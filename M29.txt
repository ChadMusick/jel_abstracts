M29|Business Strategy as a Mediation of Management Capabilities and Entrepreneurial Orientation in Business Performance|Objective – This article aims to analyze the influence of mediating Business Strategy variables on Management Capabilities (MC) and Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO) toward Business Performance. Methodology/Technique – This study was conducted on group of students of Economics and Business Department who practiced as entrepreneurs, using Path Analysis (Amos,18.0). Findings – The results of the analysis show that the management capabilities do not support the indirect influence of business strategies on business performance. However, entrepreneurial orientation supports the indirect influence of business strategies on business performance. Meanwhile, management capabilities have a significant direct effect on business performance. Novelty – Without going through a business strategy, entrepreneurial orientation does not have a significant direct effect on business performance, because business strategy supports business performance or direct influence. Type of Paper: Empirical
M29|Managing Non-Governmental Organizations to Create Values in the Disruption Era|Objective - This paper explores the challenges faced by the Indonesia National Council on Social Welfare (INCSW) and its 64 organization members from 31 provinces in Indonesia. INCSW is a social organization that is the coordinating agency for social activities by the Government of Indonesia. The analysis includes strategic management of NGOs in the era of disruption, known as the industrial revolution 4.0. Methodology/Technique - This study uses a qualitative methodology procedure to produce descriptive data obtained from verbal answers and observable behavior. The data collection methods used in this study include interviews, surveys, observations, and use of documents as secondary data. Open interviews were conducted with several administrators and staff of the Indonesia National Council on Social Welfare (INCSW). Short questionnaires were given to 64 representatives of NGOs from 31 provinces. The interview and survey included questions that probed their understanding of the industrial revolution 4.0, disruptive innovation, willingness to change, and the readiness of the organization to create values in the era of disruption. Findings - The results show that technology use is still very lacking. The quality of human resources is of minimum concern in digital knowledge. The discussions include observations about the development of management strategies and a variety of programs offered by the Indonesia National Council on Social Welfare (INCSW). Novelty - This research is one of the few studies that examine non-profit organizations in order to create economic and social values in the era of disruption. This study explains the new paradigm of NGOs by changing the platform of NGO work operationalization. This study widens the application of 'network society' theory in the study of NGOs by emphasizing networks to create value for their stakeholders. The managerial implications of this study include the importance of technology use through social media for social sharing, thus communicating social issues more efficiently and effectively.
M29|A review of entrepreneurial knowledge and skills among students at a South African Higher Education Institution|Entrepreneurship are regarded as a key element in fostering economic growth and job creation. However, growth of a country?s economy rely on developing future leaders with the right skills and knowledge to be entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurial knowledge and skills are key attributes for students if they consider self-employment. In South Africa entrepreneurship is common in higher education, however young individuals in South Africa urgently need to be trained, educated and equipped with the necessary entrepreneurial knowledge and skills to foster an entrepreneurial activity in their complex environment. The purpose of this paper is to determine students at a South African HEI perception of their level of entrepreneurial knowledge and skills. A descriptive research design approach was followed. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data from a convenience sample of 338 students at a South African public HEI situated in the Gauteng Province. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, reliability and validity analysis and a one-sample t-test. The findings infer that at this specific HEI, students feel they have the necessary knowledge and skills to be entrepreneurial. This study contributes by implementing initiatives to equip students with the knowledge and skills they may lack in becoming active individuals in economic growth.

M29|Unternehmensnachfolgen in Deutschland 2018 bis 2022|Wegen fehlender amtlicher Statistiken schätzt das IfM Bonn seit Mitte der 1990er Jahre die Anzahl der Unternehmen in Deutschland, die vor der Übergabe stehen. Die vorliegende Schätzung für den Zeitraum 2018 bis 2022 kommt zum Ergebnis, dass etwa 150.000 Unter-nehmen mit rund 2,4 Mio. Beschäftigten zur Übergabe anstehen. Eine zusätzlich durchge-führte Approximation des Nachfolgegeschehens auf Basis der Gewerbeanzeigenstatistik belegt, dass die aktuelle Schätzung des IfM Bonn die Zahl der tatsächlich erfolgten Unter-nehmensübertragungen relativ gut abbildet. Wie letztlich die Nachfolge geregelt werden wird (familienintern, unternehmensintern oder -extern), ist wegen fehlender amtlicher Statistiken ebenfalls schwer vorherzusagen. Unsere Analysen lassen jedoch die Vermutung zu, dass gut die Hälfte der vor der Nachfolgefrage stehenden Familienunternehmen ihr Unternehmen innerhalb der Familie weitergibt. Etwa 18 % der Familienunternehmen werden von Mitarbei-tern übernommen und die restlichen 29 % werden an Externe verkauft.
M29|Internal control of the organization through risk management|Internal control is defined as a comprehensive process integrated in the activity of the organization and implemented by its management and employees. It aims to provide a reasonable confidence level of achievement of the set goals. The main elements of the internal control according to COSO model are five - control environment, risk management, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The internal control system in every organization is different and unique as it reflects the specifics, the size, the organizational structure, the complexity and scope of activities, the administrative and business environment, the level of regulation, the management style, etc. However, in order to control its activities, every organization needs all of the five elements of internal control. The article focuses on one of the five elements of internal control – the risk management. Well-managed risk-taking is seen as a prerequisite for sustainable improvement of the activities of the organization.
M29|Public Policy As A Tool For Floriculture Development In The Municipality Of Tepetlixpa Mexico State, Politica Publica Como Herramienta De Desarrollo Para La Floricultura Del Municipio De Tepetlixpa Estado De Mexico|One problem facing the flower industry in Mexico, is a low linkage between government sectors responsible for supporting resources to producers. There are shortcomings in the management, dissemination and application of various types of programs that provide financial resources. These programs include national, state and municipal development at the federal level, the public body responsible for implementation is the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA). Such support programs must be permeated by t federal, state and municipal government with the intention of promoting the development of the region. This paper examines these government programs
M29|Critical Processes Of Knowledge Management: An Approach Toward The Creation Of Customer Value|The aim of this article is to contribute to the literature by identifying and analyzing possible combinations between critical knowledge management processes (absorptive capacity, knowledge transfer and knowledge application), which will result in the creation of superior customer value. The main research question this work addresses is: given that customers are demanding each day a greater value, how can organizations create more value to customers from their knowledge management processes and the combination of them? We propose that the combination of the three knowledge management processes builds a dynamic or higher-order capability that results in the creation of superior value for customers. / 0
M29|The attention of a society towards corporate brand name and its determinants within the information-rich economy|Corporate reputation can be a valuable corporate asset but a complicated concept to measure. Similarly, it is difficult to identify and quantify the determinants of corporate reputation. Considering the information rich economy and cognitive limits of economic agents (limited attention), ability to identify the effective channels of corporate communication can be a significant advantage for a corporation. This paper contributes with the methodology that enables to evaluate the attention of a society towards corporations and its determinants. The paper proposes the Googleâ€™s search volume for the specific corporation as a proxy for the attention of a society towards that company. To identify determinants of attention, the paper employs qualitative approaches Corporate Reputation QuotientTM and RepTrakÂ®, that defines the dimensions of corporate reputation. Further, the paper employs Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to handle the uncertainty in a choice of particular determinants. Set of variables identified by BMA is estimated in a linear dynamic panel environment. Delivered results enable to evaluate the current channels of corporate communication with customers and its costs.
M29|Global consolidation of industries and business failures: insights from brick-and-mortar and online outlets|Although online platforms are increasingly seen as a linchpin for firms competing in the 21st century, our understanding of competition between the traditional brick-and-mortar and online outlets, and how this can lead to different types of business failures, remains limited. In the light of the disjointed nature of the current streams of research, we propose an integrated framework that classifies the differential effects of online and brick-and-mortar competition. Based on a review of the literature, the study identified four competitive dynamics, i.e. bricks vs. bricks; clicks vs. bricks; clicks vs. clicks and brick-and-click, and explores how they can lead to different kinds of business. It is contended that the failure rate is likely to rise for small firms that adopt a sole brick-and-mortar strategy largely due to the risk of becoming “research shops”. The study contributes to comparative strategic management literature by shedding light on the evolution of online and offline management strategies and practices across the globe. In this direction, the study provides insights on some aspects both universal and country-specific features in the evolution of online and offline. The analysis highlights the importance of championing successful blending of both online and offline platforms.
M29|An empirical investigation of factors affecting the performance of women entrepreneurs in Harare: a case of food vendors|Zimbabwe, whose economy is under life support; continues to be characterized by company closures with many workers losing their jobs through retrenchments (Nyathi et al, 2018). This fragile economic situation has resulted in a number of Zimbabweans resorting to entrepreneurship as their last option. We note with kin interest that the growth of women entrepreneurs in Zimbabwe has also increased significantly. This study seeks to empirically investigate the factors that affect the performance of women entrepreneurs in Harare. The study adopts a case study approach, specifically focused on food vendors in Harare. Questionnaires consisting of structured and unstructured questions were used for data collection. The research employed purposive sampling to select the target population and 190 questionnaires were completed and analyzed. While consistent with both the psychological and economic theories of entrepreneurship, the results of this study also indicate that the performance of women entrepreneurs in the food vending sector in Zimbabwe continues to be hindered by a serious lack of adequate financial resources. The study managed to come up with two main policy recommendations that are envisioned to go a long way in improving the performance of women entrepreneurs in Zimbabwe.
M29|An analytics framework for improving public service operations and processes towards transparency issues|It is critical for a public sector to raise awareness and fight against the corruption. Among many government projects, enhancing transparency through improving public service operations and processes can be seen as one of the solutions. This study presents the lesson learnt from the transparency project performed by government agencies including selection process and criteria, selected processes, attitudes towards the project, and various obstacles and limitations in deriving the right process. These findings are synthesized and an analytics framework of public service process selection for transparency is then proposed. Such framework incorporates data analytics methodologies and techniques so that it can be further developed to build transparency in today?s digital age.
M29|WEB 2.0 technologies in companies: attitudes of B&H managers|Objective of the study was to investigate what managers think about the impact of Web 2.0 technologies on business operations. The empirical research was conducted among top and middle managers in companies in Bosnia and Herzegovina during May and June 2015. The results show that, although all respondents do not use these technologies, they have a relatively positive opinion on the application of Web 2.0 technologies in business. According to their opinion, Web 2.0 technologies make the most important contribution to data and information sharing in company and have a significant impact on the quality of communication, both internal and external.These results encourage further research on the application of Web 2.0 technologies in business and the use of all the advantages and benefits they can provide to someone actively using them.
M29|Relationship between risk and transparency in the financial statements of professional services entities|The purpose of financial reports is to provide useful information to users; the utility of information is defined through the qualitative characteristics (fundamental and enhancing). The financial crisis emphasized the limits of financial reporting, which has been unable to prevent investors about the risks they were facing. Due to the current changes in business environment, managers been highly motivated to rethink and improve the risk governance philosophy, processes and methodologies. The lack of quality, timely data and adequate systems to capture, report and measure the right information across the organization are fundamental challenges to implementing and sustaining all aspects of effective risk management. Starting from ‘80s, the investors have become more interested in narratives (from the Notes to financial statements), than in primary reports (which disclose financial position and performance). In this research, we aim to identify whether the accounting services entities disclose risk information in their financial statements. The research will use a regression model for the assessment of the relationship between the size, profitability, leverage ratios and risk reporting by the accounting and taxation services providers in Romania during the period 2009-2013
M29|Key Logistics Location Selection Factors In Retail Business|Location selection as a methodological basis for determining the rules and criteria of space deployment of production and trade activities represents an important, theoretically-affirmed framework within the contemporary economics literature, as well as the subject of careful research in similar scientific disciplines. Location selection also represents one of the most important, practical business decisions, especially in logistics management.That is precisely the starting point for carrying out the analysis within this paper, by which an intention is expressed to determine what are the most important logistics factors of object location selection with one specific participant of the supply chain, i.e. retail. The entire paper is divided into three parts. Within the first part, a short literature review is given concerning the key analysis dealing with location theory. The second part of the paper is dedicated to the analysis of location selection factors of retail objects with the focus on logistics aspects. Finally, within the last, third part, an analysis is performed of the factor usage of location selection on the precise example of Belgrade retailers. The aim of the paper is to check out to what extent are the theoretically recognized logistics factors of location selection present in the practical positioning of retail objects within the Serbian capital, as well as to determine to what extent there is space for potential improvements in this segment of business, by analysing a precise example from practice.

The paper also includes a comparative study of Spanish and European family businesses.
M29|The Future of Service Learning in International Education|Objective – This paper explores the complex dynamics of teaching service learning to EFL learners at a Chinese university through the eyes of two international instructors from an American partner school. By reflecting on different cultures’ views on charity and assistance through tools like the World Giving Index, educators can gain a deeper understanding of the implications of international perspectives on service work. Tailoring pedagogical approaches to local conditions can better fulfill service education’s function of producing future leaders who make cooperation and altruism a larger priority. Methodology/Technique – The paper examines previous studies and reports. Findings – The finding shows that perception of Western-style educational charities remains low as insisting on this can be met with a lack of enthusiasm and even hostility. But from international perspective, increasing number of students are likely to spend some of their educational experience abroad. Novelty – Providing previous context and world statistics, it gives reason on initiating service learning and its contribution on solving global, humanitarian and environmental issues.

M29|Planificarea financiarǎ pentru decizii asupra antreprenoriatului - Partea întâi<BR>[Financial planning for decisions on entrepreneurship, Part I]|The financial planning plays in the decision making on entrepreneurship, by providing an image of the efforts and rewards that the entrepreneur could expect. In this paper we approach two stages of the financial planning process: analysis of the external environment and prediction of the operating income.
M29|Organizations, Occupations and Decentral Work: On Hybridity and Ambiguity of Own-Account Workers|Conventional perceptions of the labor force say that occupational dichotomy includes just the majority of wage or salary dependent and the minority of entrepreneurs. This notion is over-simplified and not adequate to grasp the dynamic and multidimensional system of social and economic stratification and mobility. Our study dealt with one-person-enterprises, which are the vast majority of all business owners in Europe (Burke 2015). Nearly 30 percent of our sample in Austria proved to have either more than one source of income from self-employment or they were hybrids combining income from self-employment and dependent work. It shows that these circumstances disturb the clear perception of society as based upon two major categories, it multiplies theoretical challenges.
M29|Managing A Complex Adaptive Ecosystem: Towards A Smart Management Of Industrial Heritage Tourism|This paper is focused on the concept of business ecosystem, which is a relatively new field in management research. Furthermore, there is a second emerging research approach in social sciences named “complexity theory” that considers ecosystems, and business ecosystems, as complex adaptive systems. The main aim is to connect both by bringing new insights under the basis of a smart vision of tourism. In particular, we propose a theoretical discussion of the aforementioned concepts by applying them to the specific context of Industrial Heritage Management. The Industrial Heritage (i.e.: mining sites, old infrastructures, museums and historic places related to industry…) is chosen because it appears well representative: it is characterized by a complex and dynamic structure which consists of an interconnected population of stakeholders and several tangible and intangible resources to recover, organize and then manage. It follows that the management of this ecosystem should take into account many factors simultaneously. Based also on the emergent initiative of Smart Tourism, a conceptual model is presented, in which each component is explained and the focal complexity aspects appearing in this business ecosystem are highlighted. We conclude with a set of propositions for recommending new paths for future studies.
M29|Evaluating prediction markets for internal control applications|This study estimates the suitability of prediction markets (as instruments of internal control) by analyzing their event and progress sensitivity based on comprehensive experimental data. The underlying experiment was designed using expected average grades and closely observing students’ (rank and file) and teachers’ (leadership) behaviors. First, a kick-off study asked both parties about the factors that may influence the outcome of the teaching process. The resulting data served as the basis for a detailed tracking survey of four topic-specific indicators. Each week of the experiment, both students and teachers were asked to report on these indicators for 12 courses, thus producing two sets of 48 time-series data. Concurrently, 12 prediction markets were set up, in which the participants could buy and sell their forecasts 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The market utilized just one type of variable (i.e., the final average grade of each course) and the best traders could earn special commendations. The students were also encouraged to keep a trading journal that included the motives for their purchases and sales. For some courses, fake information was fed to the students in order to understand how it would influence the survey indicators, the prediction market prices, and their sensitivity to misinformation. Finally, this study reveals the results of these two extremely different control mechanisms (i.e., periodic detailed surveys vs. voluntary single-number prediction markets) and reports on how they performed and how fast their indications were adapted.

M29|Approach Regarding a Framework for Risk Reporting in Order to Enhance the Related Good Practices|The nowadays accounting information user profile became more sophisticated and the financial reports face new challenges in accomplishing process to meet users’ needs. The purpose of financial reports is to provide useful information to users. According to International Accounting Standards Board, the utility of information is defined through the qualitative characteristics (fundamental and enhancing). The financial crisis emphasized the limits of financial reporting who has been unable to prevent investors about the risks they were facing. Some managers expressed reservations about the quality and relevance of corporate reporting, stating that the annual report is no longer a useful tool. Due to the current changes in business environment, managers have been highly motivated to rethink and improve the risk governance philosophy, processes and methodologies. The lack of quality, timely data and adequate systems to capture, report and measure the right information across the organization is a fundamental challenge to implementing and sustaining all aspects of effective risk management. Starting from 80s, the investors became more interested in narratives (Notes to financial statements), than in primary reports (financial position and performance). Our research suggests a framework for risk reporting with the main goal of improving the good practice in risk management field. Also, we will debate the relation between the qualitative characteristics of accounting information, transparency and risk, and explore the possibility of developing some good practices in risk reporting.
M29|Overwiew About The Vision, Mission, Goals And Values Of Nongovernmental Organizations|The herein article aims to address several specific aspects regarding the definition of nongovernmental organizations, their vision and mission. Also the setting of goals and the presentation of the values of these types of organizations will be presented using a comparative study of literature as a research method. The fields in which nongovernmental organizations operate are very diverse, as are the needs of the community, respectively: education, science, research, culture, social protection, minorities, human rights, environmental protection, child protection, etc. The mission of the organization lies in the ample mentioning of the fundamental goals and of the view regarding the evolution and progress of the organization’s activities, from which the activity field, the market served, as well as the differentiation from other similar organizations, result. Nongovernmental organizations are characterized by a great mobility in the manner of action. Their operation is dependent on the correct identification of the needs of the community and on their ability to attract the funds required to cover them. A nongovernmental organization can play an essential role within the society by identifying certain courses of action, omitted by the public authorities. They can approach the identified niches by using their own organizational skills and human resources or they can offer assistance to the authorities.
M29|Small Businesses in the Context of Innovation Competition|The article presents the results of the analysis and systematization of publications on the competitive behavior of small businesses in the innovation economy. It is shown that the adoption of innovation activity in small firms is an effective way of mass replication of innovations and is connected with the non-linearity of the innovation process, the need for the accumulation and constant search for new knowledge and the successful adaptation to a changing business environment. In accordance with the presented in the article approach to the analysis of the competitive behavior of a small firm there were highlighted the motives (reasons) incorporating different forms of imitations in its innovation activity, individual objects of imitation, the range of factors affecting the success of the business. Suggestions put forward in this article are the basis of the author’s model of the impact made by innovative solutions on the performance of small businesses using imitations of varying degrees of creativity.
M29|Clusters - Theoretical and Policy Approach|This paper will develop some of all references about, economic thinking, description and policy issues to be noted on. Moreover, the new need of clusters consists in the scenery that the economy exposes and preserves today. Risks, disadvantages and all that shadow such new current character and actor’ are not only inherent, but keep their place in context. The concept of Clusters seems to belong to the present whereas actually it is an old economic concept. Even classics (e.g. David Ricardo) or old neoclassic (e.g. Alfred Marshall) have still significant references for the today, whereas present produced enough favourable environment for. The specific cluster policy, in its turn, explicitly identifies what the national level’s interests and the barriers of achieving those goals are and how cluster approach can help overcome these problems. It equally weights the relative merits of active intervention from the national level, versus framework conditions and facilitation, vis-à-vis theories and models.
M29|The Potential Of The Leader To Perform|Based on the finding that most research focused on the evaluation of the leader’s performance through results and by identifying the fundamental traits that a leader has, we aim through this paper to make an assessment of the leader from the perspective of the his capabilities. By using this approach we consider that we can appreciate the capacity to perform the potential data. We are studying the following potential components of the leader: the emotional potential - self-knowledge, self-control, relationship management, social awareness; thesocial potential - sense of situation, attitude, clarity, empathy, authenticity; the cognitive potential - logical reasoning, symbolic reasoning, concentration, memory; the practical potential - four mega-skiluri, four habits (skills, abilities) key; the spiritual potential - the ability to understand the truth of the situation, assess the truth of the situation, the ability to act according to the truth of the situation. The method of assessment used is based on a questionnaire research. We created a questionnaire with 25 questions, which was addressed to the top management of 20 companies. The questionnaire was given to a number of 200 subjects. The purpose of the research was to assess the capacity of the leaders to perform, the potential data and how it correlates with the performance of companies in which leaders operate. The study concludes that performances of companies are positively correlated with the capabilities of leaders but not exclusively. Potential generally understood as a synthesis of personality traits and capabilities developed, in our opinion, is the fundamental criterion in the selection and assessment of performance leader.

M29|Does affective commitment positively predict employee performance? Evidence from the banking industry of Bangladesh|The role, effect and importance of affective commitment is predicted to be contingent to context in many extant literatures. However, no study has yet explored the disposition of contextual influence on affective commitment-job performance link. This study is designed to observe the difficulty of psychologically disassociating the affective commitment construct from other types of commitments (normative or continuance) among the respondents of a complex and rarely explored context of Bangladeshi banking industry. This case study is the first one to examine the institutional context for its possible influence on the link between affective commitment and job performance in two banks in Bangladesh for the purpose of literal replication. This study uses information from interviews and focus group discussions among 53 participants and survey results of 436 respondents from the selected banks. The qualitative findings preceded and informed the survey and helped to explain the quantitative findings in this multi-method study. The qualitative data has been analysed using recursive abstraction technique and thematic analysis. Structural equation modelling (in AMOS21) has been used to analyse the quantitative survey data. The results show that the external and internal contexts of the banks have considerable impact on the nature, perception and effect of affective commitment among the respondents on their job performance. Moreover, it is observed that affective commitment does not positively predict employee performance in the case study banks. Qualitative findings from interview and focus group discussions have explained why committed employees may not be the high performers and high performing employees may not be committed. The policy implication for the HR practitioners is that, adopting unfair HR systems may lead to undesirable retention of a genuinely committed but mediocre workforce incapable to get other job offers or low affective commitment and retention rate of high performing employees. Essentially, the banks should avoid unsystematic and non-transparent recruitment and selection practices, performance management system and compensation policy. In addition, the management should strategically align the career development opportunities to the organisational goals in order to ensure meaningful affective commitment that may lead to higher job performance.

The qualitative findings preceded and informed the survey and helped to explain the quantitative findings in this multi-method study. The qualitative data has been analysed using recursive abstraction technique and thematic analysis. Structural equation modelling (in AMOS21) has been used to analyse the quantitative survey data. The results show that the external and internal contexts of the banks have considerable impact on the nature, perception and effect of affective commitment among the respondents on their job performance. Moreover, it is observed that affective commitment does not positively predict employee performance in the case study banks. Qualitative findings from interview and focus group discussions have explained why committed employees may not be the high performers and high performing employees may not be committed. The policy implication for the HR practitioners is that, adopting unfair HR systems may lead to undesirable retention of a genuinely committed but mediocre workforce incapable to get other job offers or low affective commitment and retention rate of high performing employees. Essentially, the banks should avoid unsystematic and non-transparent recruitment and selection practices, performance management system and compensation policy. In addition, the management should strategically align the career development opportunities to the organisational goals in order to ensure meaningful affective commitment that may lead to higher job performance.

M29|Diversification of Leisure Tourism in the Black Sea Coast|Romanian coastline offers many accommodation options, the tourists have at their disposal over 250,000 beds in hotels, villas and guest houses in the twelve seaside resort. On the coast there are plenty of opportunities for fun and entertainment that pretty well covers the preferences and requirements of all tourists who spend their holidays here. In the last years, along the coast have been developed many restaurants and terraces on the beach, offering guests the opportunity to relax in a joyful atmosphere of holiday and to enjoy both Romanian and international cuisine. Also, Romanian coast offers opportunities for practicing all aquatic sports, the seaside leisure options being supplemented by tennis courts, soccer and golf, amusement parks and entertainment centers that are common in the seaside resorts. The entertainment possibilities are complemented by the recently touristic constructions in Mamaia, such as: Aqua Magic and Telegondola.
M29|The Determination of Deposit and Participation Banks’ Efficiency by Data Envelopment Analysis: A Research on Banks in Turkey|The determination of productivity and efficiency of firms directs strategic decisions in the eye of decision makers. The importance of productivity and efficiency measurement in banking sector which especially attracts foreign investors in Turkey increases gradually. In this context, efficiency measurement of 15 banks operating in Turkey has been done by using their data. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique which is used as a decision making tool in multiple input multiple output processes and is not parametric is used. In the method, number of staff, total assets and capital are used as input units and general deposit, total credits and net profit are used as output units. In the results, the efficiency of banks in 2013-2014 has been measured and efficiency difference between private capital deposit banks and participation banks has been examined.
M29|Influence Of Variable Compensation On Business Performance Of The Split - Dalmatia County Pharmacies|One of the basic prerequisites of effective human resource management is to recognize the importance of motivational systems.A satisfied and motivated worker will work effectively and creatively and with greater focus towards goals.If motivation is absent, there is a danger of lowering the level of work of the best workers to that of the average or even poor workers. Employees are the most important resource of any company, and successful achievement of a company’s objectives depends on their motivation and commitment. The importance of the reward system is reflected in the motivation of employees to do their job with as much quality and efficiency as possible.In most successful companies, in addition to giving a basic salary that is the right of every worker, management introduces a variable aspect of the salary knowing that the basic salary is not enough to motivate employees. The system of compensation consists of tangible and intangible rewards.Tangible rewards are based on improving the financial status of individuals, while the intangible rewards are directed towards the fulfillment of broader human needs that are related to working behavior.Naturally, tangible rewards dominate in practice, but intangible rewards are increasingly gaining in importance
M29|Strategies for Improving the Economic and Financial Performance of the Hotel Companies in the Romanian Seaside Area|Nowadays, the hospitality industry, as other sectors, is characterized by fierce competition, at the level of the hotel company. Some of these companies succeed in facing the competition while others fail. As a result, they increasingly need a new model of tourism policy which influences their competitive position under the current competitive conditions.
M29|Quality-oriented Organizational Culture|In order to develop the quality it is necessary to move from an existing culture to a culture of quality. When referring to the important functions of any organization to create a culture solid such as dissemination of quality philosophy, staff motivation and group cohesion, we realize the obstacles in creating such a culture. The main function of the organizational culture is to give members of the organization both organizational identity and to generate a commitment to shared values and principles. Although the literature discusses frequently the links between cultural changes in order to create a culture of quality, the practical approach is still problematic. In this purpose, the primary mechanisms recommended to convince employees of the need to introduce and implement a culture of quality are education, training and leadership, while the structure, systems and procedures are important, but secondary.
M29|Aspects Concerning Quality in Tourism|Unlike the quality of products, quality of tourist services is difficult to define, to judge or expressed in quantitative terms, because the service has few physical dimensions, such as performance, functional features and maintenance costs, which could be used to compare or measurement. Quality of tourism should be approached as a market category, which means that it is a tourism product quality that makes the chain of tourism services. Knowledge of customer needs and the ability to provide consistent and useful tourist services are the result of managerial activities of tourism businesses and recruitment efforts, training and entrench the staff. These measures increase the credibility of the customer to suppliers and diminishes the quality of tourism services distrust. The quality of tourism product is ultimately reduced to the quality of the customer experience.
M29|Strategic Alternatives Adopted by Travel Agencies to Develop Tourism Services|Domestic and international tourism as a mass phenomenon is one of social events with the highest economic growth rate in the twentieth century. In Romania, the scale of this phenomenon is not very high, standing out modest position in terms of number of tourist arrivals, estimated at 0.6% of the world total, and revenue and lower a weight of 0.1% in world total. Just this demonstrates the complexity and subjectivity of the tourism phenomenon, influenced by economic, political, social, cultural, educational. The low level of development of a country and living standards, reduce tourist flows, even if it is rich tourism heritage.
M29|A VBA model for calculating partnership efficiency|The article presents the development of a software application that focuses on calculating partnership efficiency. Partnership efficiency is part of the theory of stocks. This software is developed by using Microsoft Excel and the programming language Visual Basic for Applications. The main goal is to create a simple, user-friendly interface designed to calculate partnership efficiency among contractual partners. The contribution is based on the assumption that small and medium-sized enterprises do not use complicated IT systems, but to cater for their needs, they mainly use Microsoft Excel. The main contribution of the article is the software application that calculates, in a short term period, partnership efficiency among contractual partners. The created application is also designed for educational purposes (e.g. aimed to assist university students in absorbing the practical implementation of the Cooperation Model).
M29|Micro-Entrepreneurship: Tendenzen der Präkarisierung auf dem Arbeitsmarkt? Empirische Ergebnisse für Kärnten<BR>[Motives for being self-employed as a one-person enterprise Results of an empirical analysis]|The complex interaction of technological development and socio-demographic change accelerated a structural change in the economy resulting in a changing working environment and new forms of employment. In the field of self-employment, an emerging trend towards one-person enterprises can be observed, which represent already more than 50 % of all Austrian companies. The primary aim of this paper is to analyze the rationalities of these microenterprises based on an empirical online survey of one-person enterprises in Carinthia; the focus of the analysis is the motive for being self-employed. We found out that one-person entrepreneurs are mainly driven by motives like self-realization or working without hierarchies. However, there are also one-person entrepreneurs which have been crowded out from the (dependent) labor market and are therefore driven by economic reasons (e.g. self-employment as an alternative to unemployment). This economic-driven group of one-person enterprises is comparatively dissatisfied with their professional situation, is less optimistic regarding their entrepreneurial future and generates lower incomes.
M29|Culture And Leadership: The Case Of Romania|Globalization and internationalization lead to the development of a general image of good and effective leadership which influence the local leadership styles and the behavior of leaders. The latter must overcome the conflict between the desire to implement corporate standards which are internationally valid and the need to act locally in terms of organizational culture, business environment and leadership style. The knowledge of the national peculiarities and traditions, the understanding of their heritage and background, coming to grips with them are key-success factors for international co-operations and/or joint-ventures in todayâ€™s competitive world. The aim of this paper is to explore the connection between the organizational culture and the leadership style and aims to develop a better understanding of the Romanian leadership. It also provides important information and ideas on the leadership styles practiced in the companies within Romania. The study presents the research findings on the Romanian leadership style and connects it to the political, economic and cultural influences. As far as Romania is concerned, although the variations in the cultural configurations are of a great diversity and complexity, we may, however, identify two distinct types of organizational culture, supporting the hypothesis that these two categories are the extremes of a continuum with a wide variety of expression: a culture of â€˜bureaucraticâ€™ type, typical for: state-owned companies, former state firms in the post-privatisation period and the culture of â€˜entrepreneurialâ€™ type, in the process of formation, typical for the private companies formed after 1989. The most important problems that appear in the case of the multinational companies refer to the compensation values, sacred and taboo, the management of the gradual conflicts, etnocentrism, affiliation, faulty conciliation and naive realism. The leaders must learn to analyze the cultural differences and to identify those differences existing between the values, to recognize that there are different concepts of power and to avoid errors of reward.
M29|Advancing the Economies through SPA Industry|This paper is an attempt to present a clear picture of how important is spa industry in promoting tourism and the ways in which it can be made instrumental in drawing tourists from various places to a destination. People have been visiting places famous for their spas since ancient times. People would visit places famous for their healing waters and stay there for days. Romans and Greeks were known for their luxurious baths devoted to relaxation and rejuvenation. Recently, spas are witnessing a revival of interest in them and they are becoming a force to reckon with in the hospitality sector. This research is an attempt to understand the role spas are playing in stimulating tourism of the place. A survey of 200 people was conducted and the responses were taken on a Likert like scale for the purpose of percentage analysis. It was found that Spas and Tourism of a destination have very symbiotic relationship and if harnessed well, spas can substantially add to the tourism of the place.
M29|Elements of Performance Management and Audit in Public Organizations|The concept of performance is a new one, having in mind the fact that, in order to achieve functional progress, public organizations are themselves determined to measure the results of their activity over a definite period of time. Nevertheless, a new characteristic regarding the implementation of this concept refers to the approach used by managers for putting it into practice that is the identification of the answers to the question: „What should be measured/monitored in order to have a better control over activities and which will determine their improvement?” The current article presents notions and elements specific to performance management at the level of public organizations, with a brief emphasis on the indicators and standards related to this domain.
M29|Lean Education System: A Case Study|The number of students in the institutions of secondary education approaches 5.5 million in the Turkish education system. Such a big system should be managed very well in order to educate successful students. In successful managements, successful results are obtained by taking proper steps. The key to good management is examination of the current state and determination of correct strategies in agreement with the objectives. This system aims not only at maximum quality but also to minimize the cost. In this way, it will also enhance customer satisfaction and its preferability. Previously used only in the manufacturing systems, lean philosophy is also available in the service sectors today. In this study, the current system at private high schools ? one of the most important parts of the education sector included in the service sector ? was examined; the processes of the high school were defined and analyzed; and the waste was determined. Lean thinking and lean tools were utilized to eliminate waste and to enhance quality and customer satisfaction.
M29|Corporate diversification and board composition in Japanese electronics corporations|I consider the strategic implications of corporate governance by examining the relationship between diversification and board composition, considering both agency theory and the resource-based view of the firm. Many Japanese electronics companies have performed sluggishly and instituted major governance and management reforms. The strategic choice between focus and diversification is the foremost issue for Japanese firms aiming to improve their performance.?This study uses a multivariate regression model with data from 217 Japanese electronics corporations for the fiscal year 2013 to examine the impact of board composition on decisions regarding corporate diversification. I find that corporate boards encourage corporations to pursue value-generating activities. I also argue that corporate boards can evaluate the quality of resources and allocate rents inside companies, as boards encourage firms to make use of idiosyncratic resources.
M29|Impact Of Rules On The Continuity Of Business Family Of Tehuacan, Las Reglas De Convivencia Y Su Incidencia En La Continuidad De Las Empresas Familiares De Tehuacan|The family business is a leading global financial entity. In Mexico, family business is known for being a major source of employment and contributing significantly to the country's economy. Ensuring business continuity is a common challenge faced by many family-owned businesses. The family business system can be described as two independent but overlapping subsystems: business and family. Disputes arising from this overlap area can cause the failure of the family business. Therefore, it is essential have clear rules because it can help avoid conflicts. The survey sample covers 342 family businesses in manufacturing, trade and services in Tehuacan city. The results show there are not clear rules in most family business in Tehuacan. Union and commitment have proved to be key elements for creating strong relationships in the organizations studied and the continuity of the family businesses in Tehuacan.
M29|Implications and Modalities to Mitigate Seasonality in the Romanian Seaside|In the current economic conditions, tourism can become one of Romania's strong export industries that can compete effectively with other countries with tradition in this area. Negative aspects regarding the whole tourism product standards and tourist services are the result of a period of about 20 years of weak investment in tourism or no change related to the transition to a market economy. This paper deals with the phenomenon of seasonality tourist activity, because Romania is particularly affected by this phenomenon, due primarily temperate continental climate. Combating seasonality is very difficult to remain on the coast of the Black Sea as coastal tourism usually practicable only during the summer. Lately, efforts focus seaside entrepreneurs to find viable ways to mitigate this phenomenon and to develop tourism in this area.
M29|Adaptability of the internal business environment of small and medium-sized enterprises in Slovakia|Companies that are exposed to an uncertain changing business environment must be able to adapt and change in order to achieve some compliance with the subject of business carried out and the objectives with the ambient conditions. Also these conditions can be a source of threats for small and medium-sized enterprises. In this context, we emphasize the adaptability of the enterprise. It is the active joining of resolving the conflict between the business entity and its environment. Signs of this joining we follow through changes as a transition of stability on one level to a whole new level of stability, which can cause a change in the company's original strategy to a new strategy.
M29|Main problems in the project management and the method of six thinking hats as possible solution|Nowadays, project management is divided in two thinking sides like fashion or passion. Both sides forget the main purpose of project management, to use PM methods for activities that have the nature of the project, which leads to problems. The traditional approach to PM establishes the main problems in areas like human attitudes, organizational shortcomings, supply’s gap, professional deficiencies, financial problems, time framework’s problems and technological issues. All are discussed in paper. The six thinking method used here could provide us looking at the problem from different angles, presented positive and negative arguments, which leads to a deeper understanding of problem. It is possible to solve problems also from other point of view, this is showed on more practical approach, where are solved problems like: client often changes the requirements, communication with client is very slow, delay on start of project and the main problem – spending lots of time by solving problems during the life of project.
M29|Franchising as a tool for sustainable regional development|One of the instruments of regional management of retail trade networks on this stage of development in the world economy, in our opinion, there is franchising. Actuality of his implantation in a regional economy consists in that franchising can execute the row of such important functions, as development of regional enterprise, creation of workplaces, increase of tax payment in local budgets, stimulation of development of regional producers, including of various industries to the economic clusters of a region.
M29|Tax Agents Perceptions of the Corporate Taxpayersâ?? Compliance Costs under the Self-assessment System|Reforms and changes in tax laws may affect the level of complexity in the tax system and increase taxpayer compliance costs burden. In Malaysia, the introduction of Self-assessment System (SAS) imposes greater accountability in terms of computational, recordkeeping and filing requirements upon taxpayers. The increase in taxpayer obligations coupled with higher possibility of audit may require taxpayers to seek assistance from tax agents to handle tax matters on their behalf. In spite of the expanding role of tax agents in tax reporting under the SAS, very little research has been directed at examining their views and perceptions. This study, therefore, evaluates the compliance costs of corporate taxpayers from the perspective of tax agents.
M29|Corporate diversification and board composition in Japanese electronic corporations|In this study, I examine the relationship between board composition and diversification strategy in Japanese electronic corporations. Many Japanese electronics companies have performed sluggishly and instituted major reforms in terms of governance and management. The strategic choice between Focus and Divarication is the foremost issue for Japanese firms aiming to improve their performance. A corporation?s diversification strategy is influenced by the board structure and configuration of corporate governance. Agency theory assumes that financial and other unrelated diversification reinforces the CEO?s power and creates no value for stockholders, a divergence from the owners? interests. Agency theory also holds that the CEO is a risk-averse agent. When free cash flow is available, the CEO will undertake non-value creating business rather than value creating business that may enhance stockholder value. The alignment of the interests of stockholders and managers reduces financial and unrelated diversification. To enhance the corporate board?s monitoring ability, I propose that the board should have an outsider-dominant composition. On the other hand, a strategic perspective like the resource-based view of the firm holds that related diversification leads to superior firm performance compared with a focused strategy because the company can explore business opportunities and generate additional return. The resource-based context assumes two types of corporate board composition. In the first, it is composed of insiders because they are motivated to pursue company growth regardless of stockholder?s concerns, emphasizing distinctive resources, which are diversified into several business units. In the second configuration, the corporate board is composed of outsiders because the company seeks high-level links with and access to resources in the outside environment I have considered the strategic implications of corporate governance by examining the relationship between diversification and board composition. These hypotheses are tested with multiple or logistics regression model, using a sample of Japanese corporations for the financial year in 2013. This study unravels the relationships among shareholder configuration and board structure, and the board?s strategic choice of diversification using several variables. This study finds that there is slightly negative link between diversification and the number of outsiders in the corporate board. Shareholder-oriented corporate governance does not necessarily mean a less diversified strategy. In addition, it finds that corporate boards with members who have ties to other corporations in the business group positively impacts performance, showing that high-level inter-connected directors could diversify business, leading to enhanced performance.
M29|Knowledge, Economic Models And Market Value Of Companies|The direction of our research aims in essence, to propose and build some modern systems (based on decision expert systems decision, neural networks, etc.) to estimate the risk of bankruptcy of enterprises, considering the economic models already known. Made simpler, we propose that certain non-quantifiable components of the value of the business of an organization (the knowledge held, the amount of management applied, etc) to be captured and / or included in the structure of economic models aimed at predicting the risk of bankruptcy of companies. The basic idea of the research focuses on the synthetic analysis regarding the risk of bankruptcy of firms in terms of current realities that characterize the competitive environment of businesses at a global level. Today, the knowledge society and / or the knowledge economy has become a kind of vector of reporting for both business organizations and policy makers, opinion leaders and even every citizen. The so-called intangible assets of a company determine in an increasingly measure the market value of the firm but instead they are not reflected or very little reflected in the accounts entity. Acquisition and processing of new knowledge, while organizational learning have now become major directions of action for all business organizations. New knowledge are transformed by trained / qualified employees in inventions and innovations of various types that subsequently value in all markets. Otherwise, knowledge has become today an essential resource for companies, but including this asset in the structure of accounting indicators reflects major difficulties under methodological report.
M29|A caring interpretation of stakeholder management for the social enterprise. Evidence from a regional survey of micro social cooperatives in the Italian welfare mix|The stakeholder literature on the social enterprise is still a nascent and largely under investigated field of knowledge. This literature is characterized by the existence of two persistently divergent theorizings, broadly, the ÔcorporateÕ and the Ôsocio-politicalÕ approach. We assume that the reason of this divergence lies in the absence of proper moral justifications underpinning the notion of stakeholder legitimacy, which results in devaluations and misinterpretations of the normative foundations of stakeholder management. In order to bridge this gap, we propose to conceive of the two theorizings as if they were empirical streams of research of a common normative framework of stakeholder thought. A special focus is given to the feminist theory, and, especially, to the Ôethics of careÕ (Gilligan 1982, Noddings 1984, 1999; Held, 2003), as meaningful moral grounding for advancing descriptions and managerial interpretations of the particular nature and functions of firm stakeholder relationships in social enterprises. To the purpose, we draw from the specialized literature on caring both insights and criteria of an ideal architecture of firm as Ôcaring organizationÕ (Liedtka, 1996), in order to offer an operationally meaningful conceptualization of how social enterprises might simultaneously enhance both the effectiveness and the moral quality of stakeholder management. Then, we test these assumptions on a regional survey of micro social co operatives in the Italian welfare mix. Findings reveal that the caring for attribute of ÔproximityÕ shaping firm stakeholder relationships offers a lot of useful insights to conceive of caring as suitable moral grounding for a common stakeholder theorizing of social enterprise.
M29|Protection Of Energy Consumers In The Economies Of European Countries|The paper realizes an analyze of the position of the energy consumers and presents some ways of influencing the behaviour of the energy consumers. The paper dealt also with the issue of the protection of domestic electricity and gas consumer which aims, in particular, its rights to receive energy at any time, in safe conditions and at affordable prices.

M29|Dynamics of Financial System: A System Dynamics Approach|There are several ratios which define the financial health of an organization but the importance of Net cash flow, Gross income, Net income, Pending bills, Receivable bills, Debt, and Book value can never be undermined as they give the exact picture of the financial condition. While there are several approaches to study the dynamics of these variables, system dynamics based modelling and simulation is one of the modern techniques. The paper explores this method to simulate the before mentioned parameters during production capacity expansion in an electronic industry. Debt and Book value have shown a non-linear pattern of variation which is discussed. The model can be used by the financial experts as a decision support tool in arriving at conclusions in connection to the expansion plans of the organization.
M29|Challenges For Family Business Continuity Tehuacan Case Study, Los Retos De Las Empresas Familiares Ante Su Continuidad: Caso Tehuacan|Family business is a vital force in the global economy. Nevertheless, the challenge of balancing family interests and business goals may help explain the high mortality rate of family businesses. When family members work together, emotions may interfere with business decisions. A serious problem faced by family businesses in Mexico is the lack of formality within family business. Therefore, it is critical to formalize or professionalize the family business and meet the differing goals of the two different, but interrelated domains, family and business. The inquiry was supported in a documentary and field research. The survey sample covers 342 family businesses in manufacturing, trade and services in Tehuacan city. This is the first statistical study of family businesses in Tehuacan. The aim of this paper is to analyze the relationship between the construct professionalization and constructs such as performance, family harmony, effective communication and obstacles to professionalizing the family business. A statistical model is proposed to explain the relationship among constructs and variables. This study also highlighted the importance of the variable-academic education, as main variable of the construct professionalization.
M29|Communication In The Family-Owned Businesses: Major Element In The Preservation Of Family Harmony, La Comunicacion En La Empresa Familiar, Principal Elemento En La Preservacion De La Armonia Familiar|Family business is a vital force in the global economy. Family-owned business is composed of two overlapping subsystems: family and business. But family business management becomes complex because family and business domains often have conflicting sets of needs and values. Family business success often means: harmony for family and growth/profitability for business. Harmony and communication are the strongest pillars of the family-owned business and are closely linked, the second helps to preserve the former. Communication becomes more than just a management tool to become a vital process for family businesses. This is the first statistical study of family businesses in Tehuacan. The survey sample covers 342 family businesses in manufacturing, trade and services in Tehuacan city. The results show that communication in family businesses of Tehuacan is good but somewhat formal, although this last feature does not affect significantly their harmony.
M29|Strategic Management, Leadership and Governance of the University in Portugal|Universities have a role in society different from other businesses or service industries. Universities as any human organizations are composed of people. And like any organization, they have a mission, objectives, goals, structures, roles and relationships of authority, decision-making processes and communication, interpersonal and intergroup dynamics, needs, values and interfaces. The diversity of determinants implies that the strategic management of universities become a multifunctional system decisions, which must be formulated, implemented and evaluated in order to achieve their long-term goals. The process of strategic management in universities incorporates the development and strategy formulation, implementation, monitoring and feedback. This article discusses the strategic management of organizations, especially universities, emphasizing the role that this process can have on the organization and how its implementation can help to enhance their leadership role in society to which it is addresse.
M29|Advantages and Limits of Using Pollution Control Tools as Strategic Options in the Management of Organizations|The paper aims to outline some of the pollution control tools and the advantages and limits of using them as strategic options within the management of the organizations. We provide a short literature review on the pollution control tools evolution and we emphasize the fact that there were three important stages that marked this evolution. Also, we propose a short classification of the pollution control tools identifying the most important criteria of sorting them. Afterwards, we provide an non-exhaustive analysis of both the advantages and limits of these elements, which is fundamental in the process of capitalization of the pollution control tools within the management of the organizations, through amplifying their strategic dimension. Therefore, the knowledge of the strengths and of the weaknesses of each pollution control tool represents a mandatory decisional input for the top management of the organizations, in their strategy foundation within the environmental protection.
M29|A Dynamic Managerial Theory of Corruption and Productivity Among Firms in Developing Countries|In this paper, a simple dynamic model of efficient firm-level managerial resource allocation to two uses, one involving productivity activities and another one involving corruption activities to “get things done” was developed. The model follows the optimal control theory process. Two operational equations are derived representing firm growth and shadow-price behavior. Firm-level interview data on surrogates for the firm’s inputs was used for domestically owned firms in developing economies covering two time periods. The SUR method was used to estimate jointly the two equations. Overall, the model fit the data quite well. It was found that the managerial surrogates; namely, capacity utilization, formal worker training, and the time spent dealing with government regulations, were positive and significant predictors of firm output growth and the shadow-price of its capital with a few negative exceptions. Implicitly, there appears to be a trade-off between managerial resources used for growth and those used for the shadow price. Policy implications were discussed briefly.
M29|Unternehmensnachfolgen in Deutschland 2014 bis 2018|Wegen fehlender amtlicher Statistiken schätzt das IfM Bonn seit Mitte der 1990er Jahre die Anzahl der vor der Übergabe stehenden Unternehmen in Deutschland. Die vorliegende Schätzung für den Zeitraum 2014 bis 2018 kommt zu dem Ergebnis, dass etwa 135.000 Unternehmen zur Übergabe anstehen, weil ihre Eigentümer aus persönlichen Gründen aus dem Unternehmen ausscheiden werden. Von diesen Übergaben sind im betrachteten Fünfjahreszeitraum rund 2 Mio. Beschäftigte betroffen.
M29|Zum Einfluss des Geschlechts des Übergebers auf die Wahl des familieninternen Nachfolgers: Eine theoretische und empirische Analyse in deutschen Familienunternehmen|Die vorliegende Studie untersucht die Determinanten der Entscheidung, einen Sohn oder eine Tochter zum familieninternen Nachfolger zu bestimmen. Ein besonderes Augenmerk liegt dabei auf dem Geschlecht des Übergebers. Nationale wie internationale Forschungsarbeiten deuten darauf hin, dass männliche Übergeber eher einen Sohn als eine Tochter auswählen. Hinsichtlich des Verhaltens weiblicher Übergeber finden sich dagegen gemischte Befunde. Auf Basis verschiedener theoretischer Erklärungsansätze lassen sich unterschiedliche Verhaltensweisen der weiblichen und männlichen Übergeber ableiten. Von entsprechenden Hypothesen ausgehend wird auf Basis einer repräsentativen Befragung von Familienunternehmen aus dem Jahr 2008/2009 ein Logit-Modell geschätzt, um die zentralen Determinanten der Entscheidung, einen Sohn oder eine Tochter als Nachfolger auszuwählen, zu ermitteln. Wie theoretisch vermutet, zeigt sich ein Einfluss des Geschlechts des Übergebers: Ist der angehende Übergeber eine Frau, so übt dies einen signifikant negativen Einfluss auf die Wahrscheinlichkeit, einen Sohn zum Nachfolger zu bestimmen, aus. Oder anders ausgedrückt: Angehende weibliche Übergeber präferieren - genau wie ihre männlichen Pendants - einen Nachfolger des eigenen Geschlechts.
M29|Theoretical Approach Regarding the Bases of Success and Reasons that May Lead to Failure in Project Management|The present paper work deals with theoretical concepts regarding the reasons that may lead to a project’s failure or success. The primary aim of the work paper is to help readers to get a view of conceptualizations of project management and its phases, while providing an opportunity to see the interferences of factors that may determine project’s success. This work paper also contains some aspects regarding key-factors and elements that may assure a good management of projects. The present subject was chosen because -in authors’ opinion- the ability to demonstrate yourself as a cooperative, contributing, and constructive project manager is critical for long-term career success in any domain.

It highlightsa new ‘intelligent modelÂ» which produces and chooses the right competitive information, as aresult of informational innovation which ensures the maintaining of the stability of economicgrowth in a new knowledge based economy. The proposed model describes the major role ofinformation in different kinds of innovations which provide an intelligent strategy: business,organizational and knowledge intelligence, which should be followed by the decisions toimprove the competitive advantage and intelligence of their organizations. We are integratinga dynamic interaction between each component of this model which had been tried by usingICT and a new crucial component in the model which is informational innovation.
M29|The Business Environment in the Transition|Following the collapse of planning, new small and medium-sized firms rapidly emerged in all transition economies. Using firm level data, we investigate the interaction between the widespread opportunities for new business activities such firms faced and their business environment. The business environment includes physical infrastructure, the availability of an educated labour force, provision of administrative and judicial services, the control of corruption and crime, and the stability of the macroeconomic environment. By comparing how different elements of the business environment affected firms in formerly planned economies with those in economies outside transition, we document not only the challenges faced by transition firms but also the effects of the planning legacy.
M29|Aplicación de la metáfora biológica para el desarrollo de formas organizativas en la integración empresarial|La capacidad de las empresas de adaptarse en el mercado no depende solamente de la competencia, puede alcanzarse a partir de mecanismos de cooperación interempresarial, permitiéndole ventajas importantes a las pequeñas organizaciones nacientes.

M29|Experiments And Results On The Use Of Ontologies In The Artificial Intelligence Domain|The field of agent-based systems as part of the Artificial Intelligence domain is, now-a-days, quite popular. There are specialized technologies required for building software agents and it should be communicative, capable, autonomous and adaptive. In fact, these are the key characteristics required to help make the Internet activity more successful. The limiting factors in building such systems are being overcome, and new approaches are emerging from information technology research laboratories around the world. The use of ontology has proven to be essential elements in many applications and thus, they have been successfully applied in agent systems technology, knowledge management systems, and e-commerce platforms. The current research aims to present besides some theoretical aspects and examples of using the web agents for two European cities.
M29|Agent Theory and Its Impact on Economic Crisis|This article wants to design a liaison between the world economic crisis and agency theory, trying to determine if the current crisis is a consequence of the common corporate governance practices. More specifically, it indicates that these practices lead to excessive risk taking, like subprime mortgage securities, because they have no penalty for the manager, or don’t damage his wealth in the case of collapse. Simultaneously, golden parachutes and other exit packages incite termination of the employment agreement since they reward failure, and provide little incentive for the executives to perform properly.
M29|The Businesses and the Environment|In almost entire civilized world there is an emerging consensus about respecting the environment and an increasing level of the sound of voices that sustain that companies have social and environmental responsibilities. But not always it was the same thing. Great economic and political personalities sustained that this issue is of secondary importance for our business. Nowadays, the idea of including environmental protection among the production factors, near capital and human resources has more and more followers.
M29|Оцінка Потенціалу Систем З Активними Елементами: Управлінський Аспект<BR>[Estimating potential of systems with active elements: managerial aspect]|Potential of the systems with active elements is examined in the article from point of aims of management. In wide interpretation the potential appears as the multivariate, complex, stochastic parameter reflecting dialectics of system’s internal states at interaction with the external surrounding. Potential’s types classification implies determination, at first, a positive and negative potential from the point of system's useful function and then the an active and passive potential of system’s elements. In such formulation the purposes of the management becomes expressly measurable.
M29|"La Economía Social Ibérica: el caso de las Santas Casas de la Misericordia de Portugal como instituciones particulares de solidaridad social<BR>[Iberia Social Economy: ""Santas Casa da Miosericórdia"" - Particular institutions of social solidarity (IPSS) case study]"|Las organizaciones que conforman la Economía Social favorecen el desarrollo económico y colectivo, lo cual les facilita un gran reconocimiento institucional, tanto por la función que desempeñan como por su valorización por la actividad económica realizada, a favor del servicio de las necesidades sociales, la distribución equitativa de la renta, la creación de empleo y la corrección de los desequilibrios sociales. Esta economía todavía no ha sido concretizada por aquellas instituciones que son representativas del poder gubernativo y del rigor académico. No obstante, previo al establecimiento en común de un marco jurídico y económico, estas entidades de participación comunitarias, por su cercanía, inclusive regional, tienen tanto operaciones comerciales como otras actividades del ámbito público y privado. Por este motivo, es necesario establecer un cauce de comunicación y discusión de cuáles son las entidades que favorecen el desarrollo colectivo entre España y Portugal. En este trabajo, hacemos una exposición del marco conceptual de las entidades de la economía social ibérica (principalmente en España y Portugal), para centrarnos en conocer con más detalle la economía social portuguesa, a través del estudio de las Santas Casas de la Misericordia como Instituciones Particulares de Solidaridad Social. Mostramos su evolución histórica, el papel de las Santas Casas de la Misericordias, así como ciertas perspectivas y capacidades de respuesta en el futuro inmediato de estas entidades de la economía social portuguesa.
M29|Computational Modelling Of The Parallel Logistic System|The paper highlights the problem of mathematical modelling of the highly complex logistic system consisting of parallel production lines. Each production route is arranged in a series of stands equipped with manufacturing machines. It is assumed that all production lines are identical. Each production stand performs a manufacturing operation with the use of the specified tool. Tools get worn out and require either regeneration or immediate replacement. The tool subjected to regeneration can be regenerated a certain number of times only. When this number is reached, the tool must be replaced with a new one. The logistic system is controlled by a determined heuristic algorithm. The production process is optimized by means of the stated criterion respecting defined bounds. Adequate equations of state illustrate the flow of charge material. The time scaling method in order to search for the satisfactory solution with the use of the simulation method is proposed.
M29|Agent-Based Design Of Business Intelligence System Architecture|Business intelligence is a business management term used to describe applications and technologies which are used to gather, provide access to, and analyse data and information about the organization, to help make better business decisions. The multi-agent approach provides a feasible solution for construction of the business intelligence system. This paper firstly briefly introduces the traditional business intelligence architecting principles and multi-agent approach. Secondly, a design of business intelligence system architecture is proposed, which is composed of the system framework, agent description and system workflow. This design allows to reduce effectively the construction costs of business intelligence systems and to extend the applied scope of business intelligence by minimizing the amount of data transfer and data storage. Using the predictive functionality of the system can bring a significant competitive advantage of business units. The paper presents a new approach for business intelligence architecture modelling, representing an extension over existing systems.
M29|Stakeholder theory and care management: An inquiry into social enterprises|This work aims to introduce care management from the moral viewpoint of stakeholder theory. It considers stakeholder theory a useful methodology for managerial descriptions, narratives and theorising of business ethics, and the feminist thought, especially the moral grounding of care, a valuable normative core to earn productive remarks and insights into stakeholder research in modern capitalism. Care leads researchers to meaningful conceptualizations of the firm as a relational entity, both in itself and as part of the network of stakeholders within which it is involved, paving the way for organisational analysis deeply entangled in the subjective and interpersonal aspects of specific business context. Of major importance for advancing the understanding of care as virtue ethics affecting the managerial decision-making is the problem of bordering organisation-stakeholder relationships. To this purpose, a quantitative measuring on managerial practices of stakeholder involvement in a sample of small Italian social enterprises has been carried out. Findings reveal that a fully Òcare for the otherÓ turns in favour of those stakeholders who are formally entitled to take part in the co-production of organisation's activities through the formal involvement in the governance structures.
M29|The Optimal Duration of Equity Joint Ventures|Whilst joint ventures offer a potentially attractive form of corporate and industrial organisation, they also experience high rate of break-up within ten years from their initial formation. In this paper, we model this process not as an uncertain random event, but rather as the predictable outcome of underlying economic variables, with break-up within a finite time resulting even under conditions of complete certainty. Given the prevalence of joint venture break-ups, it is in the interests of both partners in an equity joint venture to be fully aware of their own optimal durations of the joint venture in their initial negotiations for the formation of the equity joint venture. Where the underlying economic parameters imply differences in their individual optimal durations of the joint venture, there is therefore scope for mutually beneficial agreements on a binding date for the break-up of the joint venture, and for side payments to enable this binding agreement to be reached, either as cash payments or in terms of their relative shareholdings in the jointly-owned separate company that will manage the equity joint venture. In addition, there is scope for a differential corporate tax rate on the joint venture, compared to that on the go-it-alone businesses of the two partners, in order bring the two partners’ privately optimal durations into line with the socially optimal duration of the joint venture.
M29|Considerations On Measuring Performance And Market Structure|According to neoclassical theory, the relationship between the price, respectively of marginal cost and market structures, the methods for determining the performance of a firm or of an industry, deviate from the model of perfect competition. Assessing performance involves performing comparisons, reporting that their reference level can be a standard value, or a statistical value which can be a national-regional average, a homogeneous group, or an average value at a market level. Modern theories of the firm view that they may have other objectives than profit, which need to be taken into account when analyzing performance. Therefore between indicators for assessing the economic performance of an entity or a certain level of aggregation can not lack the profit or the gross operating surplus (gross profit), gross or net added value, turnover, as well as effort indicators like gross investment, tangible, intermediate consumption, cost of production, labor productivity, energy consumption, total productivity of production factors, etc.. It will be presented the main economic and financial indicators of enterprises, by class size and ownership in Romania.
M29|Scientific Research And Innovation - Decisive Factors Of Business Performance|Knowledge, science and information have become powerful driving force that stimulates human and material potential. Therefore creating a society with an economy based on high performance knowledge and ensuring sustainable human development is inconceivable without the contribution of these important subsystems of human capital. Research and Development like autonomous activity, but interdependent with activities from society, represents a systematic and creative activity to increase the amount of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and use this knowledge for new applications. According to the methodology set out in the OECD Frascali Manual, performance areas of research and development activities are presented as follows: government performance area; higher education performance area and the non-profit performance area. It will be present an analysis of the: main indicators of research and development units in Romania in the period 1990-2009; total expenses of research and development, by areas of performance and funding sources and research and development expenditures from external sources.
M29|Purchasing Decision On Crisis Conditions|Consumption suffered important mutations within the past years, due to profound changes of economic policies, as well as due to the crisis triggered in 2008. Consumption prices have suffered serious modifications every year after 1990, and since 2005 a phase shift of evolution can be noticed for various products, which makes the buying decision of consumers to be on a permanent move. So, from 2005 until 2011, the price evolution in Romania for the entire consumption basket had an increase by almost 44%, while fuel growth in 2011 was of 8-9% (bussiness day -2011). This growth was influenced by oil price. However, the Brent oil price has increased by aprox. 10%, almost as fuel price, an evolution which is hard to explain since the fuel price includes around 50% taxes. For food products (a food share of 33% in the consumption basket is the highest compared with other seven former communist countries) it is necessary to consider the inflation evolution for 2011, whose forecast has been changed from 3.6% to 5.1%, while for 2012 from 3.2% to 3.6%. All this will have an effect on purchasing power as well as on consumption. The current crisis has produced major modifications in the consumption behaviour of the population , focusing mainly on food consumption. The purchasing decision of the population from urban areas is significantly different than on rural areas (consumption expenditures are with 20-30% higher in urban areas). According to data provided by INS (National Institute for Statistics), it results that only 40% of consumers have remained constant in their purchasing decision, while the rest have reduced consumption or turned to cheaper products. By processing information like the above ones, major retailers` policies must be adjusted, based on market researches which should provide data regarding the composition of consumption basket, as well as total volume of goods to be purchased.
M29|Financial Resources of NGOs|Due to the low funding levels registered in recent years in the NGO sector in Romania, many NGOs have faced a number of difficulties, some of them have ceased to carry on business. Financial position of the governmental sector is poor, especially for large organizations that are strictly dependent on foreign funds. For the good functioning of NGOs activity, it is requiring a constant concern for finacial fundraising. The article aims to present the diversity of financial resources of NGOs.
M29|Transport Fleet Sizing By Using Make And Buy Decision-Making|Cost reduction is among the main quoted reasons for logistics outsourcing, while transport capacities and operations are among the most outsourced logistics areas. However, according to transaction costs theory, there is often room for transport insourcing. Furthermore, nowadays many authors stress that mixed solutions can give better results than “make” or “buy” alternatives.“Make or buy” decision-making normative models, methods, and procedures in transport planning are not much explored. Instead, research is rather focused on carrier selection techniques, whereby it is supposed that outsourcing transport capacities is the most suitable solution. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the body of literature on classical “make-or-buy” decision-making in transport fleet sizing in a non-logistics enterprise. It goes beyond the basic “make or buy” decisionmaking, and intermediate solutions (i.e., “make and buy”) are explored. Practical directions are given according to theoretical principles, and a case study is used to exemplify the main deductions.The research also has practical implications. Many enterprises in transition economies have faced the question of what to do with their in-house transport fleets. The obtained results are of interest to merchants and manufacturing enterprises that already have a private transport fleet and are considering how to rationalize it.
M29|"The Adoption/Adaptation Of The ""Supply Chain"" Concept In Romanian"|There are several terms used in Romanian for the English term supply chain. We have counted eleven. It has been adopted in several ways and it is perceived (adapted) in several ways in Romania. There are several causes which have determined this fact: the English terminology inconsistence regarding supply chain has been translated into other languages, professionals roots determine the usage (logistics professionals use it for logistics, strategic logistics use it in general etc.), the lack of Romanian discussions regarding the new professional terminology at general level and supply chain and logistics in particular. We expose the different ways by which supply chain is reflected in Romanian, we discuss the causes which have generated this total confusion and then we suggest a proper term for supply chain in Romanian, considering the real meaning of the term and the strategies adopted by other countries regarding supply chain adoption. In conclusion, we propose a general adoption and adaptation for the term in Romanian.
M29|Strategic Management of Regional Development in the Context of Contemporary Economy|Globalization includes the entire system of international economic relations and refers to actions with impact on the entire humanity and each human being. These actions resolving means the involvement of some important resources of the majority or even of all countries in the world. Likewise, the global concurrency is seen as international concurrency. From economic and political point of view small states total the common parameters which determine the susceptibility for certain risks. A good part of small states are excessively responsive to external events; they are crossing a transition process to market economy, a process of establishing their economic system or of preserving some situations of economic crisis which exceed the governments capacity to manage them.
M29|Business Ethics from the Perspective of the Students in Business and Economics – Identifying the Factors of Variation|The paper attempts to explore the theme of business ethics from the perspective of the students in business and economics as future business practitioners. The ethical business principles are considered to be formed before an individual enters into the work market and as a consequence it is assumed that the educational system can be responsible for this situation. Still, it is unrealistic to expect that students with the same ethical course exposure will adhere to the same ethical conduct. The purpose of this paper is to measure the ethical standards of a group of students and to identify the factors that determine the variation in their responses.
M29|Method Of Supply Chain Optimization In E-Commerce|E-commerce systems are tools meant to support the supply chain (SC), the quality of which as well as other parts of the e-commerce system largely depend on management processes representing supply chain management (SCM). The optimal way to ensure the success of SCM is to use the methods of modelling and simulation based on appropriate models and mathematical representation of a real SC. Such models are constructed with the use of process and value-chain oriented approaches or based on the concept of multi-agent systems. Different types of models in conjunction with a suitable mathematical representation allow us to perform the simulation process which outputs can help managers make suitable decisions. The paper aims at presenting contemporary approaches to the supply chain modelling within e-commerce systems. Moreover, the case study emphasized hereby is oriented to present the sample simulation approach in order to find the optimal allocation of resources which are meant to minimize shipping costs.

A survey is employed to gather data from the business owners in the city of Diyarbakir.
M29|Macroeconomic Analysis of Corruption in Developing Economies|Based on empirical data, a two-equation game-type corruption reaction function model was developed. A “data to model” approach was used rather than the usual a priori approach. The general hypothesis tested was the “monkey see, monkey do” principle. The latest data on corruption among developing countries was obtained from the Enterprise Surveys done by the World Bank Group in 2010. The key variables were the percent of domestic firms expecting to make informal payment to public officials to “get things done,” and the percent of foreign firms doing like wise. The time span is from 2002-2010. A variety of econometric methods were used. In general, the statistical results were quite good and supported the hypothesis. Both reaction equations were positively sloped. Time had a reducing effect on the frequency of domestic corruption, yet it had an increasing effect on foreign corruption. Variations in the frequency of corruption across regions of countries were generally not significant.
M29|The Impact Of Cohesion Policy And Of Member States Effort On Competitiveness|To meet the challenges generated by globalization and the technological progress, the European cohesion policy through its financial instruments is a source of competitiveness, as it implements anticipation strategies in terms of research-development, innovation, firms’ competitiveness improvement, economic reorganization, in conditions of ensuring the social composition by creating new jobs. The paper analyzes the impact of EU financial effort combined with public and private national effort on the competitiveness of some European Union member states. Quantitative research carried out by econometric modeling confirms a correlation between the considered states score of competitiveness and the financial resources allocated for the objective Regional competitiveness and employment, the primary role exercised by the public and private sector contribution of states and the need to increase the European funds allocated to improve competitiveness and to achieve a prosperous economy based on knowledge.
M29|Methodological Foundamentations Concerning The Accountancy Of The Operations Of Purchasing Stocks From Coal Extraction|In order to prepare this work, we considered the particular importance of accounting information in the process to performable management of ensuring operations of stocks necessary to normal development of production from coal extraction. On the other side, it was considered as being appropriate the highlighting of the way in which accounting information mentioned is influenced by the complexity and specificity of entry operations in management of consumables and own finished goods that, mainly, refer to: the organization of an adequate flow in order to enter into the management, the optimization of stocks on types of goods and costs that they produce, rigorous implementation of accounting policies and the attenuation of internal risks related to the stocks etc. The aspects mentioned are approached in terms of increasing the credibility of accounting information, so it will be used, to the adoption of the best management decisions regarding the stocks.
M29|Estilos de Liderazgo, Riesgo Psicosocial y Clima Organizacional en un grupo de empresas Colombianas|Se analizaron las relaciones entre los riesgos psicosociales, el clima organizacional y el estilo de liderazgo, en empresas colombianas del sector de servicios sociales y de salud. Cuatrocientos participantes respondieron la Escala de Clima Organizacional (ECO), el Cuestionario de Factores Psicosociales en el Trabajo (CFP) y el Test de Adjetivos de Pitcher (Pitcher Test Adjectives [PAT¬]). Se obtuvieron coeficientes de correlación y regresiones lineales. En general, las dimensiones del ECO correlacionaron negativamente con las del CFP. En el PAT se obtuvieron dos estilos de liderazgo, uno deseable y otro no deseable. Ambos estilos correlacionaron negativamente con la mayoría de las dimensiones del CFP y positivamente con las del ECO, pero el no deseable obtuvo coeficientes más débiles. El impacto del factor organizacional y del de relaciones (ambos con coeficiente negativo) y las manifestaciones de salud (coeficiente positivo), junto con el apoyo, predijeron el liderazgo deseable. El apoyo (coeficiente positivo) y el control (coeficiente negativo), predijeron el liderazgo no deseable.

M29|Virtue Ethics – New Coordinates For Economic Development|Operating with business ethic we meet, some ethical systems, some of them developed in Antiquity, that still have a great influence upon economics development. One of these is the ethics of virtue. The aim of this paper work is to focus upon the one ethical system – virtue ethics and to illustrate his influence in economical field, offering a new coordination in this direction. We understand the importance of the human character for a successful leadership and management. Recent ethical dilemmas illustrate us how a vicious character has an influence not only to the possessor of that type of character but also to the entire community where he develop his activities. For a comprehensive understanding I expose a briefly review on virtue ethics as it was developed by Plato and Aristotle, ant its new coordination and influence upon our contemporaneous economy, illustrated by some examples.

M29|Creativity - a Determinant of Business Success in the Context of Global Crisis|The globalization of business and the global economic crisis, companies are forced to face changes in their action. Solutions crisis lies in new ways of enhancement of human potential at individual, organizational and societal. People are creative beings by their very existence in the organizational and social context. So the difference between success and failure is determined by how companies and individuals develop their ability to generate new and used creativity in work. Regardless of what perspective is discussed and defined, creativity is a key determinant of business success. Of course, creativity should be rewarded at the organizational level to ensure long-term success. How organizational success comes from successful individuals who compose that organization, business success is achieved by educating individual’s ability to capitalize on the talents and skills of existing capital at the organizational level.
M29|The National And The European Union Business Environment In The Context Of The Knowledge-Based Economy| The paper supposes a systematic research and few pragmatic guidelines in addressing the competitive environment (national and European) in which are operating Romanian companies, because their activity is heavily influenced by the business environment and determined by the factors of it.

We tried to argue the need for a strategic analysis of business environment in the context of the knowledge-based economy, we made an analysis of current status of the Romanian business environment compared to the other European Union member states following several criteria established at the beginning of the analysis, and finally. We have outlined several measures that should be implemented to contribute to the stability and to improving the Romanian business environment in the actual conditions. At the end of the paper we also realized a short analisys of the Romaniana economy position in the international rankings.
M29|Algunas concepciones del tiempo en ciencias sociales e implicaciones para la investigación en dirección estratégica|El presente documento examina algunos enfoques sobre la concepción del tiempo asociados al trabajo en ciencias sociales y en diferentes perspectivas científicas, originados principalmente en el paradigma de la simplicidad y el orden; el documento inicia analizando el sujeto, la investigación en el tiempo, y la emergencia del concepto tiempo desde diferentes enfoques, para finalmente explorar algunas implicaciones en la investigación en dirección estratégica. El documento trata el desarrollo del paradigma de la simplicidad desde su versión mecanicista, para identificar que este enfoque concibe el tiempo como un parámetro dado. El trabajo pretende mostrar que lainclusión de la reflexión sobre el sujeto y la existencia de observadores internos a los sistemas, permite sugerir que el tiempo puede ser una variable que debe ser tenida en cuenta, en ciencias sociales y en los estudios de estrategia de organizaciones.

M29|E-business Environment in the Global Information Society|In today´s digital 21st century, almost all businesses face intense competition from competitors all around the globe. There are no borders and business area for the all companies is almost unlimited. As the main supports of mentioned fact are globalization and ICT´s development. Influences such as globalization, increased popularity of outsourcing and offshoring have recently combined to produce an environment where ICT graduates need to have up-to-date and industry-relevant knowledge and skills, so that they can be successful in this highly competitive environment. Development of e-business and e-commerce make possible the companies to enter to the global markets. Fundamental prerequisite of the successful company in the global market is well-made corporate strategy and correct source information. Of high account condition of an entry to global markets is an adjustment of the information system to global information and business system management standards. The statistics gained from the Czech market shows, that in spite of enormous Internet proliferation the ratio of e-sales is lower than the ratio of e-purchases. Some possible reasons for these phenomena are discussed at the end of this paper.

Companies are trying to make their activity more efficient by reducing costs for storing and transportation. Also they want to be able to respond more rapidly to customer needs by implementing a delivery system that can satisfy effectively the request in the market. One solution for solving these issues with minimum capital investments is outsourcing of logistic activities, that means transportation services and warehousing. This material aims to analyze the Romanian market for transportation and warehousing services, the main companies and their strategies and future trends of the market.
M29|How to deal with crisis knowing change management principles|International crisis, market transparency, labor mobility, global capital flows, and instantaneous communications have blown scenario that senior executives in large companies had a simple goal for themselves and their organizations: stability. Shareholders wanted little more than predictable earnings growth In most industries — and in almost all companies— heightened global competition has concentrated management’s collective mind on something that, in the past, it happily avoided: change. Management of change represents an important responsibility for the managers and specialists, for those who have not only to assure the survival of the organization, but to assure the fundamentals for future development and competitiveness.
M29|Measuring Organizational Capital|Firms develop their organizational practices to realize returns from given and marketable resources. Implementing effective practices requires substantial up-front investment. We approximate the economic relevance of establishment-specific organizational capital by using a two-step procedure. First, we extract an establishment-specific performance differential from a within-panel estimator. Second, we explain the variation in this differential by using organizational and control variables. Our results make it possible for us to predict the contribution of organizational practices to the performance differential. We label this part of the firm-specific performance differential “organizational capital”. Our results indicate that organizational capital has a substantial impact on performance.

M29|Does the study of Kondratieff Cycles help us to know more about the social nature of money?|"Money was, until Keynes and Friedman, the great absence in economic literature. After them, relations between money and long economic cycles have been in their turn absent in debate. Perhaps this conform an explanation for logical and chronological relations between business cycles and long cycles been scarcely explored. Notwithstanding, is in those three directions where a new monetary theory should be researched for. This ought to be a more dynamic one. Thus, economic theory would root to anthropology, showing floating relationship between theories, from former cycle theories to most recent monetary and long cycle ones. Yet we can propose as economic models Porter's diamond, applied to money, and Money Value Chain. The aim is to reflect on a ""social dimension of money"" rather than of monetary policy, evoking the rhythms followed by that perception and the means for managing it, along the long cycle."
M29|The Prevalence and Effects of Occupational Licensing|Our study provides the first national analysis of the labour market implications of workers who are licensed by any agency of the government in the USA. Using a specially designed Gallup survey of a nationally representative sample of Americans, we provide an analysis of the influence of this form of occupational regulation. We find that 29 per cent of the workforce is required to hold a licence, which is a higher percentage than that found in other studies that rely on state‐level occupational licensing data or single states. Workers who have higher levels of education are more likely to work in jobs that require a licence. Union workers and government employees are more likely to have a licence requirement than are non‐union or private sector employees. Our multivariate estimates suggest that licensing has about the same quantitative impact on wages as do unions — that is about 15 per cent — and that being both licensed and in a union can increase wages by more than 24 per cent. However, unlike unions which reduce variance in wages, licensing does not significantly reduce wage dispersion for individuals in licensed jobs.
M29|Dimensiunea interculturala în rezolvarea conflictelor|This paper aims to examine the ambiguous and complicated concept of culture; explore how culture affects our own conceptions of conflict; consider some of the influences culture has on conflict resolution. Conflict is experienced at all levels of human activity from the intra-personal to the international. Although many people and cultures regard conflict as a negative experience, it need not be. Conflicts are complex processes. However, there are certain basic elements of structure and process which conflict situations have in common. One way of conceptualising the relationship between these elements is a triangle with Attitudes, Behaviours and Structure at the points. While conflict is universal, the ways in which it is expressed and handled are not. Each specific cultural framework has its own conception of conflict and techniques and processes for managing and resolving it.
M29|The Risk-Return Paradox for Strategic Management: Disentangling True and Spurious Effects|The concept of risk is central to strategy research and practice. Yet, the expected positive association between risk and return, familiar from financial markets, is elusive. Measuring risk as the variance of a series of accounting-based returns, Bowman obtained the puzzling result of a negative association between risk and mean return. This finding, known as the Bowman paradox, has spawned a remarkable number of publications, and various explanations have been suggested. The present paper contributes to this literature by showing that skewness of individual firms’ return distributions has a considerable spurious effect on the mean-variance relationship. I devise a method to disentangle true and spurious effects, illustrate it using simulations, and apply it to empirical data. It turns out that the size of the spurious effect is such that, on average, it explains the larger part of the observed negative relationship. My results might thus help to reconcile mean-variance approaches to risk-return analysis with other, ex-ante, approaches. In concluding, I show that the analysis of skewness is linked to all three streams of literature devoted to explaining the Bowman paradox.
M29|Innovation and Risk Management|Always, anytime, we speak about innovation, that it occurs in our live, firms, countries and regions. The innovation is very important for survive of any firm, any entrepreneur, any country and any region in world market due to their speed evolution. This paper has as objective to approach the relationship between Innovation and Risk Management. We concluded that the relationship between innovation and risk management will exist always whereas we are continuing to live in global world that it originated a global market in all economic sectors. And for any firm, any entrepreneur, any country or any region that wants to survive in this world or market it need to do a risk management that consist in to innovate, and so can reduce the uncertainty relatively their contextual environment that affect a determined activity and consequently that is affecting their performance.
M29|Lazy User Behaviour|In this position paper we suggest that a user will most often choose the solution (device) that will fulfill her (information) needs with the least effort. We call this “lazy user behavior”. We suggest that the principle components responsible for solution selection are the user need and the user state. User need is the user’s detailed (information) need (urgency, type, depth, etc.) and user state is the situation, in which the user is at the moment of the need (location, time, etc.); the user state limits the set of available solutions (devices) to fulfill the user need. The context of this paper is the use of mobile devices and mobile services. We present the lazy user theory of solution selection, two case examples, and discuss the implications of lazy user behavior on user attachment to mobile services and devices, and to planning and execution of mobile services.

By the issue of the article there was predominant opinion that the right choice of dividend policy can positively influence business value. In mentioned article authors presented dividend neutrality evidence in model with perfect markets, rational behavior and perfect certainty. Thenceforth scientists try to prove whether dividend neutrality is effective in real life or not. So far it hasn’t failed to prove validity of the thesis, on the other hand to disprove as well not.
M29|Olympic Prague: Reality or Economic Utopia?|Is reasonable for Prague (or for the Czech Republic as a whole) to be able to organize such sport event (from the organizing or financial point of view), or is it a wishful thinking of the group of the “Olympic Prague” fans? The text is based on the study of the Academy of the Science of the Czech Republic dealing with the economic aspects of the Olympic Games in Prague, and this text deals with the actual topic about the organizing of the summer Olympic Games in Prague in the horizon of the years 2016 or 2020. The main assumption of the realization of this event is the necessity of the finishing of the traffic and technical infrastructure due to the municipal plan. Realizing of the economical variant of the Olympic Games is not connected with the significant level of the profit or loss. It is Prague who should make the final decision whether to be able to be side by side of the other significant cities and be the candidate for this event; Prague has a great chance to succeed.
M29|The improvement of economic business management – competitiveness growth factor|By 2000 two things have become clear. First, the roots of international competitiveness lie in the microeconomic fundamentals of an economy. Macro-economic factors play a role in creating the environment for competitiveness but are not sufficient to enhance prosperity. Second, international competitiveness results from firm level choices that produce distinctiveness, not from replicating the choices of other firms, regions or nations. Now more than ever we live in a world that moves at a bewildering speed. Innovation is an important topic in the 21st century. Innovation management has become a compulsory path to sustained enterprise growth. In today’s society, intellectual capital has replaced the more traditional meaning of the capital needed for success in business or in life. Knowledge management is now recognized as the management of the 21st century, therefore understanding knowledge management processes and factors leading to its success or failure is an important key to help managers identify and understand what is required to make knowledge management work.
M29|The Development of Business Sector in Georgia|"The article is about the development of business sector in Georgia. It consists of the wide range of information on the business environment in Georgia. Here, we would like to mention that while obtaining the information and writingthis article, we focused on the importance of development of small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) that make important contributions to economic and social development and are usually responsible for the majority of jobs created. We also indicated the steps that had been taken by the Georgian government after it became an independent republic. Actually, in Georgia many micro businesses and self- employed persons still operate outside the ""formal"" sector and therefore one of the major challenges to government is to encourage entrepreneurs to engage in legitimate activity."
M29|New Size Measurements in Population Ecology|In organizational ecology, the analysis of the impact of competition between populations on vital ratios is relatively underdeveloped. This paper addresses this issue by developing new competition measurements that focus on the importance of organizational size. The application of these measurements in the case of competition between organizational subforms in a population, and their impact on mortality rates, demonstrate their usefulness for modelling competition. Specifically, the results show how levels of competition between firms in a population can be more clearly analysed when the rival population mass or concentration indices are used.

M29|Business Climate Survey In Romania Results And Analysis| This text focuses in the analysis of the business climate in Romania and some comparison with other states. Before the analysis was took place the survey conducted among employers of residents in 7 judets and 2 additional cities in the second half of 2003 and in two additional judets in the first half of 2004. The survey was realized by Bermangroup - international economic development consulting firm and the analysis also with University of Pardubice, Faculty of Economics and Administration. The objective of the survey was to provide useful and credible information concerning the attitudes of those who invest and create jobs in respective judets and cities. Survey items included the history and status of the business, the nature of its business, labor and employee matters, business facility information, government services and relations and overall impressions of a town and judet as a place to do business. Romania is becoming an attractive country for investors because of its available work force working for very low salaries. This is not sustainable model for further economic development, however the benefit of this comparative advantage has to maximized now. At the same time companies in Romania rank work force quality lower than in competing CEE countries (especially in Slovakia) where salaries are on a slightly higher but comparable level. The growing lack of skills (especially in technical professions, financial services and marketing) belongs also among important weaknesses of the Romanian economy. Companies complain about the situation in national economy in a similar way as Czech and Slovak firms did several years ago. On the other hand investment plans are very optimistic and predicted expansion (in relative figures) at current location is higher not only than in the Czech Republic and Slovakia but also higher than in the U.S.A.

M29|Application of Price Bundling Strategies in Retail Banking in Europe|Application of price bundling strategies in retail banking in Europe is a report based on an empirical study of price bundling practices in Southern, Central and Northern Europe. The current report defines three core price bundling models that are in one form or another applied by the interviewed banks. The models are cost efficiency bundling, cross-selling bundling and loyalty bundling. Price bundling has been started to apply in retail banking in Europe in the 1980’s. Price bundling is regarded as an important strategy in the intensified competitive market and it is also supposed to satisfy increasingly sophisticated customers in the future. The price bundles that the interviewed banks apply can be explained by the competitive conditions in the retail banking markets concerning both what the banks aim at, their competitive advantages, and the market factors. Banks in different parts of Europe have different competitive advantages that they find important when pursuing their price bundling strategies. Common to all the markets is the threat of customers to switch banks, which was identified as the main driving force in competition.

M29|Supply chain management: An opportunity for metaheuristics|In today’s highly competitive and global marketplace the pressure on organizations to find new ways to create and deliver value to customers grows ever stronger. In the last two decades, logistics and supply chain has moved to the center stage. There has been a growing recognition that it is through an effective management of the logistics function and the supply chain that the goal of cost reduction and service enhancement can be achieved. The key to success in Supply Chain Management (SCM) require heavy emphasis on integration of activities, cooperation, coordination and information sharing throughout the entire supply chain, from suppliers to customers. To be able to respond to the challenge of integration there is the need of sophisticated decision support systems based on powerful mathematical models and solution techniques, together with the advances in information and communication technologies. The industry and the academia have become increasingly interested in SCM to be able to respond to the problems and issues posed by the changes in the logistics and supply chain. We present a brief discussion on the important issues in SCM. We then argue that metaheuristics can play an important role in solving complex supply chain related problems derived by the importance of designing and managing the entire supply chain as a single entity. We will focus specially on the Iterated Local Search, Tabu Search and Scatter Search as the ones, but not limited to, with great potential to be used on solving the SCM related problems. We will present briefly some successful applications.
M29|Promoting Honesty in Negotiation: An Exercise in Practical Ethics|In a competitive and morally imperfect world, business people are often faced with serious ethical challenges. Harboring suspicions about the ethics of others, many feel justified in engaging in less-than-ideal conduct to protect their own interests. The most sophisticated moral arguments are unlikely to counteract this behavior. We believe that this morally defensive behavior is responsible, in large part, for much undesirable deception in negotiation. Drawing on recent work in the literature of negotiations, we present some practical guidance on how negotiators might build trust, establish common interests, and secure credibility for their statements thereby promoting honesty We also point out the types of social and institutional arrangements, many of which have become commonplace, that work to promote credibility, trust, and honesty in business dealings. Our approach is offered not only as a specific response to the problem of deception in negotiation, but as one model of how research in business ethics might offer constructive advice to practitioners.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

M29|Deception and Mutual Trust: A Reply to Strudler|Alan Strudler has written a stimulating and provocative article about deception in negotiation. He presents his views, in part, in contrast with our earlier work on the Mutual Trust Perspective. We believe that Strudler is wrong in his account of the ethics of deception in negotiation and in his quick dismissal of the Mutual Trust Perspective. Though his mistakes may be informative, his views are potentially harmful to business practice. In this paper, we present arguments against Strudler's position and attempt to salvage the Mutual-Trust Perspective from his attack. Strudler's work reaffirms the need for a more pragmatic approach to business ethics. We close the paper with a renewed call for more constructive and practical approaches to business ethics research.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

M29|In Search Of Excellent Management|Despite important advances in recent years, no agreement exists concerning what constitutes management excellence. Specific knowledge of how managerial behaviour is perceived and evaluated by others will help to resolve unsettled questions about what is meant by management excellence and improve the actual decisions of managers. This article examines the determinants of managerial excellence as perceived by corporate CEOs, directors, and financial analysts in Fortune magazine's annual survey of the best‐managed American firms in 33 industries. While the firms perceived to be best managed are more profitable and less risky, and grow faster and reward their stockholders more than less well‐managed firms, these variables explain only about 30 per cent of the variance in management ratings. the firms perceived to be best managed have more involvement in international markets and research and development, while large firm size and firm diversification reflect negatively upon perceived managerial quality. the relative inability of conventional financial measures of firm performance to explain perceptions of managerial excellence underlines the complex nature both of these perceptions and strategic behaviour. the results support Varadarajan and Ramanujam's conclusion that excellent management depends upon a diverse set of competencies and values, as well as Chakravarthy's contention that the most important characteristic of firm performance is management's ability to transform the firm and adapt to a rapidly changing environment. By contrast, little support is found for the maximization of stockholder wealth criterion of Rappaport.
M29|Shrewd Bargaining on the Moral Frontier: Toward a Theory of Morality In Practice|From a traditional moral point of view, business practitioners often seem overly concerned about the behavior of their peers in deciding how they ought to act. We propose to account for this concern by introducing a mutual trust perspective, where moral obligations are grounded in a sense of trust that others will abide by the same rules. When grounds for trust are absent, the obligation is weakened. We illustrate this perspective by examining the widespread ambivalence with regard to deception about one's settlement preferences in negotiation. On an abstract level, such deception generally seems undesirable, though in many individual cases it is condoned, even admired as shrewd bargaining. Because of the difficulty in verifying someone's settlement preferences, it is hard to establish a basis for trusting the revelations of the other party, especially in competitive negotiations with relative strangers.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
M29|Taxation and On-the-Job Training Decisions|This paper is an econometric analysis of the on-the-job training (OJT) decisions of a group of white American males during 1975. The data are obtained from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which asked a very careful series of questions concerning the individual's OJT status. Each individual's internal rate of return is estimated and used as an explanatory variable to predict the probability of taking OJT. The individual's marginal tax rate is also entered in the equation. The results suggest that income taxation has tended to increase the probability of being involved in OJT. I conjecture that this is because income taxation makes investment in physical capital a less desirable vehicle for carrying consumption into the future, and hence increases the attractiveness of human capital.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
