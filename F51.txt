F51|Foreign in influence and domestic policy: A survey|In an interconnected world, economic and political interests inevitably reach beyond national borders. Since policy choices generate external economic and political costs, foreign state and non-state actors have an interest in influencing policy actions in other sovereign countries to their advantage. Foreign influence is a strategic choice aimed at internalizing these externalities and takes many forms. We distinguish three broad types of intervention strategies, (i) voluntary agreement interventions between the intervening foreign power and the target country, (ii) policy interventions based on rewarding or sanctioning the target country to obtain a specific change in policy and (iii) institution interventions aimed at influencing the policy choice by changing the political institutions in the target country (with or without a civil war). We propose a unifying theoretical framework to understand when and which form of foreign influence is chosen and use it to organize and evaluate the new political economics literature on foreign influence along with work in cognate disciplines. Foreign intervention plays a more important role for a proper understanding of domestic policy choices, for institutional dynamics and for internal conflict than is commonly acknowledged in both empirical and theoretical research.
F51|Forecast Performance in Times of Terrorism|Governments, central banks, and private companies make extensive use of expert and market-based forecasts in their decision-making processes. These forecasts can be affected by terrorism, which should be considered by decision makers. We focus on terrorism, as a mostly endogenously driven form of political uncertainty, and use new econometric tests to assess the forecasting performance of market and professional inflation and exchange-rate forecasts in Israel. We show that expert forecasts are better than market-based forecasts, particularly during periods of terrorism. However, forecasting performance and abilities of both market-based and expert forecasts are significantly reduced during such periods. Thus, policymakers should be particularly attentive to terrorism when considering inflation and exchange-rate forecasts.
F51|Capacity vs Energy Subsidies for Renewables: Benefits and Costs for the 2030 EU Power Market|Policy makers across Europe have implemented renewable support policies with several policy objectives in mind. Among these are achieving ambitious renewable energy targets at the lowest cost and promoting technology improvement through learning-by-doing. Although subsidy mechanisms based on energy out-put are cost-effective for achieving a certain renewable energy target in the short run, policies tied to capacity installation might be more effective in reducing technology costs in the longer term. We address the question of how policies that subsidize renewable energy (feed-in premia and renewable portfolio standards (RPSs)) versus capacity (investment subsidies) impact the mix of renewable investments, electricity costs, renewable share, the amount of subsidies, and consumer prices in the EU electric power market in 2030. Our analysis is unique in its focus on the market impacts of capacity-oriented vs energy-oriented policies while considering a realistic landscape of diverse and time-varying loads and renewable resources (including existing and potential hydro, wind, and solar resources), as well as fossil-fuelled generators and network constraints.

F51|Reopening Pandora's Box in Search of a WTO-Compatible Industrial Policy? The Brazil-Taxation Dispute|The Brazil-Taxation dispute concerns the complaints taken to the World Trade Organisation by the European Union and Japan against seven different Brazilian industrial subsidy programmes. One concerned the automotive sector and represents a clear case of policies dictated by strong domestic political-economy forces, with little attention to impacts on consumers or imports. The ensuing WTO dispute raises important issues concerning the WTO-compatibility of subsidy measures. In particular, the Appellate Body (AB) reversed the panel findings with respect to two issues: the extent to which subsidy measures can be exempted from complying with National Treatment rules under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and the identification of local content requirements (LCRs), which are prohibited under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM). In particular, the AB considered that subsidies, if not based on discriminatory taxation, could be justified under the GATT and could have some discriminatory elements without violating the National Treatment disciplines. Furthermore, it concluded that legitimate eligibility criteria under a subsidy programme should not be construed as prohibited LCRs under the SCM. However, the test devised by the AB to distinguish legitimate eligibility criteria from prohibited LCRs could facilitate circumvention of the LCRs prohibition under the SCM.
F51|Arming in the Global Economy: The Importance of Trade with Enemies and Friends|We analyze how trade openness matters for interstate conflict over productive resources. Our analysis features a terms-of-trade channel that makes security policies trade-regime dependent. Specifically, trade between two adversaries reduces each one's incentive to arm given the opponent's arming. If these countries have a sufficiently similar mix of initial resource endowments, greater trade openness brings with it a reduction in resources diverted to conflict and thus wasted, as well as the familiar gains from trade. Although a move to trade can otherwise induce greater arming by one of them and thus need not be welfare improving for both, aggregate arming falls. By contrast, when the two adversaries do not trade with each other but instead trade with a third (friendly) country, a move from autarky to trade intensifies conflict between the two adversaries, inducing greater arming. With data from the years surrounding the end of the Cold War, we exploit the contrasting implications of trade costs between enemies versus trade costs between friends to provide some evidence that is consistent with the theory.
F51|The sword and the shield: the economics of targeted sanctions|How effective are “smart” sanctions in imposing costs on an adversary? We consider this question in a model where a targeted regime may choose to “shield” strategically important firms from harm. Using detailed firm and individual data, we estimate the impact on firm performance from smart sanctions deployed by the U.S. and EU against Russia beginning in 2014. We find significant losses in operating revenue, asset values, and employees for sanctioned firms relative to their non-sanctioned peers, which are greater in sectors dependent upon Western service inputs. Strategic firms systemically outperform non-strategic firms under sanctions, implying a cost of shielding to the regime that adds substantially to the total cost of sanctions.
F51|On the Effects of Sanctions on Trade and Welfare: New Evidence Based on Structural Gravity and a New Database|Using a new, global data base covering the years 1950 to 2015, we study the impact of sanctions on international trade and welfare. We make use of the rich dimensionality of our data and of the latest developments in the structural gravity literature. Starting with a broad evaluation by sanction type, we carefully investigate the case of Iran. Effects are significant but also widely heterogeneous across sanctioning countries. Moreover, they depend on the direction of trade. We also perform a counterfactual analysis which translates our partial equilibrium sanction estimates into heterogeneous but intuitive general equilibrium.
F51|The Brexit Conundrum Worsens the UK's Relationship with the European Union|This paper examines the shortcomings in the UK government’s Brexit negotiation strategy which reflected Prime Minister Theresa May’s weak political leadership. The Prime Minister focused on securing the short-term political survival of her government amidst turbulent and fractious domestic politics, over negotiations with the EU27. Brexit negotiations were poorly planned and the government was woefully unprepared. Brexit also threatens a serious re-opening of old wounds in Northern Ireland, as debate grows around the prospect of a united Ireland inside the EU. UK politics is in turmoil and in a chronic crisis. What route the Brexit saga takes next is uncertain. But the crossroads is approaching – either the UK leaves on 31 October 2019 with no deal or it finds a route towards an accommodation with the EU. The phenomenon of British exceptionalism towards the EU is set to take a new dramatic turn, while the UK’s chaotic political divisions will not disappear any time soon.
F51|The potential impact of oil sanctions on military spending and democracy in the Middle East|This study examines how negative oil shocks (due to the oil boycotts) could affect the military expenditure and the quality of democracy in the oil rentier states of Middle East by applying the annual date from 1990 to 2017. I use both economic and political variables in a panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) model of oil boycotts. The estimated PVAR models show significant impacts of oil boycotts both on key economic factors (government revenues, defence and non-defence expenditures) and on the different indicators of the political system. Using panel impulse response functions (PIRFs) and a panel variance decomposition analysis (PVDC) based on the estimated PVAR model, the findings indicate that the responses of political institutions and different indexes of democracy such as electoral, liberal, participatory, deliberative, and egalitarian democracy to decreases in oil rents are positive and statistically significant, whereas the response of military spending is negative and significant. Moreover according to the results of the variance decomposition analysis the variations in oil rents and political situation explain considerable parts of the variation of defence expenditures in the Middle Eastern countries implying that defence expenditures are considerably influenced by oil rents fluctuations and the quality of political system in the Middle East. These results are not sensitive to different proxies for oil abundance (such as fuel exports and amount of oil production) and different indicators of political institutions (V-DEM democracy indexes and polity2), as well as different orderings of variables in the panel VAR system.
F51|Russian Business under Economic Sanctions: Is There Regional Heterogeneity?|The sanctions against Russia, beginning in early 2014, provide us with a unique opportunity to study whether, and how sanctions affect a vast territorial global superpower. This study attempts to empirically examine the economic impact of this event, paying particular attention to the existence or nonexistence of its regional heterogeneity. For these purposes, this study used a dataset from a survey that asked the executive managers of Russian regional companies to assess the impact on their management activities in late 2015. The key findings are as follows. First, approximately half of those interviewed perceived the economic sanctions as having a negative impact. Second, no regional variations in the impact of the sanctions could be found. It follows that financial sanctions, aimed at an entire nation, exert a significant and geographically uniform impact. Moreover, even regional businesses near the Asia-Pacific region, holding strong connections with Asian countries, cannot avoid its impact.
F51|A Study of Economic Sophistication of China by Using Principle Component Analysis|Following the Global Recession in 2008, European countries and U.S. recognized irreversible changes resulting from financial shock that lead their own countries into a new stage of economy, called “New Normal”. Since the Chinese economy is not independent of the global economy, China also recognized that its own economy was entering the “New normal”, or “Xin Changtai” in Chinese. Furthermore, to suit their economy to “Xin Changtai”, new economic growth policy was necessary. During the 2014 APEC meeting, President Xi Jinping declared that China aimed to change their engine of economic growth from foreign trade and investment to innovation and consumption, in addition to the harmonious upgrade of the region and society between each province to achieve sustainable economic growth. Although existing literatures suggest the use of Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) to evaluate the sophistication of society, there is no consensus on the construction of the components or the evaluation of each component of GPI, therefore, a more objective evaluation index is needed. This study employs the principle component analysis method to calculate an indicator to evaluate the sophistication of society. This indicator reflects the degree of the characteristics readily used in developed countries, and in the present study it is applied in the evaluation of China’s 31 provinces. Empirical results show that a few provinces in coastal areas developed their society, while most inland provinces were left behind. Moreover, as a result from the examination of the correspondence between the geographic distribution of the index and China’s seven geographic divisions, it is shown that a disparity in social sophistication occurred in each division.
F51|Intellectual Property, Tariffs, and International Trade Dynamics|The emergence of global value chains not only leads to a magnification of trade in intermediate inputs but also to an extensive technology diffusion among the different production units involved in arms-length relationships. In this context, the lack of enforcement of intellectual property rights has recently become a highly controversial subject of debate in the context of the China-U.S. trade negotiations. This paper analyzes the strategic interaction of tariff policies and the enforcement of intellectual property rights within a quantitative general equilibrium framework. Results indicate that, in principle, tariffs could be an effective deterrent for weak protections for intellectual property. Moreover, weakening enforcement may be a strong deterrent for raising tariffs. These results combined indicate that there is scope for international cooperation on these fronts.
F51|The defense economics and the military reform in Russia in 2018|In 2018, the total strength of the Armed Forces (AF) of the Russian Federation did not change. Early in February 2018, the President of the Russian Federation increased by 200 persons to 10,740 persons the ultimate staff number of the Central Office of the Ministry of Defense (without the guarding and building maintenance personnel taken into account), which is not included in the strength of the Armed Forces.
F51|On Trade and the Stability of (Armed) Peace|"We consider an environment in which two sovereign states with overlapping ownership claims on a resource/asset first arm and then choose whether to resolve their dispute violently through war or peacefully through settlement. Both approaches depend on the states' military capacities, but have very different outcomes. War precludes trade between the two states and can be destructive; however, once a winner is declared, arming is unnecessary in future periods. By contrast, a peaceful resolution under the threat of war today avoids destruction and supports mutually advantageous trade; yet, settlements must be renegotiated and the states must arm in future periods to resolve their ongoing dispute. Paying special attention to the importance of trade on arming incentives and payoffs in this context, we explore the conditions under which ""armed peace"" arises as the perfectly coalition-proof equilibrium over time. Our analysis reveals that, depending on the destructiveness of war, time preferences, and the distribution of initial resource endowments, greater gains from trade (jointly determined by trade costs and the substitutability of traded commodities) can reduce arming and pacify international tensions. Even when the gains from trade are relatively small, peace might be sustainable, but only for more uneven distributions of initial resources."
F51|Military Intervention via Drone Strikes|We study the 420 US drone strikes in Pakistan from 2006-2016, isolating causal effects on terrorism, anti-US sentiment, and radicalization via an instrumental variable strategy based on wind. Drone strikes are suggested to encourage terrorism in Pakistan, bearing responsibility for 16 percent of all attacks or 2,964 terror deaths. Exploring mechanisms, we distinguish between insiders (members of terrorist organizations) and outsiders (the Pakistani populace). Analyzing data from a leading Pakistani newspaper, anti-US protests, and Google searches, drone strikes appear to increase anti-US sentiment and radicalization: Outsiders seem to sympathize with insiders because of drone strikes.
F51|On Target? The Incidence of Sanctions Across Listed Firms in Iran|A central premise of current international sanctions policy is targeting, that is, concentrating the impact of sanctions on specific, politically influential groups in the sanctioned country. However, many economic factors make it difficult for senders of sanctions to hit these targets. We offer evidence on the efficacy of targeting in the case of Iran, where sanctions aimed to affect a well-defined set of political entities through their economic interests. Our identification strategy focuses on the process of negotiations for sanctions removal. We find that stock returns of firms owned by targeted political groups and firms unrelated to these groups both react positively to information indicating progress in diplomatic negotiations. However, these effects are significantly larger for firms owned by targeted groups. This evidence suggests that good news about sanctions relief yielded particularly large economic benefits for targeted political entities, consistent with the ‘income targeting’ goal of sanctions policy against Iran.Keywords: JEL Classification:
F51|Long term trends across security and development in the Sahel|Following the 2013 French military intervention in Mali, significant attention has been paid to issues of security and development in the Sahel. The stability of Sahelian countries and the capacity of their governments to manage social change and resulting tensions have major security implications for migration flows, economic development, and health concerns both for local people and for the broader international community. The rise of violent religious extremism in the region and the varied efforts to curtail its spread have raised international alarm and prompted important resources to be invested by both domestic governments and foreign partners. This paper offers a broad overview of the current situation in the Sahel paying attention to the intersecting and overlapping issues of security and development. The paper then interrogates three central themes—poverty, migration, and conflict—adopting a historical perspective to examine long-term trends in the region. In doing so, it aims to contribute to contemporary policy discussions by offering evidence of how these dynamics have either changed or persisted across this centrally important region during the last several decades.
F51|Farsightedness in Games: Stabilizing Cooperation in International Conflict|We show that a cooperative outcome—one that is at least next-best for the players—is not a Nash equilibrium (NE) in 19 of the 57 2 x 2 strict ordinal conflict games (33%), including Prisoners’ Dilemma and Chicken. Auspiciously, in 16 of these games (84%), cooperative outcomes are nonmyopic equilibria (NMEs) when the players make farsighted calculations, based on backward induction; in the other three games, credible threats induce cooperation. More generally, in all finite normal-form games, if players’ preferences are strict, farsighted calculations stabilize at least one Pareto-optimal NME. We illustrate the choice of NMEs that are not NEs by two cases in international relations: (i) no first use of nuclear weapons, chosen by the protagonists in the 1962 Cuban missile crisis and since adopted by some nuclear powers; and (ii) the 2015 agreement between Iran, and a coalition of the United States and other countries, that has been abrogated by the United States but has forestalled Iran’s possible development of nuclear weapons.
F51|Can you hear me now? Good?? The Effect of Mobile Phones on Collective Violent Action in the Libyan Revolution|We explore the effect of mobile phone and internet access on levels of collective violent action within the Libyan Revolution. Eastern Libya experienced a state-implemented blackout shortly after widespread riots and protests began. However, with luck, ingenuity, and foreign aid, Libyan rebels forged an independent mobile phone network. We exploit the exogeneity of the timing of the network’s reactivation and use a variation of difference-in-differences (DID) to measure the effect on the frequency of collective violent action. While the dominant view in the literature is that cell access increases violence by lowering the costs of organizing, we find that the reactivation of the mobile phone network reduced violent collective action by 21%. We find this negative effect for all conflicts and for conflicts that can be identified as initiated by non-state actors. We also study mobile phone’s effect on collective deadly action and fatalities using a different source for conflicts, finding similar negative effects. We propose mechanisms that may explain the aggregate negative effect: (1) substitution of physical protests to digital protests, (3) the reduction of dissatisfaction toward the state, and (3) the use of mobile phones to avoid conflict with state actors.
F51|Krieg, Frieden und Mediation - eine wettkampftheoretische Perspektive<BR>[War, Peace and Mediation - a Contest Theory Perspective]|Since the Refugee Crisis and the subsequent focus on combating the causes of migration, efforts to promote the peaceful resolution of armed conflicts have gained in importance and urgency, both in Germany and at the international level. Since 2016, the German Federal Government has significantly increased its commitment to the prevention, stabilization and termination of civil wars. Based on the economic theory of contests, this paper outlines options for how third parties can support peaceful resolution of armed conflicts. In contest theory, peace is interpreted as a stationary equilibrium of military capabilities of the warring parties. The transition from war to peace is either (1) a result of the individual rationality of the parties (endogenous peace) and, depending on the military configuration, can take place with or without the involvement of a mediator (passive mediation), or (2) the result of a targeted intervention of a third party in the calculus of (at least) one of the conflict parties (exogenous peace; active mediation). A contest theory analysis provides new insights into the value of third parties in the transition from war to peace. According to the analysis, (3) passive mediation can be used in 25% of all conceivable military configurations. (4) The 'mutually hurting stalemate' proposed in the mediation literature as a prerequisite for peace negotiations is an absolute exception (2.7%). (5) Passive mediation is much more likely in situations of 'one-sided weakness' (11.1%). To be effective (6) a passive mediator must dispose of immaterial resources such as impartiality, discretion and credibility. (7) Active mediation can be used in the remaining 75% of all conceivable military configurations. (8) To be effective, an active peace broker must have significant material resources (finances, military capabilities, private information). For potential active mediators with limited resources, cooperation with powerful fourth parties could be an attractive option.

F51|Directed social economics : China's complicated growth story|The entire globe has, in varying measures, experienced the good and the bad impact of China’s growth story this past decade. China is hastening to project itself such that, it be viewed as the ‘global growth engine’. Whether duly or unduly, like secretly many a country would want to, China is rushing all out to replace USA from the foray and become the sole unparalleled global leader. The Chinese have already compromised with Russia, by signing a long-term contract for oil supply. China’s economic numbers and the trend displayed so far, reasonably indicates its hunger for growth. China is ambitious to grow vertically on the economic scale and horizontally on the geographic scale. This is what is likely to spell disaster for the world, especially for the democratic countries.
F51|Brexit trade impacts' and Mercosur's negotiations with Europe|We estimate that a hard Brexit (HB) would reduce UK agro-industrial-imports from the EU by around 50%. Following the dismantling of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) the UK Government has proposed to shift towards market-oriented agricultural policies and negotiating free trade agreements (FTAs) with interested countries. Assuming that the UK restores the previous level of agro industrial products, the paper estimates the net export gains that Mercosur could achieve in the UK market for different agro-industrial products. In the event of a Hard Brexit, and assuming that the Mercosur-EU negotiations are not completed before, Mercosur would then face two negotiations in Europe: with the EU27 and with the UK. We argue that failing Mercosur to give priority to talks with the UK, other countries are more than likely sign trade agreements and fill its import gap thus creating additional trade diversion effects against the Mercosur. We offer back-of-the-envelope estimates indicating that under such an FTA, Mercosur could double its agro-industrial exports to the UK. These significant export gains are concentrated in a group of products that are now highly protected by the CAP.
F51|Modeling Deterrence by Denial and by Punishment|"We explore a defender's prewar allocation of military resources between denial and punishment strategies for deterrence. While denial disproportionately raises the probability to countervail aggression by disrupting military forces (""guns""), punishment proportionately raises costs on the aggressor by damaging civilian values (""butter""). Because these countervailing and deterrence effects are so divergent, the deployment that minimizes the risk of war can vary, depending on the defender's military capacity relative to the aggressor's. Namely, inferior parties resort only to punishment (e.g., post-Cold War North Korea), competitive parties concentrate solely on denial (e.g., Germany, Italy, and Japan), and superior parties develop both denial and punishment capabilities (e.g., Permanent Five)."
F51|Moving Forward vs. Inflicting Costs in a Random-Walk Model of War|"How do belligerents choose and change their military strategies during war? How do these strategies shape war? To address these questions, we develop a random-walk model of war, where two belligerents fight over ""forts"" across periods. The random walk represents a battlefront, which moves as the war evolves, resulting in the occupation of more forts for the winning side and less forts for the losing side. Unlike existing models, ours allows the belligerents to choose an action out of moving forward, inflicting costs, and surrender in every battle. We found that equilibrium strategies are monotonic with respect to the walk---a belligerent will punish its opponent if it is sufficiently advantageous and surrender if it is too disadvantageous. Accordingly, the punishment strategy can function to shorten the war. Moreover, a severer punishment tends to make the war even shorter."

Starting with a broad evaluation by sanction type, we carefully investigate the case of Iran. Effects are significant but also widely heterogeneous across sanctioning countries. Moreover, they depend on the direction of trade. We also perform a counterfactual analysis which translates our partial equilibrium sanction estimates into heterogeneous but intuitive general equilibrium effects within the same framework.
F51|Regime Change|I present a theory of multi-lateral conflict. Policy-motivated countries launch military interventions in a target country, whose policies are perceived as noxious. A successful intervention leads to a change of regime and a change of policies in the target country. Comparative statics show that an intervention is more likely in a more interconnected world, if the target nation is smaller, or if the policy preferred by the target country’s government is more extreme. To measure the effectiveness of alliances, I develop a measure of “relative sacrifice” in contributions to multilateral interventions. Using Afghanistan (2001-2014) as an illustration, I argue that the relative sacrifice made by the US, the UK, and Canada was high, while all other European NATO allies sacrificed very little.
F51|Sanctions and Public Opinion: The Case of the Russia-Ukraine Gas Disputes|Economic sanctions usually fail, sometimes even provoking the opposite of the intended outcome. Why are sanctions so often ineffective? One prominent view is that sanctions generate popular support for the targeted government and its policies; an outcome referred to as the rally-around-the-flag effect. We quantify this effect in the context of a major trade dispute between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, which led to a cut in gas exports to Ukraine and a sharp increase of gas prices. Using individual data on political and economic preferences before and after the trade dispute and exploiting the cross section heterogeneity in the individual exposure to the price shock—measured by the connection to a centralized gas/heating system—we find that people more directly affected by the increase of gas prices were significantly more likely to change their opinions in support of Western-style political and economic systems preferred by the incumbent government, consistent with a rally-around-the-flag effect.
F51|Crop and Conflict: exploring the impact of Inequalityin Agricultural Production on Conflict Risk|Recent attempts to find a robust empirical correlation between climate variability, crop production and civil conflict risk have been quite inconclusive. In this paper, we argue that the ambiguity in empirical findings may be partly due to a general tendency to treat agricultural production in absolute terms, while neglecting the importance of the relative deprivation triggered by unequal distribution in crop yields across locations and between groups. To test this hypothesis, we rely on high-resolution global gridded data on the local yield of four main crops for the period 1981-2017, and calculate the level of inequality in crop production by means of a Gini index using the grid-cell information on yearly crop yields both at the country level and between identity based groups (regional and ethnic). In addition, for each level of spatial disaggregation, we compute the Gini coefficient using information on crop production from rural grid-cells only. Our results reveal a strong and robust association between crop inequality and the probability of conflict outbreak. This effect is particularly pronounced in the case of inequality among rural areas. Climatic variability, on the other hand, is shown not to increase significantly the destabilizing effect of crop inequality. We also find that akin ethnic competition and discrimination along ethnic lines represent good predictors of conflict outbreak, especially in the case of ethnic conflicts, and when the between-group inequality in crop production is calculated along ethnic boundaries.
F51|Moving Into the Slow Lane|Growth in much of CESEE will remain healthy by post-crisis standards, but has passed its peak. We expect most economies to slow from here, reflecting weaker external demand and domestic capacity constraints. Global trade tensions, structural weakness in the eurozone and Brexit all pose downside risks to our forecasts.
F51|Dying Light: War and Trade of the Separatist-Controlled Areas of Ukraine|The paper investigates how war and the war-related government policies affected economic activity of the separatist-controlled areas of Ukraine. The paper applies a quasi-experimental study design to estimate the impact of two events on the separatist-controlled areas the introduction of the separatist control and the introduction of the second round of the trade ban, which was imposed by the government of Ukraine on the separatist-controlled territories in 2017. Using a difference-in-difference estimation procedure that controls for the yearly and monthly effects, individual fixed effects, and the region-specific time shocks, the study finds that the separatist rule decreased the economic activity by 38% in the Donetsk region and 51% in the Luhansk region according to the preferred specifications. At the same time, the trade ban of the year 2017 against the major industrial enterprises of the separatist-controlled areas decreased luminosity by 20%. The paper argues that the trade disruptions due to the war actions were nested within the negative effect of the separatist rule and accounted for half of it.
F51|Making America Great Again|Trump has promised to ‘make America great again’. As a self-proclaimed expert on everything of import, he knows exactly how to increase domestic investment and consumption, boost exports, reduce the country’s trade deficit, expand employment and bolster wages. And as America’s leader-and-policymaker-in-chief, he has taken the necessary steps to achieve every one of these goals, or so he says. Capitalists and pundits follow him like imprinted ducks. His tweets rattle markets, his announcements are dissected by academics and his utterances are analysed to exhaustion by various media. A visiting alien might infer that he actually runs the world. And the alien wouldn’t be alone. The earthly population too, conditioned by ivory-tower academics and popular opinion makers, tends to think of political figureheads as ‘leaders’ and ‘policymakers’. Situated at the ‘commanding heights’ of their respective nation states and international organizations, these ‘leaders’ supposedly set the rules, make policies, steer their societies and determine the course of history. Or at least that’s the belief. The reality, though, is quite different.
F51|Bearing the cost of politics: Consumer prices and welfare in Russia|In August 2014, the Russian Federation implemented an embargo on select food and agricultural imports from Western countries in response to the economic sanctions. The measure was designed to harm producers in United States, European Union, Norway, Ukraine, along other Western countries. In this study we quantify the effect of the embargo for welfare and consumer prices in Russia. We first provide evidence for the direct effect on consumer prices with a difference-in-differences approach with a highly detailed monthly dataset of consumer prices in Russia between 2011-2016. The results suggest that the embargo caused consumer prices of embargoed goods to rise in the short run by 8.9% - 12.6%. Regions of Russia with previously above-average levels of food imports from sanctioned countries experienced a stronger impact. In the medium run the effect reduces to 1.2% - 6.3%. The results also indicate that the policy shock has been transmitted to non-embargoed sectors by means of domestic inputoutput production linkages. We then use a Ricardian model of trade with domestic sectoral linkages, trade in intermediate goods and sectoral heterogeneity in production to perform counterfactual simulations, isolate the direct and indirect price effects, and compute welfare measures for a situation without embargo. Our simulations suggest that the self-imposed embargo caused a decline in Russian welfare by 1.88% and an increase in the overall price index by 0.19%.
F51|Potential economic effects of a global trade conflict: Projecting the medium-run effects with the WTO global trade model|The WTO Global Trade Model is employed to project the medium-run economic effects of a global trade conflict. The trade conflict scenario is based on recent estimates in the literature of the difference between cooperative and non-cooperative tariffs. The study provides three main insights. First, the projected macroeconomic effects in the medium run are considerable. A global trade conflict started in 2019 would lead to a reduction in global GDP in 2022 of about 1.96% and a reduction in global trade of about 17% compared to the baseline. For context global GDP fell about 2.1% and global trade 12.4% in the global financial crisis of 2009. Second, behind the single-digit aggregate production effects there are much larger, double-digit sectoral production effects in many countries, leading to a painful adjustment process. In general, a global trade conflict leads to a reallocation of resources away from the most efficient allocation based on comparative advantage. Third, the large swings in sectoral production lead to substantial labour displacement. On average 1.15% and 1.74% of high-skilled and low-skilled workers respectively would leave their initial sector of employment.
F51|Just peanuts? - Trump's protective tariffs and their impact on Africa|"The international discussion of Trump's dispute over import tariffs for steel, aluminum and even cars are so far focused on the big global players. However, smaller African countries in particular could suffer too from the planned punitive tariffs, analogous to the famous African proverb, ""When elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers"". Egypt and South Africa for example, the potentially most affected countries in Africa, face massive job losses and earning opportunities, with all the consequences that this entails for their already fragile economy and their population in dire poverty."
F51|The US-China Trade Competition: An Overview|An impending trade war between US and China, the world’s two largest economies can cause insurmountable consequences of unfathomable magnitude. It can cause distortions in the complex web of interconnected commodity and value chains sprawled across the boundaries, ultimately leading to suboptimal social welfare of the international community. The present paper intends to provide an overview of the US-China trade imbalance and resulting trade tensions that it begets .The paper analyses various reasons for the US- China trade competition and its implications on world trade quoting world bank data from 1992-2016 and concludes by proposing the likelihood of not getting the scenario escalated.
F51|Trump's tariff’s impact on Africa and the ambiguous role of African agency|"The international discussion of Trump's dispute over import tariffs for steel, aluminum and even cars are so far focused on the big global players. However, smaller African countries in particular suffer too from the planned punitive tariffs, similar to the famous African proverb, ""When elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers"". After years of talk on partnership for economic development (AGOA, Cotonou Agreement, EPAs, etc) Trump’s tariffs mean a severe blow to participatory foreign trade and sustainable industrialization in Africa. Egypt and South Africa for example, the potentially most affected African countries, face massive job losses and earning opportunities, with all the consequences that this entails for their already fragile economy and the population in dire poverty. Trump’s intervention thus joins the continued power politics of former colonial powers vis à vis Africa. Nevertheless, despite these asymmetric power relations, unfair trade relations and the desolate state of African infant industries are not necessarily due to externalities but often home-made. African agency plays an ambiguous role in enhancing participatory trade and indigenous industrialization."

F51|North Korea: Sanctions, Engagement and Strategic Reorientation|This paper examines the roles that sanctions, and inducements might play in resolving the North Korea problem. It finds that while the “maximum pressure” narrative is plausible, the evidence to substantiate it is thin. Likewise, the North Korean regime is aware of the potentially constraining (or even destabilizing) political implications of cross‐border economic integration and has acted to structure engagement in ways to blunt its transformative impact. Maximizing the transformative possibilities of engagement will require conscious planning by North Korea's partners. Multilateral guidelines and voluntary codes on corporate conduct could be used to anchor this process, but they will only be effective if there is greater political commitment to such norms than has been witnessed to date. Without such commitments, engagement risks enabling North Korea's doctrine of the parallel development of the economy and weapons of mass destruction.
F51|Escalating games: how intermediate levels of conflict affect stability of cooperation|We argue that cooperation can become more fragile if (i) there are sufficiently many intermediate levels of cooperation and (ii) players cannot respond with large punishments to small deviations. Such disproportional punishments can be perceived as unreasonable or players can face external constraints---political checks, negative publicity, etc. Specifically, we show that regardless of how patient the players are, any prisoner's dilemma game can be extended with intermediate levels of cooperation in such a way that full conflict is the only equilibrium outcome of the extended game.
F51|Effects of Economic Climate on Internal and External Conflicts|This study explores the econometric investigation, how social economic conditions, political stability, law and order situation, demographic accountability, the role of military in politics and some other factors affect the external and internal conflicts of the 28 low income countries for the period of 1984 to 2011. International relations among these countries have been analyzed in this study. Feasible Generalized least Square method has been used to explore this panel data analysis. FGLS with cross sectional heteroskedasticity model has been used for all these variables. All the variables are significant. The findings indicate that foreign factors associated with the conflicts are different from the internal factors associated with conflicts. The data has been collected from international country risk guide for the period of 1984 to 2011. The general theory of conflict has also played its role to explain and analyze the findings and results.
F51|Effects of Geopolitical Risks on Trade Flows: Evidence from the Gravity Model|Using a classical gravity model, this paper examines the effects of geopolitical risks on trade flows, from 18 exporter emerging economies into 164 importer countries, for the period of 1985 to 2013. We use the new index of geopolitical risks (GPR index) and to the best of our knowledge, it is the first paper in the literature that considers the new GPR index in a gravity model. The paper implements the fixed-effects (FE), the random-effects (RE), the Hausman-Taylor (HT), and the Poisson Pseudo-maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimations. The findings indicate that geopolitical risks negatively affect the trade flows. The paper also discusses the potential policy implications.
F51|Do Museums Promote Reconciliation? A Field Experiment on Transitional Justice|Can transitional justice museums promote reconciliation after political violence? Existing scholarship suggests that transitional justice policies aid processes of reconciliation and promote tolerance by acknowledging and imparting a shared history of past events. These notions motivate the widespread construction of transitional justice museums. Skeptics, however, caution that such policies can induce a polarizing effect, ingraining societal divisions. This project draws on evidence from a novel field experiment studying the Museum of Memory and Human Rights in Santiago, Chile to answer this question. Our findings suggest that though perceptions of the museum vary along ideological lines, Chilean university students display greater support for democratic institutions, are more likely to reject institutions associated with the repressive period, and are more likely to approve of restorative transitional justice policies after visiting regardless of their ideological priors. These results suggest that memorial museums can support processes of reconciliation by influencing political attitudes of visitors.
F51|Problems of commitment in arming and war: how insecurity and destruction matter|Abstract This paper analyzes a guns-versus-butter model in which two agents compete for control over an insecure portion of their combined output. They can resolve this dispute either peacefully through settlement or by military force through open conflict (war). Both types of conflict resolution depend on the agents’ arming choices, but only war is destructive. We find that, insofar as entering into binding contracts on arms is not possible and agents must arm even under settlement to secure a bigger share of the contested output, the absence of long-term commitments need not be essential in understanding the outbreak of destructive war. Instead, the ability to make short-term commitments could induce war. More generally, our analysis highlights how the pattern of war’s destructive effects, the degree of output insecurity and the initial distribution of resources matter for arming decisions and the choice between peace and war. We also explore the implications of transfers for peace.
F51|Critically important: The heterogeneous effect of politics on trade|The proliferation of international supply chains makes the domestic production of goods increasingly dependent on inputs from foreign sources. By expanding their sourcing portfolio to foreign suppliers, firms and by extension entire economies are more prone to the trade effects of adverse bilateral political shocks. In this paper, we analyze the relation between political relations and trade at lower levels of aggregation, allowing for a heterogeneous effect by types of inputs. We show that a negative shock to political relations has a more pronounced effect on trade of critical goods, conditional on the ease of switching suppliers. We construct a simple model exhibiting input-output linkages to clarify the mechanisms at play, from which we derive testable predictions. Using a new measure for countries' dependence on these critical inputs, we then test the proposed mechanism in a difference-in-differences framework. To address potential endogeneity issues we perform an event study, in which the treatment is an exogenous adverse political shock. Using a new dataset on the status of diplomatic representation and monthly trade data, we exploit the recalling or summoning of the ambassador of a country as a shock to bilateral political relations.
F51|The impacts of domestic political economic structures on sustainable trade agreements between asymmetric countries|This paper examines how the domestic political economic structures influence the bargaining power of small economies facing market dominant large trade partner. Through the analysis of the incentive compatibility conditions of small economies and large economies facing different political stances of domestic interest groups, we demonstrate that when the politically influential interest groups of large economies take the political stance supporting free trade regime, small economies? bargaining power can be improved. This result stems from the reduced equilibrium transfer from small economies to keep the trade equilibrium as a stable equilibrium due to the pro-free trade political pressures imposed by the interest groups of large economies. This result provides good theoretical insights on why most small economies are so eager to keep close connection with the interest groups in large economies
F51|Water Security in Central Asia and the Caucasus – A Key to Peace and Sustainable Development|The dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the emergence of new states in Central Asia and the Caucasus created new political and security dynamics in these sub-regions. While the Caucasus was affected by the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, the threat of conflict over shared water resources continued to exist in Central Asia. More than twenty years later, the protracted conflict in the Caucasus over Nagorno-Karabakh remains unresolved and effectively overshadows water-related problems; yet water is both a very important factor in the conflict, as well as potentially one of the keys for its resolution. In Central Asia the pessimistic scenarios did not unfold; however, the region remains a ‘classic example’ of water-related conflicts in most literature. This paper aims at understanding the root causes of water conflict in Central Asia, and the role of water in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in the Caucasus. It attempts to shed light at the complex nature of water security, and its importance in the states’ security and sustainable development. The paper suggests that given a cross-cutting nature of water resources, there should be a more holistic approach to understanding the drivers of water conflict in both sub-regions, and to finding the ways for its resolution. A number of recommendations have been provided that may be utilized for addressing the complexity of water conflicts and to help in establishing a mutually beneficial cooperation between states.
F51|Strong Growth Amid Increased Negative Risks|The outlook for growth in CESEE remains generally positive, but downside risks have increased significantly since our last forecast. The main areas of concern are the developing US-China trade war and the potential for a renewed outbreak of the eurozone crisis.
F51|The Iranian Economy: Challenges and Opportunities|The Iranian economy has greatly benefited from the lifting of international sanctions in 2016, when the JCPOA nuclear deal came into force. Oil production and exports rebounded strongly, which spilled over into non-oil sectors. However, the economy is yet to return to its 1976 peak in real per capita GDP terms, reflecting numerous challenges over the past four decades, including poor policy choices and the fallout from persistent conflict with the US. This report presents a broad overview of the Iranian economy, and identifies the main challenges to long-run economic development, including in foreign trade and investment, fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policy, and the institutional environment. It concludes that an already difficult situation for Iranian policy-makers will be exacerbated by the US decision to pull out of the JCPOA, and the introduction of new sanctions.
F51|The Proportional Solution in a Permit Sharing Problem|A permit sharing problem is represented by countries, each of whom owns a technology that emits pollutants such as GHGs to produce output and privately owns a certain amount of permits. The permits are treated as the only input and are regarded as perfectly transferable among the countries, unlike regular factor inputs such as labor or capital. First, we axiomatically characterize a series of solutions called the pro- portional solutions. We hypothetically separate countries into two groups, permit contributors and technology contributors, and identify solutions un- der which countries receive rewards systematically according to the two types of contribution they provide (Separation Principle). Two other main axioms (NART and NARP), saying that no group of countries bene t from rearranging their contributions of technologies or permits among themselves, are used in characterizing the proportional solutions. Second, we introduce another axiom called Voluntary Participation to the solutions of sharing the surplus produced beyond the autarky economy output. This addition of Voluntary Participation leads to an interesting result; the surplus must be shared equally between the two groups, the per- mit (input) contributors and technology contributors. Hence the equal share proportional solution is uniquely characterized.
F51|Cheap Talk? Financial Sanctions and Non-Financial Activity|Sanctions restrict cross-border interactions and, therefore, not only put political and economic pressure on the target country, but they also adversely affect the sender country. This paper examines the effect of financial sanctions on the country imposing them. In particular, we analyze the business responses of German non-financial entities to the imposition of sanctions on 23 countries over the period from 1999 through 2014. Examining highly disaggregated, monthly data from the German balance of payments statistics, we find four main results. First, German financial activities with sanctioned countries are sizably reduced after the imposition of sanctions, with strong reductions in the scope of cross-border activities (i.e., the extensive margin) and less robust results for total financial flows which is consistent with the concept of ‘smart sanctions’. Second, firms doing business with sanctioned countries tend to be disproportionately large, making them largely immune to the reduction in business opportunities with selected partners. Third, firms affected by sanctions expand their activities with non-sanctioned countries, some of which display close trade ties to the sanctioned country. Fourth, we find no effect of sanctions on broader measures of firm performance such as employment or total sales. Overall, we conclude that the economic costs of financial sanctions to the sender country are limited.
F51|Freeze! Financial Sanctions and Bank Responses|We study the effects of financial sanctions on cross-border credit supply. Using a differences-in-differences approach to analyze eleven sanctions episodes between 2002 and 2015, we find that banks located in Germany reduce their positions in countries with sanctioned entities by 38%. The average German branch or subsidiary located outside Germany does not adjust its positions after the imposition of sanctions. For affiliated banks located in countries with low financial standards, we even observe a relative increase in credit supply. These effects are stronger if sanctions are only imposed by EU member states and not by the entire UN.

F51|Resolving Sovereign Debt Crises: The Role of Political Risk|Sovereign defaults are bad news for investors and debtor countries, in particular if a default becomes messy and protracted. Why are some debt crises resolved quickly, in a matter of months, while others take many years to settle? This paper studies the duration of sovereign debt crises based on a new dataset and case study archive on debt renegotiations between governments and foreign banks and bondholders. Using Cox proportional hazard models, I find that domestic political instability (‘political risk’) is a significant predictor of negotiation delays, after controlling for macroeconomic conditions. Government crises, resignations, and street protests are particularly disruptive for a quick settlement process. Overall, the evidence suggests that debtor countries often lack the political ability to resolve a debt crisis. Governments in turmoil are unlikely to exit a default quickly.
F51|Sanctioned to Death? The Impact of Economic Sanctions on Life Expectancy and its Gender Gap|In this paper, we empirically analyze the effect of UN and US economic sanctions on life expectancy and its gender gap in target countries. Our sample covers 98 less developed and newly industrialized countries over the period 1977–2012. We employ a matching approach to account for the endogeneity of sanctions. Our results indicate that an average episode of UN sanctions reduces life expectancy by about 1.2–1.4 years. The corresponding decrease of 0.4–0.5 years under an average episode of US sanctions is significantly smaller. These average effects conceal that the damage to life expectancy is accumulating over time; with every additional year under UN (US) sanctions the size of the adverse effect on life expectancy increases by 0.3 (0.2) years. Finally, we find evidence that women are affected more severely by the imposition of sanctions. The fact that sanctions are not “gender-blind” can be interpreted as evidence that sanctions disproportionately affect (the life expectancy of) the more vulnerable members of society.
F51|Can economic sanctions be effective?|While economic sanctions may be attractive policy tools for governments wanting to express discontent with a country's behaviour, it is arguable if from an economic perspective sanctions can achieve the change that is often envisaged through the punitive measures taken. In fact, the literature does not present conclusive evidence that economic sanctions are an effective policy instrument. Nevertheless the number of sanction episodes is on the rise and have increasingly gained in popularity in recent years. What can explain that? This paper will review how sanctions work from an analytical perspective and the challenges countries encounter in applying sanctions as an effective policy tool. In doing so, it reviews more specifically the sanction episodes against the Russian Federation and Iran and without offering any views on the merits and/or legitimacy of the actions taken by any of the parties. It will be argued that economic sanctions generally inflict economic costs to all countries involved in the sanction episodes, including those taking the sanctions, thus shooting themselves in the foot. The country facing the sanctions is likely to develop trade relations with third parties that are not part of the sanction coalition. It is observed that sanctions are mostly taken in complement of diplomatic and other forms of pressure. The type of sanctions is also evolving, with countries increasingly using 'smart' sanctions, targeting financial transactions, business activities and individuals there were it hurts most and limiting their freedom of movement. From an analytical perspective, it is noted that when various measures are put in place, it is hard to assess the extent to which the economic sanctions per se contribute to the eventual outcomes, hence the question of attribution. It is the combination of various interventions that could eventually make the sanction episodes effective, if at all and not the economic sanctions per se. Despite such shortcomings and lack of evidence of their effectiveness, it can safely be said that they are the preferred option compared to military intervention. At the same time, and regrettably, sanctions do not necessarily prevent armed conflict adding to the economic cost the tragic cost of human life.
F51|Benevolent Mediation in the Shadow of Conflict|Before the start of a negotiation, the negotiating parties may try to affect the disagreement outcome of the negotiation by making socially-wasteful investments, such as purchasing weapons or asking for legal opinions. The incentives to make such investments depend on how the negotiation is conducted. We study the problem of a benevolent mediator who wishes to minimize pre-negotiation wasteful investments. Or main result is that the mediator should favor the strongest player, who has the lowest incentive to make wasteful investments. This result is robust to different specifications of the information available to the mediator. We therefore highlight a conflict between fairness and efficiency arising in negotiations.
F51|The context of conflict resolution - international relations and the study of peace and conflict|This paper provides a brief review of almost one century of academic research within the discipline of International Relations with a focus on the thinking about Peace and Conflict and its links to approaches in Conflict Resolution. The framework of analysis is based on the definition of science, what is studied and how it is studied, which delimits the analysis into the four debates in IR: between 1919 and the 1940s, the idealist versus realist debate; in the 1950s and 1960s, the traditionalist versus behaviourist debate; in the 1970s and 1980s, the inter-paradigm debate, and, since the 1990s, the rationalist versus reflectivist debate. This paper identifies how the classical conception of security centred on the state, the military and external threats was broadened by different approaches to include other actors (individuals, groups, societies, civilizations), other sectors (economic, political, social, environmental) and internal threats. In tandem, it maps the epistemological and sometimes ontological challenges to positivism and rationalism found in (Neo) Realism, (Neo) Liberalism and Marxism, by a set of post-positivist and reflective theories or approaches, such as the cases of Human Security, Feminism, Post-structuralism, Constructivism, Post-Colonialism, Critical Studies, and the Copenhagen School. The emergence and development of all these theories and approaches are historically contextualized alongside developments of Conflict Resolution approaches.
F51|Funding for International Affairs Activities, Within and Outside Agenciesâ€™ Base Budgets|The Congress provides the State Department, the Agency for International Development (USAID), and other agencies a â€œbase budgetâ€ each year to fund ongoing activities related to international affairs. The agencies have received other â€œnonbaseâ€ funding in recent years, in the form of supplemental appropriations, emergency appropriations, and funding for overseas contingency operations. In this report, CBO analyzes the recent use of such nonbase appropriations for international affairs activities.
F51|International Agreements, Economic Sovereignty and Exit|"We develop a model in which it is uncertainty about the future domestic policy environment that both makes international cooperation attractive and induces the possibility of a nation reneging on such an international agreement. We show, in a fairly general setting that the possibility of exit reduces the optimal degree of initial cooperation. ""Full"" cooperation will never be optimal, and the optimal degree of cooperation will never be such as to ""squeeze out"" any possibility of exit."
F51|Uncertainty and Hyperinflation: European Inflation Dynamics after World War I|Fiscal deficits, elevated debt-to-GDP ratios, and high inflation rates suggest hyperinflation could have potentially emerged in many European countries after World War I. We demonstrate that economic policy uncertainty was instrumental in pushing a subset of European countries into hyperinflation shortly after the end of the war. Germany, Austria, Poland, and Hungary (GAPH) suffered from frequent uncertainty shocks – and correspondingly high levels of uncertainty – caused by protracted political negotiations over reparations payments, the apportionment of the Austro-Hungarian debt, and border disputes. In contrast, other European countries exhibited lower levels of measured uncertainty between 1919 and 1925, allowing them more capacity with which to implement credible commitments to their fiscal and monetary policies. Impulse response functions show that increased uncertainty caused a rise in inflation contemporaneously and for a few months afterward in GAPH, but this effect was absent or much more limited for the other European countries in our sample. Our results suggest that elevated economic uncertainty directly affected inflation dynamics and the incidence of hyperinflation during the interwar period.

F51|Forecasting social conflicts in Africa using an Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence model|We propose to view social conflicts in Africa as having strong similarities with earthquake occurrences and hence to consider the spatial-temporal Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model. The parameters of this highly parameterized model are estimated through simulated annealing. We consider data for 2012 to 2016 to calibrate the model for four African regions separately, and we consider the data for 2017 to evaluate the forecasts. These forecasts concern the amount of future large events as well as their locations. Examples of our findings are that the model predicts a cluster of large events in the Central Africa region, which was not expected based on past events, and that in particular for East Africa it apparently holds that small conflicts can trigger a larger number of conflicts.
F51|Military economy and military reform in Russia|The number of Russian Armed Forces (RFAF) authorized strength at year-end 2017 increased 17,387 to 1,903,758 on the back of disbandment of the Federal Special Construction Agency (Spetsstroy); therefore, the RFAF’s total authorized strength rose to 1,013,628 from 1 million.[1] That was the first time when data on RFAF’s authorized war strength (1,700,000) were published by mass media, posting a substantial decrease from 5 million reported prior to the military reform of 2008-2012.The Russian Defense Ministry did not publish 2017 year-end service personnel statistics like it did in previous years; therefore, the total accountable strength presumably decreased to 240,000 from previous year’s 270,000 as a result of a 35,000 (13 percent) decline in the number of conscript personnel. Overall, the 2017 total number of conscript personnel inflow stood at 276,000, or 31,000 (10 percent) less than in 2016 .
F51|Conflict Over Transnational River Resources: An Applied Game Theoretic Analysis|"This paper presents a game theoretic model to analyze transnational river resource conflicts such as the Indus River Basin conflict between Pakistan and India. The model demonstrates that to obtain a share of the river resources from the upstream country downstream, the downstream country must purchase costly armaments to threaten an invasion. Yet in this process, the upstream country has a significant first-mover advantage in extracting the river resource as it can internalize the threat of invasion and prevent it from happening in the non-invasion equilibrium ""Peace with Threat of War"". When the upstream country does not internalize the threat of invasion from the downstream country, the invasion equilibrium ""War"" occurs. This paper discusses the implications of each equilibria in the model within the context of the Indus River Basin conflict. This paper also discusses the possibility of Pareto-improving cooperative outcomes by imposing new institutional frameworks."
F51|What Goes Around Comes Around: The Effects of Sanctions on Swedish Firms in the Wake of the Ukraine Crisis|This paper focuses on the effects of sanctions on Swedish firms' sales across markets, as well as sanctions’ effects on their domestic production. As a case study, the paper uses sanctions imposed on Russia and by Russia in 2014. The results suggest that the total costs of these sanctions due to a drop in sales for Swedish firms amounts to around 1 billion SEK in 2013 prices, which implies a rather limited impact on the Swedish economy overall, which amounted to a total of around 4000 billion SEK in 2013. The total impact may be divided into a target effect and a sender effect. The target effect is reflected in a 65% drop in sales of banned products in the Russian market, while the sender effect on exports outside Russia was less important. The ripple effects on other markets of these sanctions were, however, asymmetrical and complex. Sales on the domestic market was on average intact while exports to markets facing the same type of sanctions fell. The most vulnerable firms could face a loss in sales of more than 40\% of their value added, and the most important firm-level mechanism, as to how firms responded in their domestic production, was financial distress. I found, however, an additional mechanism within firms regarding their export response on markets other than Russia, since the negative impact was concentrated on their fringe products, while their core business remained intact after the sanctions were implemented.
F51|「米中関税引上げ」の経済的帰結：シミュレーションモデルを用いた影響試算|2018年に公表・実施される米国及び中国の関税引上げ措置を取り上げ、その中期的な経済的帰結について影響を試算した。試算から得られた含意は以下の通りである。第一に、関税引上げだけの場合は、米国のGDPを0.1％、中国のGDPを0.2％程度押し下げる影響があり、等価変分で評価すると、米国で98億ドル、中国で352億ドルの損失になる。世界経済への影響は軽微ではあるが、貿易転換効果によって第三国に生じる便益の合計は損失を上回らず、世界全体でもマイナスになる。第二に、資本蓄積や技術進歩の影響を勘案した場合は、米国のGDPを1.6％、中国のGDPを2.5％程度押し下げる影響があり、等価変分で評価すると、米国で1,995億ドル、中国で1,871億ドルの損失になる。貿易転換効果とそれに伴う成長効果は第三国にプラスとなるが、世界全体ではやはりマイナスとなる。第三に、産業別生産は、関税引上げによる財間の価格変化差によって生じる比較優位構造の変化に影響される。具体的には、米国でも中国でも、輸送機械や電気機械・一般機械といった技術集約的、資本集約的な業種の縮小が発生し、第三国では、この逆が生じることになる。最後に、中国の対抗措置がもたらす効果について検証したところ、米国経済への悪影響を生じさせるという意味では報復にはなるが、時間経過と共に自国の損失も大きいことが明らかになった。対抗措置は妥当な対応策ではないと示唆される。, This paper aims at evaluating the economic consequences of U.S.-China trade conflict in 2018. The potential impact of proposed tariff increases is calculated by a global CGE model. Capital deepening and technological spillover induced by trade are also considered to explore long-run influence. Following implications are delivered. First, imposed tariffs on goods alone will decline U.S. and China’s GDP by 0.1% and 0.2% respectively. They will also worsen U.S. and China’s equivalent variation by 9.8 billion US dollars and 35.2 billion US dollars respectively. Although the other countries enjoy gains from trade diversion, losses exceeds globally. Second, taking into account the effect from capital deepening and technological spillover induced by trade makes a situation worse. U.S. and China’s GDP will decline by 1.6% and 2.5% respectively. U.S. and China’s equivalent variation will decrease by 199.5 billion US dollars and 187.1 billion US dollars respectively. Trade diversion is not large enough to recover losses in two countries. Third, imposed tariffs will distort relative prices and change the production structure. Concretely, the United States and China will lose their comparative advantage in transport, electronic, and machinery equipment production, while other countries expand them. Finally, China’s retaliatory tariff increases should worsen the U.S. economy to some extent, however, it is indeed achieved at the cost of the Chinese economy. It is not an appropriate policy response in the long run.

The potential impact of the proposed tariff increases is calculated using a global CGE model. Capital deepening and technological spillover induced by trade are also taken into account to explore the long-run influence. We can derive the following implications.First, the additionally imposed tariffs on goods alone declines the GDP in the US and China by 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. The equivalent variation in the US and China is reduced by 9.8 billion and 35.2 billion USD, respectively. Although other countries gain from trade diversion, losses exceed gains globally.Second, considering the effect from capital deepening and technological spillover induced by trade makes the situation worse. The GDP in the US and China declines by 1.6% and 2.5%, respectively. The equivalent variation in the US and China is reduced by 199.5 billion USD and 187.1 billion USD, respectively. Again, the trade diversion is not large enough to recover losses in these countries.Third, the imposed tariffs distort relative prices, resulting in changes to the global production structure. Both the US and China lose their comparative advantage in transport, electronic, and machinery equipment production, while other countries expand their production in these sectors.Finally, China’s retaliatory tariff increases worsens the US economy to some extent, but it comes at a cost to the Chinese economy. In the long run, retaliation is not an appropriate policy response
F51|Determinants and Dynamics of Forced Migration to Europe: Evidence from a 3-D Model of Flows and Stocks|"Violent conflict is a well-recognised driver of forced migration but literature does not usually consider the pull factors that might also cause irregular movements. In turn, the decision to leave and of where to go are rarely considered separately. This is in contrast to literature on regular international migration, which considers both push and pull factors. We contribute to these literatures by studying bilateral forced migration from multiple countries of origin to 28 European countries in the years either side of two ""migration crises"" – the wars in the Balkans and the Arab Spring. We pay attention to dynamics by analysing lagged flows and stocks of forced migrants and modelling their spatial distribution. We find that these partial adjustment and network effects are key pull factors, with employment rate in the destination country the only significant economic variable. In addition, we demonstrate that it is episodes of escalating conflict, rather than accumulated violence, that drives decisions to leave. Out-of-sample predictions indicate that if conflict in origin countries were to cease, forced migration would continue, albeit at a significantly reduced rate. Our findings suggest that past patterns of forced migration help shape future flows, that forced migration flows cannot easily be stopped by destination country policies, and that preventing conflict escalation is important for preventing forced migration."
F51|The Economics of Peace and War: An Overview|Violence and conflicts have caused suffering throughout history. Moreover, the arrival of nuclear weapons even raised concerns about the survival of humankind. This special issue analyzes the causes and consequences of violence and conflict. It covers wars, civil wars, and terrorism, as well as organization of the military and its effects on the rest of the society.
F51|Sanctions and the shadow economy: empirical evidence from Iranian provinces| Using Iranian province level data from 2001 to 2013, this study finds that the international sanctions of 2012/2013 had a significantly stronger negative impact on the growth rate of the shadow economy than they did on the official GDP growth rate. Thus, the international sanctions on Iran have damaged the informal economy even more than the formal economy.
F51|Security, Trade, and Political Violence|To address security concerns, governments often implement trade barriers and re- strictions on the movement of goods and people. These restrictions have negative economic consequences, possibly increasing the supply of political violence. To test this hypothesis, we exploit the restrictions imposed by Israel on imports to the West Bank as a quasi-experiment. In 2008 Israel started enforcing severe restric- tions on the import of selected dual-use goods and materials, de facto banning a number of production inputs from entering the West Bank. We show that after 2008 (i) output and wages decrease in those manufacturing sectors that use those materials more intensively as production inputs, (ii) wages decrease in those local- ities where employment is more concentrated in these sectors, and (iii) episodes of political violence are more likely to occur in these localities. Our calculations suggest these effects account for 18% of the violent political events that occurred in the West Bank from 2008 to 2014.
F51|Political settlements with jihadists in Algeria and the Sahel|Military operations have not prevented the spread of jihadist insurgency in the Sahel, particularly in Mali. While some Sahelian elites favour dialogue with jihadists, hoping to negotiate political settlements that reduce or end violence, past political settlements have sometimes set the stage for future conflict. This paper analyses past settlements with jihadists in Algeria and the Sahel, distinguishing between “stabilising settlements” that remove fighters from the battlefield versus “delaying settlements” that allow jihadists to accumulate resources and recruits. Even stabilising settlements carry downsides, particularly when they push jihadists into neighbouring states. The paper also analyses recent efforts in Mali to conduct dialogue with two leading jihadists, Iyad ag Ghali and Amadou Kouffa. The paper assesses that these efforts have faltered due to logistical problems and the state’s ambivalence, rather than due to ideological factors. Although renewed dialogue is more likely to fail than succeed, the paper recommends making further attempts.
F51|Stock market reactions to conflict diamond trading restrictions and controversies|This article explores market reactions to regulations that addressed the link between armed conflict and the diamond industry. The results show that several regulatory actions taken by the United Nations and the United States in the early 2000s corresponded with lower stock returns for diamond mining companies. Such effects are inconsistent with predictions made by some critics of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. On the other hand, stock returns for jewelry companies were abnormally negative for events that hurt the reputation of conflict-free production and trade regimes. The expansion of legal diamond markets also coincided with abnormally positive returns for jewelry companies, while new restrictions on market access coincided with abnormally negative returns. The results suggest that i) diamond trade regulations affected businesses in important and measurable ways, and ii) that similar regulations may have broader applicability in related industries.
F51|Stock market reactions to conflict diamond trading restrictions and controversies|In this paper, I explore the reactions of financial market participants to news relating to the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS), a body that regulates aspects of global diamond production and trade. I use an event study approach with data on the returns for shares of leading global mining and jewelry retail companies over the period from 1999 to 2011. I show that the most influential dates related to the KPCS for diamond mining companies were associated with regulatory actions in the early 2000s taken by the United Nations and the United States. These events were associated with lower returns for diamond mining companies. After 2004, jewelry companies experienced abnormal returns coinciding with KPCS-related events, while mining firms appear rarely affected by events during this time. The majority of returns for jewelry companies were negative for events which called into question the ability of the KPCS to ensure conflict-free diamond production and trade. Expanded legal diamond production in some cases coincided with positive returns for jewelry retail companies over the time period I consider. These results are consistent with the expectation that jewelry companies, which often market directly to consumers, are more sensitive to public perception concerning the KPCS and its credibility. The results are inconsistent with the point of view that the creation of the KPCS was seen by financial market participants as “good news” overall for diamond mining companies. The results also suggest that once trade restrictions were in place, mining companies were less affected by controversies surrounding the credibility of the KPCS.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F51|Between the hammer and the anvil: The impact of economic sanctions and oil prices on Russia’s ruble|Exchange rate fluctuations strongly affect the Russian economy, given its heavy dependence on foreign trade and investment. In the aftermath of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine that broke out early 2014, the Russian ruble lost 50% of its value against the US dollar. The impact of the conflict on Russia may have been amplified by sanctions imposed by Western countries. However, as Russia is heavily dependent on natural resource exports, another factor behind the deterioration could be the sharp decline in oil prices starting in summer 2014. Using high-frequency data on nominal exchange and interest rates, oil prices, actual and unanticipated sanctions, we provide evidence on forces underlying the ruble exchange rate. The analysis is based on cointegrated VAR models, where fundamental long-run relationships are implicitly embedded. The results indicate that the bulk of the depreciation can be related to the decline of oil prices. In addition, unanticipated sanctions matter for the conditional volatility of the variables involved.
F51|Why Do Trade Negotiations Take So Long?|The Doha multilateral round of trade negotiations sponsored by the WTO has been dragging on for over a decade, with no end in sight. In this short paper we assess empirically what determines the duration of trade negotiations, focusing on the span between the start of trade talks and their conclusion. We use data from 88 regional trade agreements between 1988 and 2009, and a semi-parametric Cox proportional hazards model. Four factors are robust determinants of the length of RTA negotiations. Negotiations are more protracted when there are more countries at the negotiation table, and when the countries are not from the same region. Negotiations between more open and richer countries also finish more quickly.

They provide a multi-disciplinary assessment, combining the views of high-ranking central bankers, policymakers, commercial bankers and academics, and demonstrate that a broad view of European economic integration is crucial given that spillovers and contagion were major issues of the recent economic crisis.

F51|Challenges Facing Tehran|"There is no doubt that the Iranian leaders are feeling the heat on all fronts. On the nuclear front the negotiations have practically stagnated, which can be translated to no sanctions lifting and hence no relief for the severely ailing economy. On the Syrian front Tehran and Hezbollah of Lebanon are the only solo ideological defenders of the falling Assad regime and just recently commended their ""axis of resistance"" with Syria. Upon his fall, Iran will lose a very important regional stronghold. On the economic side Western sanctions have been very damaging. They seem to have worked more effectively than they were expected due to significant economic mismanagement of the government. On the internal affairs front the increasing differences between the Supreme Leader camp and the Ahmadinejad camp have prevented the regime to adopt a unified stance against the ongoing international pressures. The Supreme Leader has practically eliminated the Ahmadinejad team from being in control of sensitive affairs such security and international matters."
F51|What Do Trade Negotiators Negotiate About? Empirical Evidence from the World Trade Organization| According to the terms-of-trade theory, governments use trade agreements to escape from a terms-of-trade-driven prisoner's dilemma. We use the terms-of-trade theory to develop a relationship that predicts negotiated tariff levels on the basis of pre-negotiation data: tariffs, import volumes and prices, and trade elasticities. We then confront this predicted relationship with data on the outcomes of tariff negotiations associated with the accession of new members to the World Trade Organization. We find strong and robust support for the central predictions of the terms-of-trade theory in the observed pattern of negotiated tariff cuts. (JEL F11, F13)
F51|Why did the League of Nations fail?|Why did the League of Nations ultimately fail to achieve widespread disarmament, its most fundamental goal? This article shows that the failure of the League of Nations had two important dimensions: (1) the failure to provide adequate security guarantees for its members (like an alliance); (2) the failure of this organization to achieve the disarmament goals it set out in the 1920s and 1930s. Thus, it was doomed from the outset to fail, due to built-in institutional contradictions. It can also be modeled and analyzed as a potential military alliance. The results are fairly conclusive: The League of Nations did not function as a pure public-good alliance, which encouraged an arms race in the 1930s.
F51|The Importance of Oil on the International Market|"The purpose of this paper is to emphasize the importance of oil on the international market, its role and influence on the world economy. If oil had a remarkable continuity of its use in history, we see that today all modern industry depends on this ""black gold"", as it is rightly named. Hydrocarbons in the form of oil and its derivatives have become the main source of energy for most of the countries. It is a product that cannot be ignored neither in politics, nor in industry or economy. We can say that it is the product with the strongest influence in these sectors."
F51|The economic effects of a Spanish trade boycott against Catalan products|"We study the potential consequences of a hypothetical trade boycott against Catalan products organized by some sectors of the Spanish society mainly for political reasons. A symmetric trade boycott would have two effects: a reduction of Catalan exports to Spain and a partial process of import substitution in Catalonia. In order to quantify the economic impact of the boycott, we compare the ""actual"" Catalan economy, as described in the input-output table for 2005, with a ""simulated"" Catalan economy that takes into account the effects of a boycott on the trade exchanges between Catalonia and Spain."
F51|Investment Options And Bargaining Power: The Eurasian Supply Chain For Natural Gas|We use cooperative game theory to analyze how the architecture of the pipeline network determines the power structure in the supply chain for Russian gas. If the assessment is narrowly focused on the abilities to obstruct flows in the existing system, the main transit countries, Belarus and Ukraine, appear to be strong. If investment options are accounted for, however, Russia achieves clear dominance. We show that options to bypass one of the transit countries are of little strategic importance compared to Russia's direct access to its customers through the Baltic Sea. Comparing the results of our calibrated model with empirical evidence obtained from transit and import agreements we find that the Shapley value explains the power of major transit countries better than the core and the nucleolus.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F51|China’s Macroeconomic Imbalances: Causes and Consequences|In recent years China has experienced two forms of extreme macroeconomic imbalance: an expenditure imbalance in the sense of very high investment and very low consumption, giving rise to rapid capital accumulation; and an imbalance between expenditure and pro-duction, producing external imbalance, i.e. a huge surplus on the current account of the balance of payments. Both imbalances imply a low rate of time discount by both govern-ment and society: consumption in the present is forgone in favour of consumption in the future. The paper examines how these imbalances came about, and goes on to consider whether they can be sustained and how they might be redressed. There is no evidence that the rapid capital accumulation has reduced the rate of profit on capital and thus the incen-tive to invest. However, persistent external imbalance poses a threat to investment if it ge-nerates excess liquidity and asset bubbles. The current account surplus rose remarkably in the years 2004-7. This was associated with exogenous increases in competiveness and in saving, both attributable to the economic reform policies. On current policies, the surplus is likely to rise again once the world economy recovers from its recession. This poses three sorts of problems, each of which is examined in turn: difficulties for macroeconomic stabi-lization policies; risk of capital loss on the foreign exchange holdings; and the threat of re-taliation by China's trading partners. A combination of internal and external policies will be required to redress the imbalance. Keywords: China; investment; consumption; current account; exchange rate; external im-balance; macroeconomic imbalance.

F51|Defensive weapons and star wars: a supergame with optimal punishments| We model the perspective faced by nuclear powers involved in a supergame where nuclear deterrence is used to stabilise peace. This setting allows us to investigate the bearings of defensive weapons on the effectiveness of deterrence and peace stability, relying on one-shot optimal punishments. We find that the sustainability of peace is unaffected by defensive shields if the latter are symmetric across countries, while asymmetric endowments of such weapons have clear-cut destabilising consequences.

F51|Paying a visit: The Dalai Lama effect on international trade|Is political compliance a precondition for healthy trade relations with China? The Chinese government frequently threatens that meetings between its trading partners' officials and the Dalai Lama will be met with animosity and ultimately harm trade ties. We run a gravity model of exports to China from 159 partner countries between 1991 and 2008 to test the extent to which bilateral tensions affect trade with autocratic China. In particular, we empirically investigate whether countries that receive the Dalai Lama despite China's opposition experience a significant reduction in their exports to China. In order to account for the potential endogeneity of meetings with the Dalai Lama, the number of Tibet Support Groups and the travel pattern of the Tibetan leader are used as instruments. Our empirical results support the idea that countries officially receiving the Dalai Lama at the highest political level are punished through a reduction of their exports to China. However, this ‘Dalai Lama Effect’ is only observed for the Hu Jintao era and not for earlier periods. Furthermore, we find that this effect is mainly driven by reduced exports of machinery and transport equipment and that it disappears in the second year after a meeting took place.
F51|Does Trade Integration Contribute to Peace?|This paper investigates the effect of trade integration on military conflict. Our empirical analysis,based on a large panel data set of 290,040 country-pair observations from 1950 to 2000, confirms that an increase in bilateral trade interdependence and global trade openness significantly promotes peace. It also suggests that the effect of trade openness varies depending on the geographical proximity of countries. The peace-promotion effect of bilateral trade integration is significantly higher for contiguous countries that are likely to experience more conflicts. The analysis shows, however, that an increase in global trade openness reduces the probability of conflict more for countries far apart from each other than it does for countries sharing borders. The results also show that military conflict between countries significantly reduces not only bilateral trade interdependence but also multilateral trade integration. The main finding of the peace-promotion effect of bilateral and global trade integration holds robust when controlling for the natural and geopolitical characteristics of dyads of states that may influence the probability of military conflict and for the simultaneous determination of trade and peace.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F51|Financial versus Monetary Mercantilism: Long‐run View of Large International Reserves Hoarding|The sizeable hoarding of international reserves by several East Asian countries has been frequently attributed to a modern version of monetary mercantilism – hoarding international reserves in order to improve competitiveness. From a long‐run perspective, manufacturing exporters in East Asia adopted ‘financial’ mercantilism – subsidising the cost of capital – during decades of high growth. They switched to hoarding large international reserves when growth faltered, making it harder to disentangle the monetary mercantilism from the precautionary response to the heritage of past financial mercantilism. Monetary mercantilism also lowers the cost of hoarding, but may be associated with negative externalities leading to competitive hoarding. From this viewpoint, this paper makes three observations on the East Asian reserve accumulation. First, the recent large hoarding of reserves in Japan and Korea occurred in the aftermath of the growth strategy that combined export promotion and credit subsidisation (financial mercantilism). Second, whether the ultimate motive is mercantilist or precautionary, the ongoing reserve hoarding in Asia contains an element of competitive hoarding, which is likely to have negative externalities among countries involved. Finally, China's hoarding of reserves partly reflects the precaution against the financial fragility that is likely to follow the slowing of economic growth.

Using extreme bound analysis, the three most comprehensive terrorism datasets, and focusing on the three most commonly analyzed aspects of terrorist activity, i.e., location, victim, and perpetrator, we re-assess the effect of 65 proposed correlates. Evaluating around 13.4 million regressions, we find 18 variables to be robustly associated with the number of incidents occurring in a given country-year, 15 variables with attacks against citizens from a particular country in a given year, and six variables with attacks perpetrated by citizens of a particular country in a given year.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F51|Intercultural negotiations|Negotiation skill improvement is more and more regarded as the development of the management activity. An impressive argument for those skills meant to ensure an efficient negotiation is the fact that they lead to better cooperation among colleagues, subordinates, superiors and business people inside and outside companies. In addition, these skills can help someone be seen as an arbiter, a person who is capable of finding solutions to current problems arbitrarily, but still oriented towards result. Negotiation is often inefficient, despite its importance for management, but this happens because little attention is paid to the negotiation techniques based on empathy. Intercultural negotiation refers to observing business ethics – the moral principles and codes of conduct governing the relations among people within organizations. Certain cultural characteristics of different countries have been established as a result of intercultural research.
F51|Kosten und Konsequenzen des Krieges in Libyen|In diesem Artikel befassen wir uns mit zwei Aspekten des Libyenkrieges. Zunächst zeigen wir, dass die Unruhen in der arabischen Welt Auswirkungen auf den von den libyschen Rebellen geforderten Demokratisierungsprozess zu haben scheinen. Daneben können wir feststellen, dass auch Nachbarstaaten Libyens ebenfalls stark von der gegenwärtigen Situation betroffen sein können. Um die Folgen der gegenwärtigen Umbrüche auch quantitativ erfassen zu konnen, haben wir ein Modell entwickelt, das Aussagen darüber erlaubt, in welchem Maße die Demokratisierung in einem Land die Wahrscheinlichkeit erhöht, dass es auch in anderen Landern der Region zu Demokratisierungsprozessen kommt. Demzufolge ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit einer Demokratisierung in Nachbarländern wie Algerien und dem nördlichen Sudan infolge der Vorgänge in Libyen und anderswo eindeutig höher als zuvor. In einer zweiten Analyse setzen wir uns mit den möglichen Kosten des gewaltsamen Konflikts in Libyen auseinander. Demnach dürfte die libysche Wirtschaft auch bei einem nur kurzen Bürgerkrieg deutlich schrumpfen. Ein lang andauernder Krieg wäre jedoch noch weitaus schlimmer und könnte das libysche Bruttoinlandsprodukt um rund ein Fünftel sinken lassen. Gleichzeitig scheinen einige europäische und nordamerikanische Länder von einer Militärintervention in Libyen ökonomisch zumindest kurzfristig profitieren zu können.
F51|Krieg, Frieden und Entwicklung - und die Lehren für Afghanistan|"Afghanistan, Somalia und die Demokratische Republik Kongo sind Beispiele für Entwicklungsländer, die unter den Folgen von Krieg, Armut und instabilen demokratischen Strukturen leiden. Diese Länder sehen sich in Sicherheitsfragen einer sehr schwierigen Herausforderung gegenüber und brauchen internationale Unterstützung beim Wiederaufbauprozess. Derartige Prozesse können nur dann gelingen, wenn sie Hand in Hand gehen mit politischer Mitbestimmung. Nur so können sich eine verbesserte Sicherheitslage, eine wirtschaftliche Entwicklung auf breiter Basis sowie dies unterstützende politische Institutionen gegenseitig befruchten und verstärken. Es wird besondere auf fünf Lehren hingewiesen, die helfen können, gewaltsamen Konflikt nachhaltig zu überwinden. Wenn die Geberländer bzw. -institutionen sowie die betreffenden Staaten gleich zu Beginn des Wiederaufbauprozesses die richtigen Prioritäten setzen und diese Politik weiterhin beibehalten, dann ist ein Entkommen aus der ""Konfliktfalle"" möglich. Wenn diese Zusammenhänge jedoch vernachlässigt werden, schließt sich die Falle. In Afghanistan könnte es zu spät sein, die gegenwärtigen wirtschaftlichen, militärischen und politischen Maßnahmen erfolgreich anzupassen. Der Westen wird wahrscheinlich alternative Modelle für sein militärisches und wirtschaftliches Engagement in Afghanistan finden müssen."
F51|Beyond the Overall Economic Downturn: Evidence on Sector-Specific Effects of Violent Conflict from Indonesia|This paper analyses the impact of violent conflict on economic growth using micro-level data from Indonesia. We compile a panel dataset at district level for the period 2002-2008, and disentangle the overall negative economic effect of violent conflict into its sectoral components. Our results reveal substantial differences across sectors, with the most detrimental impact evident in manufacturing industries and the service sectors. Further, the short-run impacts on growth appear to be only temporal, and some evidence for the 'phoenix effect' in the early post-conflict period is found. The construction sector, in particular, recovers soon once conflict ends, while manufacturing industries and the finance sector appear especially reliant on a lasting peace. A series of alternative specifications confirm the main findings of the analysis.
F51|The United States and the PRC : Macroeconomic Imbalances and Economic Diplomacy|This paper explores the ways in which macroeconomic imbalances have driven policy discussions between the United States (US) and Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (PRC) in the last decade. The PRCâ€™s current account surplus, its growing foreign exchange reserves, and its shifting policies on exchange rate adjustment have become a central preoccupation of US trade policy. The paper considers the evolving political economy of the US policy stance and of the PRCâ€™s response; it assesses the opportunity costs of an approach that has sometimes focused on the exchange rate to the exclusion of other issues; and it explores the ramifications for economic governance in the short- and medium-run. The paper finds that there has been ample mutual misunderstanding between the US and the PRC in their economic arguments; that the momentous debates have the potential to severely impair the institutions of global economic governance; and that there is likely to be an important race between economic and demographic forces that will naturally redress the imbalances and the political imperatives for each country to stand tough and fight.

F51|Foreign influence and welfare|How do foreign interests influence policy? How are trade policies and the viability of trade agreements affected? What are the welfare implications of such foreign influence? In this paper we develop a model of foreign influence and apply it to the study of optimal tariffs. In a two-country voting model of electoral competition, we allow the incumbent party in each country to take costly actions that probabilistically affect the electoral outcome in the other country. We show that policies end up maximizing a weighted sum of domestic and foreign welfare. Using this formulation we show that foreign influence increases aggregate world welfare when there are no other means of alleviating the externalities that arise from cross-border effects of policies. In contrast, when countries can engage in international agreements, foreign influence can prove harmful as powerful countries may refuse to offer concessions. We also show that power imbalances are particularly detrimental to cooperation when they are positively correlated with economic size.
F51|Role thinking: Standing in other people's shoes to forecast decisions in conflicts|"When forecasting decisions in conflict situations, experts are often advised to figuratively stand in the other person's shoes. We refer to this as ""role thinking"", because, in practice, the advice is to think about how other protagonists will view the situation in order to predict their decisions. We tested the effect of role thinking on forecast accuracy. We obtained 101 role-thinking forecasts of the decisions that would be made in nine diverse conflicts from 27 Naval postgraduate students (experts) and 107 role-thinking forecasts from 103 second-year organizational behavior students (novices). The accuracy of the novices' forecasts was 33% and that of the experts' was 31%; both were little different from chance (guessing), which was 28%. The small improvement in accuracy from role-thinking strengthens the finding from earlier research that it is not sufficient to think hard about a situation in order to predict the decisions which groups of people will make when they are in conflict. Instead, it is useful to ask groups of role players to simulate the situation. When groups of novice participants adopted the roles of protagonists in the aforementioned nine conflicts and interacted with each other, their group decisions predicted the actual decisions with an accuracy of 60%."

F51|Negotiating constitutions for political unions|This paper provides a cradle-to-grave model of political merger between two states and highlights the role of cross-border disparities in material and technological endowments in state formation. This issue has not received adequate theoretical attention in the existing scholarship that has largely focussed on factors like defence, trade, and public goods provision. In this paper, merger negotiations are modelled using a bilateral bargaining model with inside options and contest as an outside option. It is shown that the threat of contest constrains the set of mutually acceptable taxes and, more importantly, it provides stability to the federal constitution by making the punishment strategy in the secession rule credible. The existence of negotiated and contested constitutional merger agreements that are path dependent but time-consistent is shown. Also, the rent extracted by the advanced province in the union for transferring technology to the backward province is shown to be increasing in the complexity of technology but bounded from above. Finally, the impact of demographic heterogeneity on the feasibility of inter-state mergers is discussed.
F51|The Arctic scramble: Introducing claims in a contest model|In this paper I integrate elements from the bankruptcy literature in a resource contest model. In a contest model, agents fight over a contested resource and their investment in 'guns' determines how much of the resource is secured by each agent. In a bankruptcy problem, agents claim a share of a contested resource, and their claims determine the allocation to each agent. The integrated model of this paper allows the combination of guns and claims to jointly determine the distribution of a contested resource. The relevance of such a model is motivated using the Arctic scramble as a leading example. This contest over the Arctic's oil and gas reserves involves the five coastal Arctic countries, each with its own distinct territorial claim. I propose four contest-bankruptcy rules that integrate the most common contest success function with four classical bankruptcy rules. These four rules are assessed and effects of integrating claims and guns in one rule are analysed for a resource contest model.
F51|Regional initiatives and the cost of delaying binding climate change agreements|The Kyoto and Copenhagen Protocols on climate change mitigation postponed the specification of binding commitments to a future negotiation. This paper analyzes the strategic implications of delayed negotiations. While, as is well-understood, the incentive to free ride leads to excessive emissions prior to a binding agreement, the cost of delay is magnified by players' attempt to secure a favorable bargaining position in the future negotiation. A “brinkmanship”, an “effort substitution”, and a “raising rival's cost” effects all concur to generate high post-agreement emissions. The paper applies this general insight to the issuance of forward or bankable permits.
F51|Trust, discrimination and acculturation|Migrations have intensified with the advent of globalisation. Societies once solidly monocultural are becoming increasingly multicultural. It is, however, not clear how social capital would travel across cultural boundaries. A multicultural environment might result on agents preferring to interact with those of their own culture, discriminating against others. We study trust, an aspect of social capital, between domestic Australian students of non-Asian origin and international students of Asian origin. To measure the degree of trust and patterns of discrimination between these groups, the Berg et al. (1995) trust game and a series of control games were used in framework where each participant played each game against several partners knowing their domestic or international status. Controlling for individual heterogeneity, domestic students significantly discriminated against international students in the trust game, and individual discrimination was taste-based rather than based on beliefs towards international students’ trustworthiness. Moreover, the average amount that international students sent in the trust game was negatively related with the number of semesters studied at university in Australia, which may partly reflect cultural adjustment but also institutional disadvantages faced specifically by international students. The study furthers understanding of the patterns of discrimination between domestic and international university students and the nature of this discrimination.
F51|When the Claim Hits: Bilateral Investment Treaties and Bounded Rational Learning|Using the international investment regime as its point of departure, the paper introduces notions of bounded rationality to the study of economic diplomacy. Through a multi-method approach, it shows that developing countries often ignored the risks of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) until they themselves became subject to an investment treaty claim. Thus the behavior of developing country governments with regard to the international investment regime is consistent with that observed for individuals in experiments and field studies: they tend to ignore high-impact, low-probability risks if they cannot bring specific 'vivid' instances to mind.
F51|Rethinking Climate Change Governance and its Relationship to the World Trading System|International climate negotiations have thus far eschewed efforts to incorporate trade restrictions, but they have also failed to achieve their objective of reducing global emissions. Because of this failure, some countries are now inclined to act unilaterally and minilaterally, in many cases by imposing trade restrictions against third parties. Such actions are likely to invite retaliation. They could even ignite an escalating trade war. The best way to avoid such conflicts is not to limit the use of trade restrictions but to make international climate negotiations effective. Ironically, success in addressing climate change multilaterally may require incorporating trade restrictions in a new kind of climate agreement.

F51|How Costly is Modern Maritime Piracy to the International Community?|This paper focuses on the impact of maritime piracy on international trade. Piracy increases the cost of international maritime transport through an increase in insecurity regarding goods deliveries. Bilateral trade flows between the main European and Asian countries over the 1999 to 2008 period are used to estimate an augmented gravity model that includes various measures of piracy acts. We found robust evidence indicating that maritime piracy reduces the volume of trade; the effect of ten additional vessels hijacked being associated to an 11% decrease in exports. Using these results, the international cost of piracy in terms of trade destruction is estimated to be 28 billion dollars. Finally, we compare the cost of low intensity conflict like Somalia, to the cost of a full scale conflict (Afghanistan) and to the cost of an autarkic state (North Korea) for the international community in the year 2008.The results indicate that the cost of war more than doubles the cost of low intensity conflict.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F51|The Price Of Modern Maritime Piracy| A growing body of literature has recently focused on the economic origins and consequences of modern maritime piracy and on the perception that the international community has failed to control it. This paper aims to investigate maritime transport costs as one of the channels through which modern maritime piracy could have a major impact on the global economy. A transport-cost equation is estimated using a newly released data-set on maritime transport costs from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development together with data on maritime piracy from the International Maritime Bureau. Our results show that maritime piracy significantly increases trade costs between Europe and Asia.
F51|Geopolitics, Global Patterns of Oil Trade, and China¡¦s Oil Security Quest|"Does China's quest for oil raise tensions with the United States? This paper examines the effect of international relations on global oil trade patterns. Using voting records for the United Nations General Assembly to measure the state of international relations, we estimate a modified gravity model in a panel data framework over the period 1962-2000. Our presumption is that a divergence in voting patterns reflects misalignment in political interests among pairs of states, and hence an increase in ""political distance."" Controlling for oil exporters' endowment, potential supply disruption due to civil conflict, other standard gravity controls, as well as exporter and year fixed effects, we first show that private energy companies based in the United States import significantly less crude oil from US political opponents. The result is robust to controlling for economic sanctions and militarized interstate disputes, suggesting that the political oil import diversification is more than a wartime phenomenon. A similar oil import pattern is observed in China, in which case only a few national oil companies control the oil sector. While the incentives to diversify are stronger for both the United States and China when the exporters are nondemocratic, import sanctions have opposite effects on oil imports into the United States and China. Finally, we document that there is no such oil import pattern in other non-major power oil importing countries."
F51|Economic Sanctions And The Source Country: How Economic Sanctions Imposed On China Affect The U.S|We perform an event study to assess one potential effect of economic sanctions on source countries. Specifically, for publicly-traded firms in the U.S. that report China as a geographic segment, we examine the stock price reaction to the Tiananmen Square Massacre, which occurred on June 4, 1989. Such firms experienced an economically- and statistically-significant negative market reaction to the Massacre. This finding suggests that the event increased the probability of economic sanctions against China, and that this increased probability adversely impacted at least one segment of the source-countryâ€™s population. Prior studies have examined the adverse effects to the target country (e.g., China), but have not been able to document systematic evidence of the effects to the source country (e.g., U.S.).
F51|Welfare Assessment of SPS Standards: An Empirical Study of Indo-US Mango Trade Dispute|As trade quotas have been eliminated under GATT and tariffs have been rationalized under WTO; the focal point of disputes and negotiations in international trade has shifted to non-tariff barriers (NTBs), particularly Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) standards. However, in the absence of any past experience and concrete scientific or empirical evidence, standards are usually kept at prohibitively high levels, thereby inducing sub-optimal outcomes. One such case is the mango trade dispute between India and USA. India ranks first in mango production worldwide, supplying about 40 per cent of world mangoes; whereas, USA is world’s biggest mango importer accounting for 32.7% of the total imports worldwide during 2003-05. However, USA imposed a ban on import of Indian mangoes between 1989 and 2006 due to high pesticide levels and incidence of pests. The US permitted import of mangoes from India in 2006 under high standards and strict inspection norms. This study examines the impact of various standard regimes on the two trading partners and explores if the benefit from a higher standard regime is worth the marginal effort. As the importing nation, US has four policy options – 1) a complete ban on mango trade, which was in application between 1989 and 2006; 2) Hot Water Treatment (HWT), the policy advocated by India; 3) nuclear irradiation, the policy favored by US and presently in force, and; 4) free trade, policy regime with no SPS standards in place. Welfare impact of mango trade on both, India and US, under all four different policy regimes is estimated using partial equilibrium framework with stylized microeconomic models for different components. The results suggest that policy choices of both the nations are consistent with their respective payoff estimates. However, if India undertakes to compensate the US for any losses from a policy change in favor of India, both the nations may reach a Kaldor-Hicks efficient outcome. A brief sensitivity analysis is performed, indicating that the developed north can afford to be more flexible in adopting SPS standards. This study also underscores that the impact of risks arising out of invasive species cannot be studied in terms of science alone but it has to be wedded to the economic implications.

F51|Delivering on US Climate Finance Commitments|At the United Nations climate change conference in Copenhagen in 2009 and Cancun in 2010, the United States joined other developed countries in pledging to mobilize $100 billion in public and private sector funding to help developing countries reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to a warmer world. With a challenging US fiscal outlook and the failure of cap-and-trade legislation in the US Congress, America's ability to meet this pledge is increasingly in doubt. This paper identifies, quantifies, and assesses the politics of a range of potential US sources of climate finance. It finds that raising new public funds for climate finance will be extremely challenging in the current fiscal environment and that many of the politically attractive alternatives are not realistically available absent a domestic cap-and-trade program or other regime for pricing carbon. Washington's best hope is to use limited public funds to leverage private sector investment through bilateral credit agencies and multilateral development banks.
F51|Global Macroeconomic and Financial Supervision: Where Next?|"The overriding practical problem now is the tension between the global financial and market system and the national political and power structures. The main analytical short-coming lies in the failure to incorporate financial frictions, especially default, into our macro-economic models. Neither a move to a global sovereign authority, nor a reversion towards narrower economic nationalism, seems likely to take place in the near future. Meanwhile, the adjustment to economic imbalances remains asymmetric, with almost all the pressure on deficit countries. Almost by definition surplus countries are ""virtuous"". But current account surpluses have to be matched by net capital outflows. Such capital flows to weaker deficit countries have often had unattractive returns. A program to give earlier and greater warnings of the risks of investing in deficit countries could lead to earlier policy reaction, and reduce the risk of crisis."
F51|The Political Changes in the Arabian Countries as Challenge for the Foreign Policy of the European Union (The Integration of Palestine and Lebanon as an Aberrant Move for Retaining the European Influence in the Region)|The control over the Middle East is important for European Union. The political turmoil at the beginning of 2011 there could put this control under question. There are expectations for a development in direction liberal democracy. There is also readiness to support this development, even with military force. After the long-standing support for the authoritarian governments there this approach seems suspicious. It is possible to be established in the region not liberal, but conservative (Muslim?) democracies, which might be hostile to the Western values. One is sure, that we witness considerable changes of the political systems in the Arabian countries. In this critical moment the European Union can master the process by an aberrant motion – through offering full membership to Palestine and Lebanon as a means for solving the Middle East conflict and henceforth for restoring the European prestige and control over the region.
F51|Contagiuni, dar şi oportunităţi ratate – efecte economice ale „Primăverii Musulmane”|This article outlines those economic losses and attempts to impress upon the reader the potential for further disruptions at a regional level. There is a wasted economic potential in the youthful and increasingly well educated populations of Muslim countries, confined to poverty and handouts from economic rents of natural resources controlled by a small class of political insiders.
F51|Jocul ciclic – Statele Unite ale Americii versus Coreea de Nord din unghiul teoriei mutărilor strategice|It is found that the “Theory of Moves” is adequate in a Cold War scenario, with functionally equal participants, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis. The destabilization of normal incentive systems, under power and information asymmetry, is what prevents an equilibrium from being reached, as one side (North Korea) overleverages its position, while the other side makes unproductive compromises.
F51|International Trade Crisis|This article captures a brief history of the negotiations of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), analyzes its deadlock and offers some suggestions for a successful Doha deal. First, this study shows that the nearly decade-long negotiation stalemate is caused by the opposite perceptions between industrialized countries and developing ones on agriculture, as well as by the influences of economic crisis on the world trade. Subsequently, some proposals are presented to solve the current crisis from the international trade, starting especially with the goodwill of the WTO members, as well as the countries with observer status within the institution. The main conclusion is that the US must exercise a leadership position in completing the Doha Round and the developing countries must embrace the open trade with a positive attitude beyond DDA.

F51|Comparative Analysis of Romanian and German Negotiation Style Based on Cultural Differences|As a result of intensified international business relations and a unified European space the cultural background of economic agents in the field of international business is getting an increasing importance and leaves to a certain extent its marks on business behaviour of these individuals. Thus from the sixties of the past century onwards the problem of cultural differences and their influence upon professional relations lie in the centre of attention of several researchers like E.T. Hall, Geert Hofstede and others. In business negotiations one may observe a double conditioning of people’s negotiation style, at one hand it is the result of individual characteristics like personality, education, experience, personal charisma, but on the other hand there is a strong impact of collective factors, too such as the mental programming of each nation known under the name of culture. In the following study we undertake a comparative/contrastive analysis of German and Romanian – culturally conditioned – negotiation style hoping to avoid at the same time to fall into the trap of stereotypy.
F51|Runda Doha: început fără sfârşit<BR>[Doha Round: the endless beginning]|This paper aims to research existing literature on the collapse of the Doha Round and its causes. The first part is a review of significant paper in the vast literature on the history of international trade from the end of the Second World War until the present, focusing especially, on the beginning of the Doha Ministerial Conference as part of World Trade Organization, but also, the results of the negotiations that followed it. The second part illustrated, briefly, some of the causes that led to this impasse, along with the diametrically opposed perceptions of developed countries and developing ones. The main conclusion is that although it would complete the negotiations within the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), on the contrary, the round is underway and can’t be set a fixed date for completing it. The methology used is based on reasoning deductive.
F51|Defense Expenditure and Economic Growth under External Predation|This paper develops a growth model of a country under a Hobbesian environment with international conflicts where national defense is the only way to prevent external predation. The long run growth path is determined by the equilibrium of a dynamic game with three players, the external predator, the government and the family. The equilibrium growth path has three phases, submissive equilibrium, tolerant equilibrium and full-protected equilibrium. Different defense strategies result in different growth prospects and sustainable growth will endogenously induce adjustment of defense strategies.
F51|A game theoretical analysis of economic sanction|Economic sanction has been widely used and increasingly a popular tool in maintaining peace and political stability in the world. The use of economic sanction, as opposed to the use of military power, to punish target countries have been supported by the Charter of United Nations (UN). Tsebelis (1990) modelled economic sanctions using game theory and found that any attempt to increase the severity of the sanctions was counterintuitive, namely the policy reduced the likelihood of sender country(s) in enforcing economic sanction, however, it did not change the probability of the target country(s) in violating international agreement/law. This paper focuses on the refinement of the sanction game proposed by Tsebelis (1990) to analyse international relations. Recent findings from various studies on the effectiveness of economic sanction have been used to reconstruct the game. In contrast to Tsebelis’(1990) findings, any attempt to increase the severity of economic sanction may reduce the probability of the target country(s) in violating international agreement/law. A similar result was obtained in the case for which the sender country(s) applies any policy in preventing violation of international agreement/law by providing aids, assistances, and incentives to the target country.
F51|The impact of employment in Israel on the Palestinian labor force (2005–08)|This study provides circumstantial evidence for the impact of permits for employment in Israel on the Palestinian labor force in the West Bank during the late Intifada period and its aftermath (2005–2008). The study utilizes a unique dataset that merges data from the Palestinian Labor Force Survey with Israeli administrative data on permits for employment in Israel. The study quantifies the increase in Palestinian employment in the Israeli and Palestinian economies and the decrease in Palestinian unemployment, as well as the drop in the return to schooling which coincided with an increase in the number of permits issued. These results reflect the short-run benefits for the un-skilled Palestinian labor force as well as the adverse long-run effects of Palestinian employment in Israel on human capital accumulation.
F51|Using a harmonized carbon price framework to finance the Green Climate Fund|Funding a response to climate change after Kyoto will require another look at both burden sharing and funding mechanisms. After reviewing the risks of cap-and-trade with carbon offsets and the advantages of a harmonized carbon tax, a method is proposed to utilize a harmonized carbon price to finance the Green Climate Fund. A common carbon price is set across all nations with either a carbon tax or an emissions trading floor price with carbon offsets excluded. The harmonized carbon price is incrementally increased until 2050 to reach the cost of atmospheric removal and achieve equilibrium. Carbon revenues collected internally within nations are used for internal investments in climate change. Financing for the Green Climate Fund is generated from transferring a percentage of the collected revenues, based on a sliding window of historical responsibility for fossil fuel emissions and national wealth. Collected revenue is disbursed for climate aid based on a set of national climate need factors for adaptation and mitigation, including preserving strategic carbon absorbers, low-carbon infrastructures, technology transfer and population management. In the interest of distributive justice, nations themselves determine the need factors of each other. Unlike cap-and-trade, this method does not explicitly set emissions caps, but total global emissions can be regulated nevertheless. Formulas are presented for collection and disbursement, which require parameters for a globally harmonized carbon price, a climate fund contribution rate, historical responsibility from fossil fuel emissions, a national wealth threshold for fund contributions and need factors for each nation. Published economic and emissions data are used with the formulas to demonstrate an example of how the financing can work. This presents an equitable way to address climate needs across all nations on both a global and regional level.
F51|Education and armed conflict: the Kashmir insurgency in the nineties|The experience of the Kashmir insurgency is used, to assess the impact of this armed conflict on educational outcomes of girls and boys who were of school age during the 90's. Girls and boys who went to primary and secondary schools in urban areas of Kashmir during 1990 and 1996 are affected the most by the insurgency. I compare their outcomes to women and men who finished their schooling before 1990 and girls and boys living in less affected regions of Jammu and Kashmir. Girls in urban Kashmir have up to 3.5 years less schooling compared to girls less affected by the violence. Boys and girls more affected by violence are less likely to complete their primary schooling, as well as enroll less in primary schooling, compared to boys and girls less-affected by the insurgency. Secondary education is not affected negatively by the insurgency. The results remain qualitatively robust once accounting for migration, different age cohorts, a different identification of Kashmiri and continuous measurements of violence. The first phase of the insurgency has a negative impact on education, especially for girls in primary schools. Literacy and employment programs should be designed to target these women.
F51|An organizational learning perspective on contract design|The contracting process is a crucial step in alliance development and its success. However, the existing literature reveals surprisingly little investigation into how organizational learning relates to the process of contract making. We therefore conducted an in-depth longitudinal study of the alliance contracting process in the animated film industry. First, our findings suggest that during the contracting process, firms can learn about the way to deal with the contracting process, about themselves and their partner, and about the transaction features. Second, the case analysis indicates a combination of experiential, vicarious, and inferential learning mechanisms. Combining these insights into the objects and the mechanisms of learning during the contracting process, we discuss how contracting and learning processes are related and analyze the role of the contracting process in supporting organizational learning. The findings show that the drafting of contractual clauses fosters learning and, in turn, this learning triggers new contractual negotiations. Hence we suggest that the alignment between transaction features and the choice of contractual governance results from learning during the contracting process. We then propose avenues for future research.
F51|International Business Negotiation Under The Impact of Cultural Distance|The negotiation is part of the international business which plays the role of turn-table inside the working model of international relationships. The differences between the cultures of the negotiators, known as cultural distance, are the most subtle influences on negotiation. The problems that are generated by the cultural distance could be identified at the different levels of the hierarchy of various factors for success, negotiation styles, thinking processes and decision making. The cultural distance should be identified and analyzed before the negotiation starts and it should be very much reduced, as pertinent conclusions of researches suggested. In this last respect the multicultural research, analysis of cultural distance and interactive methods could be very helpful.
F51|Is Technical Assistance under Free Trade Agreements WTO-Plus? A Review of Japan–ASEAN Economic Partnership Agreements|What kind of technical assistance and capacity building benefits do developing countries enjoy if they sign a free trade agreement (FTA) with developed countries? This is a frequently asked question among developing country officials involved in FTA policymaking. While we tend to normatively insist that an FTA should lead to a win-win situation for all contracting parties and that developed members should provide technical assistance to developing partners so that the latter can maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of an FTA, empirical assessments of technical assistance mechanisms under FTAs have not been thoroughly conducted. This paper presents a detailed textual analysis of World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreements and several FTAs in Asia, and identifies how much additional technical assistance developing member countries can enjoy if they enter into FTAs with developed countries.
F51|Changes in China's Influence on Korean Exports by Production Phase|I estimate the impact of China's GDP on Korean exports to the world and Korean exports to China based on the VAR model. It is found that the responses of Korean exports to shocks in China's GDP are very different by export type (exports of raw materials, capital goods, and consumption goods). Reflecting the trend that the proportion of capital goods in Korean exports is increasing, Korean exports of capital goods respond most sensitively to these shocks among the three export types. Another finding is that Korean exports of raw materials do not respond very sensitively relative to the other export types. These findings are almost same as those for Korean exports to China in terms of response to GDP shocks. In addition, Korean exports to the world and Korean exports to China are more responsive to China's GDP growth shocks over time.
F51|Conflict-induced migration of composers: an individual-level study|Research on the causes of conflict-induced migration is hindered by the lack of adequately disaggregated data. The underlying study overcomes this problem through the use of historical data on 164 prominent classical composers born after 1800. I analyze the impact of war on the probability to emigrate of composers, investigate the associated dynamics and shed light on the choice of a destination country in times of war. I find that the incidence of inter-state wars increases composers’ probability to emigrate by around 7 % and the incidence of intra-state wars by roughly 19 %. The results imply that conflict impacts the migration intensity with a lag of approximately 1 year. Furthermore, the choice of a destination country is significantly affected by the incidence of war and less efficient from a career’s point of view during war. Finally, I find heterogeneous responses to war based on individual’s quality. While the better composers are more likely to emigrate in times of peace, it is not so anymore if a war breaks out. In times of war, all artists are affected by war and are prone to emigrate.
F51|War and Creativity: Solving the War-Art Puzzle for Classical Music Composition|The relationship between conflict and artistic output is ambiguous. This paper proposes an explanation for the contradiction in research, which we term the war-art puzzle. We employ a global sample of 115 prominent classical composers born after 1800 and link their annual productivity with the incidence of wars. We construct age-productivity profiles and find that the impact of wars on creative production is markedly heterogeneous - composers' productivity was significantly higher during defensive or victorious international wars and lower during intra-state conflicts, offensive or lost international wars. the long-run.
F51|Are composers different? Historical evidence on conflict-induced migration (1816-1997)| In this paper, we explore whether, and to what extent, the incidence of war affects the migration intensity of 164 prominent classical composers born after 1800. We model the aggregate stock of composers in a country and find that periods of war correspond negatively with the number of artists. We also find that conflict-induced migration intensity is considerably higher for composers than for the overall population and demonstrate that the share of composers in the overall population drops due to the incidence of war. We further find that the observed outmigration substantially diminishes the country's creative potential in the long run. Copyright , Oxford University Press.
F51|War and Individual Creativity: Tentative Evidence in Relation to Composers|The relationship between conflict and individual artistic output is ambiguous, both a priori and in terms of the evidence. To address this question in relation to composers, we employ a sample of 115 prominent classical composers born after 1800 and attempt to link their annual productivity with the incidence of wars. While the sample is small and the measure of creative productivity limited, we find evidence that the impact of wars on individual creative production is significant and negative, in keeping with the evidence on the impact of wars on overall societal creative output.
F51|Can Hearts and Minds Be Bought? The Economics of Counterinsurgency in Iraq|"We develop and test an economic theory of insurgency motivated by the informal literature and by recent military doctrine. We model a three-way contest between violent rebels, a government seeking to minimize violence by mixing service provision and coercion, and civilians deciding whether to share information about insurgents. We test the model using panel data from Iraq on violence against Coalition and Iraqi forces, reconstruction spending, and community characteristics (sectarian status, socioeconomic grievances, and natural resource endowments). Our results support the theory's predictions: improved service provision reduces insurgent violence, particularly for smaller projects and since the ""surge"" began in 2007."
F51|The Economic Effects of a Spanish Trade Boycott against Catalan Products|"We study the potential consequences of a hypothetical trade boycott against Catalan products organized by some sectors of the Spanish society mainly for political reasons. A symmetric trade boycott would have two effects: a reduction of Catalan exports to Spain and a partial process of import substitution in Catalonia. In order to quantify the economic impact of the boycott, we compare the ""actual"" Catalan economy, as described in the input-output table for 2005, with a ""simulated"" Catalan economy that takes into account the effects of a boycott on the trade exchanges between Catalonia and Spain."
F51|Strengthening Public Financial Management in Postconflict Countries|Understanding how to rebuild resilient states in postconflict countries is an urgent priority for the international community. A new cross-country study of public financial management reforms in postconflict situations shows that substantial progress is possible even in difficult circumstances, while showing a pattern of sequencing and progress that differs from standard assumptions. However, the impact on state building remains less than what might be hoped. That impact could be strengthened by persistently targeting sustainable capacity, challenging areas such as procurement, greater public awareness, and more rapid coverage of line ministries and subnational levels.

F51|Ex oleo bellare? The Impact of Oil on the Outbreak of Militarized Interstate Disputes|According to conventional wisdom, strategic natural resources like oil are harmful to international peace. Nonetheless, there is little empirical quantitative work on the link between resource abundance and interstate conflicts. Analyzing the impact of oil on militarized interstate disputes on a monadic level of analysis, this paper shows that oil in fact influences the conflict potential between countries. Results of logistic regressions suggest that a high absolute oil production is associated with an increased risk of dispute initiation. Per capita oil production, in contrast, does not seem to influence a country's propensity to start militarized conflicts. We also find that while very small oil-rich countries are more frequently the object of military actions, large oil producers seem to be generally spared from foreign attacks. We conclude that specific causal mechanisms such as an increased military capacity or the indulgence of the international community (rather than domestic political conditions inherent to the rentier state) might be particularly useful to explain our findings.
F51|Aligning with both the Soviet Union and with the Pharmaceutical Transnationals: Dilemmas attendant on initiating Drug Production in India|The paper discusses the processes typically underlying the Government of India’s technological choices in the mid 1950s, with a case study of the pharmaceutical industry. It argues that questions of the future development of India’s pharmaceutical industry was impacted by debates over placing it in the public or private sector, and over securing finance from the government’s own budget,from transnational corporations or through Soviet aid. A close scrutiny of the trajectory of these debates reveals how the highly contested conception of the required scope of the production process finally emerged. This scope then determined why, when faced with an offer from the USSR for an integrated pharmaceutical complex also manufacturing dye intermediates; and from the German conglomerate Bayer for a standalone plant for chemical intermediates, both for drugs and dyes, the Government decided to accept the Bayer proposal.
F51|Do Better Political Relations with the USA Improve A Country's Economic Outlook?|Relations of countries with the USA could be considered as helpful in their quest for enhanced economic performance. Does an improvement or deterioration in relations with the USA bring significant economic and financial benefits or costs, in areas such as, trade, capital flows, remittances, aid, military expenditures, and education? The results based on an event study are very preliminary. Nevertheless, this line of research could be fruitful and may enhance our appreciation of international political-economic relations and the ability to build more comprehensive theories of trade, capital flows and the like.
F51|Regional Judicial Institutions and Economic Cooperation: Lessons for Asia?|Why is Asia lagging behind other regions in creating regional judicial institutions? What lessons from the operation of such institutions elsewhere could be valuable to Asian regional economic integration? I show that Asian states are not unusually averse to refer inter-state disputes over trade, investment, and territory to global judicial institutions. Moreover, Asian states are not unique in their reluctance to resolve regional inter-state disputes through judicial means: Regional judicial institutions elsewhere have also rarely been used to resolve inter-state disputes. The most valuable lesson for Asia from experiences elsewhere is the role that regional courts can play in resolving disputes between administrative agencies and private parties about the implementation of international law. While Asia lacks an extensive set of regional laws and regulations that create rights and obligations for private parties, there is a broad body of international law that already applies in many Asian countries. National administrative agencies or courts may not always be well-equipped to interpret this law. I suggest the creation of a regional judicial institution that contributes to the uniform application of this law and that may help signal the commitment of states to their international obligations. The proposed institution provides incentives for harmonization without creating new obligations, thus recognizing the diversity among Asian states.
F51|A Study Of Negotiations Within The Ethnic Chinese Community Between Taiwan And Hong Kong|Negotiation is a fundamental process of business activity. As the world becomes more globalized and international business negotiation becomes more frequent, the importance of culture in negotiation becomes more and more salient. The majority of previous negotiation research has been conducted in either a western or an east vs. west environment, leading us to wonder if the findings of these studies are applicable in other cross-cultural contexts. This study uses the dual concern model presented by Blake and Mouton (1985) to understand what drives negotiation strategy selection in two similar cultures (Taiwan and Hong Kong). The result of statistical analysis confirm significant differences in negotiation strategies between the countries: subjects in Hong Kong are more inclined to employ integration negotiation strategies while Taiwanese subjects employ more competitive strategies.
F51|Limited Incremental Linking and Unlinked Trade Agreements|The broadened scope of the GATT/WTO through successive rounds of trade liberalization is explained as a result of trade-partner specificity, linked agreements, and cross retaliation. In more recent years, however, countries have pursued trade liberalization through sector specific zero-for-zero agreements and preferential trade agreements, both of which have a reduced chance of suffering cross retaliation. This increase in unlinked agreements is explained by imperfect observability of trade policies generating gratuitous trade disputes and unjustified cross retaliation. If the dispute generating noise is perfectly correlated across sectors, however, then it provides no reason not to link agreements in a static sense and in many cases incremental linking still produces more liberalization than static linking. It is only when the noise is imperfectly correlated that linking and cross retaliation are problematic so that some sectors can enforce more liberalization in an unlinked agreement. If the correlation drops, the noise increases, or the number of sectors already covered is large, then incremental linking of more sectors is inefficient and countries pursue unlinked agreements.
F51|Uluslararası Enerji Güvenliği Açısından Hazar Bölgesi Enerji Ekonomisi ve Hazar Denizi’ni Paylaşım Sorunu|Caspian region for which many energy projects are being planned and executed is today one of alternative regions that can provide solution to energy supply security which is considered by west as equal to national security. For energy import of western countries the region also has the feature of being an alternative transportation route that can decrease the dependency to Russia. The main aim of this study is to determine how legal situation is an obstacle in economically valuing this potential by proving the energy potential of Caspian Region. Although the problem is legal, its result is economical.

F51|Conflict and Development—Lessons from South Asia|South Asia is the second most violent place on earth after Iraq. Conflicts in Afghanistan and Pakistan have attracted global attention. Parts of India, Sri Lanka, and Nepal have experienced long-running conflict. Conflicts result in death, misery, social trauma, destruction of infrastructure, and have huge spillover effects. What is conflict? Where is it concentrated? Is conflict a problem for development, or a failure of development? What should policy makers do?
F51|Challenges Of Economic Development In The Middle East And North Africa Region:|This book surveys major economic issues in the development of countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region since World War II. It presents a framework of analysis highlighting underlying continuities in the region's approach to issues of growth, management of oil and natural resources, post-conflict environments, progress in trade liberalization and regional integration, the use of industrial policy, labor market adjustment and unemployment, educational attainment and poverty incidence. At the same time, this book focuses on emerging differences across countries in the region in the prevailing approach to addressing such challenges most notably between the economies of the Gulf Cooperation Council and other MENA countries.This book also incorporates a discussion of tools and methods used by development practitioners and briefly examines issues of aid effectiveness. The approach used is intended to appeal to a wide audience including students of economic development, political scientists and development practitioners.

It unravels the special features of the global socio-economic system that can make it extremely fragile and vulnerable. It serves as a good reference source for anyone interested in some of the pressing and emerging problems of the global system, such as intra-national and interethnic conflicts, climate change challenges, poverty and terrorism, and provides useful and rigorous insights into the collective bid to resolve some of these problems. Written in a simple and accessible manner, this book will help researchers and policy makers in understanding and abetting costly conflicts.
F51|Introduction|AbstractThe story of development in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is a tale of the interplay between two forces: external factors and a rivalry of interests. Over time, large public sectors, rather than markets have evolved as the primary mechanism to manage these forces — by enhancing certainty, real or perceived and mediating interests — with both intended and unintended consequences for growth and development. The aim of this book is to assess development policy choices in the post WWII era from the vantage point of these two forces, their interaction and the institutional framework which is given at any point in time. As such, the book surveys primary challenges facing policy-makers in the region today; namely low total factor productivity growth, management of volatile oil and natural gas revenues and rising water scarcity, post-conflict development, raising private investment and diversifying exports, lowering high unemployment, improving education quality and addressing poverty incidence…
