M48|Fraudulent Financial Reporting and the Consequences for Employees|We examine employment effects, such as wages and employee turnover, before, during, and after periods of fraudulent financial reporting. To analyze these effects, we combine U.S. Census data with SEC enforcement actions against firms with serious misreporting (“fraud”). We find compared to a matched sample that fraud firms’ employee wages decline by 9% and the separation rate is higher by 12% during and after fraud periods while employment growth at fraud firms is positive during fraud periods and negative afterward. We discuss several reasons that plausibly drive these findings. (i) Frauds cause informational opacity, misleading employees to still join or continue to work at the firm. (ii) During fraud, managers overinvest in labor changing employee mix, and after fraud the overemployment is unwound causing effects from displacement. (iii) Fraud is misconduct; association with misconduct can affect workers in the labor market. We explore the heterogeneous effects of fraudulent financial reporting, including thin and thick labor markets, bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy firms, worker movements, pre-fraud wage levels, and period of hire. Negative wage effects are prevalent across these sample cuts, indicating that fraudulent financial reporting appears to create meaningful and negative consequences for employees possibly through channels such as labor market disruptions, punishment, and stigma.
M48|Aligning profit taxation with value creation|The OECD seeks to align transfer pricing and profit taxation with value creation but fails to provide a clear definition. This paper argues that value creation requires international cooperation and that the profit tax base should therefore be allocated according to standards commonly considered as fair when distributing the surplus of cooperation. The claim that current rules of international profit taxation are aligned with value creation is rejected. If anything, the OECD’s objective suggests a tax system in which profits are split between the involved jurisdictions. This result triggers the question of possible implementation which is discussed in some detail.
M48|The Digital Services Tax as a Tax on Location-Specific Rent|In 2018, the European Council and the UK and Spanish governments each proposed to introduce a Digital Services Tax (DST), to be levied on the revenue of large digital platforms from advertising, online intermediation, and/or the transmission of data. We offer a rationalization of the DST as a tax on location-specific rent (LSR). That is, just as many countries already levy royalties on rent from extracting natural resources, one can think of the DST as levied on rent earned by digital platforms from particular locations. We provide stylized illustrations of how platform rent can be assigned to specific locations, even when users from multiple jurisdictions participate. We then elaborate the analogy between the DST and resource royalties, and analyze the DST’s incidence and effect on consumer welfare using a simple model. Finally, we argue that the DST suggests useful directions for redesigning international taxation in the age of labor-replacing AI technology.
M48|Fraudulent Financial Reporting and the Consequences for Employees|We examine employment effects, such as wages and employee turnover, before, during, and after periods of fraudulent financial reporting. To analyze these effects, we combine U.S. Census data with SEC enforcement actions against firms with serious misreporting (â€œfraudâ€ ). We find compared to a matched sample that fraud firmsâ€™ employee wages decline by 9% and the separation rate is higher by 12% during and after fraud periods while employment growth at fraud firms is positive during fraud periods and negative afterward. We discuss several reasons that plausibly drive these findings. (i) Frauds cause informational opacity, misleading employees to still join or continue to work at the firm. (ii) During fraud, managers overinvest in labor changing employee mix, and after fraud the overemployment is unwound causing effects from displacement. (iii) Fraud is misconduct; association with misconduct can affect workers in the labor market. We explore the heterogeneous effects of fraudulent financial reporting, including thin and thick labor markets, bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy firms, worker movements, pre-fraud wage levels, and period of hire. Negative wage effects are prevalent across these sample cuts, indicating that fraudulent financial reporting appears to create meaningful and negative consequences for employees possibly through channels such as labor market disruptions, punishment, and stigma.
M48|CECL and the Credit Cycle|We find that that the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) standard would slightly dampen fluctuations in bank lending over the economic cycle. In particular, if the CECL standard had always been in place, we estimate that lending would have grown more slowly leading up to the financial crisis and more rapidly afterwards. We arrive at this conclusion by estimating historical allowances under CECL and modeling how the impact on accounting variables would have affected banks' lending and capital distributions. We consider a variety of approaches to address uncertainty regarding the management of bank capital and predictability of credit losses.
M48|Corporate Governance disclosure and implication in the financial audit of banks in Romania|Thispaperaims topresents the relevant aspects regarding the implementation of principles and rulesof corporate governance in the Romanian banking system.The purpose of the articleis to investigate the theoretical and legislative basis whichcontrolsthis area, but also research practical cases on this subject. Based on the review of nationaland international literature, the case study was based on a sample of 17 commercial banks from Romania.Usingcollected data from the official banks' websites, it was analyzed the details of chosen corporate governance elements: the management system, the shareholder and organizational structure, the financial control and audit, as well as if the banks offer disclosure for theapplicable governance codes. The main conclusion which resultsfrom thisstudy case is that,the information available to public provides details about the management structure and the audit department, but this information is not very detailed, the information about the professional experience of the members or the benefits that these credit institutions obtained from the application of corporate governance codes are not described, in some cases even missing.
M48|The Effect of Corporate Governance on Financial Performance in Non-Financial LQ-45 Firms Listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange from 2012 to 2017|Objective – This research is conducted in order to determine what factors in corporate governance affect the financial performance of a firm. Methodology/Technique – Financial performance, as the dependent variable, is measured by Return on Asset (ROA), while the independent variables (corporate governance) are measured using Board Independence, Board Size, Dividend, Firm Size, and Financial Leverage. The sampling method used in this research is purposive sampling. The requirements for the sample of this research are the non – financial firms included in LQ-45 from 2012 to 2017 that publish annual reports that are available to the public. The research method used in this paper is a quantitative method. Panel data analysis technique and E-views tools were also used. Findings – The results indicate that firm size and percentage of board independence has no effect on financial performance, while board size, dividends, and financial leverage all effect financial performance. Novelty – The study adds to the literature of corporate government and firm performance in emerging countries. Type of Paper: Empirical.
M48|What Drives the Institutionalization of Performance Measurement Systems in Indonesian Local Government?|Objective – The objective of this paper is to explore and understand the motivators of institutionalization of Performance Measurement Systems (PMS) in the Indonesian Local Government (ILG), particularly in the Batu municipality presenting the performance paradoxes. Performance accountability issues have been encouraging the Batu municipality to implement PMS since the beginning of the 2000s. Methodology/Technique – The theoretical framework and interpretation of this study are adopted from the institutional theory (coercive, mimetic, normative, and allomorphism) which is used to analyze the phenomenon. The researchers employ a single case study to scrutinize the motivators of institutionalization by elaborating on document analysis conducted from the interviews of 10 employees in a different range of management levels (top, middle, and lower). Findings – The results of this study reveal that exogenous (coercive, mimetic and normative) and endogenous (allomorphism) drivers encourage the institutionalization of PMS in the Batu municipality with coercive pressure as a major driver and allomorphism as a mere ceremonial driver (rather than an instrument). Novelty – The practical implications of this study can be used to improve the PMS process and the quality of performance reporting in the Batu municipality and in other local governments. This paper is also expected to fill the gap in existing literature on the implementation of PMS within a developing country (in this case, Indonesia). Type of Paper: Empirical Paper.
M48|Seeking Rent in the Informal Sector|Rent seeking within the vast informal segment of the developing world is a relatively underdexplored topic in the interface of labor market policies and public economics. Moreover, how rent seeking and corruption within the informal segment is affected by economic reforms targeted for the formal sector is rarely discussed in the literature. This paper fills the gap. We identify conditions under which economic reform in the formal segment will increase the rate of corruption or rent seeking in the informal sector and raise the pay-off for those involved in rent seeking activities. When formal sector contracts due to reforms, offsetting forces determine the magnitude of rent seeking in the informal sector. Thus, economic reforms may increase corruption instead of reducing it, as claimed previously.
M48|Experimental Evidence on the Impact of Replacing the Incurred Credit Loss Model of Bank Loan Loss Provisions with the International or US Accounting Standards Boards’ Expected Credit Loss Models|Our objective is to test-bed the new Expected Credit Loss (ECL) and Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) models for bank credit loss accounting to identify the potential consequences of their implementation. In particular, whether and how ECL and CECL approaches could lead to divergence in credit loss accounting practices in the U.S. relative to the rest of the world is an unanswered question. To do this, we develop a stylized bank-loan setting in a controlled laboratory environment with eight different secured personal-loan portfolios. Fifty-six senior accounting students take the role of loan managers responsible for making annual loan-loss reserve decisions in a between-subjects design under the rules of either the ECL or CECL models. We examine the effects of mandating the ECL or CECL model in terms of their impacts on the adequacy of loan-loss reserves, the comparability and predictability of loan-loss reserves and the volatility of reported profit.
M48|L’impatto sociale della produzione di scienza su larga scala: come governarlo?|L’appropriazione di conoscenze è oggi forse più importante della proprietà di capitali tangibili nel determinare la distribuzione dei redditi. Il paper analizza l’impatto socioeconomico e le ricadute distributive dell’attività delle (grandi) infrastrutture di ricerca (IR). Dopo aver definito le IR e rilevato che esse generano un beneficio sociale netto, gli autori sostengono che, sotto il profilo distributivo, la possibilità per le imprese private di appropriarsi gratuitamente della conoscenza prodotta dalla ricerca pubblica (finanziata dai contribuenti) aggrava le disuguaglianze. Tra i possibili rimedi, gli autori propongono la creazione di un nuovo tipo di impresa pubblica come polo della creazione di conoscenza.
M48|Inter-municipal cooperation as a solution for public services delivery? The case of Unioni di Comuni in Emilia-Romagna Region|Inter municipal cooperation (IMC) represents a solution adopted all around the world in order to jointly provide services considering the complexity of contemporary socio-economic contexts. However, empirical evidence on IMC solutions is still week. The purpose of this paper is to analyse associations of municipalities (Unioni di Comuni, UC), the prevalent kind of IMC established in Italy, as a possible solution for sustainable public services delivery. Our research questions refer to the main features of Unioni di Comuni as an IMC for public services delivery in Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy), to the explanation of those characteristics, and to the evaluation of UCs and their features in terms of autonomy, resilience and sustainability. In order to meet our objectives, we accomplished a cluster analysis, considering administrative and socio-economic data; in addition, we examined specific characteristics within each cluster to proceed with a comparison between clusters in terms of revenues from transfers from other governments layers, own revenues, current expenses and financial autonomy index in the last years. Our results suggest a general tendency: to provide services through UC in E-R; and to enhance their development in terms of public service special-ization. But at the same time, UCs generally decreased their own financial autonomy, relying on transfers from other public institutions. In line with Resource-Dependence Theory (RDT), our empirical analysis finds different clusters of UCs which act as new centres for public service delivery in Emilia-Romagna Region in order to reduce uncertainty over resources through the creation of new inter-institutional balances. However, the statement that strong UCs com-pensate weak starting territorial features of municipalities is not self-evident.
M48|Adoption of CSR and Sustainability Reporting Standards: Economic Analysis and Review|This study provides an economic analysis of the determinants and consequences of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability reporting. To frame our analysis, we consider a widespread mandatory adoption of CSR reporting standards in the United States. The study focuses on the economic effects of standards for disclosure and reporting, not on the effects of CSR activities and policies themselves. It draws on an extensive review of the relevant academic (CSR and non-CSR) literatures in accounting, economics, finance, and management. Based on a discussion of the fundamental economic forces at play and the key features and determinants of (voluntary) CSR reporting, we derive and evaluate possible economic consequences, including capital-market effects for select stakeholders as well as potential firm responses and real effects in firm behavior. We also highlight issues related to the implementation and enforcement of CSR reporting standards. Our analysis yields a number of insights that are relevant to the current debate on CSR and sustainability reporting and provides scholars with avenues for future research.
M48|Mandated Financial Reporting and Corporate Innovation|We investigate the impact of reporting regulation on corporate innovation activity. Exploiting thresholds in Europe’s regulation and a major enforcement reform in Germany, we find that forcing a greater share of firms to publicly disclose their financial statements reduces firms’ innovative activities at the industry level. At the same time, it increases firms’ reliance on patenting to protect their innovations, to the extent they continue innovating. Our evidence is consistent with reporting mandates having significant real effects by imposing proprietary costs on innovative firms, which diminishes their incentives to engage in innovative activities. Importantly, we examine and find that this decline in innovative activity is not fully compensated by positive information spillovers (e.g., to competitors, suppliers, and customers) within industries. Thus, our evidence implies that proprietary costs induced by reporting mandates are important consideration for regulators and policy makers.
M48|Bank loan loss provisions, risk-taking and bank intangibles|This article investigates the relationship between discretionary loan loss provisions and bank intangibles among African banks. Prior studies have focused on how intangible assets affect firms’ profitability and valuation decisions with almost no focus on the role of loan loss provisions. We investigate whether banks increase (decrease) loan loss provisions in response to risks associated with investment in intangible assets. We find that discretionary loan loss provisions are inversely associated with bank intangible assets and change in intangible assets, but the inverse association is weakened in environments with strong investor protection. We observe that income smoothing is reduced among banks that have large intangible asset investment. Moreover, income smoothing is pronounced among banks that have few intangible asset investments but this behaviour is reduced for banks in environments with strong minority shareholders right protection.
M48|Impact of IAS 39 reclassification on Income Smoothing by European Banks|We examine the impact of the reclassification of IAS 39 on income smoothing using loan loss provisions among European banks. We predict that the strict recognition and re-classification requirements of IAS 139 reduced banks' ability to smooth income using bank securities and derivatives, motivating them to rely more on loan loss provisions to smooth income. Our findings do not support the prediction for income smoothing through loan loss provisions. Also, there is no evidence for income smoothing in the pre- and post-IAS 39 reclassification period. The implication of the findings is that: (i) European banks did not use loan loss provisions to smooth income during the period examined, and rather rely on other accounting numbers to smooth income; (ii) the IASB’s strict disclosure regulation improved the reliability and informativeness of loan loss provision estimates among European banks during the period of analysis.
M48|Bank Income Smoothing, Institutions and Corruption|This study investigates bank income smoothing, focusing on the effect of corruption on the extent of income smoothing by African banks. I find that banks use loan loss provisions to smooth positive (non-negative) earnings particularly in the post-2008 crisis period and this behaviour is reduced by strong investor protection. Also, I find that banks in highly corrupt environments smooth their positive (non-negative) earnings as opposed to smoothing the entire profit distribution. Finally, cross-country variation in bank income smoothing is observed. The findings have implications.
M48|Regulatory Spillovers in Common Audit Markets|We find that Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) had two significant effects on the audit market for nonpublic entities. The first short-run effect stems from inelastic labor supply coupled with an audit demand shock from public companies. As a result, private companies reduced their use of attested financial reports in bank financing by 12%, and audit fee increases for nonprofit organizations (NPOs) more than doubled. The second long-run effect was a transformation in the audit supply structure. After SOX, NPOs were less likely to match with auditors most exposed to public companies, while auditors increasingly specialized their offices based on client type. Audit market concentration for NPOs dropped by more than half within five years of SOX and remained at this level through the end of our sample in 2013, while the number of suppliers increased by 26%. Our results demonstrate how regulation directed at public companies generates economically im-portant spillovers for nonpublic entities.
M48|Последващо Оценяване На Репутацията – Преглед На Съществуващата Нормативна Уредба<BR>[Subsequent Evaluation Of Goodwill - Overview Of Existing Accounting Legislation]|The purpose of this article is to review and analyze existing practices in the accounting regulation of post-reputation accounting as one of the major problems in the field of accounting harmonization by not aiming to critically analyze individual regulations in terms of their relevance. The objective analysis of the reviewed regulations allows us to summarize that the existing order for carrying out the ex post evaluation of the reputation and the specified disclosure elements are very important in order to obtain real indications of the business situation and the need for impairment but on the other hand they are extremely sensitive and easy to manipulate, as they use internal assumptions and assessments of enterprise management that are extremely difficult to verify. We believe that this is one of the main prerequisites for changing the regime in subsequent accounting for goodwill.
M48|Does the pension system’s income statement really matter? A proposal for an NDC scheme with disability and minimum pension benefits|This paper develops a full accounting model for monitoring the solvency of a notional defined contribution (NDC) pension scheme with disability and minimum pension benefits. Using the annual report of the Swedish pension system as a benchmark (TSPS, 2018), we extend the “Swedish” actuarial balance developed by Pérez-Salamero et al. (2017) by adding an income statement which fully explains the reasons behind the changes in the system’s solvency by type of benefit. In line with the reference model, assets and liabilities are measured at present value at each reporting date, and changes in present value are reported in each period as income or expenses and are included on the income statement. Our proposed model is a step forward because it, also, incorporates the changes for disability pensions, the value of change in the discount rate and the explicit recognition of non-contributory rights (NCRs) into the Income statement. This accounting framework integrates both contributory and social aspects of public pensions and discloses the real cost of the disability contingency and the redistribution through minimum pensions. The paper contains a numerical example consisting of an income statement for a (fictional) already-functioning system to illustrate the main differences between the Swedish NDC scheme and our model. Mathematical details are presented in a comprehensive technical appendix.
M48|Innovation in Public Sector Accounting: a New Role for Local Governments?|The research aims to analyze how local governments can adopt accounting innovations to reinvent their role. This report attempts to define the importance of reducing information asymmetry among citizens, policy-makers, and public managers, as well as how accounting system reform can support the process. This paper makes use of a case study based on the realization of a medium-sized Italian municipalityâ€™s consolidated financial statements, exploiting the action research method. The analysis outlines that, on one hand, the development of new accounting tools can enhance organizational awareness, while on the other hand, there are some possible limits regarding internal and external accountability.
M48|Situazione socio-economica e politica di coesione in Emilia-Romagna a fine 2018|Lâ€™anno in corso Ã¨ il penultimo del periodo di programmazione 2014-2020 della politica di coesione dellâ€™Unione europea condotta dallâ€™Amministrazione regionale in Emilia-Romagna. Pertanto, sembra opportuno avviare la valutazione dei risultati che si stanno conseguendo in termini economico-finanziari, senza attendere la conclusione del settennio. A tale scopo si prestano alcuni documenti ufficiali che sono stati recentemente diffusi in cui si presentano, da un lato, gli esiti delle misure realizzate nellâ€™ambito di tale politica contabilizzati alla fine del 2018 e, dallâ€™altro, i valori assunti dalle principali variabili socio-economiche nel contesto emiliano-romagnolo nel corso degli ultimi anni. Il quadro che si ottiene da tale confronto appare contrastante, riproponendo lâ€™annoso conflitto tra efficienza ed equitÃ che caratterizza la disciplina della politica economica in generale e, in particolar modo, la sua componente avente come obiettivo il riequilibrio inter- o intra-regionale.
M48|"From ""destructive creation"" to ""creative destruction"": Rethinking Science, Technology and innovation in a global context"|"There is general agreement amongst economists today that Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) have dramatically contributed to individual countries' economic growth and welfare. Another, 21st Century way of looking at the old Solow residual discussion is to observe that STI has been the core factor behind the intrinsic characteristic of capitalism to accumulate indefinitely. Doing so STI has also created the seeds of the current pattern of unsustainable global development. Once the major driving forces of countries' international, technological competitiveness are taken into account, ""smart"", innovation-led growth and ""sustainable"", green growth appear in contradiction with each other. The paper makes the case for ""smart"" no longer be leading in STI policy but rather ""sustainability"". Four priority ""directions"" are suggested: radical improvements in eco-productivity reducing the energy and emissions intensity of production, distribution and consumption; biomimicry as sustainable product innovation guiding principle; the use of AI and big data as ""sustainable purpose technologies"" assisting and complementing growth in eco-productivity and green product development and design; and finally regulatory and taxing policies addressing over-consumption, including advertising. In so far as sustainability and inclusiveness are also in contradiction with each other, there is also need for specific proactive, integrated ""eco-social"" STI policies. Global sustainable development will only be successful if it supported by all classes in society. While for high income classes priority can be given to increased taxation, for low income classes there is a need for a more comprehensive green new deal that should include house retrofitting and social energy tariffs making the energy transition cheap. Finally the research community itself should put full priority to exploit fully the digital substitution advantages of research networking, rather than air travel."
M48|Critical Factors Towards Philanthropic Dimension Of CSR in The Nigerian Financial Sector: The Mediating Effects Of Cultural Influence|The purpose of the study is to examine the leading factors towards philanthropic dimension of corporate social responsibility in the Nigerian financial sector. The need to build corporate image, prompt managers towards prioritizing the philanthropic dimension of CSR. Satisfaction of stakeholder needs to reduce the pressure exerted on managers’ leads also to the assumption of more philanthropic activities. Within these set of circumstances, the objective of the study is to explore the possible predictive factors leading towards prioritization of philanthropic dimension of CSR by managers of the Nigerian financial sector. This study examined the relationships between philanthropic dimension of CSR, corporate image, stakeholder pressure and cultural influence. A total of 173 managers from the Nigerian financial sector responded to the survey instruments administered which later on was analyzed using partial least squares-structural equation modeling. The results revealed that corporate image and stakeholder pressure are influencing factors towards prioritization of the the philanthropic dimension of CSR, and are mediated by the role of cultural influence in the Nigerian context. This study highlights the prioritization of philanthropic dimension of CSR by managers of the Nigerian financial sector with respect to cultural influence and predictive factors like building a corporate image and reducing pressures from stakeholders
M48|Bank Earnings Smoothing During Mandatory IFRS adoption in Nigeria|We examine the extent of bank earnings smoothing during mandatory IFRS adoption in Nigeria, to determine whether mandatory IFRS adoption increased or decreased income smoothing among Nigerian banks. We find that the mandatory adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is associated with lower earnings smoothing among Nigerian banks, which implies that Nigerian banks do not use loan loss provisions to smooth reported earnings during the mandatory IFRS adoption period. We find evidence for earnings smoothing via LLP during voluntary IFRS adoption. Earnings smoothing is not significantly associated with listed and non-listed Nigerian banks during voluntary and mandatory IFRS adoption. Overall, the findings indicate that mandatory IFRS adoption improves the informativeness and reliability of loan loss provisions estimate by discouraging Nigerian banks from influencing loan loss provisions for earnings smoothing purposes during the mandatory IFRS adoption. The findings of this paper are relevant to the debate on whether IFRS reporting improves the quality of financial reporting among firms in Nigeria. The implication of the study is that IFRS has higher accounting quality than local GAAP in Nigeria as it improves the quality and informativeness of accounting numbers (LLPs and earnings) reported by Nigerian banks during the period examined
M48|The influence of emotional intelligence on the performance of health department officers of Deli Serdang regency|Employee performance is the responsibility of employees to their work and the results achieved by the employees in performing the job given to them either in quantity or quality within a certain time. The goals of employee performance are to adjust employee expectation with organizational goals. Incompatibility between efforts to achieve employee performance goals with organizational goals will result in poor performance. Employee performance is influenced by internal and external factors. One of the internal factors that affect employee performance is emotional intelligence. This research analyzed the influence of emotional intelligence which consists of self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills on the performance of the Officer of Health Department of Deli Serdang Regency, North Sumatera, Indonesia. The type of this research was causal research with cross-sectional study design. The subjects of this research were Civil Servants working in the Health Department of Deli Serdang Regency who occupied operative positions or staff of 100 people. The sampling used data were collected through interviews, questionnaires distribution and literature study. The data were analyzed using a multiple linear regression model, hypothesis and testing was done by using T-test and F-test. This research was conducted at the Health Department of Deli Serdang Regency, North Sumatera Province, Indonesia. The result showed that emotional intelligence which had a significant influence on the performance of Health Service Officers of Deli Serdang Regency was motivation and social skill. The results of the T-test showed that the emotional intelligence: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills simultaneously had a positive influence on the performance of the Health Department officers of Deli Serdang Regency. The results of the -test concluded that emotional intelligence: motivation and social skills had a positive and significant influence on the performance of the Health Department officers of Deli Serdang Regency. Emotional intelligence consisting of self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills had a positive and significant influence on the performance improvement of the Health Department officers of Deli Serdang Regency. The higher the emotional intelligence of the Health Department officers of Deli Serdang Regency, the better the employee performance, the lower the emotional intelligence, the lower the performance of the employees.

M48|Marking to Market versus Taking to Market|Building on the idea that accounting matters for corporate governance, this paper studies the equilibrium interaction between the measurement rules that firms find privately optimal, firms' governance, and the liquidity in the secondary market for their assets. This equilibrium approach reveals an excessive use of market-value accounting: corporate performance measures rely excessively on the information generated by other firms' asset sales and insufficiently on the realization of a firm's own capital gains. This dries up market liquidity and reduces the informativeness of price signals, thereby making it more costly for firms to overcome their agency problems.
M48|Sustainable mobility in Florian—polis: A commuter-based empirical investigation|Mobility in Brazil represents a crucial challenge for policy makers, given the economic, environmental and social problems that current patterns of transportation bear in densely populated urban areas. The research stems from the assumption that, since commuters play a key-role in driving the change towards innovative and environment-friendly mobility systems, a thorough understanding of the motives underpinning modal choice is a pre-requisite for the implementation of sound strategies and policies. The paper illustrates the preliminary results of an empirical investigation on modal choice on a sample of 436 commuters from the urban area of Florian—polis, Santa Catarina (Brazil). Policy implications for public authorities are presented, and avenues for future research are proposed.
M48|Comparability and predictive ability of loan loss allowances: The role of accounting regulation versus bank supervision|We investigate whether and how the shift from discretionary forward-looking provisioning to the restrictive incurred loss approach under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the European Union (EU) affects the cross-country comparability and predictive ability of loan loss allowances. Given bank supervisors' keen interest in comparable and adequate loan loss allowances, we also examine the role of supervisors in determining financial statement effects around IFRS adoption. We find that the application of the incurred loss approach has led to more comparable loan loss allowances. However, some differences persist in countries where supervisors were reluctant to enforce the incurred loss approach. Our results also suggest that the predictive ability of loan loss allowances improved following IFRS adoption. Finally, in supplemental analyses we document that increased comparability of loan loss allowances is associated with the cross-country convergence of the risk sensitivity of bank leverage indicating an improvement in the effectiveness of market discipline in the EU.
M48|Who Falls Prey to the Wolf of Wall Street? Investor Participation in Market Manipulation|Manipulative communications touting stocks are common in capital markets around the world. Although the price distortions created by so-called “pump-and-dump” schemes are well known, little is known about the investors in these frauds. By examining 421 “pump-and-dump” schemes between 2002 and 2015 and a proprietary set of trading records for over 110,000 individual investors from a major German bank, we provide evidence on the participation rate, magnitude of the investments, losses, and the characteristics of the individuals who invest in such schemes. Our evidence suggests that participation is quite common and involves sizable losses, with nearly 6% of active investors participating in at least one “pump-and-dump” and an average loss of nearly 30%. Moreover, we identify several distinct types of investors, some of which should not be viewed as falling prey to these frauds. We also show that portfolio composition and past trading behavior can better explain participation in touted stocks than demographics. Our analysis offers insights into the challenges associated with designing effective investor protection against market manipulation.
M48|The Death of a Regulator: Strict Supervision, Bank Lending and Business Activity|An important question in banking is how strict supervision affects bank lending and in turn local business activity. Forcing banks to recognize losses could choke off lending and amplify local economic woes. But stricter supervision could also change how banks assess and manage loans. Estimating such effects is challenging. We exploit the extinction of the thrift regulator (OTS) — a large change in prudential supervision — to analyze economic links between strict supervision, bank lending and business activity. We first show that the OTS replacement indeed resulted in stricter supervision of former OTS banks. Next, we analyze the ensuing lending effects. We show that former OTS banks increase small business lending by roughly 10 percent. This increase is not entirely accounted by a reallocation of mortgage lending and stems primarily from well-capitalized banks and those more affected by the new regime. These findings suggest that stricter supervision operates not only through capital but can also overcome frictions in bank management, leading to more lending and a reallocation of loans. Consistent with the latter, we find increases in business entry and exit in counties with greater expose to OTS banks.
M48|Evidence-based policymaking: promise, challenges and opportunities for accounting and financial markets research| The use of evidence and economic analysis in policymaking is on the rise, and accounting standard setting and financial regulation are no exception. This article discusses the promise of evidence-based policymaking in accounting and financial markets as well as the challenges and opportunities for research supporting this endeavour. In principle, using sound theory and robust empirical evidence should lead to better policies and regulations. But despite its obvious appeal and substantial promise, evidence-based policymaking is easier demanded than done. It faces many challenges related to the difficulty of providing relevant causal evidence, lack of data, the reliability of published research and the transmission of research findings. Overcoming these challenges requires substantial infrastructure investments for generating and disseminating relevant research. To illustrate this point, I draw parallels to the rise of evidence-based medicine. The article provides several concrete suggestions for the research process and the aggregation of research findings if scientific evidence is to inform policymaking. I discuss how policymakers can foster and support policy-relevant research, chiefly by providing and generating data. The article also points to potential pitfalls when research becomes increasingly policy-oriented.
M48|Opacity, Liquidity and Disclosure Policies|We present a model that links the opacity of an asset to its liquidity. While low opacity assets are liquid, intermediate levels of opacity provide incentives for investors to acquire private information, causing adverse selection and illiquidity. High opacity, however, benefits liquidity by reducing the value of a unit of private information to investors. The cross-section of bid-ask spreads of U.S. firms is shown to be consistent with this hump-shape relationship between opacity and illiquidity. Our analysis suggests that uniform disclosure standards may be suboptimal; efficient disclosure can instead be achieved through a two-tier standard system or by subsidizing voluntary disclosure.
M48|Taxing Direct Sales of Digital Services: A Plea for Regulated and Internationally Coordinated Profit Splitting|The employment of capital is rival in nature. Small countries do not benefit from taxing its employment. By contrast, the use of digital services is non-rival and small countries do benefit from taxing expenditures on such services. In fact, some countries have already decided to tax digital activities. If such practice spreads, the development of digital services is negatively affected. It is argued that countries exporting digital services have reason to respond by promoting an international tax regime in which the right of taxing the profit earned on the direct sales of digital services is split between the countries involved.
M48|Information in Mandatory and Voluntary Earnings Announcement Date Forecasts|We address whether mandatory forecasts of earnings announcement dates are informative and what are the informational tradeoffs between mandatory and voluntary forecasts. We find China mandatory forecasts predict actual earnings announcement dates and yet-to-be-announced firm performance, and the market reacts to the initial and revised forecasts accordingly. Regarding informational tradeoffs we find the following. China mandatory forecasts are informative, even by firms less likely to issue a voluntary forecast; this information is unavailable in a voluntary regime. The act of US voluntary forecasting and its timing reveal information incremental to the forecasted announcement date, which is unavailable in a mandatory regime. Perhaps surprisingly, US voluntary and China mandatory initial forecasts convey a similar amount of earnings news, which is noteworthy because the China forecasts are issued substantially earlier and suggests the amount of information in the act and timing of voluntary forecasts is small.
M48|Long-Term Economic Consequences of Hedge Fund Activist Interventions|We examine the long-term effects of interventions by activist hedge funds. Prior papers document positive equal-weighted long-term returns and operating performance improvements following activist interventions, and typically conclude that activism is beneficial. We extend prior literature in two ways. First, we find that equal-weighted long-term returns are driven by the smallest 20% of firms with an average market value of $22 million. The larger 80% of firms experience insignificant negative long-term returns. On a value-weighted basis, which likely best gauges effects on shareholder wealth and the economy, we find that pre- to post-activism long-term returns are insignificantly different from zero. For operating performance, we find that prior results are a manifestation of abnormal trends in pre-activism performance. Using an appropriately matched sample, we find no evidence of abnormal post-activism performance improvements. Overall, our results do not strongly support the hypothesis that activist interventions drive long-term benefits for the typical shareholder, nor do we find evidence of shareholder harm.
M48|The Impact of the Current Expected Credit Loss Standard (CECL) on the Timing and Comparability of Reserves|The new forward-looking credit loss provisioning standard, CECL, is intended to promote proactive provisioning as loan loss reserves can be conditioned on expectations of the economic cycle. We study the degree to which one modeling decision–expectations about the path of future house prices – affects the size and timing of provisions for first-lien residential mortgage portfolios. While we find that provisions are generally less pro-cyclical compared to the current incurred loss standard, CECL may complicate the comparability of provisions across banks and time. Market participants will need to disentangle the degree to which variation in provisions across firms is driven by underlying risk versus differences in modeling assumptions.
M48|The Accounting Conservatism of the Adoption of IFRS in Indonesia|Objective - The Indonesian Accounting Standard Authority has required companies to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) since its adoption in 2012. The new standard emphasizes relevance, while the previous standard focused on conservative issues. While the IFRS does not specifically aim to reduce conservatism, this aspect is no longer the emphasis of the new standard. There are concerns about whether the IFRS reduces conservatism and the research on this issue are still uncertain. Hence, this study aims to determine the level of conservatism in the period following the adoption of the IFRS. The study also aims to examine the outcome of the adoption of the IFRS since its adoption in Indonesia in 2012. Methodology/Technique - Using the accounting conservatism model developed by Basu (1997), the authors compare firm conservatism before and after the adoption of the IFRS. The sample includes companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange between 2006 and 2016. There are 3.742 firm-years that consist of 394 companies from various industrial sectors. The data is analyzed using a Pooled Least Square method. Findings - The results show that conservatism was high prior to the adoption of the IFRS. Further, accounting earnings are more sensitive to the negative return than to the positive return before the adoption of the IFRS. However, in the post-adoption period, sensitivity to negative return has decreased. This means that the adoption of the IFRS has reduced levels of conservatism. The Indonesian Accounting Standard Authority may rely on these results to evaluate the mandatory policy of IFRS. Novelty - This study explores the prevalence of conservatism within firms prior to, and following, the adoption of the IFRS using longitudinal data.
M48|Information Asymmetry in the Post-IFRS Adoption Period: Evidence from Developing Countries|Objective - The adoption of IFRS aims to reduce the level of information asymmetry. Prior studies conducted in developed countries prove that the adoption of IFRS enhances transparency and diminishes information asymmetry. However, in developing countries with a low level of openness, limited regulation, and more centralized ownership, the ability of IFRS to reduce information asymmetry remains unknown. To address this issue, this study aims to investigate whether IFRS adoption will reduce information asymmetry in some developing countries in South East Asia. Methodology/Technique - This research is applied in three developing countries: Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand. Information asymmetry is proxied by the cost of capital using the Easton model (2004) and a bid-ask spread. Listed firms from the three countries are selected as the research sample resulting in 5.313 firm-years for the period between 2007 and 2016. Findings - This study concludes that the adoption of the IFRS decreases information asymmetry in developing countries. These finding confirm that the benefit of the adoption is the same as in developed countries, despite the level of law enforcement in developing countries being lower. Managers, standard authorities and investors must note that the IFRS conveys benefits to the market, which increases transparency by asking lower returns and valuing company stocks appropriately. Novelty - This study examines the benefits of the adoption of the IFRS in reducing information asymmetry in some emerging countries to enhance the generalization of the results from prior studies that are mostly conducted in developed countries.
M48|Free to choose: Do voluntary audit reforms increase employment growth?|Many European countries have abolished mandatory audits for small firms to reduce the regulatory and administrative burden for these firms. However, we still lack knowledge on whether such legislative changes affect employment growth for those firms that become free to choose to have external audits. We investigate this question using a Swedish reform that made audits voluntary for small firms fulfilling certain requirements. The reform created an almost ideal natural experiment, which we use to evaluate the effects of voluntary audits on employment growth for small firms using a difference-in-difference estimator. We find that firms which fulfilled the requirements for voluntary auditing, compared to a control group of similar firms that did not, increased their employment growth rate by 0.39%. This corresponds to 1,830 jobs being created in the year following the reform, suggesting that mandatory audits act as a growth barrier for small firms.
M48|Do audited firms have lower cost of debt?|The purpose of this study is to investigate if audited financial statements add value for firms in the private debt market. Using an instrumental variable method, we find that firms with audited financial statements, on average, save 1.26 percentage points on cost of debt compared to firms with unaudited financial statements. We also find that using the big, well-known auditing firms does not yield additional cost of debt benefits. Lastly, we find that the effect of audit on cost of debt varies between industries. As such, we find that firms in industries that have been identified in previous studies to have a more complex information structure, and therefore more complex auditing process, also save more on cost of debt relative to other industries when audited.
M48|Optimal vs satisfactory transparency: The impact of global macroeconomic fluctuations on corporate competitiveness|Being able to separate temporary global macroeconomic influences – caused by fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and inflation – from intrinsic performance – related to a superior product, production process or management – is crucial to assessing the development of a firm’s competiveness. Against that background, this paper analyzes institutions’ role in making firms supply outside shareholders with relevant information corresponding to satisfactory transparency from the shareholder perspective. Based on a sample of the 100 largest public European firms, it is found that no firm provided information to a level deemed satisfactory by the outside shareholder. One explanation may be that optimal transparency for the firm does not equal satisfactory transparency for the outside shareholder. However, the implementation of IFRS/IAS 1 in the EU as of 2005 and a company’s international cross-listing activities exhibit associations with a better supply of information and a narrowing of the gap. Shareholders in the Anglo-Saxon corporate governance system are provided with more relevant information than those in other corporate governance systems. The paper adds to the literature on the role of institutions in international corporate governance, with a particular focus on information asymmetries in an international business context.
M48|Systematic Systemic Stress Tests|For a given set of banks, which economic and financial scenarios will lead to big losses? How big can losses in such scenarios possibly get? These are the two central questions of macro stress tests. We believe that most current macro stress testing models have deficits in answering these questions. They select stress scenarios in a way which might leave aside many dangerous scenarios and thus create an illusion of safety; and which might consider highly implausible scenarios and thus trigger a false alarm. With respect to loss evaluation most stress tests do not include tools to analyse systemic risk arising from the interactions of banks with each other and with the markets. We make a conceptual proposal how these shortcomings may be addressed and how stress tests could be made both systematic and systemic. We demonstrate the application of our concepts using publicly available data on European banks and capital markets, in particular the EBA 2016 stress test results.
M48|Evolutions and tendencies regarding the Romanian transfer pricing legislation: is there a need for change?|In the context of internationalization and globalization of businesses an important attention has been paid to the transfer pricing legislation. Moreover, starting with 2016 Romania has adopted new transfer pricing regulations which have a significant impact on the groups of companies. Therefore, one of the objectives of our research was to analyse the Romanian transfer pricing legislation in order to capture an evolution of it. To achieve this objective we performed a comparison between Order 222/2008 and Order 442/2016. Other objectives of the research were to capture the perception of the tax specialists about the transfer pricing subject and the Romanian related legislation, especially about the new regulations and to identify if there is necessary a change in the Romanian transfer pricing legislation. To achieve these two objectives, the main investigative tool used was a questionnaire distributed to members of the Romanian Chamber of Tax Consultants. The collection of the information based on questionnaire was conducted in the period 11 – 27 June 2016. The study’s results show that the Romanian transfer pricing legislation contains some efficient regulations, but however it needs some changes which would contribute to a better prevention of the base erosion and profit shifting between multinationals and which would avoid any misunderstandings and possible disputes between taxpayers and tax authorities.
M48|The new era of expected credit loss provisioning|"Following the Great Financial Crisis, accounting standard setters have required banks and other companies to provision against loans based on expected credit losses. While the rules adopted by the two main standard-setting bodies differ, banks must in both cases provision for expected credit losses from the time a loan is originated, rather than awaiting ""trigger events"" signalling imminent losses. In the short term, provisions may rise but the impact on regulatory capital is expected to be limited. However, the new rules are likely to alter the behaviour of banks in credit downturns, potentially dampening procyclicality. Banks, supervisors and market participants must prepare for their respective roles in implementing the new approach and assessing its impact."
M48|Economic And Social Environment - Global Outlook 2016 And Beyond|The aim of the paper is to provide a perspective on the current economic situation through a brief analysis of the economic environment and main macroeconomic indicators. Today's economy shows a moderate improvement, with a more gradual growth in emerging markets and developing countries and a modest growth in advanced economies. Prospects are showing that the total economy output will still remain under the pre-crisis levels and countries must take into account many challenges like high unemployment rates, geopolitical issues and need for a high quality life.
M48|How cultural and contextual variables affect the disclosure and transparency of pro-forma indicators|The paper analyses how company-specific financial factors and country-specific institutional and cultural factors affect the extent to which companies disclose Non-GAAP Financial Measures (NGFMs) in their financial communications. Our study is based on the analysis of 1,731 quarterly financial reports from 120 companies located in 23 countries and listed in Standard & Poor’s Global Oil Index. The results provide evidence that supports both the informative theory on NGFMs (asserting that NGFMs are disclosed to provide the investors with higher quality information) and the opportunistic theory (affirming that NGFMs are disclosed to mislead investors). On one side we see that highly indebted companies more frequently disclose NGFMs, but they are conservative in their adjustments, which is consistent with the informative theory. On the other side, low profitability is a driver of positive adjustments providing evidence of an opportunistic behaviour. The regulation on NGFMs has a positive effect on disclosure and does not increase conservatism. It increases the transparency of adjustments, but more in a formal way than substantially. Also the specific set of accounting standards adopted has a relevant effect on the disclosure of NGFMs. The cultural factors play a role partially consistent with this theory, but on average their impact is negligible. Our study was the first to analyse the use of NGFMs including companies from different continents and considering the impact of cultural variables. From a theoretical point of view, the results provide evidence that an informative and opportunistic use of NGFMs coexist and that different factors (mainly company-specific financial factors and institutional factors) lead to different practices. From a practical point of view the analysis provides interesting evidence for the evolution of regulations on NGFMs.
M48|Opportunism in disclosing pro-forma indicators: rationale and contextual drivers|The paper examines the impact of the institutional context and the regulation on the disclosure of non-GAAP indicators (NGIs), with a focus on the adoption of NGIs for opportunistic purposes. We firstly discuss the concept of opportunism and the approaches to discover opportunistic behaviours in the adjustment process. Then, we define a new procedure in three steps to highlight opportunistic behaviours. Based on a sample of 120 international listed companies, from 23 countries included in the S&P Global Oil Index, we employ logistic panel regression models to test our hypotheses about the role of the institutional context in affecting opportunism. First results suggest that while strong institutional contexts (developed market, high-quality legal system, protection for minority shareholders, common law system) reduce the disclosure of NGIs, they increase opportunistic behaviours. Moreover, the introduction of a regulation on NGIs increases the general disclosure of adjusted measures, but it does not moderate the opportunistic use of NGIs. Our research contributes to the non-GAAP literature providing a practical approach for measuring opportunism in NGIs disclosure. At the same time, the results provide useful insights to regulators and standard setters about the role and the effectiveness of regulations on NGIs in different institutional contexts.
M48|Taxing Intellectual Property in the Global Economy: A Plea for Regulated and Internationally Coordinated Profit Splitting|Inter-country equity in the taxation of IP is a contentious issue. With its BEPS initiative, the OECD aims at taxing in accordance with value creation even though there are admitted difficulties in determining the actual place of value creation. The European Commission promotes the introduction of unitary taxation. The proposal’s drawback is that it lacks incentive compatibility in information exchange. Furthermore, it stipulates a cost-dependent apportionment of the common consolidated corporate tax base that incentivizes locating R&D in low-tax countries. Against this background, this paper makes a case for an internationally regulated split of the profit earned with imported IP.
M48|Quality enhancements in Government Finance Statistics since the introduction of the euro - Econometric evidence|This paper reviews the development of the quality of the main fiscal data released through the Excessive Deficit Procedures (EDP) since the euro's introduction. As such, this paper presents the outcome of various econometric tests based on all the vintages of the annual main fiscal data (deficit, change in debt) to assess whether qualitative progress took place over the years. Sound Government Financial Statistics (GFS) data are indeed crucial in the context of the fiscal surveillance carried out in the EU. Therefore, we find it useful to carry out a study responding to former criticisms which pointed out that Member States were beautifying their fiscal data and especially their first notified deficit. It was often assumed that Member States could abuse the initial recording of components which bridge the deficit to the change in debt (the so-called deficit-debt adjustments components). To assess this qualitative development properly, the study goes beyond the simple description of the revisions. It proposes innovative ways to identify whether each step of the revision is caused by the upward change in deficit. The study also seeks to better identify the datasets which triggered the qualitative progress observed. JEL Classification: H81, M48
M48|Why Company Should Adopt Integrated Reporting?|Sustainability and transparency issues have been evolving the nature of corporate reporting. On these issues stakeholders are very keen to get access financial and nonfinancial information on companies’ business activities and sustainable value creation. Despite availability of information, yet many stakeholders cannot use pertinently the disclosed information due to separation of reports. Thus, “Integrated Report” brings together financial and nonfinancial measure in one-piece of the report. It also shows the links among financial and nonfinancial performance metrics. This paper highlights integrated reporting as the holistic reporting approach for company and discusses the potentiality of a single report. Specifically, what integrated report can do for companies and stakeholder, for instance, integrated report for sustainability and corporate social responsibility reporting, improvement in stakeholder engagement process and integrated thinking lead to changes in corporate behaviour as well as for enchancing reputation and performance. Hence, the paper justifies reasons why companies should adopt integrated reporting as reporting tools.
M48|Earnings and Dividend Announcements: Are They Interactive? Evidence from the French Context|In this study, we examine abnormal stock returns surrounding contemporaneous earnings and dividend announcements in order to shed more light on the substantive relationship between these two financial signals. Our focus is to investigate the possible complementary or substitutive effect on a sample of French firms. The empirical evidence indicates that information content of dividends should be examined jointly with earnings announcement. The coefficients of all the dummy variables are uniformly negative and significant above the 1% confidence level. These results are inconsistent with those of Kane et al. (1984). The significant coefficients support the corroboration hypothesis showing a negative interaction between earnings and dividends. This evidence suggests that investors evaluate the two announcements as two offsetting effects in order to meet any unexpected change in the firm’s financial policy.
M48|Religion and mergers and acquisitions contracting: The case of earnout agreements|This paper contributes to the growing literature on the effect of religion on corporate decision making. We posit that contingent payment in mergers and acquisitions not only violates Islamic law but also results in several agency issues by creating an incentive for managers to participate in long-term value-destroying behavior during earnout periods. Our empirical results, using regression as well as difference-in-difference estimation, show that target managers significantly manage earnings upward by cutting discretionary expenses during earnout periods. As compared to a sample of matched non-earnout M&A, acquisitions with earnout clauses are followed by significantly lower long-term abnormal returns. Our arguments and results have significant economic and legal consequences on cross-border M&A and could be used to facilitate worldwide economic integration.
M48|Sustainability-oriented Business Model Innovation: Context and Drivers|This study outlines a systemic review of the social and economic transformations that have been inducing the business to reconsider its traditional strategies and innovate to become sustainable. In doing so, the study adopts an original approach, focusing on the evolution in the socio-economic context, imposed by globalisation first and by the Great Recession afterwards. Hence, the review covers a wide range of literature and subjects, including political science, sociology, economics, finance and strategic management. Departing from the contextual picture, the study identifies the main drivers of the innovation of the business models, from the adoption of voluntary standards to the acknowledgement of the need to lengthen strategic time horizons. What emerges from the review is that, if business’ primary concern was initially to safeguard its declining reputation under competitive pressure, it perceives sustainability today as a necessary condition to survive the deep transformation of the economy.
M48|Corporate Governance, Financial Ratios, Political Risk and Financial Distress, A Survival Analysis|""".Objective – The objective of this study was to investigate the factors like corporate governance, financial ratios, and political risk and their impacts on company’s survival. Methodology/Technique – Collecting data of Indonesian Stock Exchange from 2000 to 2014 and employing purposive random sampling, this research collects samples of 58 companies undergoing financial distress and 275 others which do not. Findings – The research eventually proves that agency theory and Asymmetric Information theory do occur in Indonesia. With Cox Proportional Hazard model, it then proves that all two models employed: independence commissioners, leverage, operating risk, size, return on asset and control of corruption, are variables which consistently affect financial distress of the company. Novelty – The study uses original data and gives supported suggestion for the researched issues."""
M48|E-Government as an Anti-Corruption Tool: Experience from Indonesia|Objective – Transparency is promoted as one of the most important measures against corruption. E-government provides greater access to information that can subsequently increase transparency, accountability, and be used as an effective anti-corruption tool. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between e-government and corruption. Methodology/Technique – To gain more insight, we also investigate the effect of e-procurement as one of the egovernment initiatives for tackling corruption. We use observations from local government (districts and cities) in Indonesia during the period 2012–2015. Findings – The results show that e-government implementation is associated with lower corruption. E-government reduces corruption by removing discretion, thereby curbing the opportunities for arbitrary action that often result in corruption. Novelty – Moreover, the results also show that adopting e-procurement increases transparency and accountability through increased competition among bidders and enables real-time access to information, which ultimately reduces corruption in public procurement.
M48|Is the SEC Captured? Evidence from Comment-Letter Reviews|SEC oversight of publicly listed firms ranges from comment letter (CL) reviews of firms' reporting compliance to pursuing enforcement actions against violators. Prior literature finds that firm political connections (PC) negatively predict enforcement actions, inferring SEC capture. We present new evidence that firm PC positively predict CL reviews and substantive characteristics of such reviews, including the number of issues evaluated and the seniority of SEC staff involved. These results, robust to identification concerns, are inconsistent with SEC capture and indicate a more nuanced relation between firm PC and SEC oversight than previously suggested.
M48|The Role of Overbilling in Hospitals’ Earnings Management Decisions|This paper examines the role of overbilling in hospitals' earnings management choices. Overbilling by hospitals is a form of revenue manipulation that involves misclassifying a patient into a diagnosis-related group that yields higher reimbursement. As overbilling allows hospitals to increase revenues without altering operations, affecting costs, or having to reverse such behavior in the future, I propose and find that overbilling reduces hospitals' use of managing accruals or cutting discretionary expenditures. Next, I find that hospital managers prefer overbilling to managing accruals (cutting discretionary expenditures) when cutting discretionary expenditures (managing accruals) is constrained, and vice versa. Collectively, my findings suggest that overbilling is an important alternative manipulation tool in hospitals.
M48|減損会計は企業投資行動に影響を及ぼすか|減損会計とは、企業が保有する資産価値が減少した場合に、当該資産の貸借対照表上の価額を減らすとともに、減損分を利益額から差し引く会計上の取扱いである。日本では、固定資産の減損会計基準が2005年度から強制適用されたが、景気低迷期にその導入が議論されたこともあり、負の影響を懸念する見方も多かった。一方、先行研究の多くは、減損会計を含む保守的な会計基準には効率的な投資を促す効果があるとしている。本稿では、2000年度から2014年度における上場企業のパネルデータを用い、減損会計が企業の設備投資や土地購入・売却行動に及ぼす影響を調べた結果、以下の点を見出した。第1に、減損計上企業と非計上企業とを比較すると、設備投資率や土地購入率に有意な違いがない場合が多い。第2に、保有土地の時価簿価比率で表される含み益は設備投資率を高める効果を持つが、減損計上の有無は、含み益と設備投資率との関係には影響しない。第3に、減損計上企業における土地売却率は減損計上しない企業における土地売却率を上回る。この傾向は、利益率が上昇傾向にある企業においてより強く観察されており、財務に比較的余裕のある企業が減損の生じている土地を売却して損金を計上するという税務上の動機に基づいた行動の結果である可能性がある。
M48|Impact Of The Federal Law For Prevention And Identification Of Operations With Illegal Resources To Taxpayers Who Develop Vulnerable Activities, Impacto De La Ley Federal Para La Prevención E Identificación De Operaciones Con Recursos De Procedencia Ilícita A Contribuyentes Que Desarrollan Actividades Vulnerables|This research examines the impact of the Federal Law for the Prevention and Identification of operations with illegal proceeds (LFPIORPI) in Mexico. This law imposes administrative obligations on taxpayers who develop vulnerable activities. It is a joint research. Analytical methods are used whenever the nature of the law of each vulnerability analysis activity is required. The type of study is exploratory, descriptive and explanatory. The design of the instrument was based on article seventeen of the LFPIORPI (2013), which lists fifteen vulnerable activities. In some cases there are subgroups of these activities. A sign of intentional type 20 taxpayers operating in the construction industry in the city of Puebla Mexico was applied through the website “easy survey”. The research instrument allowed the detection of reasons for the incorrect interpretation and enforcement. We find the current bill in the Chamber of Deputies, accurately observed the ongoing review of the LFPIORPI. It does not propose an independent autonomous body to monitor compliance with it.
M48|Foreign ownership and financial reporting quality in private subsidiaries|In a sample of large private Spanish subsidiaries, we find that the magnitude ofdiscretionary accruals is significantly higher when the parent company is foreign thanwhen it is local. Our tests support the thesis of recent research on earnings management strategies within multinational corporations (MNCs), suggesting that the parent company’s incentives underlie the observed negative relation between foreignownership and financial reporting quality at the subsidiary level. In particular, weobserve that: (1) the tenure of the controlling shareholder has a negative incrementaleffect on financial reporting quality in firms under foreign control, but not insubsidiaries of local groups; and (2) the negative association between foreign ownershipand financial reporting quality is mainly driven by the subsample of subsidiaries withparent companies located in countries with higher institutional quality than Spain.
M48|Does Board Gender Diversity Influence Financial Performance? Evidence from Spain|Abstract In recent years, several countries have enacted guidelines and/or mandatory laws to increase the presence of women on the boards of companies. Through these regulatory interventions, the aim is to eradicate the social and labor grievances that women have traditionally experienced and which has relegated them to smaller-scale jobs. Nevertheless, and despite the advances achieved, the female representation in the boardroom remains far from the desired levels. In this context, it is now necessary to enhance the advantages of board gender diversity from both ethical and economic points of view. This article examines the relation between board gender diversity and economic results in Spain: the second country in the world to legally require gender quotas in boardrooms and historically characterized by a minimal female participation in the workforce. Based on a sample of 125 non-financial firms listed on the Madrid Stock Exchange from 2005 to 2009, our findings show that in the period analyzed the increase of the number of women on boards was over 98 %. This suggests that compulsory legislation offers an efficient framework to execute the recommendation of Spanish codes of good governance by means of the increase in the number of women in the boards of firms. Furthermore, we find that the increase in the number of women on the boards is positively related to higher economic results. Therefore, both results suggest that gender diversity in boardrooms should be incremented, mandatory laws being a key factor to do so.
M48|Recognized intangibles and the present value of growth options|Abstract We investigate the relation of recognized intangibles, defined as acquired intangibles net of goodwill, and the market’s perception of firm growth options (PVGO). We find that: (a) on average recognized intangibles are positively associated with PVGO after controlling for intangible expenditures immediately expensed, firm specific characteristics, industry membership and systematic risk (b) the said relation is highly non-linear (negatively skewed) and more strongly pronounced in companies with lower accumulation of R&D Capital; recognized intangibles are not that significant at higher levels of PVGO and whereas firms have committed to in-house technological development, and (c) while adjusted levels of recognized intangibles increase approximately tenfold over the last 35 years their explanatory power to PVGO over the period generally wanes. Our results are informative for the interpretation of recognized intangibles as a summary balance sheet item and therefore useful to users of financial statements forming investment and credit decisions, to policy makers aiming at stimulating firm growth and to standard setters aiming at improving value relevance.
M48|Effect of capitalizing operating leases on credit ratings: Evidence from Japan|The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of constructively capitalizing operating leases on credit ratings in Japan. In particular, this study investigates whether and how a credit rating agency considers operating lease information when determining credit ratings. First, this study shows that constructively capitalized operating leases are associated with credit ratings. Second, this study finds that the associations between operating leases versus finance leases and credit ratings are not substantially different. However, when operating lease disclosures are less reliable, this study finds that operating leases are not associated with credit ratings and that the risk relevance of operating leases is substantially different from that of finance leases. This study reports that the reliability of accounting information has significant effects on the risk relevance of operating leases. These results indicate that a credit rating agency considers operating lease information in determining credit ratings to the extent that this information is reliable. This study contributes to the literature on the usefulness of operating lease disclosures and to the discussions on the global convergence of accounting standards.
M48|Does Recognition versus Disclosure Affect Risk Relevance? Evidence from Finance Leases in Japan|This study examines the risk relevance of recognized versus disclosed finance leases in Japan. In particular, this study investigates whether and why equity investors treat recognized finance lease obligations differently from disclosed finance lease obligations when assessing firms’ equity risk. This study shows that recognized finance leases are associated with equity risk but that disclosed finance leases are not. Moreover, the relations between recognized versus disclosed finance leases and equity risk are substantially different. However, for firms with higher levels of institutional ownership, the risk relevance of disclosed finance leases is similar to the risk relevance of recognized finance leases. These results suggest that institutional investors are more sophisticated at processing disclosed finance leases and treat ing disclosed and recognized finance leases similarly when assessing firms’ equity risk. This study provides the evidence that investors’ information processing has significant effects on the risk relevan ce of lease arrangements. This study contributes to the accounting literature on recognition versus disclosure and to the discussions on the global convergence of accounting standards.
M48|The role of comprehensive income in predicting banks’ future earnings|Research background: In the economic literature there are many arguments presented by critical supporters and opponents of measuring and reporting comprehensive income. There is a justified need to examine the relevance and usefulness of comprehensive income, especially the predictive power of comprehensive income for forecasting future earnings. It may be assumed that the comprehensive income has a better predictive power for future bank performance than net income, because this measure includes many elements, presented in the statement of changes in equity. Purpose of the article: The major subject in this paper is the evaluation of the usefulness of comprehensive income for predicting banks’ future earnings. Realization of the fundamental objective of this paper was centered around the main research hypothesis, stating that in economic practice of banks listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange it can be assumed that there is a positive predictive power of financial result in forecasting financial standing of these entities. Methodology/methods: The research comprised bank joint-stock companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (qualified on 15.09.2016). Empirical data for the study was obtained from the quarterly financial statements (the period from 2009 to 2015) from EMIS. The research method was the regression analysis conducted by means of Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and by two regression models in two versions. Findings & Value added: The research showed that the analyzed bank companies were characterized by a diversity usefulness of comprehensive income for predicting banks’ future earnings. Nevertheless, it must be stressed that the calculated Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients confirm in most instances a positive character of dependence between the comprehensive income and future return ratios. The results of the estimation of econometric models shows the positive association of comprehensive income with future profitability of banks.
M48|Earnings Management Dynamics in Portuguese Listed Firms|This study examines earnings management dynamics in Portuguese listed firms. It provides evidence consistent with firms using accrual and real management as substitutes. Besides, the use of each strategy appears to depend on its relative cost. This investigation also points to the existence of a trade-off between derivatives use and the magnitude of earnings management. Furthermore, the impact of both earnings management and derivatives use on effective tax rates is examined. The results indicate that, if the tax function is convex, firms can reduce tax expenses by hedging with derivatives. This research also explores how earnings management practices are related with a set of market and financial incentives, while controlling for earnings management constraints. Meeting dividend thresholds seems to be the most relevant incentive for firms to manage earnings upward.
M48|Bank Loan Loss Provisions Research: A Review|We review several observations in the bank loan loss provisioning literature to identify and discuss several advances in the literature and to suggest possible directions for future research in the literature. We address several issues including the ethical dimensions of income smoothing, motivations and constrains to income smoothing, methodological issues in the bank loan loss provisions literature and the dynamic loan loss provisioning experiment. We identify some challenges in the literature and proffer directions for future research.
M48|Preparation and disclosure of non-financial statement based on the new Bulgarian accountancy act|As a result of a new Bulgarian Accountancy Act, adopted in late 2015, public interest entities must prepare and publish a non-financial statement. The main objective of the paper is to analyze the existing definitions of the public interest entities and to develop a new one. In addition, the author of the paper aims to analyze the current legal framework regarding the structure and content of non-financial statement. The main object of the study are public interest entities. The main subject of the paper is the non-financial statement.
M48|Достоверното Счетоводно Дефиниране На Научноизследователската И Развойна Дейност<BR>[Defining and interpreting the term research and development for accounting purposes]|The process of planning the research activities that are included within the scope of an innovative project is a complex and multi-layered one. At the end of this process an intangible asset is developed. For the purposes of a successful innovation the intangible asset must be properly valued and priced. It is mainly associated with the proper accounting of the expenditures within the scope of R&D. The thesis that the author advocate is that for the proper accounting of the intangible asset it is important to clearly distinguish the activities that are included at the research and the development phase.

M48|Управленски Аспекти На Счетоводната Обезценка На Търговската Репутация<BR>[Management Aspects of the Impairment of Goodwill]|Редица автори формулират сред основните детерминанти при признаване на счетоводна обезценка на репутацията качеството на корпоративното управление и частните мотиви на изпълнителните директори и главните мениджъри на компаниите. Съществуват достатъчно емпирични изследвания, които показват, че връзката между размера на признатата репутация и размера на бонусите на мениджмънта е значима. Съществуващата методика за обезценка на репутацията, показва, че в значителна степен тестът за обезценка е базиран на различни управленски решения и очаквания, свързани с функционирането на предприятието след бизнескомбинацията, което води до възможности за манипулиране на тестовете за обезценка на репутацията, а от тук и на финансовите резултати от дейността на предприятието като цяло. English Abstract: Many authors formulate the quality of corporate governance and the private motives of executive directors and chief executives of companies as the main determinants in recognizing accounting impairment of goodwill. There is enough empirical research to show that there is a significant relationship between the amount of recognized goodwill and the amount of management bonuses. The current methodology for impairment of goodwill shows that, to a significant extent, the impairment test is based on various management decisions and expectations related to the operation of the entity after the business combination, which leads to opportunities to manipulate the impairment tests of goodwill and the financial performance of the enterprise as a whole.
M48|Image, Credibility and Reputation: Perceptions of Deceitful Corporate Communication in the Classroom|In 2013, Drummond Ltd., a coal mining company, concealed and lied about the occurrence of a major coal spill on Colombia’s northern coast. In light of a pedagogical exercise in an executive education context, this paper analyzes international observers’ perceptions about the deceitful behavior of this multinational company when communicating with stakeholders after the mentioned accident took place. I do it by testing three constructs—perceived corporate image, credibility, and reputation—on a two-round basis, i.e., before and after the revelation of the company’s deception through its official ex-post communications. For that to happen, a combined exercise of group-based inquiries and individual self-administered surveys was performed. Respondents were 174 professionals of diverse nationalities and backgrounds, all of them enrolled in several graduate programs at an accredited French school of business. When both moments of measurement were compared, results showed a clear decrease in the mean value of all three constructs, but an increment in variability of responses. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in light of the effects of deception in corporate communication, and the importance of this topic for the managerial education in general.
M48|Companies’ Characteristics and the Choice of Hedge Accounting for Derivatives Reporting: Evidence from Malaysian Listed Companies|This paper investigates the adoption of hedge accounting by Malaysian listed companies in reporting their use of derivatives for hedging activities. Based on a sample of 300 Malaysian listed companies, we found that only 162 companies (54 percent) used derivatives to hedge their financial risks exposure and only 30 percent of the companies chose to apply hedge accounting. In addition, this study examines the relationship between the company specific characteristics and their application of hedge accounting. The logistic regression results showed that the decision to apply hedge accounting by Malaysian companies is positively influenced by the company size and leverage. The implications of the findings were discussed.
M48|Disclosure of Information in Company’s Annual Reports: A Bibliometric Analysis|This study evaluated the development of research publications towards the disclosure of information in companies’ annual reports. The aim of this study is to provide a preliminary source of references for related scholars interested in research mapping in this field. By using several bibliometric indicators, all research publications related to the disclosure of information in the companies’ annual reports in the online Web of Science (ISI Thomson Reuters) database were analysed. The authorship, number of citations, journal sources, publishers, institutions, and countries, year of publication, categories, and author keywords were examined. The results of these analyses were underlined and discussed.
M48|Telaah Kepemilikan Kebenaran Ilmiah Pada Pengembangan Pengetahuan Akuntansi<BR>[Review Of Scientific Truth Ownership On Development Of Accounting Knowledge]|This article aims to examine the conflicting paradigm in accounting research and development from the point of view of the philosophy of science. Each adherent is both mainstream and alternative, assuming that their point of view is the most scientific approach and more suitable for developing the discipline of accounting scholarship. This article also agrees on the use of a multiparadigm approach as a space for researchers so that it does not have to be trapped in a single point of view, it would be better to paradigm each other interact and synergize to produce strength. Accounting research and development can be approached from the point of view of the philosophy of science. From any point of view the paradigm used in researching and developing whether the mainstream or accounting alternative is a product of knowledge that has no absolute truth, so it is not necessary to differentiate the way of view in researching accounting into a contradiction that can negate the essence of epistemology, ontology, and axiology
M48|Bank Earnings Smoothing, Audit Quality and Procyclicality in Africa: The Case of Loan Loss Provisions|This paper empirically examine whether the way African banks use loan loss provisions to smooth earnings is influenced by capital market motivations and the type of auditor after controlling for non-discretionary determinants of loan loss provisions and fluctuations in the business cycle. The findings support the income smoothing hypothesis and indicate that (i) African banks use loan loss provisions to smooth reported earnings; (ii) listed African banks use loan loss provisions to smooth earnings to a greater extent than non-listed African banks possibly for capital market reasons; (iii) income smoothing via loan loss provisions is not reduced among African banks with Big 4 auditor; and (iv) bank provisioning in Africa is procyclical with fluctuations in the business cycle. The findings have three implications. One, listed African banks smooth income because they are more visible to investors and investors do not view stock price fluctuation as a good signal. Securities market regulators in African countries should enforce strict disclosure rules that reduce earnings smoothing practices in order to improve the transparency of banks’ reported earnings in the region. Two, the presence of Big 4 auditor did not improve the informativeness of loan loss provisions estimates among African banks. Three, the evidence for procyclical provisioning suggest the need for dynamic loan loss provisioning system in Africa.
M48|Budgeting and governance in Tanzanian Local Government Authorities|This paper explores how budgeting contributes towards governance in the context of local government authorities (LGAs) in Tanzania. The study sought to examine the relationship from the perspectives of the local government stakeholders, namely councilors, local and central government executives and members of the parliamentary committee responsible for LGAs. Hence an interpretive methodology was adopted and grounded theory procedures (Strauss and Corbin, 1998) were employed in gathering and analyzing data. Data was collected in two LGAs through document review, interviews, and passive participant observation over a period of four months.The study revealed interplay between the stakeholders' perceptions of roles in local governance and budgetary practices. Budgeting was considered by all the stakeholders as a mechanism that facilitated discharge of the perceived roles in governance. Also budgetary practices influenced perceptions of their roles in governance. Such interplay is mainly shaped by the stakeholders? perspectives on governance and the nature of power relationship among these groups. Also of importance were the stakeholders? perceptions of governance, organizational arrangement, knowledge possessed by the groups of participants, policies and regulations, dependence on central government funding, availability of local revenue, interests of the stakeholders in the budgeting process, and availability of reliable and understandable budget information. Emergent findings also show that the interplay generates preferences for different budgetary practices amongst the local government stakeholders as well as development in such practices. The study makes theoretical, practical and policy contributions.
M48|The Internal Control Management Development Strategy in Romania|The internal control management means all the forms of control exercised at the public entity, including internal audit, established by the management in accordance with its objectives and legal regulations in order to provide fund administration economically, efficiently and effectively; it also includes the organizational structures, methods, and procedures. The phrase, â€œinternal control managementâ€ emphasizes the responsibility of all hierarchical levels for controlling all internal processes undertaken in order to achieve its general and specific objectives. The internal control management development strategy prioritizes managerial responsibility and ensures that the implemented internal control management systems are adequate and prevent or limit errors and fraud.
M48|La gestione finanziaria nelle imprese di costruzioni.Riflessioni da unâ€™analisi empirica|The construction sector in Italy has been characterised by a long-lasting economic decline, causing a slump both in terms of GDP and employment. The financial management of this type of companies can be claimed as one of the main difficulties they have to cope with. The high reliance on short-term bank loan, the long payment delays by public administration, together with the lack of planning capabilities can explain partly the financial difficulties encountered. In this paper, we aim at shedding some light on the financial management practices and knowledge diffused in the Italian construction companies. Besides, we provide some reflections on the actual and future financial strategy for construction companies.
M48|The evolution of the conceptual basis for the assessment of urban mobility sustainability impacts|In this paper we highlight the evolution of both the conceptual basis and the methodological approaches for the sustainability assessment of transport and urban mobility. Through the review of key contributions in the field we highlight the significant shift in perspective that has occurred over the ast two decades, characterized by a series of changes in the development of urban mobility patterns. erspectives, goals and strategies evolved to the point that they represent an actual shift in the paradigm, i.e. a change in the points of reference for conceiving an urban mobility system. The theoretical oundations for the evaluation of sustainability impacts have changed accordingly, flanking the emphasis on the environmental impact with an increasing attention to the social and economic impacts. Although ragmented, the literature on urban mobility principles and development provides useful insights on the rationale behind the above mentioned shift in the paradigm. We review such literature outlining the major traits of the studies regarding sustainable mobility that emerged over time. Second, we focus on the two ain perspectives (that we label principles oriented and planning oriented) that shaped the way sustainable urban mobility is conceived today.
M48|The relationship between corporate governance and tax avoidance - evidence from Germany using a regression discontinuity design|This paper analyses the relationship between corporate governance and tax avoidance. We use a regression discontinuity design (RDD) in a two-stage instrumental variable and take advantage of the exogenous variation in the index membership around the DAX and MDAX threshold. We suppose the differences in corporate governance result from the valueweighted composition of the market capitalization-based indexes. We find a significant discontinuity in the level of the corporate governance characteristics at the cutoff. The largest MDAX firms show stronger corporate governance characteristics compared to the smallest DAX firms. Our analysis shows that strong corporate governance characteristics drive down the effective tax rate for the DAX firms. This paper contributes to existing research by establishing a causal relationship between governance and taxes. This research aims to highlight the wide-ranging effects of institutional investors, which channel in corporate policy, in our case tax management.
M48|Review on tax research in accounting: Is the information given by U.S. GAAP income taxes also provided by IFRS?|In this paper, we present a review of tax research in accounting. We outline U.S. GAAP accounting rules for the following four income tax notes and survey the area of research literature dealing with the information content provided by U.S. GAAP: (1) unrecognized tax benefits, (2) valuation allowances, (3) foreign earnings designated as permanently reinvested, and (4) book-tax differences. Building on this, we present the accounting rules for comparable income tax notes following IFRS standards and offer which we believe are interesting avenues for future research on the information on tax notes provided by IFRS financial statements.
M48|Tax consultants' incentives: A game-theoretic investigation into the behavior of tax consultants, taxpayers, and the tax authority in a setting of tax complexity|We propose a game-theoretic investigation to capture the interplay between the behavior of tax consultants, taxpayers, and the tax authority in a setting of tax complexity. Our purpose is to provide answers to two research questions: Which aspects of the strategic interaction between the players induce tax consultants to provide inaccurate consulting services? How can we change the incentive structure in order to improve tax consulting quality? We find that tax consultants can be best motivated to work accurately by exogenously increasing the probability of tax underpayment and by ensuring that the tax authority corrects both tax underpayment and tax overpayment.
M48|Capital-Market Effects of Securities Regulation: Prior Conditions, Implementation, and Enforcement|We examine the capital-market effects of changes in securities regulation in the European Union aimed at reducing market abuse and increasing transparency. To estimate causal effects for the population of E.U. firms, we exploit that for plausibly exogenous reasons, such as national legislative procedures, E.U. countries adopted these directives at different times. We find significant increases in market liquidity, but the effects are stronger in countries with stricter implementation and traditionally more stringent securities regulation. The findings suggest that countries with initially weaker regulation do not catch up with stronger countries, and that countries diverge more upon harmonizing regulation.Received August 3, 2015; accepted April 25, 2016, by Editor Andrew Karolyi.
M48|The Study On International Cooperation Made By The Romanian Professional Accountancy Bodies|Professional bodies with responsibility in regulating the accounting profession in Romania, with a vast experience in the field, such as Body of Expert and Licensed Accountants from Romania, the Chamber of Financial Auditors from Romania, Chamber of Financial Consultants from Romania, National Association of Certified Evaluators from Romania, are intensively cooperating with international bodies in order to develop accounting profession and support the accountants in providing high quality services to the public. Cooperation of the professional bodies involved in the regulation of the accounting profession has one fundamental objective: development of a strong accounting profession, able to serve the public interest, spread information and recommendations among its members, as well as providing services of the highest professional level.
M48|Considerations on the Fiscal Consequences of Accounting Result|The concepts of accounting result and the fiscal result, the manner of determining and recording in accounting have always aroused interest for different categories of users. The concept of accounting result is used by all entities compelled to submit annual financial statements, regardless of how the performance of the business is taxed, while the notion of fiscal result is only used by the entities liable to pay corporation tax. In terms of information provided by the accounting result, those are intended for a wide range of users among which shareholders, investors, financial creditors, the general public, while information given by the fiscal result are mainly intended for the government and fiscal management institutions. Both accounting result and fiscal result are determined based on revenues and expenses recorded in the accounts, while respecting accounting policies and principles and tax laws.
M48|The Importance of Accounting Information in Decision Making|In the field of accounting, economic information is of great interest, meaning that accounting information plays an important part in the economic book-keeping/registration system in general, but also in the economic information system especially for decision making necessary for the business. Although accounting information are available for a wide range of users - stakeholders (managers, employees, suppliers, customers, financial creditors, government and its institutions, the public, the media, etc.), the investors (shareholders) are recognized as the privileged users of accounting information. Four principal qualitative characteristics must be met for the accounting information to be useful in the management system: understandability, relevance, reliability and compatibility of information. Any economic transaction processing involves collecting, categorizing, summing and analyzing the data.
M48|"¿Pueden considerarse significativas las reformas fiscales de México? || Can the Tax Reforms in Mexico be Considered Significant?"|"Se establece como objetivo general, analizar la significancia estadística de cambios en la recaudación del Impuesto Sobre la Renta (ISR) y del Impuesto al Valor Agregado (IVA), a partir del año 2000 y hasta el segundo trimestre del 2015, para afirmar o no la variación en la recaudación. Para lograrlo se aplican métodos clásicos con valor crítico significante a 0,05 de alfa, pero complementándolo parámetro delta para establecer el nivel de cambio en poco significante, medianamente significante o de gran significancia. En las conclusiones se deja antecedente que a pesar de lo que parecieran como impactantes cambios en materia fiscal que pudieron haber incidido positiva o negativamente en el pago del ISR e IVA, tales como el acotamiento del régimen de consolidación fiscal, gravámenes complementarios, hasta llegar a la homologación del IVA a tasa 16% para todo el país, en la mayoría de los casos, no se obtuvo evidencia para argumentar eficiencia en la recaudación nacional. || It is the purpose of this work to analyze the significance of changes in average for the collection of value-added (VAT) and income taxes from year 2000 and up to the second quarter of 2015. To accomplish that, classic methods of significance will be applied, but contrasted with tests for the typified difference of the average, fundamental parameters of the meta-analysis Cohen's Delta. The main conclusions are that although there have been relevant changes in the tax collection process such as limits in the tax consolidation regime, complementary taxes e.g., flat rate business tax, substitute tax credit to wages, tax on cash deposits and the standardization of the VAT to 16%, there is no strong evidence to state an efficient national tax collection system."
M48|Culmination of the Powers of the State Audit Office of Hungary within the Scope of New Legislation on Public Funds|The regulatory framework serving the renewal of domestic public finances comprises the Fundamental Law and cardinal acts entering into effect following its adoption. Among cardinal acts, the first one to be adopted was the new SAO Act. In addition to its full consistency with international requirements, the act consolidated the SAO’s independence and audit powers and, by clearly declaring the publicity of reports, improved the transparency of audits. Among the SAO’s new powers, the power to sanction failure to fulfil the action planning and cooperation obligations, coupled together with general empowerment to issue administrative warnings has lent weight to the SAO’s interventions and transformed its operation. The new act also vested new roles and rights related to preparing studies and analyses in the institution, as well as performing advisory and consultative activities. The SAO is free to avail itself of these tools within regulatory provisions having as its only mandatory task to prepare analyses in support of the Fiscal Council’s work. By means of its new roles and leveraging publicity, the SAO has been effective in focusing its efforts on facilitating controlled behaviours to ensure the regular and efficient use of public funds.
M48|Contribution of the Supreme Audit Office of Poland to Legislation and Experiences of Some Other SAIs|As a result of audits performed, the Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) present recommendations, including de lege ferenda proposals. In Poland the law clearly establishes such competence, while in many countries it has been defined only indirectly. Some SAIs consider themselves as not taking part in the law making processes, in order not to be involved in anything that later can be audited. The article presents how the Supreme Audit Office of Poland (NIK) formulates de lege ferenda proposals versus the practice of other SAIs, in particular in Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia. It presents actions to ensure the quality and enhance the effectiveness of the proposals through a) formulating them adequately; b) keeping a register and listing them in the SAI annual activity report; c) examining their use in contacts with the Parliament and Government. The paper ends with a problem of a role of the NIK proposals in the law making process.
M48|EPSAS: Investment Into the Future. European Public Sector Accounting: Present and Future|At present, IPSAS – the International Public Sector Accounting Standards developed by IPSASB (the International Public Sector Accounting Standard Board) – comprises the only internationally recognised system of public sector accounting standards. Although its application is not mandatory for Member States, IPSAS plays an important role in the development and practice of public sector accounting across the European Union. Council Directive 2011/85/EU acknowledges that IPSAS – i.e. the availability of a complete and reliable set of fiscal data that is comparable across Member States – is key to the budgetary surveillance framework of the Union. The European Commission has passed a decision to establish a set of European Public Sector Accounting Standards (EPSAS) applicable across all EU Member States, and the use of IPSAS standards may provide a sound basis for this endeavour. The most significant contribution of this paper is its attempt to summarise the current status of European public sector accounting, i.e. to present the practice of public sector accounting in the European Union and to outline expected changes in the European regulation of public sector accounting in light of the harmonisation efforts in progress.
M48|How compliant is the Romanian accounting with the Europan directives and international accounting standards?|"Cultural, economic, political, religious and social differences exercises influence also at accounting level, most contradictions existing between Anglo-Saxon and continental accounting systems. European directives, as well as IFRS are not binding in law, they do not bind national courts only in terms of outcome to be achieved and leaves them free when it comes to form and means used to achieve it. The enunciated aspect explains why we are dealing with national standards (rules) considering that, not only once, legislature and specialists in the field in our country have embraced all the collocations of ""harmonization"", ""convergence"" and newer, ""compliance"" of Romanian accounting regulations with European directives, with international accounting standards, namely IFRS, by which heads all countries and contributing to the globalization of accounting. The question naturally arises, how are European directives comply with International Financial Reporting Standards? but our national accounting regulations with IFRS or European directives? To answer these questions we considered useful to undertake a comparative empirical study in the international-European-national perimeter."
M48|Zakat Accounting: Metaphor and accounting treatment for business organization|The various sources of zakat accounting are actually going to provide an answer to the question of whether the accounting capable of acting stints zakat management. Zakat accounting will provide information or data of a general nature modified technically-practical reorganized to be able to calculate the zakat that in fact contain a special purpose, such as the purification of wealth. The business organization is generally oriented to profit by using the entity (entity theory), which means that the company is a separate entity from its owners. While zakah accounting as a part of shari'a accounting affirms that a company or business organization is united with its owner, so that he has an obligation to pay zakat. Consequently, the business organization to change the orientation, from profit and stockholder-oriented to zakah-oriented, conservation of nature-oriented, and stakeholders-oriented.
M48|Fraud Detection, Conservatism and Political Economy of Whistle Blowing|This paper presents a discussion on whistle-blowing and take the view that whistle-blowing is an important fraud detection technique. A discussion of some factors that influence the whistle-blowers’ incentive to blow the whistle or to remain silent in the face of persuasive fraud red flags, is also presented. The paper suggests that the tradeoff between the cost and benefit of whistle-blowing may compel the whistle-blower to apply some degree of conservatism in their whistle-blowing activities. Also, some discussion on how whistle-blowing might be influenced by firm-level politics, country-level political economy, firm ownership and other institutional factors is presented. Finally, although the provision of incentives can increase the appeal to encourage whistle-blowing, the appeal to blow the whistle may be weakened when the whistle-blower takes into account the larger context that influence the decision to blow the whistle or to remain silent.
M48|Is Bank Supervision Effective? Evidence from the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses|I investigate whether bank supervision is effective in enforcing written rules on the estimations of the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) consistently between public and private banks, which have different intensity of incentives to misreport the ALLL. Results suggest that bank supervision of the ALLL estimations was effective between 2002 and 2012, but has become lax recently. State-chartered public banks underestimated the ALLL by about 13% annually between 2013 and 2015. Bank regulators are willing to cater to banks’ private interests when the economic environment is good and the regulatory emphasis is weak, but not during the crisis.
M48|An empirical effect of Fraud Specific Problem Representation on Accountants’ Skills and Fraud Risk Assessment|This paper examines the impact of fraud specific problem representation (FSPR) on the relationship with Accountants’ Skills Requirement (SR) and Fraud risk assessment (FRA) in the Nigerian public sector. The research methodology is quantitative with cross-sectional design and survey. The respondents are accountants (i.e. auditors and forensic accountants) in the public sector accounting and auditing institutions. The study addresses the gap in the literature by highlighting the significant influence of FSPR on SR and FRA regarding fraud detection, prevention and response. The findings from a second generation statistical analysis tool of the Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) confirm the direct relationship of accountants’ skills on fraud risk assessment. Also, a direct relationship of accountants’ skills on fraud specific problem representation, and fraud specific problem representation on fraud risk assessment and the indirect relationship of fraud specific problem representation on skills and fraud risk assessment. This study may help to enhance the regulatory, ethical, institutional and legal framework in Nigeria especially and the developing nations in general. Furthermore, it will accord support for the government transformation programme on efficient and effective public sector and capacity building of the workforce.
M48|Determinants of Internal Audit Task Performance in Nigerian Tertiary Institutions: A Conceptual Approach|The increasing rate of financial irregularities, fraud, and mismanagement rocking Nigerian Tertiary Institutions calls for concern. Despite all control measures put in place by the government, coordinating and regulating agencies, and the institutions themselves, lack of transparency and accountability continues unabated. Literature and documentary evidence have shown that lack of functional internal audit department is one of the factors responsible for the frequent occurrence of these acts. The objective of this study, therefore, is to examine conceptually management support and communication skills as the key factors affecting internal audit task performance in the Nigerian tertiary institutions. Based on the existing literature and the pronouncement of accounting and auditing professional bodies, the study develops a framework of these factors as influencing task performance. The study suggests that adequate management support and effective communication skills of internal auditors will enhance the task performance of internal audit department, hence, curbing the incidence of financial malpractices. The study has policy implications as it will assist the proprietors (government and private individuals), coordinating ministries, regulatory authorities, professional bodies, councils and management of tertiary institutions, and auditors in their decision making and oversight functions.
M48|The Moderating role of Capability Element of Fraud on Internal Industry Factors and Fraud Prevention in Saudi Arabian Banking Sector|Fraud described as an unlawful act that portrays a violation of trust, deceit, or concealment and which does not essentially rely on applying it, or physical force threatening or violence. The Internal factors inspire and dishearten fraud in the sense of outcome deliverables. This paper discusses the impact of internal industry factors such as insider involvement, internal controls, and information sharing on fraud prevention in the Saudi Arabian banking sector. Precisely, this study investigates the moderating role of capability element of fraud on internal industry factors and fraud prevention in the Saudi Arabian banking sector. The findings of this study will help the banking sector in Saudi Arabia especially and Middle East banks in general to improve the fraud prevention system, and for other stakeholders, it will help them uncover critical areas in fraud schemes that deserve immediate and prompt attention.
M48|Untaxed Social-Media Problem and Potential Solutions|Advancement of internet innovation brings both pros and cons by changing the rules and dynamics of fields as trade, public service, education, entertainment, intelligence, and defense. The developments in web technology provided a lot of conveniences. On the other hand, this situation brought many problems because of lack of laws and rules in this field. One example of these challenges is those websites do not have branches in every country are not subject to taxation. This situation is directly related to the sovereign rights of the countries. Major international internet companies are only subject to tax in the countries where their headquarters are located and do not pay taxes in other nations where they earn money. Particularly in the developing countries, the tax loss reaches serious dimensions. This study will focus on the problem of social media taxation. Also, solution proposals will be presented especially for developing countries.
M48|The Effectiveness of Risk Management Committee and Hedge Accounting Practices in Malaysia|This study examines the effectiveness of Risk Management Committee (RMC) in influencing hedge accounting practices among non-financial companies listed on the Bursa Malaysia. Our regression results reveal that that there is no significant relationship between the application of hedge accounting and the effectiveness of RMCs. However, there are positive and significant relationships between the choice of hedge accounting and each of company size and leverage. The implications of the findings were discussed.
M48|The rate of implementation of accrual based accounting in the EU public sector|The article deals with the extent of using of accrual based financial reporting in public sector of EU member states. The extent is expressed by the number of member states on the one hand and monetarily through budgetary expenditure on the other hand. Besides, the article describes the current attitude and actions of European institutions to introduce the accrual basis in the public sector at EU level. At the same time the article discusses the specific possibilities of implementation of accrual based accounting with the emphasis on introducing the principles based on International Public Sector Standards (IPSAS).
M48|Simple accounting versus tax records|The aim of the contribution is to identify and characterize the requirements for keeping information databases of simple accounting and tax records in 2016. The analysis and comparison methods made it possible to formulate the findings and conclusions. Both databases have gone through the stages of development, stagnation and reduction since they were introduced into the Czech legislation. Simple accounting was initially a part of the national accounting system. Its abolition from 2004 onwards was one of the consequences of the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union. By being restored in 2016, simple accounting did not return to the position of an accounting system. It is intended for an accounting entity which is not VAT registered, whose total income does not exceed CZK 3 million, the value of its assets does not exceed CZK 3 million, and it must be one of the enumerated non-profit organizations. Tax records became a part of the Czech legislation in 2004, when they replaced simple accounting for natural persons. Tax records are intended only for natural person entrepreneurs, who are not accounting entities. For small non-profit organizations, an information database was created, not a fully-fledged accounting system, as the name might suggest. The newly arranged structure of accounting decreases its reliability since it is missing complex information. If simple accounting is to be retained, it is necessary to add duties, so that it is unequivocally differentiated from tax records.
M48|IFRS vs. CAL: summary of practical knowledge and identification of research questions|In 2004, the Czech Republic entered into the European Union. This brought the obligation to implement International Financial Reporting Standards to the Accounting Act. The implementation does not mean mandatory use of IFRS for individual financial statements, however, it enables it. This fact brings a different presentation of accounting items which subsequently can result in a different financial indicators value. The paper theoretically presents financial reporting (International Financial Reporting Standards and Czech accounting legislation), identifies the impact on financial indicators, summarizes the current practical knowledge in this area and specifies related research questions.
M48|Modernisation of Public Sector Financial Reporting Systems in Europe - Challenges and Milestones|Many European countries have been carried out a modernization projects in public sector financial reporting since the last two decades. Consequence of a stronger demand for complex, reliable and relevant economic information on government is governments´ efforts towards better accountability. IPSAS standards, a full accrual national financial reporting standards closed to, or national standards with clear reference to IPSAS, are often considered as the best tool for that. This article aims to identify key challenges and milestones - four key aspects of these public sector financial reporting modernization projects. It offers a comparison amongst several European countries comparing the ways these countries decided to deal with those challenges and milestones.
M48|Public Sector Accounting Policy Reform in the Czech Republic: Experience from Local Governments (pilot)|The Czech Republic has recently introduced and implemented public sector accounting reform. The aim of the reform was to make the Czech public finance system more transparent, efficient and realistic. The authors of this reform, in fact, intended to bring public sector accounting and public financial management closer to private sector practices that, from their point of view, fulfil the reform goals previously mentioned. After a few years of functioning in this new accounting environment, certain associated points and problems have arisen that have to be tackled. The aim of this paper is to describe public sector accounting reform and its post-implementation process to current state in the Czech Republic based on pilot empirical research mirroring the opinions and experience of municipal Chief Financial Officers and its comparison with similar examples from other countries. The pilot sample for this research consists of municipal Chief Financial Officers and the research method is based on questionnaires and interviews with them. Results and findings achieved by this pilot research show that the reform of the new public sector accounting system in the Czech Republic has been developed in very extended scope in comparison with other countries, estimated costs perceived by users (local governments) are prevailing over advantages and benefits and thus there was identified certain degree of scepticism which may disrupt further efficient and positive use of this new accounting system.
M48|Impact of New Standard “IFRS 16 Leases” on Statement of Financial Position and Key Ratios: A Case Study on an Airline Company in Turkey|The studies regarding the changes made related to the accounting for lease have taken its final status with the publication of IFRS16 Lease Standard as a result of a long time and effort in January 2016. The related Standard shall ensure (1) the reporting of all the leases in the same way, (2) the displaying of the unrecorded leases in the financial statements and therefore, (3) the submission of more transparent, correct and comparable information. The purpose of our study is to examine the statement of financial position of the lessee enterprise after the transition to the new financial reporting standard IFRS 16 and the impacts of the change in the basic ratios. For this purpose, the impacts possible to occur in the financial position of an airline company having activities in Turkey as a result of the application of the related standard have been examined. The results of the study show that the reflection of the operating leases on the balance sheet shall cause to significant increases in the assets and liabilities and for this reason; there shall be a significant increase in the ratio of liability/asset and a significant decrease return on asset.
M48|Board Independence, Audit Quality and Earnings Management: Evidence from Egypt|Using a unique dataset for Egyptian firms, we investigate the relationship between board independence, audit quality and earnings management. We test whether firm-level corporate governance provisions matter in an emerging market setting characterised by weak legal enforcement and inadequate external discipline by the market for corporate control. Our results cast doubt on the notion that a higher ratio of non-executive members is associated with lower earnings management. We find that the effect of board independence on earnings management practices is contingent on the levels of ownership held by executive directors and large shareholders, as well as the composition of audit committee. In addition, the results are consistent with the view that high-quality auditors are effective in reducing earnings management. JEL Classification: M41, M48
M48|Improvement in Quality of Sales Tax Assessments in West Bengal: A Study|The major source of own tax revenue of a State in India is Sales Tax. The Sales Tax administration in the State of West Bengal has undertaken a paradigm shift in last five years. Discretionary assessment of the tax-payers has been replaced by intelligent, objective and risk-based selection method. Replacement of unilateral discretionary demand by adjudication through introduction of draft order has established transparency and equity in the system. Distribution of hearing cases over the periods instead of completing them towards the end of the limitation has increased the quality of assessment. Electronic storage of records and electronic service of notices has increased efficiency of the tax administration. Use of data analytics in assessment and audit has resulted in growth in per cent of collection of assessed demand compared to previous years. JEL Classification: H21, H71, M48, K34
M48|Strategy implementation through hierarchical couplings in a management control package: an explorative case study|Abstract We examine how couplings of management control (MC) elements help to implement an organization’s strategy. Despite prior research stating that couplings between MC elements form a fruitful soil for further research, empirical studies in this area are still scarce. We draw on coupling theory to explore three hierarchical relations between MC elements, and examine how these couplings help to implement the organization’s strategy. We conducted a single case study in a medium-sized Dutch municipality, using interviews, observations and desk research. We identified three different types of couplings which yielded different effects, but were all distinctively helpful in implementing particular parts of the organization’s strategy. This study contributes to the MC literature by demonstrating how coupling theory can be operationalized to examine relations between MC elements in an MC package, and by showing how various hierarchical couplings can help to implement an organization’s strategy.
M48|Relations among audit committee establishment, information transparency and earnings quality: evidence from simultaneous equation models|Abstract Either shareholders or related parties typically serve as the directors and supervisors of listed companies in Taiwan. Consequently, the managerial and supervisory functions of certain companies have failed to meet shareholder expectation, and there have been numerous cases where managers have embezzled company assets and inflated company earnings. Therefore, we contend that strong corporate governance should be established, and the supervision system should be improved. First, we discuss the relationship between establishing an audit committee and information transparency and that between audit committee establishment and earnings quality. Subsequently, we describe results obtained by employing simultaneous equation models to examine the interactions among audit committee establishment, information transparency, and earnings quality for companies in the Taiwan electronics industry in 2011. Our empirical results show that establishing an audit committee correlates positively with both information transparency and earnings quality. The simultaneous equation models result show that interactive and positive effects exist among audit committee establishment, information transparency, and earnings quality.
M48|Usefulness of fair values for predicting banks’ future earnings: evidence from other comprehensive income and its components|Abstract This paper examines whether fair value adjustments included in other comprehensive income (OCI) predict future bank performance. It also examines whether the reliability of these estimates affects their predictive value. Using a sample of bank holding companies, we find that fair value adjustments included in OCI can predict earnings both 1 and 2 years ahead. However, not all fair value-related unrealized gains and losses included in OCI have similar implications. While net unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are positively associated with future earnings, net unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts classified as cash flow hedges are negatively associated with future earnings. We also find that reliable measurement of fair values enhances predictive value. Finally, we show that fair value adjustments recorded in OCI during the 2007–2009 financial crisis predicted future profitability, contradicting criticism that fair value accounting forced banks to record excessive downward adjustments.
M48|Are managers strategic in reporting non-earnings news? Evidence on timing and news bundling|Abstract Using a comprehensive sample of non-earnings 8-K filings from 2005 to 2013, we examine whether firms strategically report mandatory and voluntary news. In particular, we examine whether firms report negative news when investor attention is low and whether they bundle positive and negative news. Our findings support the notion that managers believe in the existence of investor inattention and strategically report negative news after trading hours. These results particularly apply to public firms, where equity market pressures provide stronger incentives to mitigate market reaction to news by exploiting investor inattention. Further analysis of the market reaction to strategic disclosure uncovers no evidence of investor inattention, consistent with market efficiency. We also observe that public firms are more likely to strategically disclose through news bundling and that the likelihood of this increases with the likelihood of strategic disclosure through timing.
M48|Accounting for accounting history: An exploratory study through topic modeling approach|This paper contributes to the growing history of accounting history by analysing the contents of all papers published in Accounting History, one among the leading journals of the field, through a recent and promising analytical technique called Topic Modeling. Based on literature, we know what accounting history is about, but we know less how the accounting history field has evolved. By adopting Topic Modeling, an automated procedure for coding the content of corpus of text based on Bayesian statistic, the paper complements prior assessments of the accounting history literature by providing accurate measures about the relative prevalence of research areas and their evolution over time. The analysis highlights three sets of topics not uncovered by previous categorizations. In particular, the ÔRegulationÕ topic, that refers to international accounting standards and auditing regulation, appears to be overlooked by previous reviews. In terms of dynamics we find that the ÔTechnical core of accountingÕ decreased in importance overtime in favour of more variegated and fragmented foci of research: this finding may substantiate the claimed shift from a conception of accounting as a technical practice to the one of accounting as a social practice, that is the transition from the so called ÔtraditionalÕ to ÔnewÕ accounting history. Moreover, we see a pluralisation in the range of issues that are under the lenses of accounting historians. Finally, our analysis suggests that the way in which accounting history is presented or Ôtalked aboutÕ has not changed much in the last 20 years.
M48|The Effects of the Financial Crisis on Cooperative Banks in Europe – A Critical Comparison –|The financial crisis has highlighted the necessity of discussions on the adequacy of banking regulation and accounting standard-setting for financial institutions. We compare the development of several variables in this context between commercial banks, cooperative banks and savings banks from 2005 through 2013, in order to investigate whether smaller banks such as cooperative banks or savings banks tended to be more robust to the financial crisis. We find that the volume of lending (loan loss provisioning) remained stable or increased (decreased) for smaller financial institutions. Furthermore, there is no significant increase in loss avoidance behavior specifically for cooperative banks. Cooperative banks are also the group of banks that showed the least pro-cyclical effects and the most income smoothing behavior. Our results suggest that cooperative banks were the group of banks being most stable during the years surrounding the financial crisis in 2007/2008. This demonstrates the importance that policy makers consider the broad range of financial institutions for discussions on policy adjustments.
M48|Unternehmen im Spannungsfeld der Stakeholderansprüche: Möglichkeiten und Rahmenbedingungen für unternehmerische Mitverantwortung|Eine aktuelle Umfrage zeigt, dass die Bevölkerung skeptisch gegenüber dem Gemeinwohlinteresse von Unternehmen ist. Etwa ein Drittel hat kein Vertrauen in Unternehmen, Gutes für die Gesellschaft zu bewirken. Insbesondere den großen und börsennotierten Unternehmen gegenüber sind die Menschen misstrauisch (Buschhausen, 2016). 72 Prozent wünschen sich mehr Verantwortungsübernahme von großen Unternehmen. Gleichzeitig sehen jeweils rund 80 Prozent Unternehmen dann als verantwortungsvoll an, wenn sie auf die Belange der Mitarbeiter eingehen und Verantwortung für Kunden und Lieferanten übernehmen. 43 Prozent halten es für verantwortungsvoll, wenn das Unternehmen Gewinne für die Aktionäre erwirtschaftet. Bereits hier wird deutlich, dass verschiedene, zum Teil in Konflikt stehende Interessen an Unternehmen herangetragen werden. Die Kunden wünschen sich innovative und qualitativ hochwertige Produkte zu einem möglichst geringen Preis. Die Anteilseigner – Shareholder – erwarten hohe und steigende Renditen. Die Mitarbeiter wünschen sich eine angenehme Arbeitsatmosphäre, gute Arbeitsbedingungen sowie positive Lohnentwicklungen. Der Staat hofft auf hohe Steuerzahlungen. Hinzu kommt, dass die meisten dieser Stakeholder sowie Nichtregierungsorganisationen (NGOs) erwarten, dass diese Ziele moralisch einwandfrei und nachhaltig vom Unternehmen erreicht werden. Die meisten Unternehmen fühlen sich auch mehreren Stakeholdern gegenüber verantwortlich. Fast alle Unternehmen fühlen sich Mitarbeitern und Kunden gegenüber verantwortlich, knapp 90 Prozent gegenüber den Eigentümern und jeweils 80 Prozent empfinden eine Verantwortlichkeit für ihre Standorte und die Gesellschaft insgesamt.
M48|Pricing the Transfer of Intellectual Property: A Plea for Regulated and Internationally Coordinated Profit Splitting|Taxing intellectual property effectively is a challenging task. With its BEPS initiative the OECD (2013) aims at taxing intangibles in accordance with value creation although difficulties in determining the jurisdiction in which value creation occurs are acknowledged. The European Commission promotes the introduction of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) to neutralize profit shifting. The drawback of this proposal is that incentives are set to relocate R&D activities to low-tax countries. This is the background against which the present paper pleads for a regulated and internationally coordinated split of the profits earned with licensed know-how.
M48|Executive Compensation: A Modern Primer|"This article studies traditional and modern theories of executive compensation, bringing them together under a simple unifying framework accessible to the general-interest reader. We analyze assignment models of the level of pay, and static and dynamic moral-hazard models of incentives, and compare their predictions to empirical findings. We make two broad points. First, traditional theories find it difficult to explain the data, suggesting that compensation results from ""rent extraction"" by CEOs. However, more modern ""shareholder value"" theories, that arguably better capture the CEO setting, do deliver predictions consistent with observed practices, suggesting that these practices need not be inefficient. Second, seemingly innocuous features of the modeling setup, often made for tractability or convenience, can lead to significant differences in the model's implications and conclusions on the efficiency of observed practices. We close by highlighting apparent inefficiencies in executive compensation and additional directions for future research."
M48|Performance Management and Monitoring of Internal Audit for the Public Sector in Romania|Performance management is an on-going process, which has an essential component part, performance measurement, which involves the identification, supervision and communication of performance results, through the relation to a set of performance indicators. Based on the assessment results, corrective measures are established to ensure attainment of targeted results, offering a feedback, essential for the decision grounding enhancement, at all levels: strategic, operational or individual. As concerns performance management in public institutions in Romania, The Code on managerial internal control provides a hierarchy type model, in the framework of which, the head of the public entity, which is on the first level, needs to provide for performance monitoring for each objective and activity, through the intermediary of relevant quantitative and qualitative indicators, including referring to economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. Given the importance of the internal audit in the process of performance management, identifying solutions for continuous improvement of the public internal audit was subject to a study that was based on questioning public sector auditors on how to monitor the performance of public internal audit activity. Considering issues arising, the article proposes a series of directions for improving the monitoring of the performance of public internal audit activity in the public sector.
M48|Fraud Between Definition And Ways To Defraud Illustrated By Examples|Auditors have a key role in the formulation of an opinion on the effective functioning of management and control systems of the operational programs co-financed by ESIF. International Auditing Standards states that the primary responsibility for preventing and detecting fraud lies with both top management and those responsible for governance of the entity. On the other hand, the auditors also play a role in the fight against fraud and should help Member States fulfill their obligations to prevent, detect and correct irregularities and fraud.
M48|Research On The International Accounting Harmonization Process|During the last decades, the need of harmonization of the financial reporting frameworks has become more acute, mostly because the capital markets are not restricted anymore by country borders and capital movement has outlined the phenomenon of globalization and internationalism. A significant step in harmonizing the financial reporting was done in the process of normalization through different sets of rules and principles, recognized and applied in many states are the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The process of international recognition of these standards continues along with conceptual development which is based on epistemological research on specific markets, industries, economies open to international capital flows. In this context it becomes of interest to identify and understand generally accepted and applied accounting elements which carry forward the accounting harmonization process along with factors and circumstances that create diversity in nationally applied financial reporting frameworks.
M48|Views on the Credibility of the Nonfinancial Information – New approaches|The purpose of the study is the method of presentation of non-financial information and information on diversity by certain businesses and large groups, in accordance with amendments made by Directive 2014/95/EU. The study was carried out under public poll organized by U.E. (DIGIT-EUSURVEY@NOMAIL.EC. EUROPA. EU) in relation to the guide of presentation of financial information currently under development at EU. The result is represented by the test the usefulness of non-financial information depending on a number of qualitative characteristics such as: avoid undue administrative tasks, comprehensiveness, fairness and balance, comparability, understandability, reliability, usefulness and materiality or relevance of the information. This test was to identify those characteristics and results of non-financial information that are most significant for different users of financial and non-financial information, depending on the type and issuer of such information. The study will be continued by developing, based on testing, of a standard model report including non-financial information, as well as models of such reports specific to different types of issuers and / or users, depending of the area of specific interest.
M48|An Empä°Rä°Cal Analysä°S Of Audä°T Delay Ä°N Turkey|The main purpose of this study is to examine the factors that affect delaysin the signing of audit reports in Turkey. The audit delay is measured as a function of the numberof days that elapse from the accounting period until the date when the audit report is signed.This study utilizes a sample of 508 firms listed on the Borsa Istanbul in 2013. The findingsindicate that the companies that report net income, that have standard audit opinion releasetheir audited financial statements earlier. Variables such as auditor firm and leverage show nosignificant relationship with audit delay.
M48|The Role Of The Financial Audit In Preventing And Combating Money Laundering|The role of the financial audit in preventing and combating money laundering is to enhance the information credibility from the financial statement. Among the most important laws in defining and explaining the legal obligations on prevention of money laundering is the FATF guide on measures of risk, published in 2008. The legal framework in Romania in this field was established by the Law no.656 / 2002. In Romania, the structure of the profession representation with its obligations established by the Law 656/2002 is the Body of Accountants Expert and the Chamber of Financial Auditors.
M48|The development of a corporate governance assessment model for the Romanian public sector|Corporate governance is an essential component of business management, and has acquired a particularly important momentum in the private sector, in the context of the economic crisis and financial maneuvers which are questionable in terms of legality. The same imperative need to develop corporate governance is also identified in the public sector, given the large number of stakeholders and their heterogeneity, the need for accountability, efficiency, performance, transparency and sustainability. By using a qualitative research approach, a set of ideas on corporate governance was presented, as published in the specialized literature; also, a model was proposed for the assessment of corporate governance in the Romanian public sector. In the current context, the development of such a model complements the informational valences in the literature regarding the corporate governance, allows the identification of the deficiencies in the governance of Romanian public institutions, and creates the potential for the development and implementation of a governance code dedicated to the public sector.
M48|The profile of the internal auditor in the Romanian banking sector|Internal audit in the banking industry is one of the most debated topics nowadays. The paper’s objective is to examine the profile of the internal auditor in the banking industry of Romania. The research design is empirical in nature. The researchers use the development of job announcements for the position of internal auditor in the Romanian banking industry. The announcements are classified according to: language of the job announcement; geographical area of the employer; the internal auditor’s tasks; the internal auditor’s professional requirements; education and qualification; practical experience; personal attributes; age; salary etc. The results of the research consist in the current profile of an internal auditor in a Romanian bank. The research fills in an important gap in the Romanian academic literature, which lacks studies regarding the internal audit in the banking industry.
M48|Auditors’ and auditees’ perception on the internal audit quality|The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of audit planning, fieldwork audit, audit reporting, follow-up action of the audit results, the auditor team competence, and independence of the auditor team on the internal audit quality at the General inspectorate of the Ministry of Finance, Indonesia. The study uses a research instrument in the form of a questionnaire which is submitted to the auditor team of the Inspector General and the head of office as the auditee in the Ministry of Finance. We also conducted interviews with senior auditors at the General Inspectorate and officials as the auditee at the Ministry of Finance. The sample is analysed by multiple regression analysis. The results show that the internal audit quality according to the auditor team perception is affected by audit planning, audit reporting, and auditor team competence. Fieldwork audit, follow-up action of the audit results, and the independence of the auditor team do not affect the internal audit quality. From the auditee’s perception, the internal audit quality is affected by audit planning, fieldwork audit, and the competence of the auditor team. Meanwhile, the reporting of audit results, the follow-up action of the audit results, and the independence of the auditor team do not affect the internal audit quality at the General inspectorate of the Ministry of Finance.
M48|Human capital reporting in Romania: from corporate costs to social responsability and vocational training|All forms of capitals that are found in an entity or within an economy owe their existence and their development to creativity, to innovation and to the work undertaken by the human capital. “The living resource of the economy” is the engine that determines the value creation, which is reflected in turnover, gross domestic product and profit. If Romania intends to be competitive on the global market, the human capital should be used and appreciated. In this regard, education and continuing vocational training must target the demand on the labor market, the latter contributing to human capital development by providing a work environment that allows covering both the financial needs of employees and their personal development. The analysis of the Romanian situation showed that our country is in line with the European trend through the national programs developed. The same cannot be said about the employees’ compensations.
M48|Corporate responsibility reporting according to Global Reporting Initiative: an international comparison|The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is an organization that has managed to impose its reporting practices on corporate responsibility among large transnational companies. The model proposed by GRI is based on the supposed convergence between the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. This convergence can be presumed at macroeconomic level, but at the level of enterprises, the three dimensions are often divergent. By analyzing the structure of reports included in the GRI database, our article aims to identify the factors that impact on company’s behavior in the corporate responsibility reporting process. In addition, our research invites to answer the following question: is it not possible that these reports attempt to exaggerate company environmental and social performance, rather than to cause a change in their conduct?
M48|The relationship between the audit committee|Audit committees, governance type or otherwise, are a less common feature in EU Member States, where only few countries have extended audit committees or “governance” or similar such committees . Audit committees in the private sector focus on ensuring the reliability and the internal and external reporting, and therefore on the internal and external audit, the quality of internal control systems and risk management processes. For many countries applying this type of public sector audit committee may be too sophisticated, because there are no preconditions for its existence. The existence of audit committees does not automatically mean that organizations function properly and have no governance, internal control and external reporting problems. Because of the importance of communication between the internal auditors and the audit committee, the paper addresses issues such as planning discussions with internal auditors, analysis and conclusions as a result of communication, questionnaire models for the addressed areas and planning the meetings with external auditors.
M48|Convergence of Romanian accounting regulations with IFRS. A longitudinal analysis|In this paper we analyse the evolution in the level of convergence of the Romanian accounting regulations with IFRS in the last decade. We focus our study on the accounting topics covered by IAS16, IAS17, IAS 41 and SIC15. We find that in 2005 the regulations exhibit a good level of convergence for property, plant and equipment, a medium level of convergence for lease accounting and divergence for accounting for the agricultural activity. The overall convergence level improved over time for all the topics analysed. These results indicate that the companies with dual reporting may incur lower costs in applying IFRS. Moreover, the national regulations offer the opportunity for a higher level of comparability in Romania of the financial statements prepared under IFRS with those prepared under national regulations. However, we underline that the institutional factors (such as the tax influence over accounting) might negatively affect the convergence of practices.
M48|Factors supporting an adequate sizing of internal audit departments in the public sector|This article addresses the issue of determining the appropriate size for the internal audit compartments in the public sector. Public internal control in Romania in undergoing a broad transformation: moving from a standardized management and control (usually through regulations) to an objectives-based management and to a dual control, based on self-management (managerial control), as well as on separate evaluations by independent bodies (public external audit and public internal audit). Within the article default factors are identified for sizing the audit structures: the risks of the organization and the expectations regarding the manner in which the activity can bring value, which is the basis for the allocation of resources. The dimensioning of the internal audit compartment is analysed in terms of seven critical factors, and a comparative analysis of the proposed models (determinants, strengths/weaknesses, applicability criteria) is presented. For the improvement of the internal audit in the public sector, the Model of the Internal Audit Capacity in the Public sector is proposed, advanced by The Institute of Internal Auditors, according to which the evolution of the internal audit activity is structured around a number of levels to be attained in succession. By identifying the factors considered critical for the sizing of the internal audit departments, which have no equivalent (counterpart) in the factors provided for in the current normative framework in Romania, the article contributes to the clarification of issues related to sizing models and procedures in the field.
M48|History of auditing in Russia. Periodization and challenges of development|This paper discusses the recent history of auditing in Russia from 1987 to the present time. This kind of research, such as any inquiry into history, calls for a well-grounded periodization. For the purposes of this study, factors were determined which influence the regulatory and methodological support of auditing; in accordance with the results of the analysis of their time intersections – the logical addition – qualitative leaps in the development of auditing in Russia were identified, which are represented as stages of its evolution. Through the application of this method, four stages in the recent history of auditing in Russia were identified: pre-history (the birth of the Russian auditing, the “wild” auditing); establishment of auditing in Russia; government regulation and licensing; self-regulation of audit activity.
M48|Model for dimensioning the audit structures in the public sector|This article proposes a solution to determine the size of the internal audit departments in public sector organisations. The conceptual model for determining the actual size of an internal audit department, as adopted by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), is presented and the various factors used in dimensioning are analysed. The article also presents a computational model for the public sector, illustrated by means of a procedure which is based on the size of the organization and uses specific calculation variables and explicit (clearly defined) correction coefficients to determine the final number of internal auditors. The variables and the coefficients of the described model cover the significant factors that might influence the size of the internal audit department. At the same time, the requirements of adequacy and usefulness of the model for the various entities of the public sector are insured. The model proposed for the public sector entities constitutes also a supporting tool for the practical implementation of the legal, regulatory and normative requirements with regard to the sizing of the internal audit departments.
M48|Internal audit practices and trends in Romania and worldwide|For a long time, internal audit has been seen mainly as an activity of providing assistance to external auditors, especially by checking up accounting procedures as part of the internal control evaluation process. At present, while this role of the internal auditor has not disappeared, the role of consultant manager has gained primary importance. In this context, it is increasingly obvious that the professional profile of the internal auditor will undergo changes generated not only by the changes in the role that he or she fulfils, but also by the challenges that the business world needs to deal with: risk management, increasingly sophisticated information technology, data mining etc. This study relies on the information provided by The Institute of Internal Auditors Research Foundation – IIARF which includes data extracted from The Global Internal Audit Common Body of Knowledge – CBOK database, and it aims to point out the practices and trends regarding internal audit in Romania and worldwide, and, respectively, the competencies traditionally required from internal auditors, their views on the skills they master and on the scope of their further skill development.
M48|Credit Risk Management in Banks under the Basel Accord and IFRS 9: Challenges and Projections|The importance and the relevance of the credit risk management issues in the context of its accounting information support are indisputable. The continuing financial and economic crisis and the changes in the global regulatory framework for banks are reviewed. The preparation of the Bulgarian banking system for a global reform of financial regulation – Basel III, and the proposed changes in international accounting standards to future loan loss recognition are analyzed.
M48|Economic Performance Forecasting According To The Type Of Management| Forecasting the audited entities’ performances in correlation with management typology (local or foreign) proves to be useful in terms of estimating the impact of a particular type of management of the audited entities upon indebtedness policies, the efficiency of using the shareholders’ assets and capitals, and upon the contribution of revenues to strengthen the self-financing capacity. Establishing a mathematical model, tested on a stratified sample within a representative county at national level, provide relevance to the present research results. The study found a positive linear correlation between the performance of audited entities from Cluj County regardless of the type of management and the financial years.
M48|The Audit Of The Management System For State Subsidies And Financial Support Granted To Agricultural Producers|This article examines the issue of financial support for agricultural producers in Romania, awarded in the framework of the Common Agricultural Policy, in a three-dimensional perspective: (a) an image of the financial effort materialized during the period 2012-2015 (areas, allocating funds, payments), to which is added a second coordinate (b) a review of the forms of organization (institutions, programs, and procedures for the granting of financial support), and - to close the referential perspective - the third coordinate consisting of a short presentation of the management and supervisory requirements (mainly, objectives and missions of audit and control, public internal and external audits).
M48|Accounting in central banks|This paper examines the important but not often discussed issue of accounting in central banks. It highlights the distinguishing factors that make the financial statements of central banks unique relative to those produced by other bodies. We begin by explaining why central banks produce financial statements. We then discuss a variety of specific topics in central bank accounting. In terms of balance sheet items, we discuss banknotes, shareholders’ equity, gold, foreign exchange and financial instruments. Our discussion of the income statement then centres on profit recognition and distribution.
M48|Difficulties In Limiting The Expansion Of The Romanian Public Sector|aking into consideration the dimension of economic public sector it can be considered as part of the economic system. One of the major and current problems is precisely the need to put a limit to the expansion of the budgetary sector, because in the last years we witness the progressive public sector expansion in the economy. In Romania the economic growth has been reflected more in public sector development at the expense of the undevelopment of the private sector. For that, there are difficulties in financing and supporting this oversized sector, based on income from household. We consider that appropriate measures must be taken in order to correct financial statemants for public sector by optimizing expenses for missions and programs. Financial statements of public sector as essential tool in the programming, budgeting, management and reporting must support economic and financial objectives set by European institutions in order to maintain financial stability and administrative responsibility in EU.
M48|The Role Of Documentation In The Audit Mission|Missions carried out by the auditors are based on extensive documentation consisting of relevant and reliable audit evidence. The audit documentation guarantee the quality of the conducted mission, perform the activities in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, Code of Ethics, rules and decisions issued by the Chamber of Financial Auditors of Romania. All information obtained by the auditor in connection with the audited entity are used as working documents submitted in the dossier of evidence to support the conclusions and expresed opinion. An audit mission without proper documentation is not only a poor quality mission but the impossibility to express an opinion with the possibility to relief the auditor.
M48|Towards Integrated Reporting: Analysis Of Information Published On The Companiesâ€™ Websites That Could Be Part Of The Integrated Reporting|Integrated reporting is a new approach to corporate reporting which is rapidly gaining international recognition. Integrated reporting is based on integrated thinking, which include interconnectivity of strategy, performance, risk and incentives and helps to identify sources of value creation. In this paper are summarized the need for integrated reporting, companiesâ€™ benefits of its implementation as well as content of the integrated report. The aim of the paper is to increase the awareness of the companies about integrated reporting especially in the Republic of Macedonia due to the absence of its implementation in Macedonian companies realized by pre-research phase about implementation of integrated reporting conducted on companies listed on Macedonian stock exchange. Furthermore, as a result of the negative results from the pre-research phase, it is made qualitative analysis about publication of information through the companiesâ€™ websites that might be part of the integrated report if it commence to be prepared by the companies.
M48|La contratación interadministrativa en Colombia: una figura frágil de la contratación pública en el modelo neoliberal|El artículo reseña los contratos interadministrativos en la contratación pública colombiana, analizándolos en el contexto de las políticas públicas que desarrollan un modelo económico neoliberal. Además analiza la relación contractual interinstitucional que se dio entre el Ministerio de las Tecnologías de la Información y las Comunicaciones con la Universidad Nacional de Colombia en el lapso 2009-2015. Esto en desarrollo de los ordenamientos constitucionales y reglamentarios sobre la gestión del espectro electromagnético y los servicios de las comunicaciones en Colombia.
M48|Profit distribution and loss coverage rules for central banks|The issue of central bank profit distribution is both complex and often politically controversial. Based on the replies of 57 central banks worldwide to an ECB questionnaire, this paper analyses how profit distribution rules can affect the amounts distributed and the financial strength of central banks. The paper also investigates the link between profit distribution, accounting rules and financial strength. Research shows that central banks apply divergent rules as regards profit distribution and loss coverage. While they are not a measure of central bank performance, in the long run profits strengthen the credibility of central banks and contribute to their financial independence, whereas profit distribution rules that do not allow central banks to set up adequate reserves might have the opposite effect. The interaction of profit distribution rules and accounting rules also plays an important role in central banks achieving financial strength. Accounting frameworks can materially influence central banks JEL Classification: E37, E58, M48
M48|Accountants’ Perceptions on the Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards in Yemen|Developments in the global capital market have made the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) more significant than ever before. The purpose of this study is to examine the accountants’ perception of IFRSs adoption in Yemen. We also seek the accountants’ view on whether Yemen should adopt the IFRSs or not, and on the expected time taken to adopt the accounting standards. We also examine the difference in opinion between academicians and practitioners regarding the adoption of IFRSs. In this regard, this study carries out a survey of 48 Yemeni accounting postgraduate students in Malaysian public universities. We find that a majority of the respondents acknowledge the benefits of adopting IFRSs in Yemeni companies. Moreover, a majority of the respondents (82.9%) agree that Yemeni companies should adopt IFRSs. About 58.6% of respondents expect the period of IFRSs adoption in Yemen to be within three to 10 years, while 41.5% expect it to be more than 10 years. The results of this study may help policy-makers and the Yemeni Association of Certified Public Accountants make more precise decisions regarding IFRSs adoption in Yemen.
M48|Analysis of Income Elasticities of Brazil’s Energy Matrix|This study aims to estimate and analyze the income elasticities of Brazil’s energy matrix, represented by the supply and consumption of energy. We sought to compare the income elasticities of both energy products and consumption through secondary sources and consumer sectors. This is an explanatory or relational research of an ex-post-facto nature, analyzing the period from 1970 to 2011, using the ANCOVA-EC estimation method. The results obtained from the estimates show that both for energy products, as in relation to industrial sectors, the elasticities are statistically different. The naphta, natural gas and ethyl alcohol had the highest elasticities in the energy matrix, and the industries ferro-alloy, non-ferrous metals and nonenergy are the most sensitive to income growth. When elasticities are compared with the sectoral energy intensity index, there is evidence that less efficient sectors have higher income elasticities. In summary the results show that there is sectors or products that are more sensitive to economic growth where the energy-intensive and demand presented as the main factors to explain the sensitivity, there is also evidence to demonstrate that the level of efficiency is different compared the different sectors.
M48|Customer Accounting and Environmental Uncertainty: Sequential Explanatory Study|This study seeks to substantiate its proposition through two research objectives: (1) To investigate the impact of customer accounting (CA) information usage on companies’ performance; and (2) to determine the moderating effect of perceived environmental uncertainty (PEU) on the relationship between CA information and companies’ performance. This study develops a theoretical framework by applying interaction fit. To answer the research questions, the study follows a sequential explanatory design and the data is collected in two phases. In the first phase, 172 questionnaires are distributed to managers, of which 97 questionnaires are deemed usable. The results of this stage indicate that CA information usage significantly influences organizational performance, and that there is a moderating effect of PEU on the relationship between CA information and organizational performance. The second phase aims to validate the quantitative results via seven semi-structured interviews. The results of the interviews confirm and explain those obtained from the first phase.
M48|Client Following Former Audit Partners and Audit Quality: Evidence from Unforced Audit Firm Changes in China|In China's audit market, audit clients occasionally follow an audit partner who moves to another audit firm in an unforced setting (i.e., not due to the predecessor audit firm suffering regulatory sanctions). By examining a sample of Chinese listed companies during 2001–2013, we find that turnover audit partners are significantly less likely to issue a modified audit report to their unforced follower clients, as compared either with all other audits in the same successor audit firm in the same year, or with post-follow audits of forced follower clients (where the predecessor audit firm suffers regulatory sanctions). We also document evidence of turnover partners treating unforced follower clients favorably prior to the partner turnover event. Our evidence suggests that a close audit partner–client bonding impairs audit quality when lacking regulatory and public attention, and has implications for regulators, investors, and audit firms' quality control in emerging markets where clients are usually closely tied to audit partners rather than to the audit firm, and where a non-compete agreement between an audit partner and the audit firm is unavailable or weakly enforced.
M48|Fiscal Support and Earnings Management|It is well documented that firms tend to manipulate earnings before IPO (initial public offerings) and SEO (seasoned equity offerings). This study contributes to the literature by providing the first evidence on whether and how fiscal support in the form of preferential tax treatment and financial subsidy affects a firm's earnings management behaviors. Using data for Chinese firms that have conducted IPO and SEO, I find that firms have a lower level of earnings management prior to the offerings if they enjoy more preferential tax treatment or more financial subsidies from local governments. My results are consistent with the view that firms that receive stronger fiscal support have smaller demand for earnings management, which is a costly tool for a firm to achieve its desired earnings targets.
M48|Discussion of “Security Returns and Volume Responses around International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Earnings Announcements”|Olibe (2016) uses price and trading volume responses around IFRS earnings disclosures for U.K. cross-listed firms trading as American Depository Receipts in U.S. equity markets to investigate whether such disclosures provide information to market participants over and above U.S. GAAP earnings disclosures. He finds evidence of significant price and trading volume responses for IFRS earnings disclosures, leading to the conclusion that market participants find that those disclosures facilitate trading in U.S. equity markets. This discussion focuses on the paper's incremental contribution to the literature and offers suggestions for improvements in the research design and analyses.
M48|The informativeness of non-GAAP earnings after Regulation G?|This study explores the possibility that managers mislead investor perceptions through the disclosure of non-GAAP earnings even after SEC intervention (Reg G). We find that, on average, some higher qualities of exclusions, such as nonrecurring items, are moved from GAAP earnings to arrive at non-GAAP earnings. However, net income-decreasing other exclusions most related to recurring items are negatively associated with future operating income. Thus, managers still manipulate non-GAAP earnings to exclude certain recurring items from non-GAAP earnings even when reporting on the reconciliation table. We further use CEO and CFO selling shares as the key factor to test whether top executives convey good information to affect the firm's stock, and then mislead investors through disclosing non-GAAP earnings. We find that a CEO or CFO who sells their shares during the two weeks after the earnings announcement date is more likely to disclose non-GAAP earnings. Additionally, the negative correlations between other exclusions and future operating incomes for cases with executives’ sales are more significant than those for cases without executives’ sales. That is, even after SEC intervention, managers may disclose non-GAAP earnings to mislead investors' and garner private benefits.
M48|Rank and file employees and the discovery of misreporting: The role of stock options|We find that firms grant more rank and file stock options when involved in financial reporting violations, consistent with managements’ incentives to discourage employee whistle-blowing. Violating firms grant more rank and file options during periods of misreporting relative to control firms and to their own option grants in non-violation years. Moreover, misreporting firms that grant more rank and file options during violation years are more likely to avoid whistle-blowing allegations. Although the Dodd-Frank Act (2010) offers financial rewards to encourage whistle-blowing, our findings suggest that firms discourage whistle-blowing by giving employees incentives to remain quiet about financial irregularities.
M48|Voluntary monthly earnings disclosures and analyst behavior|We examine how voluntary monthly earnings disclosures relate to monthly analyst behavior. We focus on the number of analysts following a firm and several properties that characterize analysts’ earnings forecasts for the upcoming annual earnings. We find firms that disclose monthly earnings attract more analysts, have more accurate and less dispersed analyst earnings forecasts, and have lower overall uncertainty and less commonality of information in analysts’ earnings forecasts. In addition, the effect of monthly earnings disclosure on analyst behavior is more pronounced for the firms that regularly disclose monthly earnings. Our results are consistent with the notion that an important role played by a voluntary increase in reporting frequency is to trigger the generation of idiosyncratic information by financial analysts. In other words, analysts tend to complement rather than substitute for firm-provided voluntary disclosures.
M48|Stock returns and future tense language in 10-K reports|This paper shows that firms talking less about the future in their annual reports generate positive abnormal returns of about 5% annually. I measure how much companies talk about the future in their annual 10-K reports by the frequency of the verbs will, shall, and going to. The evidence favors a risk-based interpretation: firms that use less future tense in their report offer higher returns since they are riskier. These results are consistent with finance theories stating that investors need to be rewarded for holding stocks of firms that put less information about the future in the marketplace.
M48|Regulations, institutions and income smoothing by managing technical reserves: International evidence from the insurance industry|This paper investigates the role of technical reserves in the income smoothing behavior of insurance companies. This is one of the first attempts in the literature to trace such relationship in the insurance industry, especially at a multi-country setting. The experience of 770 insurance firms operating in 87 countries over the period 2000–2009 reveals that there is a significant evidence of income smoothing. The paper also finds that institutional characteristics, e.g., the rule of law, common law legal origin, economic freedom, and regulations relating to technical provisions and supervisory power constrain income smoothing but other factors such as capital requirements, tax deductibility of provisions, auditing, and corporate governance do not have a significant effect.
M48|Market reactions to the appointment of women to the boards of Malaysian firms|This study examines market reactions to the appointment of women to corporate boards, and observes if their attributes and role they play in monitoring affect firm value. We observe 127 Malaysian firms that appoint women directors over the period 1999–2011. We use the market model to assess abnormal returns surrounding the appointment of women directors from day −10 to day 10. Using conventional t-tests, share time series tests and rank tests, we find that investors welcome the appointment of women directors. A positive average abnormal return (AAR) is observed on day −1 using all three tests. Cumulative average abnormal returns (CAAR) are positive over the period day 1 to day 10. We also find that investors are more likely to favor women who are prominent, young, have no international exposure, and have no family relationship with any other director. Our findings support the initiative taken by the Malaysian Government to promote women’s participation on corporate boards.
M48|Remuneration committee effectiveness and narrative remuneration disclosure|This paper investigates the impact of the effectiveness of remuneration committees on narrative voluntary disclosure of information on remuneration. We develop a composite measure as a proxy for remuneration committee effectiveness by incorporating remuneration committee size, remuneration committee independence, remuneration committee chairman's independence, expertise and diligence. We find that both the existence and quality of a remuneration committee play a significant role in the decision to provide voluntary disclosure of remuneration actions and in the extent of this disclosure. Further analysis suggests that remuneration committee independence and diligence enhance the quality of remuneration committees. The results have policy implications for remuneration committees as an effective corporate governance mechanism.
M48|How Does Corporate Governance Structure Affect Risk-Taking Activities In Japanese Firms?|This paper examines whether changes in corporate governance structure affect risk-taking activities in Japanese firms. New corporate governance systems have been imported into Japanese firms from the US since the late 1990s. However, Japanese firms have not necessarily been able to improve their financial performance. We analyze the effects of reforms of boards of directors on risk-taking activities because Japanese firms are too risk averse and this may lead to lower firm performance. Firstly, we analyze whether outside directors and nonexecutive directors affect risk-taking activities in Japanese firms. The results show that firms with more outside or non-executive directors promote risk-taking activities more aggressively. Secondly, we examine the differences in the effects on risk-taking activities between firms with outside directors and those with more than one outside director. The result shows that firms with more than one outside director invest in long-term capital more actively, while those with one outside director invest in more passively. Thirdly, we focus on two situations in which firms need to undertake riskier projects. The first is firms with business opportunities and the second is older firms. The result shows that firms with higher potential for growth and more than one outside director promote risk-taking activities, but that firms with higher potential for growth and only one outside director do not. Then, focusing on firm age, the result shows that older firms with one outside director undertake relatively less risky activities. Finally, we calculate the trends of sales and operating income after investment. The results show that firms with more than one outside director have a higher sales growth ratio than those with no outside directors or only one outside director. The facts suggest that risk-taking activities have economic effects on firms.
M48|Substantial Authority Update: Tax Penalty Avoidance By Good Faith Reference To Judicial, Administrative And Legislative Authorities|Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 6662(b) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to impose a penalty if an underpayment of income tax by a taxpayer exceeds a computational threshold called a substantial understatement. An understatement is reduced, however, by the portion attributable to an item for which the taxpayer had substantial authority. Substantial authority is defined in Treasury Regulation Â§1,66624(d)(2), but taxpayers are required to recognize and take into account the relative weight of various authorities such as regulations, revenue rulings, legislative histories, court cases and IRS pronouncements. Alternatively, taxpayers may make a reasonable cause argument for the waiver of underpayment penalties, claiming that they made a good faith effort to comply with the IRC requirements. We examine the manner and extent to which courts have been willing to waive penalties based on substantial authority cited by taxpayers. We also analyze cases in which taxpayers have claimed reasonable cause. We draw conclusions about judicial responses to these two penalty avoidance arguments
M48|Awareness Of Human Resource Accounting Practices And Costing: Evidence From The Philippines|This study focused on the awareness of the Human Resource Accounting Practices and Costing (HRAC) of companies located in Carmelray Industrial Park 1 (CIP 1), Canlubang, Calamba City. The respondents were 8 human resource managers, 18 human resource supervisors, 8 finance officers, 9 chief accountants, and 5 accounting supervisors of the forty-eight (48) companies of CIP 1. The researchers used a questionnaire to collect the data. The study disclosed that the companies were not aware of the HRAC Cost Based Approach Models. The results also revealed that CIP 1 companies used the traditional or conventional accounting for human resources, where costs incurred for human resources were charged to expenses. The level of awareness and acceptance of the forty-eight companies of CIP 1 is very low. Based on the findings, the researchers recommended an accounting system that the companies might be able to use
M48|Gaap Vs. Ifrs Treatment Of Leases And The Impact On Financial Ratios|As of January 1, 2013, most of the world financial market economies are using International Reporting Standards (IFRS) as the required framework for financial statements. A non-comprehensive listing includes the European Union Countries, Canada, Australia, Japan and New Zealand. In the United States, US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is still required but adoption of IFRS has support of many accounting firms and professional organizations and is under consideration by the SEC. This case study focuses on differences in the treatment of leases and the impact of these differences on financial statements and selected financial ratios. Students take GAAP financial statements and prepare an IFRS based balance sheet, cash flow statement and income statement. It is necessary to understand both GAAP and IFRS rules regarding leases to address this case study. This case study is suitable for use at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. It may be used in an Intermediate Accounting II, Accounting Theory, Financial Statement Analysis or an International Accounting class, as well as an Investment Finance course. The case can be offered as an individual case study or as a group project
M48|A Chinese Kandi Recipe: One Part Sustainability And One Part Entrepreneurial Spirit|The call for environmentally sustainable business practices is growing in momentum. As supplies of fossil fuels decline, damages from environmental disasters mount and radical climatic effects appear, the logical result is that organizations operate in a more eco-friendly fashion. This paper examines the efforts of one Chinese automobile company, Kandi Technologies Group, Inc., to deal with the level of air pollution in China. Kandi and various end users may be in the process of transforming the way consumers think about and use automobiles. The Kandi Model is one where customers no longer own, but rather lease or share electric vehicles. Implications for the number of privately owned vehicles, air quality, and urban congestion are provided.
M48|Opinion shopping: Partner versus firm-level evidence|"We study the strategies, timing and relative outcomes obtained by companies that attempt to shop for more favorable audit opinions both at the firm and at the partner level. Using a uniquely long time series of Spanish firms’ data, we employ the Lennox's (2000) methodology and find evidence of successful opinion-shopping through voluntary firm switching. In contrast, our results suggest that voluntary audit partner switches are associated with a fresh eye effect. Additionally, we document that firm switching activity is more likely when prior attempts to shop for an opinion were unsuccessful. Finally, we show that the fresh eyes effect associated with partner switching disappears when partner rotation becomes mandatory; and that under such a regulatory setting firm-level opinion-shopping is still pervasive. Estudiamos las estrategias empresariales para conseguir informes de auditoria con opiniones mas favorables, tanto a nivel de firma como de socio. Utilizando la metodología de Lennox (2000) y la comparación entre la opinión pre y post cambio de auditor, proporcionamos evidencia de la existencia de compra de opinión a través del cambio voluntario de firma de auditoría. Sin embargo, los resultados sugieren que los cambios voluntarios del socio de auditoría están asociados con un efecto ""ojos frescos"". Además, los cambios de firma son más probables cuando previamente se han producido intentos de compra de opinión que no han tenido éxito. Finalmente, se proporciona evidencia de que el efecto ""ojos frescos"" asociado a los cambios voluntarios de socio desaparece cuando la rotación del socio es obligatoria; y que la compra de opinión a nivel de firma sigue existiendo en un contexto de rotación obligatoria del socio."
M48|What Drives Corporate Governance Quality In Emerging African Economies? Evidence From Ghana|This paper investigates the determinants of good corporate governance across Ghanaian listed firms for the study period 2000 to 2009. The Ghanaian Code of corporate governance introduced in 2003 was the first attempt to make official corporate governance guidelines on best practices not backed by the force of law of which the Ghanaian firms were encouraged to comply with its provisions. As such, firms listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange are expected to comply with the recommended governance provisions in order to promote good corporate governance. Some of the key provisions in the code are separating the posts of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the board of directors, limiting the board size to between eight and sixteen directors, having at least one-third of the total membership of the board to be independent directors, and the establishment of separate board committees to be responsible for audit and executive remuneration. Other provisions call for improvement of the relationship between shareholders and managers, and provisions on financial affairs, auditing and disclosure practices. We develop a corporate governance index and its six sub-indices to measure firm-level governance quality. Annual reports of the Ghanaian listed firms are scored according to their governance disclosure during the whole period, 2000-2009 and pre 2003 and post 2003 introduction of the Ghanaian Code. A panel data analytical framework was used to find the determinants of strong corporate governance in Ghanaian listed firms. The empirical results over the whole period, 2000-2009 show statistically significant and positive relationship between external financing needs, firm size, institutional shareholdings and governance quality measured by the Ghanaian corporate governance index. While we find no relationship between external financing needs, director shareholding and governance quality pre 2003, the result is positive and statistically significant for post 2003. The most consistent relationship we find concerns firm size and institutional shareholdings. However, growth opportunities and firm performance measures appear to have no association with strong governance in Ghanaian firms. The results have important implications for the Ghanaian firms and regulators. In particular, the Ghanaian firms with high external financing needs would have to improve their governance structures in order to attract such facility. For regulators, it is important to have clear code of corporate governance guidelines in place where firms’ governance practices can be benchmarked. In addition, the study contributes to our understanding of the firm attributes affecting strong corporate governance in emerging African economies.
M48|Sustainable financial reporting practice in Australian companies - does quality matter?|This study explores whether accounting and disclosure quality have been achieved in the current reporting practice (i.e. post-IFRS period) in Australian non-financial listed companies and whether stock market is sufficiently responsive (i.e. value relevance) to quality accounting numbers. Given the role of IFRS in enhancing reporting quality, it explores whether post-2005 reporting practice sufficiently effective (i.e. sustainable) in mitigating earnings management concerns of the investors and stakeholders’ at large, as well as explaining predictive value and return under the current regulatory environment. Applying GLS regression in a full sample of 2000-2014 and sub-samples of pre-IFRS and post-IFRS adoption periods, we document that accounting quality has been improved marginally in explaining change in profitability and cash flow in post-IFRS period as compared to pre-IFRS period. However, there is no significant progress in explaining change in receivables and sales between the pre and post-IFRS periods. Despite expectation of high value relevance of accounting information in post-IFRS period, our results suggest the opposite, i.e. value relevance is either disappeared or counter active in post-IFRS period as compared to pre-IFRS period. However, significant accounting quality improvement is observed in restraining earnings management practices in post-IFRS period. Overall, the findings highlight a mix representation of accounting/disclosure quality in post-IFRS period, which suggest that accounting quality still remains as a matter of concern in delivering quality financial reporting. Our findings raise questions, in an asymmetric information environment, about long-term decision usefulness of accounting numbers and sustainable financial reporting practice in Australia. Policy makers, regulators, accounting standard setters, investors and other stakeholders should understand that for Australian companies the accounting quality journey has not fully achieved yet as per expectation even after adopting IFRS and more to be done in this direction. While some improvements are commendable, further road-map is warranted for sustainable financial reporting practices in Australian companies.
M48|Corporate governance, SFAS 157 and cost of equity capital: evidence from US financial institutions|This study examines the association between fair value measurements and the cost of equity capital under different fair value valuation methods, and assesses the impact of corporate governance on this relationship for US financial firms. We find that firms’ cost of equity capital is negatively associated with more verifiable fair value assets and positively related to less verifiable fair value assets. Furthermore, the positive association between less verifiable fair value assets and the cost of equity capital is mitigated under better corporate governance. The differential impact between more and less verifiable assets becomes smaller for firms with stronger governance. Our findings contribute to the ongoing debate on fair value regulation by investigating the economic consequences of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) and the importance of audit committee financial expertise on fair value reporting. We also provide evidence on the importance of board independence, internal control strength, auditor industry specialists, and audit committee financial experts in fair value reporting.

M48|Changes in analyst following for less covered firms accompanying Regulation Fair Disclosure: the roles of ability and industry experience|Abstract We examine how Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD) affects the decisions of analysts with various levels of ability and industry experience to add or drop less covered firms (LCFs), which are followed by only a few analysts. We use the analysts who continue to follow the same LCFs after Reg FD was implemented as a comparison group to explore the differences in the forecast properties of analysts who add LCFs and those who drop LCFs. We find that, after the implementation of Reg FD, analysts with greater ability or more industry experience are more likely to follow an LCF, and analysts with less ability are more likely to drop coverage of an LCF. In addition, we propose that analysts who add LCFs provide more accurate forecasts and are more likely to issue long-term forecasts. Moreover, compared with analysts who continue to cover the same LCFs, the analysts who drop coverage of LCFs issue more optimistic forecasts for LCFs in the pre-Reg FD period.
M48|The impact of SEC investigations and accounting and auditing enforcement releases on firms’ cost of equity capital|Abstract I study the impact of an SEC investigation (as captured by accounting and auditing enforcement releases) on a firm’s cost of equity capital. AAERs are often used in accounting literature as a proxy for fraudulent financial reporting. Fraudulent financial reporting should lead to an increase in cost of equity capital as a firm’s future cash flows become less certain. Overall, this study provides evidence of changes in cost of equity capital for firms targeted by an SEC AAER on the date the investigation is first made public.
M48|Sneaking in the back door? An evaluation of reverse mergers and IPOs|Abstract I examine whether the financial reporting quality of firms that access capital markets through reverse mergers differs from that of firms that rely on the traditional and more onerous IPO process. Using a broad sample of reverse merger firms and a propensity-score matched sample of IPOs, I find that reverse merger firms exhibit lower earnings quality as measured by several earnings attributes established in prior literature: accrual quality, earnings persistence, earnings predictability, cash persistence, cash predictability, earnings smoothness, timeliness, and value relevance. I document similar results for firms with low levels of institutional ownership. Differences in earnings quality, however, are attenuated for reverse merger firms with higher levels of institutional ownership. Given recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement actions against Chinese reverse merger firms, I also use a difference-in-differences technique and find that the lower financial reporting of reverse merger firms is actually driven by the non-Chinese reverse merger firms.
M48|Corporate patents, R&D success, and tax avoidance|Abstract It is well known that research and development (R&D) tax policies are written to encourage firm innovation, a crucial driver of business growth. However, evidence on the effectiveness of tax benefits for innovation is largely anecdotal and empirical examination of the influence of innovation on firm-level taxation is still underexplored. In this study we use an archival research design to assess the implications of corporate innovation on tax avoidance. Based on a large sample of patent data from 1987 to 2010, we find that, on average, both a firm’s innovation productivity (using patent counts) and innovation quality (using patent citations) are positively associated with its tax avoidance level. Nevertheless, we find that the success of R&D investment, in terms of patent output per R&D dollar, is not associated with tax avoidance. Our study is informative for the debate about tax credit reform, such as establishing a ‘patent box’ regime for the purpose of spurring both the conduct of research and commercialization of R&D program.
M48|Welfare Effects of Endogenous Information Acquisition and Disclosure in Duopoly Markets|"This paper investigates the interaction between firms' information acquisition decisions and disclosure of internally acquired information in a Cournot duopoly market. The results are as follows. Given that the precision of firms' private information is constant, mandatory disclosure of information about the industry-wide demand uncertainty can enhance social welfare. However, when the precision of firms' private information is endogenously determined, mandatory disclosure is not always desirable. This is because when disclosure is mandated, firms acquire less precise information compared to the case where acquired information is not disclosed, and hence their internal information environments are deteriorated. This can lead to ""unintended consequences,"" such that disclosure regulation strictly decreases social welfare on the whole."
M48|The Impact of Japanese Regulatory Changes on Accrual-Based and Real Earnings Management|The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes in accrual-based earnings management (AEM) and real earnings management (REM) in response to Japanese regulatory changes. After the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) in 2002, the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of 2006 (J-SOX) was introduced in June 2006 in Japan, has been effective since the fiscal year ending on March 31, 2009. We shed light on the time lag between the introduction of SOX and J-SOX as a transition period. During this period, several regulatory bodies addressed the issue of internal control, considering both the SOX and the forthcoming J-SOX. This study, therefore, focuses on the J-SOX and a series of related laws and regulations in this transition period, and their effects on AEM and REM. Our results show that the level of AEM changes during the transition period before the introduction of J-SOX, while that of REM decreases after the introduction of J-SOX. The evidence generally supports the view that J-SOX and the series of regulatory changes before its implementation have an impact on the financial reporting quality of Japanese firms.
M48|Balance sheet classification of compound financial instruments and the judgment of securities market analysts|This paper investigates the effect of balance sheet classification of a compound financial instrument on the analystâ€™s judgment on estimates in target prices using an experimental setting. The experimental design involves both buy and sales-side analysts grouped into three subsamples with limited information set about the company used in the experiment and different information regarding the accounting for the compound financial instrument (IAS 32 model, SOA model and NEA model) after the following event: a private placement of a mandatorily convertible debenture to finance the acquisition of another company abroad. We apply nonparametric means and bootstrap test. Our result show that regardless of balance sheet classification of the compound financial instrument, analysts are likely to treat it conservatively as a liability. Moreover, if the compound financial instrument is wholly classified as a liability and the company is highly leveraged, they tend to discount firmâ€™s share price.
M48|A cross-sectoral analysis of climate change risk drivers based on companies’ responses to the CDP’s climate change information request|Companies are increasingly concerned with current and future climate change risks that have the potential to generate a substantial change in their business operations, revenue and/or expenditure. Therefore, the paper focusses on the companies’ perspective and aims to create a higher awareness of companies’ risk drivers when it comes to specific challenges of different sectors as well as each company within its sector. Based on companies’ responses to the CDP’s climate change information request 2013, including 125 companies from Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the paper presents a detailed companies´ perspective on climate-related risk-drivers, comprising i) changes in regulation, ii) changes in physical climate parameters and iii) changes in other climate-related developments. Hence, the paper provides insights into climate change and adaptation related risks for companies. Furthermore, the results also facilitate a comparison of risk drivers between and within sectors. This also enables companies to i) position themselves regarding the potential threat they might be facing now and in the future, ii) assess their competitive advantages and disadvantages as well as prioritize risk drivers they have to deal with by evaluating their own position within the sector-specific analysis. Regarding specific threats companies are facing, they furthermore have the possibility to take good practices and innovative ideas from companies out of different sectors into consideration, aiming for an efficient and effective adaptation to climate change. Thus, the study’s findings can also serve as an innovative starting point for further research as well as the practical implementation of adaptation measures.
M48|Shock-Based Causal Inference in Corporate Finance and Accounting Research|We study shock-based methods for credible causal inference in corporate finance research. We focus on corporate governance research, survey 13,461 papers published between 2001 and 2011 in 22 major accounting, economics, finance, law, and management journals; and identify 863 empirical studies in which corporate governance is associated with firm value or other characteristics. We classify the methods used in these studies and assess whether they support a causal link between corporate governance and firm value or another outcome. Only a stall minority of studies have convincing causal inference strategies. The convincing strategies largely rely on external shocks â€“ usually from legal rules â€“ often called â€œnatural experimentsâ€ . We examine the 74 shock-based papers and provide a guide to shock-based research design, which stresses the common features across different designs and the value of using combined designs.
M48|Innovative Perspectives On The Accountingof Romanian Public Institutions Of Academic Education|"At national level, the subject of public accounting is more relevant than ever, the legislator showing intense concerns for modernizing the specific rules in order to adapt to the requirements of the actual economy, under the significant impact of globalization as an overall phenomenon. Therefore, our paper presents the accounting of Romanian public institutions in full reformist process, starting to take shape the new vision in the field on the background of the community approach of contouring the European Public Sector Accounting Standards (EPSAS) starting from the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). Moreover, the normative ""revolution"" with impact on public accounting manifested in our country starting with 2014, leads us to anticipate important innovations on financial reporting in public institutions of academic education on the background of the obvious trend of rallying to the community paradigm."
M48|Value Relevance And The Adoption Of The Ias/ Ifrs Framework – A Literature Review|The change in the basis for preparation and presentation of financial-accounting information generates changes in the quality attributes of reported information. The purpose of this paper is to qualitatively assess the scientific literature examining the variations of value relevance due to the voluntary or mandatory adoption of IASs/ IFRSs. We carry out a qualitative analysis concerning the mixed findings of these studies. These results and their variation can be explained by various factors called moderator variables. Although our study has several limitations, we make a contribution to the` value relevance research field by classifying approximately 40 studies that analyze the changes occurred in value relevance after the adoption of the IAS/ IFRS reporting framework.
M48|Curbing Financial Crimes with Anti-Graft Bureaus in Nigeria: The Accountants’ Perception|Corruption, be it financial or non-financial is a global cankerworm that has eaten deep into the fabrics of many nations and war against it has been a recurring decimal in every economy. In Nigeria, recent attempts at nipping corruption in the bud gave rise to some anti-graft agencies such as the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Against this background, opinion of 140 accountants in various capacities was sought on the efficacy of the anti-graft agencies in curbing financial crimes through a survey questionnaire. The study found that respondents group perceived the anti-graft agencies as highly effective but could not establish that accountants in various walks of life differ significantly in their perception of the efficacy of the Nigerian Anti-graft bureaus (Overall Mean= 2.98, F= 2.263 and P>0.05) using ANOVA as statistical analysis tool. It was recommended that Nigerian government should strengthen the Anti-financial crimes agencies given that the influence of highly placed offenders, the dignity, societal bondage and shame inherent in financial crimes may affect the potency of anti-financial crimes measures put in place.
M48|Professional Autonomy and IFRSS Adoption|Since the concept of professional judgment is at the core of principles-based financial reporting, the present article analyses the connection between professional autonomy (including as component professional judgment) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) adoption. Thus, we developed a methodology for estimating the IFRSs’ adoption status for 44 countries and constructed an Index of Professional Autonomy based on World Value Surveys. The levels of the respective index were estimated in an Exploratory Factor Analysis framework. In order to deal with the reverse causality issues, a GMM methodological framework was adopted. The results reveal that the overall index is positive and statistical significant at 1% related to IFRSs adoption. These findings are robust even if “the implication in voluntary work for professional associations” and the “importance of the material motivation of work” are considered as control variables.
M48|Impact of the Credit Rating Agencies on the Financial Crisis 2007–2009|The commitment not to engage in tax avoidance – to refrain from using aggressive tax planning techniques – has not become part of the corporate social responsibility agenda in Poland. The purpose of this paper is to examine justificatory and explanatory reasons of that significant absence. The analysis unfolds in the following way. After setting out the necessary terminological background, I present main results of the limited empirical study of selected CSR documents, in order to substantiate the claim that tax avoidance is a theme absent from the CSR programs in Poland. Then I put forward the contention that this commitment should be included in such programs, as prima facie justified, and address a selection of objections that can be raised to defeat this contention. Finally, in the last section of the paper, I briefly comment on possible reasons of this absence and show how they elucidate the nature of CSR.
M48|The Effectiveness Of National Programs Aimed At Funding And Developing Imms By Romanian Youth|National programs for funding and development of Small and medium sized entreprise (SMEs) by young people in our country are a part of a broader series of measures aimed at stimulating economic growth and competitiveness, creating new jobs, and increasing the entrepreneurial spirit. This paper presents two of our national programs that support young entrepreneurs in the creation and development of SMEs by providing them with facilities and non-reimbursable funding. The analysis of the implementation, funding, and results of these programs highlights their effectiveness, their main weaknesses, and the ways they could be improved.
M48|Consolidated Financial Statements - Ipsas Vs Ifrs|The consolidated financial statements represent a topic that gains more and more ground in the international research. This issue is of high interest and it is heavily debated by academics, practitioners and regulators. The reforms of the public sector, such as the implementation of these new types of reports, namely the consolidated reports, have tried to approach the public sector accounting system to the private sector one. As the standards of the private sector have suffered amendments in 2011 and IASB issued new standards regarding the issue of consolidation, we aim to measure the degree of similarity and dissimilarity between IPSAS 6, 7, 8 and the new private sector accounting standards IFRS 10, 11, and IAS 28. According to the undertaken analysis, we could observe that the standards are quite different, difference that can be explained by the changes suffered by the private sector standards.
M48|Pricing the Transfer of Intellectual Property as a Problem of Second-Best Tax Policy|The adequate pricing of intellectual property (“IP”) for tax reporting is a largely unsettled issue. Transactional profit-based methods are on the rise although only rated as “methods of last resort” by the OECD. This paper focuses on regulated profit splitting and compares this transfer pricing rule with one allowing multinationals to price IP freely subject to the constraint that the price used for tax reporting is also used internally. The standard of comparison is global efficiency in R&D. The model is one of second best. It allows for internationally differentiated tax rates and non-deductible effort costs in the production of know-how.
M48|Climate Change and Firm Valuation: Evidence from a Quasi-Natural Experiment|In this paper, I estimate the effect of mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions disclosure on corporate value. Using the introduction of mandatory GHG emissions reporting for firms listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange as a source of exogenous variation, I find that firms most heavily affected by the regulation experience significantly positive valuation effects. Increases in value are strongest for large firms and for firms from carbon intensive industries (e.g., oil and gas). Valuation increases are driven by capital market effects such as higher liquidity and lower bid -- ask spreads for the most affected firms.
M48|The Impact Of Controls On Financial Reporting Quality|The study identifies the impact of the internal and external control of the quality of financial reporting, considering the professional accountants’ opinions, evaluating the extent to which financial and non-financial information presented annually by companies represent a guarantee of compliance with the ethical principles of professionals, and also a transparency presentation of the economic activity, risk management, at the same time protecting the interests of stakeholders in the company.

M48|Evolution Of Accounting Regulations In Romania After 1990 And Until Ue Accession|"For years among the Romanian accounting was understood as a planned and consolidated accounting, with the principles and common practices of the communist society. But december1989 not only meant the end of the communist regime, but also the end of the centralized economic system, thus requiring the adoption of a so-called liberal economy based on market values. Accounting begins to be seen as a business management tool deployed in an economy ""in transition "", hence the need to define new accounting practices. (Diaconu, 2006) The necessity of accounting reform in Romania aimed at continuous improvement of the Romanian accounting system."
M48|Economy And Environment. Points Of View And Actions|The current situation of the environment is a direct consequence of history, especially of economic history. The article analyzes the relationship between economy and environment, in order to determine the main causes that led to the ecological crisis. The article argues that despite the close relationship between environment and economy, the economy did not take into account the environmental protection, until there appeared serious environmental impacts. Including the environment in economic thinking led, first, to the application of conventional techniques to economy to try to solve problems. The article also examines some priorities for improving the relationship between economy and environment conducive to move towards a model of sustainable development. The conclusion is that sustainable development is the goal to be achieved. In search of sustainability, companies should play an important role, as in all phases of the life cycle of their products, there are environmental risks and, therefore, they are a major source of environmental degradation of the planet.
M48|El subsistema de formación contable en Colombia y México|Resumen Este artículo de investigación muestra las características del subsistema de formación contable (Jarne, 1997) en Colombia y México, cuyo proceso de convergencia internacional inició en los años 2009 y 2005, respectivamente. A través de una revisión documental y bibliográfica, se señalan lineamientos de formación contable que establecen organismos nacionales de cada país e internacionales como la UNCTAD y el IFAC, describiendo la situación actual de los países con respecto a los requerimientos de educación, desarrollo de contadores profesionales y de educación profesional continua. El estudio muestra como principales diferencias entre los dos países, la convergencia internacional en temas de formación contable y la certificación de profesionales; y como coincidencia, la necesidad de incluir mayor investigación en los planes de estudio.
M48|Creative Accounting and Financial Reporting: Model Development and Empirical Testing|This paper empirically and critically investigates the issue of creative accounting in financial reporting. It not only analyzes the ethical responsibility of creative accounting but also focuses on other factors which influence the financial reporting like role of auditors, role of government regulations or international standards, impact of manipulative behaviors and impact of ethical values of an individual. Data has been collected through structured questionnaire from industrial sector. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to generalize the results and conclude the findings. The study concluded that a company is involved in frauds or scandals because of several factors like unethical behaviors, agency problem and non professional attitude. Creative accounting is neither an illegal nor legal only the maximum use of it pushes a company in scandals. Creative accounting plays significant role in financial reporting but has been negatively correlated that means more managers involved in it may decrease the value of financial information. Government regulation/international standards have positive and significant role if it is flexible in financial reporting. As auditor’s comment also plays positive and significant role in financial reporting. Ethics plays an important and positive role in financial reporting. The more ethical values mean lesser manipulative behaviors. So the manipulative behaviors only destroy the image of any company.
M48|The Brazilian Electricity Energy Market: The Role of Regulatory Content Intensity and Its Impact on Capital Shares Risk|This study analyzes the risk related effect of content intensity in regulatory legislation on the shares of the companies operating in the Brazilian electricity energy market. For this analysis, the regulatory legislation, enshrined in the Federal Constitution of 1988 until 2013 and addressed to the market, was captured and selected using the Markov Regime Switching model of Regime Change. The intensity of Regulatory Content (RC) in each legislative action was quantified through the content analysis technique. The results suggest that, when classified in event families, the risk impact on shares is different and gradual. Further, the individual analyses of the different types of events, classified according to the RC intensity, show that strong and average intensity events have a higher impact on the risk factors of shares of the companies that constitute the sector. Conversely, political or institutional decisions that have low intensity of RC are not perceived as significant in the market. As research contribution, the results presented confirm that regulatory events must be differentiated by type, since they have varying influences on regulatory risk. Moreover, this study demonstrates that the RC intensity is important, and in this case, the higher its presence, the greater the impact of the potential risk on the regulated sector’s shares.
M48|Decomposition Analysis of CO2 Emissions from Electricity Generation in Nigeria|This paper investigates the factors that influences the change in CO2 emissions from electricity generation in Nigeria. The Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method of decomposition that was used. The main result shows that: (1) CO2 emission from electricity generation decreased by 0.59 Mt. (2) Electricity efficiency decreased CO2 emission by 2.33 Mt. (3) Electricity intensity decreased CO2 emission by 21.85 Mt. (4) Economic activity increased CO2 emission by 28.27 Mt. The result from the analysis shows that CO2 emission increased in Nigeria. Electricity efficiency and intensity contributed to the reduction of CO2 emission while economic activity has contributed to the increase in CO2 emission in Nigeria. Since economic activities can not be reduced without affecting the economic performance of Nigeria, energy efficiency improvement would be an important option to reduce CO2 emissions.
M48|Evolution of Risks for Energy Companies from the Energy Efficiency Perspective: The Brazilian Case|This study aims to evaluate whether energy savings from energy efficiency programs in Brazil affected the risks taken by energy companies during the period 2000-2013, based on the following research question: can we assume that energy conservation programs affect return risks to electrical energy companies? The results obtained through risk assessment models, exponentially weighted moving averages, and the capital asset pricing model indicated that during periods of crisis, both volatility and required returns were higher, but during less difficult periods, risks taken were significantly reduced. Further, as research contribution, this research suggests the elimination the affirmative hypothesis that a possible increase in energy efficiency affects the risks taken by electrical energy companies.

M48|The association between energy taxation, participation in an emissions trading system, and the intensity of carbon dioxide emissions in the European Union|Energy taxes are intended to internalize the costs of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to incentivize reductions in GHG emissions; evaluating whether taxes have the desired effect on emissions is an important research question. A second tool to incentivize GHG reductions is an emissions trading system (ETS). We examine data across countries in the EU from 1996 to 2009 and find that as implicit tax rates on energy increased, carbon intensity of emissions decreased. Further, participation in an ETS also resulted in a significant reduction in overall carbon intensity.
M48|In the name of charity: Political connections and strategic corporate social responsibility in a transition economy|This study investigates whether firms in China use corporate social responsibility (CSR) to build political networks and, if so, how such CSR decisions affect firm performance. We bypass the empirical difficulty of measuring the value of political networks by using an event study approach. Specifically, we examine how abrupt termination of existing political connections caused by replacement of city mayors affect Chinese listed companies' CSR choices. We find that when a mayor is replaced, the level of and the propensity for CSR activity increase. Such increases are more prominent in firms for which political connections are more valuable, namely, nonstate-controlled firms, smaller firms, and firms operating in cities ruled by more corrupt government. In addition, we find that firms that spend resources to bond with a new government via CSR activities are rewarded: these firms receive higher levels of government subsidies or have a greater propensity to receive future government subsidies. These firms also outperform firms that do not invest in political networking via CSR. Our study adds direct evidence to how and through what channel CSR affects firm performance. We also contribute to the CSR literature on politically motivated CSR strategies.
