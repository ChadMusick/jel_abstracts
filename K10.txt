K10|Promise, Trust and Betrayal: Costs of Breaching an Implicit Contract|We study the cost of breaching an implicit contract in a goods market, building on a recent study that documented the presence of such a contract in the Coca-Cola market, in the US, during 1886‒1959. The implicit contract promised a serving of Coca-Cola of a constant quality (the “real thing”), and of a constant quantity (6.5oz in a bottle or from the fountain), at a constant nominal price of 5¢. We offer two types of evidence. First, we document a case that occurred in 1930, where the Coca-Cola Company chose to incur a permanently higher marginal cost of production, instead of a one-time increase in the fixed cost, to prevent a quality adjustment of Coca-Cola, which would be considered a breach of the implicit contract. Second, we explore the consequences of the Company’s 1985 decision to replace the original Coke with the “New Coke.” Using the model of Exit, Voice, and Loyalty (Hirschman 1970), we argue that the unprecedented public outcry that followed the New Coke’s introduction, was a response to the Company’s breaching of the implicit contract. We document the direct and quantifiable costs of this implicit contract breach, and demonstrate that the indirect, although unquantifiable, costs in terms of lost customer goodwill were substantial.
K10|Teaching Romanian Business Law through the Medium of English|Objective - The course of Business Law aims to provide students with the basic legal terms and concepts necessary in their economic activity. Teaching law through the English language does not mean translating the course or the laws from Romanian but involves applying interactive methods so that the information is well conveyed and language does not become a barrier in the process of learning. Methodology/Technique - By turning to action research, the aim of the study is to identify students' perception on the relevance of the content and the teaching methodology of the current Business Law course, to identify the key elements of the new Business law course to be designed, employing active learning methodology and designing specific activities to be proposed to students. Findings - Debates or discussions are never absent from class activities, in which I try to engage all students. The lectures are delivered with visual aids, i.e. Power Point program, while the slides are drafted in an enjoyable manner. Novelty - Most recently in Romania, there has been a legislative change which saw the introduction of new fiscal advantages into limited liability companies fulfilling certain requirements (SRL-D), a topic which exceeds the current curriculum.
K10|When Women are the Criminals: Governing Violent Extremism in Malaysia via 'Hard' and 'Soft' Modalities|Objective - This paper seeks to examine the multiple roles of women in preventing and countering violent extremism (PVE/CVE) efforts and the existing legal ('hard') and non-legal ('soft') modalities governing such criminality. Methodology/Technique - This paper adopts a library-based research methodology through not only the conceptual analysis but also content analysis and doctrinal legal analysis. The secondary data consists of the primary sources, which includes the terrorism-related laws and the Penal Code. The secondary sources include books, law reports, journals, and online databases. Findings - The authors contend that despite the significance of women's role in preventing and countering violent extremism, the gender perspective is glaringly absent in the current Malaysian PVE/CVE initiatives. Novelty - There is a dearth of research on the involvement of women in violent extremism in Malaysia, and their role in PVE/CVE. This paper is very useful in contributing to the existing literature on the role of women in PVE/CVE efforts and beneficial for policy-makers and law enforcement agencies in curbing such criminality.
K10|Combating Malaysia's Involvement in Worldwide Organ Trafficking by Tapping into the Potential of Bioprinting|Objective - Organ shortages have caused many Malaysian people to travel to India or China to purchase organs illegally and to have those organs transplanted into their body, thus contributing to the worldwide problem of organ trafficking. Bioprinting presents the potential to develop human organs in the future. The objective of this study is to explore, through empirical research, the potential of bioprinting as a means of addressing Malaysia's organ shortages, thereby discouraging Malaysians from obtaining illicitly acquired organs abroad. Methodology/Technique - This is a qualitative study involving primary data including binding international agreements, soft law (non-binding documents issued by international organizations) and Malaysian legislation dealing with organ trafficking. These legal documents are interpreted through a textual analysis. A content analysis was also conducted on the secondary resources consisting of journals, book chapters, conference and working papers, newspaper reports, and other internet materials. Findings - The results of the study show that between 2014 and 2018, Malaysia experienced significant organ shortages, particularly shortages of kidneys. They also suffered from a lack of transplant specialists and medical teams as well as overburdened government hospitals. The Organ and Tissue Transplantation Bill, a new law replacing the Human Tissues Act of 1974, aims to ban organ trading and regulate organ donations. Malaysian research universities have embraced bioprinting through the production of blood vessels and skin, and the Malaysian government has introduced grants and technology transfers that are hoped to accelerate bioprinting. This has the potential to curb Malaysian involvement in worldwide organ trafficking. Novelty - This study is novel as it proposes bioprinting as a technological solution to illicit organ trading and transplantation within the Malaysian context, which has not been previously suggested.
K10|The Impact of Intellectual Property Rights on Labor Productivity: Do Constitutions Matter?|Focusing on 22 OECD countries we estimate the impact of constitutional provisions and of lower-rank norms aimed at protecting intellectual property rights (IPR) on labor productivity at industry level. Our analysis allows us to answer the following questions: Are IPR more likely to be enforced if they are envisaged in the constitution rather than provided for in ordinary legislation? And if constitutional protection implies an accrued defense or enforcement of those principles, is this difference relevant enough to translate into a higher impact on firms’ outcome? By using IV techniques and controlling for a full set of year-, industry- and country fixed effects (and their interactions), we show that constitutional provisions protecting IPR positively affect the differential in labor productivity between high and low R&D intensive sectors. This effect is driven by the impact of IPR protection on R&D investment of the highly innovative sectors. Our results hold after controlling for lower-rank norms. Furthermore, the interaction between constitutional norms and lower legislation is negative, suggesting that the two are substitutes: the impact of constitutions is stronger in those countries where IPR protection by lower norms is weaker. On turn, in those countries where IPR are protected by constitutional norms, lower norms do not have a significant effect on the productivity of high R&D intensive sectors.
K10|Promise, Trust and Betrayal: Costs of Breaching an Implicit Contract|We study the cost of breaching an implicit contract in a goods market, building on a recent study that documented the presence of such a contract in the Coca-Cola market, in the US, during 1886?1959. The implicit contract promised a serving of Coca-Cola of a constant quality (the “real thing”), and of a constant quantity (6.5oz in a bottle or from the fountain), at a constant nominal price of 5¢.

K10|Local referendum: The perspectives of a forgotten legal instrument|Direct democracy is generally represented by national referenda, when the whole population of a country could decide on a particular matter, or could express an opinion. However, in most of the democratic countries, the local communities, regions or townships have also the right to hold referenda from local issues, such as the planned construction of new industrial facilities, or from investments with remarkable environmental impact. These referenda are subject to similar legal framework, than national referenda, but their inherent character is different: this local legal instrument does not constitute essentially the expression of the popular sovereignty, but it creates a tool for the citizens to participate at the self-governance of the local community. Due to this ambiguity, local referenda shall be distinguished clearly from the national level of direct democracy: the legal background, the special campaign, and the remedies of local referenda shall be analysed in depth. Moreover, to outline the different models in this regard, a comparative research would be also crucial to provide an overarching picture from local referenda across Europe.As the outcome of our research, we would provide a deeper understanding of local referendum as an underestimated instrument of direct democracy, and we would conceptualize, how this constitutionally acknowledged legal framework could serve the interest of the citizens and the local communities more efficiently. For this purpose, certain points would be highlighted for consideration for future constitution-making processes. Our research would cover a field, which has been little researched, and it would be based on three strands of literature, which has been rarely used by this integrated manner. Firstly, we would rely on contributions from direct democracy, which give us some sense from the general character of this forgotten legal instrument. Secondly, the literature from the self-governance would be also referred, as local referenda shall be evaluated primarily within this concept. Thirdly, sources directly linked to local referendum would be also revealed from various European countries, where this concept plays a significant role to decide particular issues.
K10|Consolidated democracy, constitutional stability, and the rule of law|What sets a consolidated democracy apart? We argue that the expectation that under the rule of law a law-abiding government will not enforce the unlawful acts of its predecessor creates incentives for agents - such as members of the civil service or law enforcement agencies - not to comply with such acts. Thus, even an opportunistic government may ﬁnd it in its best interest to abide by constitutional rules or, once it has been in violation, to reinstate the legal order. If so, the government contributes to its own punishment and agents’ expectations are self-fulﬁlling. Thus the rule of law has instrumental value in stabilizing the constitutional order. We also provide a theoretical explanation of the empirical distinction between consolidated and transitory liberal democracies and we explain why consolidated democracies are likely to stave oﬀ populist challenges.
K10|Diversité ethnique et déforestation dans les pays en développement: identification des principaux canaux<BR>[Ethnic diversity and deforestation in developing countries: identifying the transmission channels]|We examine the direct and indirect relationship between ethnic diversity and deforestation for a group of developing countries over a period from 2001 to 2015. We measure deforestation through loss of forest cover and ethnic diversity through ethnic (religious) fractionalization and polarization. We have identified three channels through which ethnic diversity affects the environment, namely property rights, corruption and conflicts that are often used in regressions of deforestation. Using the SURE model, we found a positive indirect total link between ethnic fractionalization and deforestation through the specified channels, while the indirect total effect of ethnic polarization is negative. However, we have a total effect (indirect total effect + direct effect) positive of the two indices (polarization and fractionalization) on deforestation. In addition, the total effect of ethnic polarization is greater than that of ethnic fractionalization. Robustness analyzes were carried out and the results obtained are robust compared to the basic specifications.
K10|The Institution of the Prefect According to the Romanian Administrative Code|A code can be defined as a legislative act that includes in a unitary system the rules of a branch of law. In this respect, the Administrative Code regulates the general framework for the organization and functioning of the public administration authorities and institutions, the status of the personnel within them, the administrative responsibility, the public services, as well as the specific rules regarding the public and private property of the state and of the administrative-territorial units. The paper has as main research objective to make a qualitative analysis of the main amendments made to the Prefect institution by adopting in the Romanian Parliament the first Administrative Code after 1989. In this regard, we will analyze the important steps regarding the adoption of the Administrative Code, as well as the changes brought about in terms of roles, powers and occupation of the prefect institution.
K10|هل تعترف الشرعية بثمنية العملات الرقمية المشفرة<BR>[Shariah stand on cryptocurrencies]|Undoubtedly, the emergence of cryptocurrencies has imposed upon Shariah scholars the challenge of addressing related Shariah issues and providing Muslims with clear answers as to whether or not they can deal with, or invest in, these currencies. The challenge, however, is in demystifying these currencies and understanding their technicalities and economic implications. Hence, it is necessary to first study the technicalities of these currencies in order to address their various Shariah issues. Cryptocurrencies involve various Shariah matters, including the very permissibility of their issuance in view of the fact that they are not backed by real valuable assets or supervised by governments or financial authorities, such that people dealing with them are vulnerable to possible fraud and manipulative fluctuations in their values. Other Shariah issues also include trading in them and whether or not they are considered as interest-bearing (ribawi) commodities such that the injunctions pertaining to interest (riba) may apply to them, as they apply to conventional currencies. In addition, they have potentially negative implications for the market, such as their use in money laundering, drugs trafficking and other illegal dealings. This paper treats the Shariah aspects of cryptocurrencies.
K10|Optimal Law Enforcement with Ordered Leniency|This paper studies the design of enforcement policies to detect and deter harmful short-term activities committed by groups of injurers. With an ordered-leniency policy, the degree of leniency granted to an injurer who self-reports depends on his or her position in the self-reporting queue. By creating a “race to the courthouse,” ordered-leniency policies lead to faster detection and stronger deterrence of illegal activities. The socially-optimal level of deterrence can be obtained at zero cost when the externalities associated with the harmful activities are not too high. Without leniency for self-reporting, the enforcement cost is strictly positive and there is underdeterrence of harmful activities relative to the first-best level. Hence, ordered-leniency policies are welfare improving. Our findings for environments with groups of injurers complement Kaplow and Shavell's (1994) results for single-injurer environments.
K10|Ordered Leniency: An Experimental Study of Law Enforcement with Self-Reporting|"This paper reports the results of an experiment designed to assess the ability of an enforcement agency to detect and deter harmful short-term activities committed by groups of injurers. With ordered-leniency policies, early cooperators receive reduced sanctions. We replicate the strategic environment described by Landeo and Spier (2018). In theory, the optimal ordered-leniency policy depends on the refinement criterion applied in case of multiplicity of equilibria. Our findings are as follows. First, we provide empirical evidence of a ""race-to-the-courthouse"" effect of ordered leniency: Mild and Strong Leniency induce the injurers to self-report promptly. These findings suggest that the injurers' behaviors are aligned with the risk-dominance refinement. Second, Mild and Strong Leniency significantly increase the likelihood of detection of harmful activities. This fundamental finding is explained by the high self-reporting rates under ordered-leniency policies. Third, as a result of the increase in the detection rates, the averages fines are significantly higher under Mild and Strong Leniency. As expected when the risk-dominance refinement is applied, Mild Leniency exhibits the highest average fine."
K10|Understanding of the sustainable developmnet principle in Polish Law|Sustainable Development when discussed on the ground of legal science is first of all the subject of environmental law but also constitutional law and the theory of law. It is possible to say that its legal status is specified by terms used by the theory of law, its importance by the EU primary law and on polish grounds ? in polish constitution. The scope of its realization is a subject of studies of environmental law. The paper will discuss the problem of understanding the principle in Polish law. The main aim is to show the dilemma of location of the sustainable development principle in the first chapter of Polish Constitution and the consequences of that fact.
K10|Legal Reform of Asset Declaration system: A Strategy to prevent and combat corruption in Thailand|Declaration of assets and liabilities by politicians and public officials can be a powerful tool to prevent and fight corruption. Politicians and public officials are obliged by the Organic Act on Counter Corruption B.E. 2542 to submit an account showing particulars of their assets and liabilities and to disclose such account to the public. It has been acknowledged that a number of the assets declaration reports have been left unverified by the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC), thus making the system ineffective. The purpose of this study is to examine, analyze, and compare the asset declaration systems in Thailand and in other countries, as well as the problems and obstacles in practice. This study found that in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the asset declaration system, NACC should make it compulsory for all types of public officials to submit an account showing particulars of their assets and liabilities but verify an account only when there are doubts about a submitted account or only for positions with high risk of conflict of interest. The deployment of information technology in the asset declaration system especially for the filing process and the verification process as well as linking the information from other government agencies and private organizations shall increase the efficacy of the system. The disclosure of account showing particulars of assets and liabilities should be required from everyone who is holding a political position and from every public official so that the general public will be able to examine the disclosed information. Finally improving the organizational structure of NACC to be in line with the asset verification system can increase the effectiveness of the system.
K10|Recourse To The Constitutional Court Based On The Constitution Of The Republic Of Albania|In this paper we will discuss the recourse to the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Albania. In Albania, the Constitutional Court operates in several different ways: with the request of the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister , not less than one-fifth of the MPs, ombudsman, Chairman of the High State Control, any district courts, each commissioner established by law for the protection of fundamental rights and freedom, guaranteed by the Constitution, High Council of Judges and High Council of Prosecution , Local state bodies, Religious institutions, political parties, NGOs, individuals. The attention in this paper focuses on the new constitutional changes regarding the recourse to the Constitutional Court and individual recourse at the request of the individuals. So far, the Constitutional Court has reduced constitutional control on the basis of individuals' requests only in the control of a due legal process. This is quite different from the experience created by the implementation of the law on the main constitutional provisions, on the basis of which the Constitutional Court finally resolved the appeals of individuals concerning the essence of fundamental rights and freedoms. In its jurisprudence, the Constitutional Court has closely related the guarantee of the right to a fair trial and its constituent elements to the concept of the rule of law, considering it the first element of the rule of law. The recommendation in this case refers to the revision of this article of Law 99/2016 to extend the access of recourse to individuals to the Constitutional Court, not limiting it only to breaches of the rules regarding due process. The meaning of this research paper is precisely that of the constitutional review in order to extend the title on the constitutional guarantees in the protection of fundamental rights. The comparison with Latin American countries will be fruitful for our constitutional lawmaker, both in terms of history and constitutional development.Key words: constitution, recourse, individual recourse, Albania, constitutional revision.
K10|The other side of the coin: the negative aspect of freedom of religion|It is beyond doubts, that the framework of freedom of religion, as a positive right, entitles people to conduct a wide range of activities. However, what is the proper assessment, when one refrains from a legal duty due to religious reasons, or one refuses to participate in compulsory commitments on religious grounds?It should be highlighted, that freedom of religion influences almost all areas of life worldwide, the issues which are raised, are quite similar in the different countries. As for demonstration, it is broadly accepted, that the free exercise of religion shall not violate disproportionately the fundamental rights of others. The definition of religion and church shall be precised. It is also questionable, whether there is a right to convert someone to one?s religion. Our contribution is dedicated to these issues.
K10|Organic laws in Africa and the judicial branch|During the last decades, several countries have entrenched a special subcategory of law, which is adopted by stricter procedural rules, than the requirements of the ordinary legislative process. These laws are enacted by qualified majority, by the consent of the two chambers of the legislation, they are subject to mandatory constitutional review before their promulgation, or additional safeguards are implemented in the ordinary legislative process. Organic law appears in the French, the Spanish and the Hungarian legal system also as main models. Later, further European countries implemented organic law in their legal system, such as Portugal, Romania or Moldova. Organic law is also known in Latin-America. In Africa, a total of 19 countries have implemented organic law: Algeria; Angola; Benin; Burkina Faso; Central African Republic; Chad; Djibouti; Equatorial Guinea; Gabon; Guinea; Ivory Coast; Democratic Republic of Congo; Republic of Congo; Madagascar; Mauritania; Morocco; Niger; Senegal; Togo; Tunisia; and Cape Werde Islands. Although the fact, that organic law has been introduced in a huge number of African countries, this phenomena has not been researched in depth int he relevant African literature. Several questions might be raised: whether the implementation of organic law is a mere copy of European (French and Portugal) samples, or internal African reasons may be also identifiable? What is the role of organic law in African constitutional systems, could organic laws promote the stability of African constitutional frameworks? Is there any regional differences between organic laws? African organic laws differs remarkably from their European counterparts? Is there any African discussion or jurisprudence from the legal category of organic law?My study will address such issues, and would provide a broad overview from African organic laws. I have three main purposes: to understand the characteristics of African organic laws; to compare the relevant African and the European models; and to analyse the perspectives of organic laws in Africa. My concept would be based on a combined strands of first and secondary African and European sources, which have been rarely used in this integrated manner.
K10|The Role Of The State On The Private Law Through Notary As A Public Official In Legal System In Indonesia|The legal system in Indonesia embraces the division: public law and private law, which is one of the characteristics of the civil law system. The Government, as an organ of the State, also assigns some of its duties and authorities to the Public Official. A public official is a functionary appointed and discharged by the authority of the State, represented by the Government, and authorized and obliged to serve the public in certain matters because he or she participates in exercising the authority of the Government. Notary, as a general functionary or public official, performs State duty in making authentic deed in order to serve (if requested) society; and the authentic deed made is a state document. In its development, there has been a shift of the notarial position as a public official ? who is a part of the state organs ? to become no longer a public official but a general profession. This is because if there is a legal issue concerning the authentic deed that is made, it is often contested through the general court rather than through the administrative court of the State. Therefore, the role of the State is necessary in strengthening the legal system.
K10|The limits of judicial power in England and Germany: a comparative methodological and constitutional perspective|The principle of legal certainty, the rule of law and the constitutional separation of powers are affected to a significant degree when judges engage in judicial law-making, i.e. when they restrict or extend the scope of application of an enactment beyond or against the possible semantic meanings of the statutory language. This paper assesses how far English and German judges go when they interpret national legislation. It adopts a comparative methodological and constitutional perspective. The border between permissible judicial law-making and impermissible judicial amendment of legislation is governed by ?outer? methodological limits in judicial practice. This paper explores reasons that may explain the existing similarities and differences in these limits in England and Germany. By focusing on the methodological constraints of judicial law-making, the paper adds an underexplored aspect to the debate on converging / diverging statutory interpretation in civil law and common law jurisdictions. It also focuses on the often neglected relationship between statutory interpretation and constitutional law. The wider debate the paper feeds into is the debate about the proper degree and limits of judicial power in a legal system.This paper argues that opposing default positions exist in English and German judicial practice in relation to the permissibility of judicial law-making. This is not only due to different underlying constitutional settings but also due to historical factors and tradition that affect judicial attitudes. The paper thus rejects the thesis that statutory interpretation in both countries is fundamentally uniform.In the realms of rights-consistent judicial law-making and interpretation in conformity with an EU directive, this paper discerns contrasting trends in statutory interpretation in both jurisdictions. One effect of these trends is, however, a growing congruence not only in the general expression of outer interpretative limits but also in their application in individual cases in England and Germany. This convergence is based on judges? common understanding of their constitutional role vis-à-vis the legislature. Changes in the UK constitutional framework can partly, but not fully, justify this convergent development. Another reason for the high level of convergence is that English courts have exceeded their judicial powers. The paper therefore argues that scholars have rightly criticised highest English courts for undermining constitutional doctrine with adventurous re-interpretations of legislation. As regards German judicial practice, the paper will challenge scholarly claims that German courts have extended the limits of the judicial function.

K10|Finance, Intangibles and the privatization of knowledge|The paper examines different types of financial organization in a framework of incomplete law, under which the rights and the duties of the individuals are not completely specified. It focuses on the relationship between finance and specificity arguing that, while financial structure influences the degree of specificity of the assets, the degree of specificity of the assets influences the financial structure of firm. Because of these two-way relation, multiple possible equilibria exist and their selection is influenced by the nature the underlying assets. For this reason, the spectacular increase of intangibles is likely to have increased the role of equity finance relatively to traditional forms of banking, which are usually guaranteed by assets that, unlike most intangibles, have thick markets and fairly stable market values. The excessive financialization of the global economy mirrors the abnormal growth of intangibles and, in particular, of the assets related to the privatization of knowledge. International regulations should also tackle the negative effects of overenclosing the knowledge commons.

K10|Real estate foreclosures: their functioning and the effects of recent reforms|Lengthy in-court debt recovery procedures may adversely affect the economic and financial system, for example in the management of non-performing loans. This paper analyses the characteristics of real estate foreclosures in Italy and the determinants of their length. A decomposition of procedures into phases shows that the phases preceding and following the actual sale also contribute significantly to the total length of the procedure. The length also turns out to be influenced by both observable and unobservable court characteristics. We also find a reduction in the length of the procedures following recent reforms: new regulations are helping to reduce the length of the ‘pre-sale’ phase and, above all, of the sale phase.
K10|Criteria for “good” justifications|"Many institutions in a democratic society wield important power by virtue of the decisions they make. These decisions may concern individuals or have a more general impact on society. It goes without saying today that this exercise of power must be accounted for. A supreme court's reasoning is given in its judgements. A central bank's reasoning is given in the decision-making body's minutes. In this paper, we develop criteria for what constitute good written justifications for a decision, not what makes a good decision per se. We look at the two institutions we know best: supreme courts and central banks. Of course, these are not the only institutions that exercise power on behalf of the state, and we also ask whether our criteria could be applied more generally. We assess a selection of supreme court judgements and monetary policy decisions in various countries qualitatively against our criteria, and find that practice largely conforms to the criteria. There are some common features between supreme courts and central banks. In recent years there has been a development in the way the judgments are written in the UK Supreme Court. Earlier, each judge wrote his votum. Now they are writing a common text. With individual writing, there were many different formulations of the normative text. It is easier for the public to relate to one legislative text. The UK Supreme Court, under the presidency of Lord Neuberger, has therefore gradually moved towards writing a joint text. John Roberts, the US Chief Justice, thought that judges should be worried when they are writing separately about the effect on the court as an institution. What about the minutes of the central banks? Professor Alan Blinder at Princeton argues that a central bank that speaks with a cacophony of voices has no voice at all. Professor Otmar Issing, the former Chief Economist and Member of the Board of the ECB, believes that there is a danger that individual minutes provide an incentive for individual members to put themselves ahead of the institution We also test empirically whether the institutions' decisions and the justifications for these decisions are communicated in clear language. Our analysis is inspired by Bank of England chief economist Andrew Haldane's speech ""A little more conversation, a little less action"", and by the report ""Bankspeak: The Language of World Bank Reports 1946-2012"" by Franco Moretti and Dominique Pestre at Stanford Literary Lab. We analyse more than 6,000 central bank and supreme court decisions from the past decade and find considerable differences in length and readability across countries and institutions. The grand chamber decisions of the European Court of Human Rights are by far the longest, while the European Court of Justice employs the most complex language. The Danish central bank keeps things briefest and uses the clearest language, but also has the simplest regime to explain. The Swedish central bank's minutes stand out as both long and complex, while the Norwegian central bank is unusually concise. Moretti and Pestre analysed the text of all World Bank reports and found quantitative indications that the language of the reports had moved in the wrong direction in terms of readability. We perform the same tests on central banks and supreme courts and find that these institutions' language has not moved in the same negative direction. Former Bank of England governor Mervyn King argued that the design of an institution ""must reflect history and experience"", and there is no doubt that each institution's way of writing is influenced by its own history. This is what economists refer to as ""path dependence"". We wonder, however, whether there is rather too much path dependence in many cases, and whether the institutions in question might benefit from looking at trends and learning from other institutions both at home and abroad. In our work on this paper, we have been particularly wary of phrases along the lines of ""based on a general assessment"". Alarm bells sound whenever we see them, especially with any frequency, as they are liable to conceal rather than illuminate the true rationale."
K10|Sostenibilidad de la deuda pública en Colombia|Este artículo presenta un análisis sobre la sostenibilidad de la deuda pública en Colombia para el periodo 2012-2016. Se procede en dos partes: la primera corresponde al estado del arte en esta materia, se incluye una serie de definiciones y distinciones clave, así como los elementos relevantes de la teoría económica —siendo el criterio de sostenibilidad de Blanchard (1990) el indicador más importante—. Al mismo tiempo, se presentan las disposiciones jurídicas que enmarcan el manejo de la deuda por parte del Estado. Adicionalmente, se muestra que la trayectoria de la deuda impacta no sólo las finanzas públicas, sino que también afecta la desigualdad y los objetivos de crecimiento y desarrollo del país. La segunda parte expone la evidencia empírica. Se centra en la discusión de los elementos macroeconómicos y sociopolíticos que han incidido en la dinámica de la deuda durante este periodo. Para ello, se incorpora una simulación de largo plazo del organismo de control y se plantea que la sostenibilidad requiere, más allá del cumplimiento de los criterios de teoría económica —particularmente el de Blanchard— de una serie de decisiones políticas en torno a la estructura tributaria y productiva del país, en relación con los objetivos de crecimiento y desarrollo económico. Para finalizar, se introduce una serie de conclusiones que permiten sintetizar los hallazgos presentados y servir de insumo para las discusiones de política económica que se requieren en torno al manejo responsable y sostenible de la deuda.
K10|Is the EU Disinformation Review Compliant with EU Law? Complaint to the European Ombudsman About the EU Anti-Fake News Initiative|The EU’s approach to fake news, as epitomised by the European External Action (EEAS) Service East Stratcom Disinformation Review, violates the rights to freedom of expression and due process of those accused of distributing disinformation. The EU Disinformation Review is a publication of the European External Action Service (the European Union’s diplomatic service) to target fake news and online disinformation. Following our request for access to documents, EEAS conceded that the EU Disinformation Review uses an “ad hoc” methodology for conducting its fact-checks, which makes it an outlier in the international fact-checking community led by the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). Despite being a well-intentioned initiative to respond to the challenges posed by pro-Kremlin disinformation, the EU should ensure the respect of fundamental rights when engaging in fact-checking. The EU Disinformation Review seeks to control the right to freedom of expression by labelling publishers as “disinforming outlets” and their content as “disinformation,” creating a chilling effect on the work of journalists that is central to democracy. The right to freedom of expression is expressed in Article 11.1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (2000/C 364/01) and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The labelling of publishers as “disinformation outlets” is contrary to principle of the freedom of press established by the European Court of Human Rights: “[a] general requirement for journalists systematically and formally to distance themselves from the content of a quotation that might insult or provoke others or damage their reputation is not reconcilable with the press’ role of providing information on current events, opinion and ideas.” In addition, the methodology used by EEAS in the EU Disinformation Review is “ad hoc,” which constitutes a violation of the fundamental right to good administration in Article 41 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. Specifically, the ad hoc design and operation of the EU Disinformation Review fails to ensure the review acts “impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time.” First, publications are not provided with the right to be heard or proper notice. The EU Disinformation Review’s homepage offers an opportunity to contact the Task Force report a suspected mistake in a fact-check but the page is only available in English, in violation of the principle of multilingualism, and no notice if given to outlets accused of being “disinforming outlets” before or after fact-checks of their content are published. Second, the EEAS does not fulfil its duty to motivate. EEAS is given a broad margin of discretion to identify disinformation, but fails to do so according to a consistent methodology. Therefore, EEAS cannot justify, on the basis of objective criteria, its choice of which content to review and how to determine its truth or falsehood. To comply with EU law and ensure the respect of fundamental rights, the EEAS should develop and make public (1) a methodology for selecting partnerships and reviewing fact-checks in line with international standards and (2) a notice and response mechanism for journalists, publishers and citizens whose content is being reviewed. If EEAS is unable to comply with the above, the EU Disinformation Review should be shut down.
K10|Norm making and institutions dynamics: how the research program of the French Régulation Theory can be fertilized by the methodological concepts from the “Max-Planck-Institute for European Legal History”|The aim of this paper is to show the possible connections between some legal history research methodologies and the research agenda of the Régulation Theory. As the last is a heterodox theory of institutions, cross-fertilizations with other fields of research open new research perspectives. In this respect, the methodology of the legal history research from the Max-Planck-Institute for European Legal History developed several methodological concepts like multinormativity, governance, science of regulation or law as communication. Such constructivist framework allows analyzing in vivo the norm-making and their incorporation into actors and social structures. In a context of trans-national regulation and growing autonomy of sectoral regulations, such in vivo analysis of the norm making can explain the genesis, transformation and destabilization of macro-economic institutions, which is the core interest of the Régulation Theory.
K10|The Functional Method as the Staple of Comparative Studies of European Legal History in the Early 21st Century?|The Europeanization of legal scholarship and legal education facilitates the emergence of comparative legal science as a promising new tool to discover similarities and differences between two or more jurisdictions and their past development. Yet, the specific methodology of such studies is still not clear. Some legal historians hold that comparative legal history does not or should not have its own methodology other than that of comparative law. Others warn against imposing a contemporary agenda and toolbox on legal history. The author of this article aims to clarify this debate by examining the prospect of applying one of the most popular methods of comparative law – the functional method – to the domain of legal history. On the basis of several examples from the European legal past he claims that examining the functions (the social purpose) of legal norms can help legal historians in three ways: first, to determine the objects of comparison and the sources of analysis, despite the variety of verbal shortcuts (the initial stage of research); second, to analyse legal norms from the perspective of solving social problems in the past – to study the 'law in action'; and third, to arrange the results of the research according to meaningful criteria at the final stage
K10|The Functional Method to Study General Part of Contract Law in Historical Perspective: Pro Et Contra|Comparative legal history is a fashionable new discipline which aims at a better understanding of the law's past by comparing similarities and differences of legal phenomena in two or more jurisdictions beyond the limits of national legal histories. Despite its popularity in Europe, it still lacks comparative projects that cover both Western and Eastern areas of the Continent, not least because the methodology of such comparison requires proper consideration and cannot be simply copied from comparative law or national legal histories. The present article evaluates the applicability of the dominant method of today's comparative law (the functional one) in the domain of the general contract law of the first codifications in the major jurisdictions of Continental Europe (Austria, France, Germany, Russia) during the 'long 19th century'. This subject matter is chosen by way of example as a 'legal cross-road' of legal concepts and models, more susceptible to changes, innovations, borrowings, and closely l inked to social needs. In the main part of the article, it is argued that the adaptation of the functional method to the needs of comparison in legal history becomes plausible due to at least two factors. First, comparatists mitigated the rigid assumptions of the 'classical' functionalism of the 20th century (rejecting its privileged status and purely functional perception of law, irrebuttable presumptions of similarity and unification of compared legal systems etc.). Second, many legal historians, like the drafters of the first civil codes in Western and Eastern Europe, also believe that law is more than minimally connected to social problems and manifests itself primarily through its actual application. On the basis of such premises, the author of this article discusses potential benefits and limitations of researching general contract law in the selected jurisdictions with the functional method. At the preparatory (descriptive) stage, it can be useful to assure comparability of contract law in the selected civil codes, to identify omissions in the codified general rules on contracts, and to arrange legal provisions around practically relevant issues. At the stage of analysis, functionalism can be coupled with teleological interpretation of legal norms to enable us to understand better the link between the application of the legal rules, their legal purposes, and the practical social problems serving as tertium comparationis for all the compared jurisdictions. A sketch of such an analysis in the final part of the article allows to conclude that a research with the help of the functional method narrows our perception of law as a cultural phenomenon and breaks the inner doctrinal logic, but in return, it offers a starting point for a much needed dialogue of legal historians with a wider legal community.
K10|The Language of the Republic at School: Who Decides?|After inspections by Public Prosecutor’s Office in 2017, the question of lawfulness of compulsory learning of republican languages at school received widespread ñoverage. This article addresses the question of whether Russian republics have the right to establish a duty to learn the state language of the republic in schools. The right of republics to establish their own state language, stipulated by the provisions of the Russian Constitution, federal legislation, and the national-territorial principle of the formation of republics in Russia, presupposes the republic’s ability to establish the compulsory study of its language in the state and municipal schools on its territory. Since 2007, this right has been formally blocked by the Federal State Educational Standards (FSES) approved by the Russian Ministry of Education and Science. The de facto prohibition of compulsory language learning significantly limits the republics in the full realization of the right to establish their state language
K10|Constraints of Spanish Insolvency Law. A predictive bankruptcy model for Spanish industrial SMEs (2007-2015)|Why almost 90% of Spanish SMEs that declare insolvency end up in liquidation? Academic works on insolvency focus either on legal terms – normative bias, impact on business’ death rate, and contrast to internal restructuring processes, to name a few – or on financial aspects – especially bankruptcy predictive models – . This work argues that a combined approach could be elucidating. For this purpose, it configures a predictive model – inspired on Atlman’s z-score – for Spanish SMEs of industrial sectors for the period 2007-2015. This investigation argues that operative difficulties can be detected well in advance to official declaration of insolvency; and provides specific evidence of Spanish Law constraints.
K10|A Theory of Equality Before the Law|We propose a model of the emergence of equality before the law. A society can support “effort” (“cooperation”, “pro-social behavior”) using the “carrot” of future cooperation or the “stick” of coercive punishment. Community enforcement relies only on the carrot and involves low coercion, low inequality, and low effort. A society in which the elite control the means of violence supplements the carrot with the stick, and involves high coercion, high inequality, and high effort. In this regime, elites are privileged: they are not subject to the same coercive punishments as non-elites. We show that it may be optimal—even from the viewpoint of the elite—to establish equality before the law, where all agents are subject to the same coercive punishments. The central mechanism is that equality before the law increases elites’ effort, which in turn encourages even higher effort from non-elites. Equality before the law combines high coercion and low inequality—in our baseline model, elites exert the same level of effort as non-elites. Factors that make the emergence of equality before the law more likely include limits on the extent of coercion, greater marginal returns to effort, increases in the size of the elite group, greater political power for non-elites, and under some additional conditions, lower economic inequality.
K10|Ordered Leniency: An Experimental Study of Law Enforcement with Self-Reporting|"This paper reports the results of an experiment designed to assess the ability of an enforcement agency to detect and deter harmful short-term activities committed by groups of injurers. With ordered-leniency policies, early cooperators receive reduced sanctions. We replicate the strategic environment described by Landeo and Spier (2018). In theory, the optimal ordered leniency policy depends on the refinement criterion applied in case of multiplicity of equilibria. Our findings are as follows. First, we provide empirical evidence of a ""race-to-the-courthouse"" effect of ordered leniency: Mild and Strong Leniency induce the injurers to self-report promptly. These findings suggest that the injurers' behaviors are aligned with the risk-dominance refinement. Second, Mild and Strong Leniency significantly increase the likelihood of detection of harmful activities. This fundamental finding is explained by the high self-reporting rates under ordered-leniency policies. Third, as a result of the increase in the detection rates, the averages fines are significantly higher under Mild and Strong Leniency. As expected when the risk-dominance refinement is applied, Mild Leniency exhibits the highest average fine."
K10|Optimal Law Enforcement with Ordered Leniency|This paper studies the design of enforcement policies to detect and deter harmful short-term activities committed by groups of injurers. With an ordered-leniency policy, the degree of leniency granted to an injurer who self-reports depends on his or her position in the self-reporting queue. By creating a “race to the courthouse,” ordered-leniency policies lead to faster detection and stronger deterrence of illegal activities. The socially-optimal level of deterrence can be obtained at zero cost when the externalities associated with the harmful activities are not too high. Without leniency for self-reporting, the enforcement cost is strictly positive and there is underdeterrence of harmful activities relative to the first-best level. Hence, ordered-leniency policies are welfare improving. Our findings for environments with groups of injurers complement Kaplow and Shavell’s (1994) results for single-injurer environments.
K10|Sex, Drugs, and Baby Booms: Can Behavior Overcome Biology?|We study the behavioral changes due to marijuana consumption on fertility and its key mechanisms, as opposed to physiological changes. We can employ several large proprietary data sets, including the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, Nielsen Retail Scanner database, as well as the Vital Statistics Natality files and apply a differences-in-differences approach by exploiting the timing of the introduction of medical marijuana laws among states. We first replicate the earlier literature by showing that marijuana use increases after the passage of medical marijuana laws. Our novel results reveal that birth rates increased after the passage of a law corresponding to increased frequency of sexual intercourse, decreased purchase of condoms and suggestive evidence on decreased condom use during sex. More sex and less contraceptive use may be attributed to behavioral responses such as increased attention to the immediate hedonic effects of sexual contact, delayed discounting and ignoring costs associated with risky sex. These findings are consistent with a large observational literature linking marijuana use with increased sexual activity and multiple partners. Our findings are robust to a broad set of tests.
K10|A Review of Geoffrey M. Hodgson, Conceptualizing Capitalism: Institutions, Evolution, Future|Capitalism and law go together in Geoffrey M. Hodgson's comprehensive analysis of the intellectual history and practical development of the capitalist system in Western Europe and North America. Given the breadth and depth of Professor Hodgson's reading in political economy and his reflections on its implications for the present and future of global capitalism, his book deserves to be widely read. Labeling his approach legal institutionalism, he argues that a legal system that supports capitalism and the market is necessary but not sufficient to sustain a fair and efficient economic system. The state makes efficient markets possible, but it must also deal with the inevitable tensions and the fundamental asymmetry between labor and capital. Tensions arise because labor cannot be used as collateral for the loans that are needed for large-scale capitalist enterprise. Hodgson has not developed the political implications of his conclusions in any detail, but his work ought to inspire research that explores the implications of his arguments for ongoing projects of nation building.
K10|Toward understanding 17th century English culture: A structural topic model of Francis Bacon's ideas|We use machine-learning methods to study the features and origins of the ideas of Francis Bacon, a key figure who provided the intellectual roots of a cultural paradigm that spurred modern economic development. Bacon's works are the data in an estimation of a structural topic model, a recently developed methodology for analysis of text corpora. The estimates uncover sixteen topics prominent in Bacon's opus. Two are key elements of the ideas usually associated with Bacon—inductive epistemology and fact-seeking. The utilitarian promise of science and the centralized organization of the scientific quest, embraced by Bacon's followers, were not emphasized by him. Using strategic communication, Bacon facilitated reception of his scientific methodology, targeted influential groups, and finessed powerful opponents. We provide the first quantitative evidence that the genesis of Bacon's epistemology lies in his experience in the common-law. Combining our findings with accepted arguments in the existing literature, we suggest that the effects of common-law culture can help explain the coincidence of early political and economic development in England.
K10|The Anatomy of Constitution Making: From Denmark in 1849 to Iceland in 2017|This paper reviews aspects of the constitution making process in Iceland after the financial collapse of 2008, emphasizing the differences between the provisional constitution of 1944 when Iceland separated unilaterally from Nazi-occupied Denmark and Denmark’s 1849 constitution which served, with notable exceptions, as the prototype for Iceland’s 1944 constitution. The comparison and contrast between the Icelandic and Danish constitutions invites a comparison also between Iceland’s 1944 constitution with the new post-crash constitution from 2011 accepted by two thirds of the voters in a national referendum in 2012 and waiting to be ratified twice by a reluctant Parliament. Against this comparative background, the paper proceeds to discuss political and procedural aspects of Iceland´s constitutional reform project, and concludes by proposing lessons to be learned from Iceland´s experience thus far.
K10|Descentralización (y centralización) sin representación: a propósito de la composición territorial del congreso colombiano|Este artículo explora la composición territorial del Congreso bicameral colombiano en las legislaturas del período 1991-2018. Ilustra la prevalencia y persistencia del fenómeno de los Departamentos sin senador, que ha afectado a jurisdicciones pequeñas y medianas en tamaño de población. Muestra que la composición de la Cámara de Representantes y la del Senado tienden a duplicarse, con predominio de las entidades territoriales más pobladas. Arguye que las reglas de composición del Senado no son inclusivas territorialmente y que conducen a una concentración geográfica excesiva del poder político, desaprovechando las posibilidades que ofrece el bicameralismo como mecanismo de balance de poderes en una democracia. Los problemas de representación política territorial en el centro no son intrascendentes: es allí donde se forja el marco legal de la descentralización y la centralización. El escrito analiza algunas propuestas y medidas dirigidas a encararlos. *** This paper explores the territorial composition of the Colombian bicameral Congress in the legislatures of the period 1991-2018. It illustrates the prevalence and persistence of the phenomenon of Departments without a Senator, which has affected small and medium-sized jurisdictions in population. It shows that the composition of the House of Representatives and that of the Senate tend to be similar, with predominance of the most populous territorial entities. It argues that the rules of composition of the Senate are not territorially inclusive and lead to an excessive geographical concentration of political power, missing out on the possibilities offered by bicameralism as a balance of power mechanism in a democracy. The problems of territorial political representation in the center are not inconsequential: It is there where the legal framework of decentralization and centralization is forged. The paper discusses some proposals and measures aimed at addressing such problems.
K10|Eradicating women-hurting customs: What role for social engineering?|Social engineering refers to deliberate attempts, often under the form of legislative moves, to promote changes in customs and norms that hurt the interests of marginalized population groups. This paper explores the analytical conditions under which social engineering is more or less likely to succeed than more indirect approaches when it comes to suppress genderbiased customs. This implies discussing the main possible interaction frameworks leading to antiwomen equilibria, and deriving policy implications from the corresponding games. The theoretical arguments are illustrated by examples drawn from available empirical works, thus providing a reasoned survey of the literature.
K10|Populism and Central Bank Independence|"The consensus that surrounded the granting of central bank independence in the pursuit of a price stability oriented monetary policy has been challenged in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, in the light of the rise of populism on the one hand and the expanded mandates of central banks on the other hand. After considering the economic case for independence and the three Ds (distributional, directional and duration effects), the paper examines three different dimensions in the debate of how the rise in populism - or simply general discontent with the status quo - affects central bank independence. Finally, the paper examines how to interpret the legality of central bank mandates, and whether or not central banks have exceeded their powers. This analysis leads us in turn to consider accountability and, in particular, the judicial review of central bank actions and decisions. It is important to have in place adequate mechanisms to ""guard the guardians"" of monetary and financial stability."
K10|Obeying vs. resisting unfair laws. A structural analysis of the internalization of collective preferences on redistribution using classification trees and random forests|In this paper, we study whether individual normative preferences are affected by the knowledge of collective normative preferences. In a questionnaire-experimental framework, we study whether respondents obey, resist or are indifferent to a very unfair but legal distribution of an inheritance between a minimum wage-earner and a millionaire. In addition to regressions, we use classification trees and random forests to provide a full picture of how asymmetric combinations of self-interest and ideological factors may lead to identical individual redistributive preferences and law internalization attitudes. We find that sensitivity to procedural fairness and responsibility cut opinions are good predictors of individual redistributive preferences. We also find that law internalization is associated with the support of core normative values, but not with the support of fairness as procedures. This echoes Cooterâ€™s hypothesis of â€˜meta preferencesâ€™ triggering an expressive vs. backlash effects of laws. Lastly, we find that, among the law-sensitive, the social â€˜losersâ€™ tend to submit to the unfair but legal collective preference while the social â€˜winnersâ€™ tend to either be indifferent of voice their disagreement.
K10|The Digital Privacy Paradox: Small Money, Small Costs, Small Talk|'Notice and Choice' has been a mainstay of policies designed to safeguard consumer privacy. This paper investigates distortions in consumer behavior when faced with notice and choice which may limit the ability of consumers to safeguard their privacy using field experiment data from the MIT digital currency experiment. There are three findings. First, the effect small incentives have on disclosure may explain the privacy paradox: Whereas people say they care about privacy, they are willing to relinquish private data quite easily when incentivized to do so. Second, small navigation costs have a tangible effect on how privacy-protective consumers' choices are, often in sharp contrast with individual stated preferences about privacy. Third, the introduction of irrelevant, but reassuring information about privacy protection makes consumers less likely to avoid surveillance, regardless of their stated preferences towards privacy.
K10|The certainty versus the severity of punishment, repeat offenders, and stigmatization|There is a widely held presumption among criminologists that the certainty of punishment p is a greater deterrent than the severity of punishment (s). This presumption is at odds with recent experimental work as well as the implications of simple law enforcement models. This article shows that when offenses may be committed repeatedly, p may have a greater deterrent effect than s, even when each individual offender is more responsive to sthan p. This resolves the discrepancy between experimental results and the common belief held among criminologists.
K10|Watching India's Insolvency Reforms: A New Dataset of Insolvency Cases|This paper introduces a new dataset of orders passed by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in the insolvency cases under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code or IBC. It builds this dataset to attempt an empirical analysis of the economic effect of the IBC and the performance of the judiciary under the IBC. There are 23 fields of information recorded in the dataset for each case. It analyses orders passed during the first six months of operationalisation of the provisions of the IBC to answer questions such as who are the initial users of the insolvency process under the IBC, what kind of evidence are they using to support their claims before the NCLT, what is the average time taken by the NCLT to dispose off insolvency cases, what is the outcome of the proceedings and is there variation between the benches. Within this limited dataset and within such a short time from the passing of the law, the paper finds behavioural shifts among credit market participants. As the insolvency cases increase, this data set will too increase in scope and size and will form the foundation to answer questions relating to the impact of the IBC and the overall functioning of the Indian bankruptcy regime.
K10|Kwangju Incident and Role of the Judiciary in South Korea|"""Objective – The Constitutional Court of South Korea (‘the Court’) is the guardian of the constitution and has jurisdiction to decide cases concerning potential violations of the constitution. In the Kwangju incident, innocent citizens were murdered and injured while they were protesting against the military government. Their demand was to be provided the basic rights which are granted by the constitution of South Korea, as well as seeking democracy in the country. This paper analyses the judgment of the Court and observations of the judges. Further, it discusses the effects of the judgment on legislation, as well as analysing the situation involved in deciding the case in which unconstitutional actions of the military government were declared inhumane. Methodology/Technique – The research reviews articles in related area. Findings – Through this judgement, the Court played a major role in strengthening the constitution and democracy, through the way in which it reached a conclusion in the Kwangju incident case. The Court suggested the legislator should introduce new legislation to remove the latches of the case. Novelty – The study intends to learn the effects of the judgement on South Korean legislation."""
K10|The Position Of The Bank Indonesia As The Lender Of Last Resort After The Enactment Of Law No. 9 Of 2016 On Prevention And Mitigation Of Financial System Crisis|Objective – This paper explores the role of the Indonesian Central Bank as the Lender of the Last Resort. Methodology/Technique – This research uses normative juridical research and secondary data. Findings – The results indicate that the Bank of Indonesian, in coordination with the Financial Services Authority, still has the authority to grant short-term loans for banks with liquidity issues. Nevertheless, the Bank of Indonesia does not have authority to provide emergency finance facilities where the funding is granted at the government's expense. Novelty – This paper uses normative juridical research and qualitative data analysis.
K10|How Status Seeking may Prevent Coasean Bargaining|Even in a world with zero transaction costs, status seeking can prevent efficient Coasean bargaining. Using simple illustrations and various examples, we show that ignoring this impediment can explain the failure of some negotiations where an efficient bargain seems a priori reachable and expected. Rather than just emphasizing this neglected issue, we discuss various institutional and behavioral strategies by which this impediment can be overcome and even strategically used in socially desirable directions, such as bargaining over status.
K10|Judicial Choice among Cases for Certiorari|How does the Supreme Court choose among cases to grant cert? In the context of a model that considers a strategic Supreme Court, a continuum of rule-following lower courts, a set of cases available for revision, and a distribution of future lower court cases, we show that the Court grants cert to the case that will most significantly shape future lower court case outcomes in the direction that the Court prefers. That is, the Court grants cert to the case with maximum salience. If the Court is rather liberal (conservative) then the most salient case is the one that moves the discretionary range of the legal standard as far left (right) as possible. But if the Court is moderate, then the most salient case will be a function of the skewedness of the distribution of ideologies of the lower courts and the likelihood that future cases will fall within the part of the discretionary range that is adjusted if the case is granted cert. Variations take place when the ideology of the Court is moderately liberal, moderately conservative or fully moderate. Extensions of the model allow us to identify the sensitivity of the results to the number of petitions for revision; the variety of legal topics covered by the petitions; and anticipation of whether the Court will confirm or reverse.
K10|Explaining Difference in the Quantity of Supreme Court Revisions: A Model for Judicial Uniformity|While civil law supreme courts (e.g., Italy, France, Chile) hear up to 90% of the petitions for revisions, common law supreme courts (e.g., U.S., U.K, Canada) hear as low as 1% of the same type of cases. In this study we postulate that these different commitments towards revisions are each consistent with different approaches by which the legal system provides judicial uniformity. We formulate a theoretical model that shows that a given level of uniformity in lower (or appeal) court decisions can be achieved either by fixing a given probability of judicial revision or a given monetary/non-monetary disutility associated with a reversal. Hence, despite the fact that common law legal systems are characterized by a lower probability of case revision, we cannot state a priori that judicial uniformity is greater in civil law systems, as this will depend upon the magnitude of the disutility associated with a reversed decision. Indeed, with the exception of the impact upon career concerns (which net effect is not clear) in terms of ideology, reputation and legal standards, reversal disutility seems to be much higher in common law systems than in civil law systems. In addition, we demonstrate that in an efficient legal system the optimal number of revisions increases with the size of the reversal disutility, but decreases with the probability that the supreme court makes erroneous decisions; the total number of cases soliciting revision and the intrinsic utility obtained by a lower court which enforces its desired rule. We also show that in an efficient legal system it is the judicial law-making role of a common law supreme court that explains why that Court revises fewer cases than a civil law supreme court.
K10|Convincing early adopters: Price signals and Information transmission|We study the optimal pricing strategy for a new product when consumers learn from both prices and early adopters’ purchase decisions. In our model, a long-lived monopolist faces a representative consumer each period. The monopolist is privately informed about his type, the probability of producing good-quality products. First-period consumers are early adopters, who learn quality before purchasing the product. Second-period consumers learn about product quality only after observing the public history, namely past price and early adopters’ purchase decisions. In this context, prices play a dual role, acting as signals of the firm’s type but also facilitating or impeding information transmission between early adopters and second-period consumers. Our main result is that separation might occur through either high or low prices (with respect to the full-information monopoly price), depending on the elasticity of demand. When demand for good-quality products is less elastic, high prices are less costly for high-type firms due to both a static (through demand) and dynamic (through information transmission) effects. On the one hand, high-type firms are marginally less affected by high prices, since they lose fewer consumers. On the other hand, early sales at higher prices carry good news about quality to second-period consumers, since such sales are more likely to come from a good than from a bad-quality product. The opposite happens occurs when demand for good-quality products is more elastic. We provide two market examples for each case and show that in the case of disruptive (incremental) innovations high (low) prices can be used as signals of quality. We finally discuss consumer welfare under the two resulting alternative equilibria, and show that the observability of early adopters’ purchase decisions improves consumer welfare when separation occurs through high prices.
K10|Gordon Tullock and the Virginia School of Law and Economics|Abstract In 1999 Gordon Tullock became Professor at the George Mason University Law School. Tullock’s arrival at George Mason brought the economics department and the law school close together. The work that resulted during those years consolidated the methodological foundations for a different way of thinking about the economic analysis of law—the “functional” approach to law and economics. The functional law and economics approach espoused by the Virginia School was not attacking any of the results of the Chicago School or the Yale School, but rather proposing a methodological shift. This paper presents some of the results developed by this school and illustrates Tullock’s controversial positions on trials and on the common law system, through anecdotes, Tullock’s own work and related scholarly contributions.
K10|On security of collateral in Danish mortgage finance: a formula of property rights, incentives and market mechanisms|Abstract Specialized mortgage intermediaries in Denmark have for over 200 years provided owners and buyers of real property wide access to credit. The present paper sets out to explore the safeguards that nurtured development of a robust, market based financing system and a deep mortgage market. Observations are made on the nature of collateral performance in respect to property rights, mortgage law and market development in search of general features of required institutional arrangements. The robustness of the Danish mortgage finance system is largely accredited to the securitization model based on the balance principle that assigns risks and responsibility to market players in a self-disciplinary manner and protected the mortgage banks against cash flow mismatches even during deep crisis, as history attests. It is shown how property registers and effective enforcement have created transparent property rights and practically reduced legal risks of mortgaging to zero. Standardization and scale of economics supported collateral efficiency, as measured in terms of simplicity, transparency, rapidity and costs. The Danish mortgage finance system illustrates the critical role of government in insuring the quality and enforceability of mortgage collateral, and reducing uncertainty for market players throughout the entire process. The paper suggests that sound incentive structures of the securitization model, strong commitment mechanisms and the market mechanisms constituted a complex formula of safeguards that—rather than specific capital coverage requirements—created the preconditions required for a well-functioning mortgage market.
K10|Understanding Social Market Economy, Francesco Forte and His Interpretation|Abstract The social thought which emerges from Francesco Forte’s economic writings proves to be mainly inspired by methodological individualism, though interpreted through a peculiar “personalistic” key. We will analyze the peculiar traits of his thought and the specific contribution that Forte gave to the understanding of a specific economic theory based on the doctrine of “Ordoliberalism” or the “Freiburg School.” In our work, we will show how Forte proposes an interpretation of that doctrine, according to two of his main points of reference in economic and philosophical thought: Luigi Einaudi and Antonio Rosmini Serbati. Finally, we will present an important aspect of Forte’s work: his institutional analysis in the light of the particular civil philosophy expressed by Christian social teaching.
K10|Diffusion of Legal Innovations: The Case of Israeli Class Actions|In law and economics, it is standard to model legal rules as an opportunity structure. The law’s subjects maximize expected profit, given these constraints. In such a model, the reaction to legal innovation is immediate. This is not what we observe after class action is introduced into Israeli law. For a long time, the new remedy is almost unused. Then the adoption process gains momentum. We discuss alternative options for theorizing the effect. We find that market entry is not only explained by the available information about profitability, but also by the adoption pattern of others. When deciding whether to bring further claims, law firms also react to the experiences they have made themselves. We thus explain the pattern by individual and social learning, and cannot exclude mere social imitation.

K10|Concordian Economics: Beyond Micro and Macroeconomics|In Concordian economics there is no distinction between micro and macro economics, because the economic process is the same for the individual person, the city, the nation, or the world, What changes is the scale, but not the structure of the process. When micro and macro economics are seen as one, it makes no sense to add monetary wealth to real wealth. It becomes then evident that monetary wealth is not wealth; monetary wealth is a legal representation of real wealth.
K10|New Evidence on the Casual Effect of Traffic safety Laws on Drunk Driving and Traffic Fatalities|In the United States, about 28 lives are lost daily in motor vehicle accidents that involve an alcohol-impaired driver. The conventional wisdom is that these accidents can be prevented through the use of strict traffic laws that are robustly enforced, though no consensus exists on the causal impact of these laws in reducing motor vehicle-related fatalities. This paper exploits quasi-random variation in state-level driving and road safety restrictions to estimate the causal effect of select traffic laws on the number of fatal accidents and fatal accidents involving a drunk driver. In this paper, we employ the contiguous-border county-pair approach. This is causally identified from the discontinuities in policy treatments among homogeneous contiguous counties that are separated by a shared state border. This approach addresses the econometric issues created due to spatial heterogeneity that may have biased several studies in the literature. The analysis reveals that the laws related to accident prevention, such as having a good graduated licensing system, Pigovian beer taxes and primary seatbelt enforcement, are the most effective in reducing motor vehicle-related fatalities. Using these estimated coefficients, simple simulations suggest that policymakers have been utilizing existing traffic laws sub-optimally, saving only 17% of the lives lost to motor vehicle crashes.
K10|Constitutional Bases of Public Finances in the Central and Eastern European Countries|The paper analyses and compares some constitutional examples, especially in the 29 NISPAcee countries, how the states settle the bases of the economy and public finance in their constitutions or fundamental laws. The main hypothesis can be formulated as, is there any correlation between the constitutional provisions (or other relevant law sources) and the performance of the economy (GDP growth), sound and sustainable fiscal policy (budgeting, government debt, taxation, audit), furthermore monetary policy (price and exchange rate stability); also after the amendments can any changes be identified or not.
K10|Measuring institutions during and after colonisation in Senegal (1819-2010)|Most of the widely used indicators of institutions have been criticised for the lack of objectivity in their construction and for their coverage of short time periods, especially for African countries. New objective indicators of de jure property rights, de jure political and civil rights, and de facto political instability over a long time horizon have been recently launched for a number of former African British colonies, using the leximetrics method. This paper proposes comparable indicators of institutions for a former African French colony, Senegal. De jure indicators are coded based on written regulations, laws and constitutions for the period 1819-2010. Our de facto measure of political instability is based on reported events collected from different sources. Data from such a long time horizon provide an opportunity to understand the Senegal's path of development from the early time of the colonisation until today.
K10|Tyranny Of Majority: The Contractarian Solution|In this paper we are trying to describe one of the classical problem of political theory: which decision can be created by majority rule. For our purpose we can define democracy as a method of creation of political decisions in a political society. Essence of this method is so called ?majority rule? which is applied on different levels of political process. The classical definition of democracy is ?rule of the people by the people?. Under the majority rule, we have not governance of all individuals, but, obviously, only one part of the people that is ?majority?. So, there is some kind of gap between the ideal type and essence of democracy as rule of the people, and de facto situation when the power is in the hands of majority. The standard solution for this problem we can find in the tradition of contractualism. In this model of creation of political community we have two levels of ?transferring? of power [rights]. First is so called the social contract: ?the constitutional phase? within which we create a basic rules, the fundamental tenets of our society [the constitution]. For this step we have the unanimity-request: the logical necessity for the social contract is the consent of all. Second is ?the post-constitutional phase? [J.Buchanan] where we create executive body to makes decision on the day-to-day level, and legislative body to provide a framework [the legal order] for that. If the legislative body makes the laws which are compatible by the constitution, these laws have ?implied? consent of all. Within this ?post-constitutive? or ?executive? phase, we cannot insist to unanimity because that will be inconsistent with our decision to leave the state of nature and go-in the political society: by the social contract we create the state as an agency for regulation of conflict, misunderstandings etc between members. From this theoretical concept it is obvious and clear for which kind of decision the majority rule can be used: only for decisions from the post-constitutional phase. If we try to solve some conflict which is in the sphere of constitution by using the majority rule, we have situation of tyranny of majority.
K10|Patent Validity Challenges and The America Invents Act|Patent reexamination or patent review systems can lower the cost of challenging patent validity and help improve patent quality. We empirically investigate post-grant patent validity challenges at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and how the 2011 America Invents Act affected them. We compare the inter partes reexamination with the inter partes review procedure that replaced it after the reform. To identify the effect of the policy changes, we exploit the fact that patents filed before the act passed, but granted after the new inter partes review system took effect, are not eligible for reexamination in the old system. We find that more patent challenges end with a patentee win after the policy change. Still, at least one patent claim is canceled in more than 60% of the cases. Challenged patents issued to small entities more often had at least one claim canceled compared to other patents.
K10|Eradicating Women-Hurting Customs: What Role for Social Engineering?|Social engineering refers to deliberate attempts, often under the form of legislative moves, to promote changes in customs and norms that hurt the interests of marginalized population groups. This paper explores the analytical conditions under which social engineering is more or less likely to succeed than more indirect approaches when it comes to suppress gender-biased customs. This implies discussing the main possible interaction frameworks leading to anti-women equilibria, and deriving policy implications from the corresponding games. The theoretical arguments are illustrated by examples drawn from available empirical works, thus providing a reasoned survey of the literature.
K10|Wenn ich zwanzig Ziegen will und Du mir keine geben magst - Ein Überblick über die Möglichkeiten und Methoden der Streitbeilegung|Der Beitrag zeigt die verschiedenen Möglichkeiten einer Streitbeilegung in Deutschland auf. Ein Konflikt kann grundsätzlich im Machtmodell, im Delegationsmodell oder im Konsensmodell gelöst werden. Die Möglichkeit zur nachhaltigsten Konfliktlösung bietet die Konfliktlösung im Konsensmodell, da die Parteien im Rahmen des Konsensmodells die Gelegenheit erhalten, sich über ihre wirklichen Interessen klar zu werden und gemeinsam und eigenverantwortlich eine Lösung zu suchen, die ihren Bedürfnissen und Interessen gerecht wird. Wenn die Parteien nicht bereit sind, freiwillig und auf Augenhöhe gemeinsam an einer Lösung des Konflikts zu arbeiten, dann bietet das Gerichtsverfahren mit seiner Bindung an das materielle Recht, seinen prozessualen Verfahrensgarantien und seinem unparteiischen Entscheider zumindest eine gewisse Sicherheit dafür, dass der Unerfahrene oder wirtschaftlich Unterlegene eine angemessene Konfliktlösung auf der Grundlage der bestehenden Gesetze erhält. Mit der Verabschiedung des Verbraucherstreitbeilegungsgesetzes im Jahr 2016 ist die Diskussion über die richtige Konfliktlösungsmethode in Gesellschaft und Politik erneut in den Fokus gerückt. Dieses Gesetz sieht für vertragliche Streitigkeiten zwischen Verbraucher und Unternehmern ein flächendeckendes Angebot einer Streitbeilegung mithilfe eines Schlichtungsverfahrens, also eines Konsensverfahrens vor. Der Erfolg dieses Verfahrens wird entscheidend davon abhängen, ob es den Verbraucherschlichtungsstellen gelingt, das Machtgefälle zwischen Unternehmen und Verbrauchern aufzuheben und beide Seiten von den Vorteilen einer einvernehmlichen Konfliktlösung zu überzeugen.
K10|The development of English company law before 1900|This article outlines the development of English company law in the four centuries before 1900. The main focus is on the evolution of the corporate form and the five key legal characteristics of the corporation - separate legal personality, limited liability, transferable joint stock, delegated management, and investor ownership. The article outlines how these features developed in guilds, regulated companies, and the great mercantilist and moneyed companies. I then move on to examine the State's control of incorporation and the attempts by the founders and lawyers of unincorporated business enterprises to craft the legal characteristics of the corporation. Finally, the article analyses the forces behind the liberalisation of incorporation law in the middle of the nineteenth century.
K10|Balanced budget rules and fiscal outcomes: Evidence from historical constitutions|This paper studies the reduced-form effects of constitutional-level balanced budget rules (BBRs) on fiscal outcomes. Using historical data for a large set of countries dating back to the nineteenth century and applying a difference-in-difference design we find that the introduction of a constitutional BBR leads to a reduced probability of experiencing a sovereign debt crisis. We estimate that debt-to-GDP ratio decreases by around eleven percentage points on average, most of these consolidation being explained by decreasing expenditures rather than increasing tax revenues. Using the same methodology and sample, we do not find evidence that non-constitutional BBRs included in national legislation affect these variables. Additional estimates gained from applying the synthetic control method on nine selected case study countries in Africa, Europe, and Latin America are consistent with the main findings, but also highlight the importance of country specific circumstances when evaluating the success of BBRs.
K10|Malicious litigation|It has long been recognized that some plaintiffs sue defendants out of malice, but malicious litigation has not been previously modeled in the law and economics literature. I construct a simple model of malicious litigation, wherein malice is defined by the plaintiff's obtaining some utility whenever the defendant incurs costs. When plaintiffs are malicious, they are more likely to file even non-meritorious suits; both probability of filing and the plaintiff's settlement payoff increase in the plaintiff's malice. However, if the defendant is also malicious, obtaining utility when the plaintiff incurs litigation expenses, settlements may fail even with complete information. Two-sided malice deters filing over a certain parameter range; outside it, it raises the ratio of cases that go to trial instead of being resolved through settlement. Giving the defendant the right to call for a bar on settlement is less effective at deterring malicious lawsuits relative to non-malicious “negative-expected-value” (NEV) or “nuisance” suits. However, combining the optional settlement bar with a “commitment requirement” stipulating that the plaintiff commit to going to trial (rather than withdraw) whenever the defendant opts to defend discourages malicious litigation for a wider range of parameters.
K10|The economic and legal significance of “full” deposit availability|Bank deposits have two characteristics: they are available on demand and at par value. Deposit redemptions face, at least given current technology, a lag between when they are requested and when they are delivered. This fact leads some to argue that as a deposit is not fully available, all deposits are, in fact, loans and that the legal obligation of the depository changes. We argue that this lag does not nullify the original economic intent of the deposit, and hence, does not alter the legal obligations that a depository faces. Deposits must be held safely to ensure that the depositor′s money will be available when an unforeseen event occurs. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2016

K10|The Prospects, Benefits and Challenges of Sui Generis Protection of Geographical Indications of South Africa|This article appraises the prospects, benefits and challenges of sui generis protection of geographical indications (GIs) in South Africa (SA). In SA, there is no specific legislation protecting GIs, and the country relies, amongst others, on the common law system and various legislations, such as the Agricultural Products Standards Act of 1990; Counterfeit Goods of 1997; the Liquor Products; the Trademark Act; the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Act of 2013; and the Consumer Protection Act of 1998. It is therefore argued that SA needs a specific law that considers GIs as a specific, separate intellectual property right (IPR).
K10|Prosecutorial Power and its Constitutional Limits in South Africa: Reflections on the Pikoli Saga|The suspension and subsequent dismissal by the President of the Republic of South Africa of the national director of public prosecutions, Advocate Vusi Pikoli, in 2007 and 2008 respectively, sparked a heated debate among legal scholars and political commentators concerning the extent to which the national prosecuting authority can freely exercise its prosecutorial powers in South Africa. The suspension in particular evoked widespread criticism against the President for what legal scholars and opposition political parties across South Africa referred to as the political interference with the functions of an independent institution. This paper revisits the case of the dismissed director to look closely at the nature and extent of prosecutorial power and to try to understand its limits under the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. An attempt is made to address a few interesting legal questions that emerge from the case. The first concerns the extent to which the national prosecuting authority can perform its functions independently, without interference and free from partisan politics. The second concerns the relationship between the political agenda of the prosecuting authority and its ability to execute its constitutional mandate. Because of the difficulty of reconciling the impartiality required for the proper discharge of the prosecuting authority?s constitutional responsibilities and its political accountability, the relationship between the prosecuting authority and the executive is critically examined. Thus, two fundamental concepts that are relevant to the effective functioning of the prosecuting authority, namely prosecutorial independence and prosecutorial accountability, are critically analysed. Drawing on the lessons from the case of the dismissed director, this paper makes an observation that the current constitutional structure pertaining to the national prosecuting authority in South Africa does not support the notion of complete prosecutorial independence. On the contrary, it is argued that under certain circumstances, such as in matters affecting or involving national security, the intervention of the relevant political head in the functions of the prosecuting authority may be legally justified.
K10|The Role Of Dissenting And Concurring Opinions In The Constitutional Jurisdiction|The Judges’ possibility to submit dissenting / concurring opinions is disputed as arguments are brought both for and against it in the context of the obligation to ensure the secrecy of deliberations. This study, bringing landmarks of the European Constitutional Courts’ legislation and case-law on the subject, demonstrates the role of the dissenting and concurring opinions in the development of the law, emphasizing the idea of balance for their formulation and grounds.
K10|Considerations Regarding The Integration Of Fundamental Human Rights In The System Of Natural Law|This article studies the relationships and interactions between fundamental human rights and natural law school. The objectives of this paper are circumscribed to the way fundamental human rights, by their nature, can be integrated within the doctrine of natural law or to the contrary, may be related to various branches of legal positivism. In specialized literature, it was pointed out that fundamental human rights constitute genuine natural rights which have the same natural law recognized attributes: immutability, non-alienable nature et. al. However, in the context of contemporary changes within the European Union, generated by cultural differences which are becoming ever more significant, the question rises of whether those rights are in fact a creation of legal positivism. Within the paperthere are several doctrine opinions described, as well as some arguments for reconsidering the placement of fundamental rights within the sphere of legal positivism. Using the comparative method, the study analyzes the common points and the points of divergence between fundamental rights and the doctrines of natural law and legal positivism, seen through the prism of the general theory of systems, legal culture, legal colonialism and legal ethnocentrism.
K10|Sine Die Suspension Of Law Enforcement - Reason For The Cessation Of Its Existence?|"The successive suspensions of aid payments from 2011 and to date, as provided by the framework Law 284/2010- Annex ,7 for uniform pay, amended, section 3, have caused serious damage to property observance, as guaranteed by Art. 1 of Protocol no. 1, additional to the European Convention on Human Rights. ”Invoking the country's economic and financial situation by the legislator, in order to restrict the exercise of a fundamental right springing from a law that is still in force, is not sufficient, but that restriction must meet all the requirements specified in Art. 53 of the Constituti on”. The rules that have the effect of ""sine die"" suspending the rights of former employees, now retired, restrict and limit forcedly their rights guaranteed by law and cannot be considered democratic measures, as long as successive suspensions can affect the very existence of the law. Research methods used: direct documenting through case studies from personal law practice and not only, as well as from primary and secondary bibliographic documentation. Results and implications of the study: the impact of these rules that defer the payment of aids to former employees is significant, in that they bring material losses, but also that it violates the constitutional principle of the rule of law. Sue petitions pending lawsuit in courts have been formulated, whereby admitting the application of these rights and compelling former employers to pay the ”aids” given by the law, and largely the courts upheld these claims."
K10|On ergodic algorithms for equilibrium problems|In this paper, we present a new iteration method for solving monotone equilibrium problems. This new method is based on the ergodic iteration method Ronald and Bruck in (J Math Anal Appl 61:159–164, 1977 ) and the auxiliary problem principle Noor in (J Optim Theory Appl 122:371–386, 2004 ), but it includes the usage of symmetric and positive definite matrices. The proposed algorithm is very simple. Moreover, it simplifies the assumptions necessary in order to converge to the solution. Specifically, whereas previous methods require strong monotonicity and Lipschitz-type continuous conditions, our proposed method only requires weak monotonicity conditions. Applications to the generalized variational inequality problem and some numerical results are reported. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016
K10|South Africa: Trading international investment for policy space|The overall trend since 1994 of growing foreign direct investment into South Africa has been a reflection of the country’s openness to investment as well as significant international trust in its institutions. Recent policy and legislative developments, including the termination of South Africa’s bilateral investment treaties with EU trading partners and the introduction of the Protection of Investment Act, are however raising concern among international investors and bringing into question the attractiveness and reliability of South Africa as a destination for foreign investment. These concerns have been compounded by increasing regulatory restrictions upon foreign investors, including stricter visa requirements, and the introduction of various other pieces of legislation that have implications upon the level of protection of property rights in South Africa. A policy shift, reflected in legislation such as the Protection of Investment Act, the Private Security Industry Regulation Amendment Bill and the Expropriation Bill, indicates an enhanced focus on the public interest aspect of the constitutional right to property in accordance with the government’s constitutionally mandated transformative agenda. A balance needs to be found between the government’s sovereign right to implement domestic policies in order to achieve its socio-economic goals, its duty to protect foreign investments, and its overall objective of promoting sustainable economic growth.
K10|Do judges react to the probability of appellate review? Empirical evidence from trial court procedures| The appellate review system is intended to serve as an efficient remedy for imperfect judicial decision making. However, it can fulfil this task only when appeals are ex ante unpredictable to the judge, and thus can be expected to occur primarily in case of a bad verdict. Using data from case records of a German trial court, we show that the probability of appeal can be predicted based on easily observable exogenous factors. Controlling for the complexity of a legal case, we find that judges also tend to decrease their effort when the ex ante probability of appeal is low. Thus, our empirical evidence indicates an inefficiency in the appellate review system because trial judges allocate their effort to cases not exclusively according to case complexity, but particularly according to the ex ante probability of being reviewed.
K10|Precision-Guided or Blunt? The Effects of US Economic Sanctions on Human Rights|We use endogenous treatment-regression models to estimate the causal average treatment effect of US economic sanctions on four types of human rights. In contrast to previous studies, we find no support for adverse effects of sanctions on economic rights, political and civil rights, and basic human rights. With respect to women's rights, our findings even indicate a positive relationship. Emancipatory rights are, on average, strengthened when a country faces sanctions by the US. Our findings are robust when applying various changes to the empirical specification. Most importantly, this study provides strong evidence that the endogeneity of treatment assignment must be modelled when the consequences of sanctions are studied empirically.
K10|Informality and Optimal Public Policy|This article explores optimal public policy, in terms of the level of tax enforcement and the supply of public goods, in an economy characterized by a huge informal sector. We define informality as the set of productive activities that do not comply (totally or partially) with government regulations. The government intervenes as a Stackelberg leader and has to decide how to allocate public expenditures, using funds collected through the tax system, between the provision of a public good, which can only be used for formal activities, and enforcement effort, aimed at detecting informal firms that evade taxes. Taking the public policy as given, a representative household, owner of a representative firm, decides how to divide a fixed supply of labor between formal and informal activities. Our results show that the greater the distortions in the tax collection process, the larger is the informal sector. Finally, we derive the properties of the optimal public policy. In particular, we show that the shadow cost of public funds represents the rationale of enforcement spending.
K10|Determinants of Mortgage Default and Consumer Credit Use: The Effects of Foreclosure Laws and Foreclosure Delays| The mortgage default decision is part of a complex household credit management problem. We examine how factors affecting mortgage default spill over to other credit markets. As home equity turns negative, homeowners default on mortgages and home equity lines of credit at higher rates, whereas they prioritize repaying credit cards and auto loans. Larger unused credit card limits intensify the preservation of credit cards over housing debt. Although mortgage nonrecourse statutes increase default on all types of housing debt, they reduce credit card defaults. Foreclosure delays increase default rates for housing and nonhousing debts. Our analysis highlights the interconnectedness of debt repayment decisions.
K10|Strip Clubs, â€œSecondary Effects,â€ and Residential Property Prices|"The ""secondary effects"" legal doctrine allows municipalities to zone, or otherwise regulate, sexually oriented businesses. Negative ""secondary effects"" (economic externalities) justify limiting First Amendment protection of speech conducted inside strip clubs. One example of a secondary effect, cited in no fewer than four United States Supreme Court rulings, is the negative effect of strip clubs on the quality of the surrounding neighborhood. Little empirical evidence that strip clubs do, in fact, have a negative effect on the surrounding neighborhood exists. To the extent that changes in neighborhood quality are reflected by changes in property prices, property prices should decrease when a strip club opens up nearby. We estimate an augmented repeat sales regression model of housing prices to estimate the effect of strip clubs on nearby residential property prices. Using real estate transactions from King County, Washington, we test the hypothesis that strip clubs have a negative effect on surrounding residential property prices. We exploit the unique and unexpected termination of a 17 year moratorium on new strip club openings in order to generate exogenous variation in the operation of strip clubs. We find no statistical evidence that strip clubs have ""secondary effects"" on nearby residential property prices."
K10|Precision-Guided or Blunt? The Effects of US Economic Sanctions on Human Rights|This study contributes to the literature that analyzes the consequences of economic sanctions for the target country’s human rights situation. We offer a political economy explanation for different types of human rights infringements or improvements in reaction to economic shocks caused by sanctions. Based on this, we derive hypotheses linking sanctions to four types of human rights: economic rights, political and civil rights, basic human rights, and emancipatory rights. We use endogenous treatment regression models to estimate the causal average treatment effect of US economic sanctions on each type of human rights within a uniform empirical framework. In contrast to previous studies, we find no adverse effects of sanctions on economic rights, political and civil rights, and basic human rights, once the endogenous selection into sanctions is modelled. With respect to women’s rights, our findings even indicate a positive relationship. Emancipatory rights are, on average, strengthened when a country experiences sanctions by the US. Our findings are robust and we find little evidence for effect heterogeneity between types of target countries or sanctions. Most importantly, this study shows that the endogeneity of treatment assignment must be modelled when the consequences of sanctions are studied empirically.
K10|When to expect a coup d’état? An extreme bounds analysis of coup determinants|Abstract Over the last several decades, both economists and political scientists have shown interest in coups d’état. Numerous studies have been dedicated to understanding the causes of coups. However, model uncertainty still looms large. About one hundred potential determinants of coups have been proposed, but no consensus has emerged on an established baseline model for analyzing coups. We address this problem by testing the sensitivity of inferences to over three million model permutations in an extreme bounds analysis. Overall, we test the robustness of 66 factors proposed in the empirical literature based on a monthly sample of 164 countries that covers the years 1952–2011. We find that slow economic growth rates, previous coup experiences, and other forms of political violence to be particularly conducive to inciting coups.
K10|Determinants of in-court settlements: empirical evidence from a German trial court|Because verdicts are typically the more costly resolution of legal disputes, most governments are interested in high settlement rates. In this paper, we use a unique dataset of 860 case records from a German trial court to explore which factors have a significant impact on the decision to settle in civil law litigation. We find that case-specific factors, procedural aspects and individual characteristics of the involved judge have a significant impact on settlement probability. Interestingly, we find supporting evidence for the hypothesis that the gender of the involved judge has an impact on settlement probabilities in certain subfields of law. Based on our empirical results, we derive some conclusions for legal policies that aim at increasing settlement rates.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
K10|Affirmative Action and the Quality-Fit Trade-Off|"This paper reviews the literature on affirmative action in undergraduate education and law schools, focusing especially on the trade-off between institutional quality and the fit between a school and a student. We discuss the conditions under which affirmative action for underrepresented minorities (URM) could help or harm their educational outcomes. We provide descriptive evidence on the extent of affirmative action in law schools, as well as a critical review of the contentious literature on how affirmative action affects URM law-school student performance. Our review then discusses affirmative action in undergraduate admissions, focusing on the effects such admissions preferences have on college quality, graduation rates, college major, and earnings. We conclude by examining the evidence on ""percent plans"" as a replacement for affirmative action. ( JEL I23, I26, I28, J15, J31, J44, K10)"

K10|The consequences of not applying mutátis mutándis a decision of the Romanian Constitutional Court|"The article aims at procedural mechanism of application of art.147, paragraph 2 of Romanian Constitution, in the specific case of pronouncing an unconstitutionality decision which concerns a law in draft before its promulgation, but especially focuses on the effects produced by such a normative act adopted without consideration of the Constitutional Court Decision. In other words, the Parliament, although bound to reconsider those provisions to bring them into line with the Constitutional Court decision, for failure to comply with this obligation, it brings us into the situation of prevalence inability of this Constitutional Court Decision and breach of a law in force which was, moreover, declared unconstitutional still at the planning stage. In this way, we find that the effects in question are reflected in an unfavorable way; above all the interest of local collectivities; and raises a big question mark on the achievement of both the ""joint"" powers of Parliament's own, and the concept of ""local autonomy"" by those who exercise it, knowing your rights, obligations and limits allowed."
K10|Shortcomings of lawmaking process in Romania. Their influence on the rule of law|The study aims to analyze the main shortcomings that are found in lawmaking process in Romania. It will be structured in four sections, in which will be addressed, in succession, the requirements drawn from constitutional regulations in matters of lawmaking process in Romania, then the rules and principles drawn from the legislation of rules regarding the legislative technique. Further, reporting to the ideas expressed in the first two sections, there will be highlighted the worst shortcomings, by the content and consequences, and in the last part of the study will be revealed the negative effects they produce in the rule of law and, implicitly, on businesses environment. Also, there will be outlined several possible solutions and recommendations that should be considered in the future.
K10|Considerations regarding the constitutional obligation determining the financing source for budgetary expenditures|This study examines the relation between constitutionality and opportunity in order to adopt regulations in matters of economy and finance. The analysis concerns in particular the regulation process on budgetary expenditures, respectively the constitutional obligation to indicate the source of financing for these expenses. The legal and jurisprudential landmarks identified are likely to reveal the delicate issues of balancing the concurring interests, as well as the constitutionalisation tendency of certain obligations imposed by the law of public finances and, respectively, the Fiscal Responsibility Law in the sense of transforming them into “constitutional criteria” through the application of Article 138 (5) of the Constitution.
K10|Business and human rights: from soft law to hard law?|Over the last decades the international community turned its attention towards the impact that businesses have on human rights, and the role they can play in furt hering human rights protection, in light of the lead role they play in globalization, and the increasingly vocal allegations of human rights violations directed against some multinationals. These developments triggered some action at the United Nations, and at the European Union level, and led to the development of international soft law in this area, moving slowly towards binding instruments. This paper explores the evolution of business and human rights, presents the current international non-binding instruments, as well as some states’ binding initiatives in this area, and highlights the tendency to move from soft law to hard law, to leave the realm of voluntary corporate responsibility for the one of pure accountability. In this context, several solutions are debated by scholars: from a binding treaty, or a series of narrower treaties focused on specific areas, to a Model Law which could be used by states to enact laws imposing obligations on businesses within their jurisdictions, or even adding human rights in the international investment agreements and making use of the international arbitration as an enforcement mechanism.
K10|The human rights and the terrorism|Regarding Human rights has been emphasized by governments through universal declaration human rights and its violations faced the global reaction in any case. From this perspective; the necessity of observing human rights against terrorism has been emphasized by many resolutions of the General Assembly, the Security Council and many regional resolutions. But, today especially after the September 11 events and America unilateral attacks by resorting to human rights and of course by considering the lack of international agreement on the norms, strategies and principles of human rights, the campaign against terrorism has started on the basis of its obligations, regardless to existing norms. So it would be said that today; the war against terrorism more than any other terrorist attacks threatens the security and human rights. However, human rights framework has never prevented effective and legitimate actions to the terrorist attacks. In other words; in the human right framework, there is no conflict with the campaign against terrorism, it emphasizes on identifying and fighting and even it guarantees the effectiveness of such a fight. As a result, Human rights violations at the expense of security, certainly associated with the destruction of both.
K10|Considerations regarding the creative intention in unilateral legal acts by deciding the separation of intention and consent|In legal systems, the intention of people in certainty of legal performance plays the main role and the contracts & transaction attributes to persons' intention as the general & public principle. The people by their intention establish obligation & undertakings for themselves and others in the frame of contracts & unilateral obligations, in the realm of law to obtain the commitment force for his/her intention that causes establishing the commitments and the responsibilities of the peoples. The volition is consisted of intention & consent elements for establishing the commitment, in other words each of these elements, intention and consent are efficient in the situation of legal act through canceling or lack of legal act influence. The quality of this effecting and performance g uaranty of the lack of each main conditions in certainty of the volition in the field of contracts have been considered and the rule in the field of contracts has been clarified in civil code but in unilateral obligations, in respect of unilateral obligations, there are some ambiguities in the role and clarifying basic conditions which these ambiguities are the results of leaving unsaid the many regulations about unilateral obligations in civil code by the jurisprudents and the legislators. In this article creative intention in unilateral obligations to be surveyed and it would be a step for clarifying the opposed and agreed views.
K10|The relationship dynamics between legal positivism and the divisions of law, analyzed from a systemic perspective|This article is studying the dynamics of the relationship between legal positivism and the two divisions of law, respectively private law and public law. Legal positivism, envisions concepts of human intervention in the creation and application of the law, and so it finds application in both public law and private law. However, in private law, there are several principles which can be deduced from the doctrine of natural law, such as substitution, reversibility and others. To the contrary, in public law, legal positivism is all present, manifesting itself in all its branches. It is not, however, an exclusive presence, because there is a balance between natural law and legal positivism in each of the divisions of law. The two orientations of law, namely natural law and legal positivism coexist in each of the divisions and branches of the law, but with a different structure, dynamic or static, depending on specific branches of law. This paper presents in an analytical manner, the static and dynamic manifestations of legal positivism within the framework of the two divisions of law, namely private law and public law.

I find that only property crime increases in the communities hosting matches but not violent offences. There is a negative away game attendance effect on crime which is due to voluntary incapacitation of potential offenders attending a match. Police displacement during home games increases property crime by 7 percentage points for every extra 10000 supporters in areas that are left underprotected."
K10|Do Constitutions Matter? The Effects of Constitutional Environmental Rights Provisions on Environmental Outcomes|We use a novel data set within an instrumental variables framework to test whether the presence and legal strength of constitutional environmental rights are related to environmental outcomes. The outcome variables include Yale’s Environmental Performance Index and some of its components. The analysis accounts for the possibility that a country which takes steps to protect the environment might also be more likely to constitutionalize environmental rights. Controls include: (1) gross domestic product per capita (2) whether the country is a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights; (3) rule of law; (4) population density; and (5) exogenous geographic effects. The inclusion of income means that our study is directly related to the Environmental Kuznets Curve literature. We find that constitutions do indeed matter for positive environmental outcomes, which suggests that we should not only pay attention to the incentives confronting polluters and resource users, but also to the incentives and constraints confronting those policymakers who initiate, monitor, and enforce environmental policies.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
K10|Appeal In The Interests Of The Law Within Current Regulations|The paper approaches theoretical issues of appeal in the interests of the law, emphasizing the role of such legal institution which aims at ensuring the uniform interpretation and application of the law across the country. The constitutional attribute of ensuring the uniform interpretation and application of laws by all courts rests with the High Court of Cassation and Justice which should only refer to the interpretation of the law.
K10|The Determinants of Dividend Payment: the Effect of the Legal and Contractual Obligatory Minimum in Brazilian Companies|This study seeks to identify the effects of the mandatory dividend in determinants of companies listed on the BM&FBovespa to pay dividends, demonstrating that the methodology proposed is a step forward in the pursuit of these determinants, mirroring the reality of actual willingness to pay. To accomplish this was used a tobit model with instrumental variables, separating the sample into three groups: the Complete Sample, ABOVE group and MINIMUM group. In total, were analyzed 1531 dividend distributions from 2007 to 2013. It was found that there is strong empirical evidence that companies paying dividends above the mandatory feature different determinants of those who only pay this. Thus, the existence of companies in the sample who pay only the mandatory dividend influence on the regression coefficients, resulting in significant biases for dividend determinants in Brazil. Because companies that pay above mandatory are the real makers of the decision to pay dividends, as companies only pay the mandatory simply comply with the legislation.
K10|Digital Tools and the Derailment of Iceland's New Constitution|This paper maps the use of digital tools in the Icelandic constitutional revision process of 2011 and discusses its aftermath in subsequent years. Although causal links between the digital elements of the process and the content and fate of the constitutional bill are impossible to establish, an analysis of the Icelandic constitution-writing efforts as ‘digital democracy’ reveals some important lessons. High-quality input into constitution-making processes through digital participation is possible, but the very threat of this to vested institutional interests also makes consensus on and enforcement of the ‘rules of the game’ of paramount importance.
K10|Chain of Legitimacy: Constitution Making in Iceland|To understand Iceland’s political situation, it is necessary to consider the historical background to the post-crash constitutional revision process launched in 2009. Also, the paper offers a brief account of some aspects of the constitution-making process during 2010-2013, including the work of the Constituent Assembly. Further, the paper describes Parliament’s ongoing attempt to undermine the substance of the constitutional bill accepted by two thirds of the voters in the 2012 referendum. A national parliament cannot, without undermining its own legitimacy, allow the results of a constitutional referendum to be changed after the fact, let alone ignored, even if the referendum was advisory.
K10|Paying by the Hour: The Least Appealing Option for Clients of Lawyers|In this study, we analyze a client’s choice of contract in auctions where Dutch law firms compete for cases. The distinguishing feature is that lawyers may submit bids with any fee arrangement they wish. We find robust evidence that bids offering hourly rates are less attractive to clients. Our findings tentatively contradict lawyers’ often-made argument that hourly rates are in a client’s best interest.
K10|Clients Prefer Flat Fee Contracts: Ten Questions to Jo Seldeslachts|No abstract is available for this item.
K10|Mandanten von Anwälten wollen kein Stundenhonorar|We analyse a client’s choice of contract in auctions where Dutch law firms compete for cases. In these auctions lawyers may submit bids with any fee arrangement they prefer. We find robust evidence that hourly rate bids are a client’s least-preferred choice. Our findings tentatively contradict lawyers’ often made argument that hourly rates are in a client’s best interest. Wir analysieren die Vertragswahl von Mandanten bei Auktionen, in denen niederländische Anwaltskanzleien um Fälle konkurrieren. Dabei können Anwälte Angebote mit der von ihnen bevorzugten Honorarregelung einreichen. Die Untersuchung bietet eindeutige Belege dafür, dass Angebote mit Stundenhonorar jene sind, die von den Mandanten am seltensten ausgewählt werden. Unsere Ergebnisse widersprechen dem von Anwälten oft vorgebrachten Argument, dass Stundenhonorare einen Vorteil für den Mandanten darstellen.
K10|Magna Carta, the rule of law, and the limits on government|This paper surveys the legal tradition that links Magna Carta with the modern concepts of the rule of law and the limits on government. It documents that the original understanding of the rule of law included substantive commitments to individual freedom and limited government. Then, it attempts to explain how and why such commitments were lost to a formalist interpretation of the rule of law from 1848 to 1939. The paper concludes by arguing that a revival of the substantive commitments of the rule of law is central to reshaping modern states.
K10|Explaining constitutional change: The case of judicial independence|This paper studies the factors driving changes in constitutionally entrenched judicial independence (JI). Our indicator of constitutionally safeguarded JI is derived by applying a factor analysis utilizing 29 variables. Variations in JI are identified based on changes in the constitutions of as many as 100 countries that occurred between 1950 and 2005. Two theoretical perspectives are developed—the democratic competition view and the commitment view—and various hypotheses are suggested for explaining changes in JI. We find strong evidence that changes in political participation and competition as well as the characteristics of individual leaders—such as how they acquired or lost power—play an important role in explaining changes in constitutionally safeguarded JI. However, we find no clear-cut evidence supporting one theoretical perspective over the other.
K10|Political self-serving bias and redistribution|We explore the impact of the self-serving bias on the supply and demand for redistribution. We present results from an experiment in which participants decide on redistribution after performing a real effort task. Dependent on individual performance, participants are divided into two groups, successful and unsuccessful. Participants' success is exogenously determined, because they are randomly assigned to either a hard or easy task. However, because participants are not told which task they were assigned to, there is ambiguity as to whether success or failure should be attributed to internal or external factors. Participants take two redistribution decisions. First, they choose a supply of redistribution in a situation where no personal interests are at stake. Second, they choose a redistributive system behind a veil of ignorance. Our results confirm and expand previous findings on the self-serving bias: successful participants are more likely to attribute their success to their effort rather than luck, and they opt for less redistribution. Unsuccessful participants tend to attribute their failure to external factors and opt for more redistribution. We demonstrate that the self-serving bias contributes to a polarization of the views on redistribution.
K10|Synthesis of fatty acid methyl esters via the transesterification of waste cooking oil by methanol with a barium-modified montmorillonite K10 catalyst|The transesterification of waste cooking oil (WCO) with methanol to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) in the presence of barium-modified montmorillonite K10 (BMK10) catalyst was investigated in a batch reactor. The influence of the reaction parameters on the yield of FAME was investigated. The highest value of 83.38% was obtained with 3.5 wt% catalyst loading at 150 °C with a methanol: oil molar ratio of 12:1 during a reaction time of 5 h. BMK10 is a promising low-cost catalyst for the transesterification of WCO to produce FAME.
K10|Does the placement of the accused at court undermine the right to a fair trial?|The UK Government has recently launched an ambitious reform of the court estate across England and Wales, including the closure of 86 courts and signi cant investment in new technologies. The time is right to rethink how courts of the future should look, with an emphasis on exibility of space and the use of technology. A longstanding architectural feature of criminal courts is the dock, where the accused is held during a trial. In recent years, this has evolved to include a fully-glassed in box, or in some countries, metal cages. The continued use of docks may undermine the rights of the accused, including the right to participate in one’s trial, the right to be presumed innocent, and the right to be treated in a digni ed manner. I present the results of an experiment testing whether the placement of the accused in a dock can impact on mock-jurors assessment of guilt. Jurors were more likely to return a guilty verdict when the accused was in a dock, compared to sitting at the bar table with counsel, independent of the evidence against him. If the government is serious about creating fairer and more effective courts of the future, then they need discontinue the use of docks in criminal trials.
K10|The economic consequences of crime in Italy|Purpose - – The purpose of this paper is to employ provincial data to study the relationship between several crime typologies, namely murder, robbery, extortion and fraud and economic output in Italy. Design/methodology/approach - – The authors propose a spatial econometric approach where the spatial proximity is defined by a measure of physical distance between locations, in order to take into account possible spill-over effects. Findings - – The results of the spatial estimation suggest that criminal activities, namely murder and robbery, exhibit a negative impact on Italian gross domestic product while fraud and total crime do not affect economic output and that there are beneficial spill-overs from neighbouring provinces. Originality/value - – The study empirically shows that only violent crimes have a crowding-out effect on economic output.
K10|Hypotheses for a constitutional right to food|Food is a matter for the right to play in its complexity and multidimensionality. The legal significance, so far, mainly concerned the supply as subject of production and consumption. The right to food is, in fact, synonymous of Agricultural policy and of the agro-food economy regulation. The right to food law is a branch (autonomous) of agricultural law and, therefore, predominantly part of the private or commercial law. The right to food, in the last twenty years, developed along larger trajectories of those traditionally related to production inputs and consumption. The relationship between environmental protection, human rights and food security of health protection becomes relevant, as well as it begins the discusses about the nature of the right to food. Feeding questions, particularly the problem of world hunger are currently an inescapable political issue: it concerns not only the economic factors of production and consumption, but it relates to the fundamentals of individual life and socio-political, that challenge the relationship between generations and the principle of accountability at all levels of the forms of political organization.
K10|Constitutional Issues of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM)|European history has always been characterized by a strong link between banks and States and, more generally, between banks and politics. National banking systems, therefore, have always been one of the forms of expression of sovereignty. This setting is seriously called into question by the Banking Union project, which has been recently implemented in Europe. Given the importance of the issue, this should be studied not only from the perspective of economics and regulatory studies, but also from the perspective of constitutional law. The paper, after a reconstruction of the historical and economic conditions that have led to design a project of Banking Union, analyzes several constitutional issues. In particular, te paper focuses on the friction points between the European Banking Union and the democratic principle, the rule of law and the justiciability principle.
K10|The Effect of Intellectual Property Rights on Domestic Innovation in the Pharmaceutical Sector|There is little empirical evidence concerning the effect of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protecting pharmaceutical products and processes on pharmaceutical domestic innovation. Indeed, existing literature does not provide a punctual estimate of this effect for developing countries. This paper fills this gap, by exploiting a self-constructed dataset which provides, for a 22-year period, information concerning IPR reforms involving pharmaceuticals for 74 developed and developing countries. The identification strategy exploits the different timing across these countries of two sets of IPR reforms. Domestic innovation is measured as citation-weighted domestic patent applications filed at the European Patent Office (EPO): the highly skewed distribution of the dependent variable, and the high number of zero observations, are taken into account using count data models. In particular, a Zero Inflated Negative Binomial model is adopted, to overcome previous literature assumption that all innovations are patented in the main markets of reference, and to take into consideration the choice not to patent at the EPO. Results show that innovation is sensitive to IPR protection, but not to its degree. Moreover, the effect is not long lasting. My study also finds that developing countries profit significantly less than developed ones from the protection, benefiting from an effect that is roughly half of that for developed countries. Consequent policy implications are examined, and include the conclusions that a “one size fits all” approach can be inappropriate, and that gradual reforms should be preferred to rare reforms that greatly alter the level of IPR protection.
K10|Sovereign Default in the US|In the absence of a judicial mechanism to reduce the debt burden of a sovereign member of our Union, the resolution process can be quick but perhaps too indifferent to the health, safety, and welfare of the affected residents. In this paper, I use evidence from the Arkansas state archives to provide a description of the events surrounding the default of the state in 1933. I examine the evolution of the negotiations, the outcomes, and the role of fiscal policy.

K10|Proposal of benchmarking concerning cooperation networks between justice organisations| Benchmarking is the process of investigation of the most effective solutions that produce superior performance in organisations. This concept could be successfully implemented in organisation of justice, however, in this case the main goal of benchmarking must be different. Courts do not compete with each other so they do not have to reach the competitive advantage. The main objective of benchmarking in this situation will be identification and then implementation of the best practices in justice system for improving its general organisational efficiency and cooperation network. The measure of organizational efficiency of the judiciary is to meet needs and requirements of internal and external stakeholders. Efficient organization of justice rationally employs its material goods and skilfully acquires material and human resources. It also ensures smooth interaction of all departments of the organization. The aim of the chapter is to present the benchmarking concept and possibilities of its implementation of cooperation networks between justice organisations.
K10|Court Excellence Model as a tool of improving the organizational efficiency of courts| The measure of organizational efficiency of the judiciary is to meet needs and requirements of internal and external stakeholders.

The aim of the paper is to present the benchmarking concept and possibilities of its implementation using EFQM Business Excellence Model for improving the organizational efficiency of courts.
K10|The Legal Conceptions of Hans Kelsen and Eugen Ehrlich: Weighing Human Rights and Sovereignty|This paper considers the relevance of the legal conceptions put forward by Eugen Ehrlich and Hans Kelsen to the contemporary debate on human rights and their limits. It is asserted that the conceptions of Ehrlich and Kelsen adopt a multifaceted approach to the law and, at the same time, a philosophical perspective that secures human autonomy and freedom from “great narratives” and governmental intervention. This perspective opens up a variety of opportunities for better understanding the balance between individual and collective interests, and between the significance of rights and sovereignty. Both conceptions are still relevant to debates in the fields of international and constitutional law, and to legal philosophies about the limits of human rights and the epistemic conditions for identifying these rights, and how these rights can the same time lay claim to a universal character while remaining culturally embedded. The principle of relativity that underpins the Pure Theory of Law of Kelsen and the legal sociology of Ehrlich are of particular importance for discussing the “relative universality” of human rights
K10|Towards a Tribunal Services Agency|The performance of Indian tribunals has been unsatisfactory. Yet, policy-makers continue to rely heavily on tribunals to achieve their end objective. One example of this are the tribunals which will adjudicate in the proposed Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2015. This is premised on the assumption that the tribunals will be able to dispose of cases within hard deadlines. A natural key question that arises is how Indian tribunals can perform better in this matter when they cannot in others? This paper proposes that administrative functions of tribunals should be hived off into a separate agency - Tribunal Services Agency - which will help improve the performance of the administrative functions of tribunals and, in turn, improve their judicial functioning in general.
K10|Behavior Under Vague Standards: Evidence from the Laboratory|Doctrinal lawyers strive to reduce legal uncertainty based on the premise that difficult to predict legal consequences discourage socially desirable activities. Contributions from the economic theory of law suggest that increasing legal uncertainty can be socially beneficial. We test in an innovative laboratory experiment whether increasing the variability of an exogenous choice threshold (legal standard) increases or reduces socially desirable behavior. The results indicate a U-shaped relationship between increases in variability and activity choices: increases in variability first induce lower than optimal choices under an efficient standard (overcompliance), but eventually lead to greater than optimal choices under an efficient standard (undercompliance). We also find that overcompliance arises only under low degrees of standard variability. Moreover, increasing variability gradually crowds-out compliant choices. Finally, in the experiment minimal variability of the legal standard induces erratic individual behavior beyond socially satisfactory levels such that the standard loses its coordination function.
K10|State provision of constitutional goods|This paper investigates the impact of constitutional rights on the level of public expenditure in a large sample of countries. To do so, we construct a panel of 73 countries from 1960 to 2011. We first investigate factors that drive constitutional changes regarding constitutional rights. To address potential endogeneity concerns in the choice of constitutional rules, we rely on an instrumental variable within estimation (country and time fixed effects) to estimate the impact of constitutional rights on government size. We find that larger governments tend to inscribe fewer rights in their constitutions, but we do not detect any impact of constitutional rights on the government size.

K10|De jure determinants of new firm formation: how the pillars of constitutions influence entrepreneurship|Abstract This paper provides empirical evidence supporting the view that constitutions are the primary and fundamental institutional determinant of entrepreneurship. It shows that some of the provisions contained in national constitutions are positively and significantly associated with a standard measure of entrepreneurial dynamics, namely the rate of new business density. Using for 115 countries a novel dataset containing the characteristics of the constitutions enacted in the world, applying an IV-GMM treatment to deal with the endogeneity of constitutional rules, and controlling for de facto variables, the paper finds that provisions about the right to conduct/establish a business, the right to strike, consumer protection, anti-corruption, and compulsory education promote higher rates of new firm formation. Contrasting results are instead obtained for provisions concerning protection of intellectual property rights.

Ez a rend nem tervezhető meg, és jelenlegi tudásunk alapján nem is érthető meg konzisztens, összefüggő rendszerként. A magyar gazdaság fejlődési célját ezért nem lehet nemzetgazdasági szintű rendszerként vagy modellként megfogalmazni. A tényleges feladat az intézményi rend középszintű elemeinek fokozatos, kísérletező változtatása, figyelembe véve a már létező intézményi környezet történetileg adott, helyhez és időhöz kötött sajátosságait.

K10|Russian reforms in the context of cognitive history theory|Within the conceptual framework of cognitive theory the author presents a concept of social transformations based on information exchange — the target-oriented construction of the social reality in past and present. The paper focuses on cognitive logic of reforms, reconstructing the frames of general information, elaboration of dominant reform projects, the process of priorities selection, the modes of cognitive domination maintenance used by reform elites. On this ground the Russian reforms style is analyzed as the stable and self-reproductive cognitive stereotypes, the system of formal and informal institutional regulations, their transformation in the process of reforms, implementation of varied strategies and technologies of information control as precondition of the reforms’ success. The accumulation of historical experience provides the possibility to rethink the strategy of Russian reforms at the current stage.
K10|Legislative strategy for setting up an independent debt management agency|The Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA) is a body that issues public debt with the objective of keeping long term costs of government borrowing low. In India, the existing legal framework obliges the government to give the task of managing its debt to the RBI. Pursuant to its role as debt manager, RBI set up market infrastructure such as an exchange and a depository. Carve-outs were made in the regulation of securities, to allow the RBI to regulate the bond market. Over the last 20 years, the proposal to establish an independent PDMA has been repeatedly put forward. In this paper, we work out the legal strategy to set up a PDMA. We show the transition path for the roll out and for the movement of the functions, accounts, records and systems to the new agency in a phased manner.
K10|General Considerations Concerning the Principle of Territoriality of the Romanian Criminal Law|The expression used by the legislator in article 8 paragraph 1 of the Romanian Penal Code shows that the Romanian criminal law enforcement is exclusive and unconditional, so regardless of the category of acts which are committed on the Romanian territory, the criminal jurisdiction will be always exercised by the Romanian State through its competent bodies. From this point of view it appears that the Romanian legislator remained constant regarding the territoriality of Romanian criminal law. In the current regulation of art. 8, paragraph 3 of the Penal Code, the offense committed in Romania, is any offense committed on the territory defined in art. 8 paragraph 2 of the Penal code or a ship under the Romanian flag or an aircraft registered in Romania.
K10|General Aspects Regarding the Crime of Human Trafficking|Wishing to emphasise the importance of the fundamental social values defended by the criminalization of the human trafficking crime, the Romanian legislator, with the change of the penal code, by the entering into force on February 1, 2014 the new code, incriminated human trafficking in the article 210 of this complex criminal law. Thus, according to article 210 of the Penal Code, the crime of human trafficking involves „recruiting, transportation, sheltering or receiving of a person with the purpose of exploiting.For the offense of human trafficking there may exist preparatory acts, but the law does not incriminate these acts as crimes and does not punish them. The attempt is punished according to article 217 of the Penal Code, stating that the attempt to the offenses stipulated at articles 209- 211 and article 213 paragraph 2 of the Penal Code shall be punished.
K10|The Role Of The Cooperation And Verification Mechanism In Consolidating The European Values In The Romanian Territorial Collectivities|Understood as forms of democratic organization of the State in social, cultural, administrative and financial fields, the administrative decentralization and local autonomy should promote and articulate the relationship between state, society and economy. In this space of networking and concerted action among different stakeholders, citizen engagement, transparency, subsidiarity and other European values must converge. In light of these structural changes produced in the state that must meet new social demands, territorial collectivities face a series of new skills, roles and responsibilities. The aim of this article is to analyze the role of the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM) and the European values promoted by the state and reflected at the local public administration level. Some of these values could be identified as the following in the Romanian territorial collectivities: legality of administration, the principle of reliability, the guarantee of fundamental rights and freedoms and equality before the Law. The CVM is a tool to maintain the reform momentum in Romania and Bulgaria and prevent reversal of the rule of law reforms enacted during the EU accession negotiations. Every six months, the Council issues a CVM report for Bulgaria and Romania, evaluating progress on the established benchmarks and flagging the most pressing issues that should be addressed before the next report.
K10|Le Legislatif Et L’Intervention Legislative|The paper aims to give a comprehensive analysis of the Romanian legislative and its nomothetic action. Considerable attention has been paid to the development of a society, which, according to the author’s opinion, is not possible without the more or less extensive and more or less conscious participation of the people in its leadership. On the other hand, the realities of contemporary society require the existence of a representative assembly. The Romanian Constitution defines the Parliament as the supreme representative body of the Romanian people and the sole legislative authority. However, the latter quality has been questioned by scholarship, due to constitutional provisions conferring the right of legislative initiative to other legal entities as well. Moreover, the author turned his attention to some existent limitations in the exercise of the legislative prerogatives by the Parliament.
K10|Provisions Of The Romanian Constitution That Cannot Be Object To Revision Of The Fundamental Law|The fundamental law represents, in an organization based on democracy and respect for principles, a normative act enjoying a higher degree of stability under a temporal aspect. A constitution produces legal effects and remains in force for a period of many years, and the revisions made through specific procedures are also rarely registered. The Romanian supreme law as well, although adopted a quarter of a century ago, has been subject only just one time to the revision procedure. However, through its initial provisions, the Constitution of Romania cannot be subject to legislative revisions if these aim any of the regulations that cannot be subject to revision. Consequently, four of the characteristics of the Romanian state, added certain other fundamental values: republican form of government, independence of justice, integrity of the territory, official Romanian language and political pluralism, as well as some conditionings connected with the contexts, according to which any alterations of the fundamental law concerning individual freedoms cannot be operated, all these cannot form the object of a constitutional law, altering or revising the present fundamental law.
K10|The Virtues of Hesitation: Optimal Timing in a Non-stationary World|In many economic, political, and social situations, circumstances change at random points in time, reacting is costly, and reactions appropriate to present circumstances may become inappropriate upon future changes, requiring further costly reaction. Waiting is informative if arrival of the next change has non-constant hazard rate. We identify two classes of situations: in the first, delayed reaction is optimal only when the hazard rate of further changes is decreasing; in the second, it is optimal only when the hazard rate of further changes is increasing. These results in semi-Markovian decision theory provide motivations for building delay into decision systems. (JEL C61, D72, D82, D83, K10, M11)
K10|Causes, Factors And Ways Of Combat Tax Evasion|Tax evasion is a complex phenomenon faced by all member economies, regardless of geographic position. Committing this crime and related crimes they attract undesirable economic consequences. The temptation circumvention of the law is becoming bigger for taxpayers whose taxes are imposed increasingly higher. Fiscal bodies faced a growing phenomenon as a snowball.
K10|Financially-Constrained Lawyers|Financial constraints reduce the lawyers’ ability to file lawsuits and bring cases to trial. As a result, access to justice for true victims, bargaining impasse, and care taking incentives for potential injurers might be affected. We present the first cradle-to-grave model of legal disputes involving financially-constrained lawyers, third-party lawyer lending, and asymmetric information. In equilibrium, access to justice is denied to some true victims and bargaining impasse occurs. We demonstrate that policies that relax lawyers’ financial constraints might be welfare reducing if the positive impact on access to justice is weak and the potential injurers are overdeterred.
K10|Incentive contracts for teams: Experimental evidence|This paper reports the results of an experiment on incentive contracts for teams. The agents, whose efforts are complementary, are rewarded according to a sharing rule chosen by the principal. Depending on the sharing rule, the agents confront endogenous prisoner's dilemma or stag-hunt environments. Our main findings are as follows. First, we demonstrate that ongoing interaction among team members positively affects the principal's payoff. Greater team cooperation is successfully induced with less generous sharing rules in infinitely repeated environments. Second, we provide evidence of the positive effects of communication on team cooperation in the absence of ongoing team interaction. Fostering communication among team members does not significantly affect the principal's payoff, suggesting that agents’ communication is an imperfect substitute for ongoing team interaction. Third, we show that offering low sharing rules can backfire. The agents are willing to engage in costly punishment (shirking) as retaliation for low offers from the principal. Our findings suggest that offering low sharing rules is perceived by the agents as unkind behavior and hence, triggers negative reciprocity.
K10|The jurisprudence. Formal law source|The importance of jurisprudential unification lies in the fact that the jurisprudential discrepancies existing in fields of general interest for society produce a state of uncertainty, which diminishes the public’s trust in the judicial system. In general, in the Romanian law system, jurisprudence (the juridical praxis), although it has been approached regarding the sources of law by Romanian scholars, they reached a common conclusion, in the sense that it is not a formal source of law. As far as we are concerned, as we will show in the subsequent developments, we do not share the diffidence manifested by the authors, generally, with regard to seeing jurisprudence as not a source of law, with the nuances and parantheses required. The modern trend was one of closeness and interconditioning between the two great law systems (the great Romano-Germanic system and the great common-law system), this is way we have to leave behind the prejudices and to see the fact that, in the Romanian judicial reality as well, jurisprudence has gained an increasingly significant role. In the next years, we believe that jurisprudence, by shaping general law principles, will be recognized as a main source of law.
K10|The role of law as an instrument of communication within legal positivism|This article tackles some aspects concerning the role of law as an instrument of communication from the perspective of legal positivism. The paper presents considerations regarding law communication in relation to legal positivism and scientific positivism. At the same time, the article examines the correlations between the legal communication models and the various inclinations developed under legal positivism. Both within legal positivism and the scientific positivism, the role of law as a communication tool is essential. The concept of legal communication should be considered as the idea of understanding the legal norm by the recipients of law, namely by persons and also acceptance of these rules in order to respect them. Also, clarity and transparency in law communication are very important elements that contribute to the way in which legal standards are received. The analysis of legal communication from the perspective of legal positivism presents a special scientific interest, given the very essence of positivism, namely that the laws are commands of the human being. Thus, it is important to analyze communication patterns that can be applied in the positivist orientation to consistently appreciate the ways in which legal communication can be improved.
K10|South Africa’s transformative Constitution: from civil and political rights doctrines to socio-economic rights promises|This article discusses the post 1994 rights-based approach to transformation. Civil and political rights and socio-economic rights are conceived as central tenets to South Africa’s transformative Constitution, 1996. The Constitution was fundamentally tasked with transforming society to bring about substantive social and legal justice, peace, political stability and reconciliation among South Africans. This culminated in a new legal culture, elevating hopes that socio-economic problems largely inherited from the past would be altered. Thus, this article examines the extent to which norms and the law in the Constitution normalizes people’s socio-economic conditions. It utilizes notable entrenchment and eventual justiciability of socio-economic rights as noticeable attempt to proffer a panacea to prevailing socio-economic instabilities. It has been observed that first and second generation rights are interrelated and mutually supportive towards the course of transformation. However, it is asserted that the commended normative framework is struggling to ward off the country’s social and economic problems owing to persistent poverty problem. Thus, real transformation will remain an elusive dream if poverty is not eliminated.
K10|The evolution of the right of association from constitutional standpoint in Romania|Starting from the principle that the history, on the whole, it is an analysis of the past in order to understand the present and to guide future behaviour, we intend to demonstrate that the historic landmarks on the evolution of constitutional regulations concerning rights and fundamental freedoms and the right of association are particularly important for consistency of the contemporary debates on issues of constitutional reform. In this context, we have been concerned about presenting an analysis from historical perspective on the evolution of the regulations, taking into account the main moments in the evolution of Romanian constitutionalism. This analysis is the result of a research method based on the historical and documentary analysis, where we have taken into consideration on one hand the evolutionary analysis of the issue from its earliest manifestation forms on the Romanian territory until present day, and, on the other hand, the analysis, through checking and comparing identified data and the documents that were issued during the reference periods linked to it. Also, analysing bibliographic sources has provided a fundamental ideological support for our scientific approach.
K10|The State and the separation of powers|The State is a complex concept that can be addressed from a legal, political, social and economic perspective. The paper explores the meanings of the concept of State, State elements and stresses that the State power is one and indivisible and it is exercised through three functions and not to separate powers, namely the legislative function, executive function and the judicial function. The State institutions through which the three functions are controlled each other and collaborate to achieve the needs of society, which is likely to prevent abuses against citizens.
K10|The Political Liability Of A Republic’S President|The objective of this study is to make a comparative analysis of the political liability of the head of state in parliamentary republics and in semi presidential republics. The paper introduces the concepts of “non-responsibility” and “inviolability” of the President, concepts concerning the notion of liability. The approach is based on the comment on the constitutional provisions which regard the political liability of the President and on observing how to apply in practice these provisions. As a result of using comparative method, the implications of this study refer to a better knowledge of the regulation of the political liability in certain states which allow an efficient reception and enforcement of the constitutional provisions on the matter.
K10|Penalty Structures And Deterrence In A Two-Stage Model: Experimental Evidence|Increasing penalty structures for repeat offenses are ubiquitous in penal codes, despite little empirical or theoretical support. Multi-period models of criminal enforcement based on the standard economic approach of Becker (1968) generally find that the optimal penalty structure is either flat or declining. We experimentally test a two-stage theoretical model that predicts decreasing penalty structures will yield greater deterrence than increasing penalty structures. We find that decreasing fine structures are more effective at reducing risky behavior. Additionally, our econometric analyses reveal a number of behavioral findings. Subjects are deterred by past convictions, even though the probability of detection is independent across decisions. Further, subjects appear to take the two-stage nature of the decision making task into account, suggesting that subjects consider both current and future penalties. Even controlling for the fine a subject faces for any given decision, being in a decreasing fine structure has a significant effect on deterrence.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
K10|What Clients want: Choices between Lawyers' Offerings|We analyze a client's choice of contract in auctions where Dutch law firms compete for routine cases. The distinguishing feature here is that lawyers may submit bids with any fee arrangement they prefer: an hourly rate, a fixed fee or a mixed fee, which is a time-capped fixed fee plus an hourly rate for any additional hours should the case take longer than expected. Furthermore, this format of selling legal services is unusual in that it both forces lawyers to compete directly against each other and allows clients to easily compare these different offers. We empirically estimate a choice model for clients and find robust evidence that hourly rate bids are a client's least-preferred choice. Our findings tentatively contradict lawyers' often made argument that hourly rates are in a client's best interest.
K10|Economie constitutionnelle en Afrique: analyse empirique du changement de l’article sur la limitation de mandat des présidents|This paper analyzes the constitutional change in Africa by focusing on the current phenomenon of the change in the presidential term limits. The analysis covers the period 1990 - 2010 for a set of 32 countries. Two cases are analyzed: the attempt to change and success. The results obtained with the logit models show that individual factors related to the personality of the President, the quality of the political system, socio-cultural and economics factors are the main factors explaining the will of amending Article and success. The article also shows that in some parts of Africa, the legal origin is an obstacle to constitutional change. Finally, when the opposition is not polarized, it is an obstacle to change, while it serves the interests of the dominant political group wishing to change when it is weak and highly fragmented.
K10|Communicating judicial retirement|Justices can strategically shape perceptions of their likely retirements, and so influence the President and Senate in choosing an ideologically compatible replacement. Relatively new justices can vote insincerely to affect how their ideologies are perceived, but their strategies are shaped by older justices’ expected retirement probabilities. We show that “strong messages” of retirement are likely when new justices vote insincerely and the new and retiring justices’ ideologies are aligned. “Weak messages” are more likely when new justices vote sincerely or, if they do vote insincerely, the old and new justices’ ideologies are unaligned.
K10|Personal bankruptcy law, debt portfolios, and entrepreneurship|Bankruptcy provides entrepreneurs with insurance against the financial consequences of failure at the cost of worsened credit conditions. Using a quantitative general equilibrium model of entrepreneurship, we show that the presence of secured credit in addition to unsecured credit substantially alters this trade-off. If secured credit is not available the optimal bankruptcy law is harsh since the negative effect dominates. If secured credit is available the optimal law is lenient since entrepreneurs rationed out of the unsecured credit market can still obtain secured credit, lowering the costs of worse credit conditions. We find significant welfare gains from reforming the law.
K10|Economic Values In The Constitutional Preambles|The economic values and categories within the constitutional preamble appear in this work as a subject of the special interest. In the contrast to the primary center of gravity of classical legal thought when it researches the constitutional preamble, the pendulum will be slightly shifted towards questionable of position and the way in which constitutional preambles regulate issues of economic values and categories. We do not regard this question less significant compared to the usual literary manners of preamble study. It is our understanding of the importance of constitutional attitudes towards to the vital issues of the state and security that started us to begin exploring of this problem, in the context of an established thematic framework of this paper. There is no doubt that legislators in the preambles treat various issues in different ways, depending on the gravity of priority. Rarely, we could find constitutions without preambles, constitutions with technical preambles and with preambles, almost entirely, faced toward the past. However, for this paper is interesting preambles which texts could be characterized as a futuristic projection and perspective, because, among them we want to find the essence of the legislators’ attitudes to economic issues.
K10|La declinazione della qualità del lavoro nell’ordinamento giuslavoristico italiano|La riflessione sul tema della qualità del lavoro nell’ordinamento giuslavoristico parte dalla ricostruzione del nesso lavoro-dignità sancito nella Costituzione italiana, oggi penalizzato dalle logiche di mercato, ma ancora di assoluto valore per realizzare efficaci pol itiche di crescita economica. L’A. dimostra come la qualità del lavoro, oltre a rappresentare un valore in sé, incida positivamente sulla produttività delle imprese, attraverso la valorizzazione della professionalità e della formazione dei lavoratori, un investimento che mal si concilia con l’eccessiva flessibilità del lavoro. In questa direzione, di assoluto rilievo è il ruolo del sindacato, chiamato a perseguire la valorizzazione del lavoro, rinnovando i contenuti della politica contrattuale. Il tutto nella piena convinzione che uno sviluppo che punti sulla qualità del lavoro, anche come fattore di produttività, non possa prescindere da tutto ciò che attiene ai diritti, per non far prevalere una visione mercantile delle relazioni produttive e di lavoro e disconoscere i valori costituzionali.
K10|Section 6-7. Military Economy and Military Reform in Russia|The accession of the Republic of Crimea to the Russian Federation in March 2014 was not favored by the global community and resulted in Western economic sanctions against Russia, getting even tougher throughout the entire year. The sanctions were focused chiefly on Russia’s defense sector, having a strong adverse impact on the fulfillment of the state armaments program and the military-industrial complex (MIC) development program planned by the Russian leadership. The key tit-for-tat measures included the development of import substitution plans in the military-industrial complex and the placement of the Military Industrial Commission under the supervision of President Vladimir Putin in September. The international sanctions in 2014 had no effect whatsoever on the performance of the plans of professionalization and combat training of Russia’s Armed Forces.
K10|Section 6. Institutional Changes|The main developments over the past year in the sphere under consideration were the launch of the second three-year privatization program for the years 2014–2016; the approval of the new government program Federal Property Management until 2018; the transfer, by a court ruling, of JSC Bashneft back to Russian Federation ownership; the continuation of the active process of creation of integrated structures in the defense industry and related sectors; absence of any significant deals completed on the corporate control market with the participation of state companies; and the expansion, at the level of approved model documents, of the set of available instruments to be applied in the management of entities belonging to the public sector of the national economy.

K10|Political Bias in Court? Lay Judges and Asylum Appeals|Several countries practice a system where laymen, who lack legal education, participate in the judicial decision making. Yet, little is known about their potential influence on the court rulings. In Sweden lay judges (namndeman) are affiliated with the political parties and appointed in proportion to political party representation in the last local elections. This paper investigates the influence of their partisan belonging when ruling in asylum appeals in the Migration Courts, where laymen are effectively randomly assigned to cases. The results show that the approval rate is affected by the policy position of the laymen's political parties. In particular, asylum appeals are more likely to be rejected when laymen from the anti-immigrant party the Swedish Democrats participate, and less likely to be rejected when laymen from the Left Party, the Christian Democrats or the Green Party participate. This indicates that asylum seekers do not receive an impartial trial, and raises concerns that laymen in the courts can compromise the legal security in general.
K10|The Non-Scalability Of The Concept Of Law—A Reply To Thomas Schultz|The thesis of the non-scalability of the concept of law put forward by Professor Thomas Schultz is under the scrutiny in this paper. The major weakness of the thesis is that the emergence of transnational normative regimes question the old paradigm of the concept of law. The deterritorialization of the legal mode of domination blocks the possibility of fixing the (indisputable) necessary and sufficient conditions which constitute the concept of law and which are the prerequisites for the justification of the non-scalability thesis. The author thinks that we need another sort of methodology to describe the problem
K10|Conservative Philosophy and the Doctrine of Sovereignty: A Necessary Connection?|This article explains the philosophical sources of contemporary Russian conservative philosophy, which is blended with exceptionalism, the Westphalian conception of sovereignty, the negation of the universality of human rights, and which is based on the positivist precepts of the prevailing legal thinking in Russia. This conservative ideology is not new, as similar conceptions have been developed in Russian intellectual history in the past.
K10|Is Sharia Compatible with Contemporary Russian Law?|The analysis of the interaction between Sharia and legislation in action along with the compatibility of Sharia with contemporary Russian law is important from both a scientific and a practical point of view. There are several reasons for the increasing interest in this issue: the renaissance of Islam, the activity of Muslim communities outside the regions where Islam has traditionally spread, the threat of Islamic extremism, and the increasing influence of Sharia upon the political and legal development of the Muslim world. Russian researchers do not have a common attitude to Sharia’s relation to Russian legislation. They put forward different arguments for and against including Sharia in the official legal system. Along with these, some Russian lawyers make attempts to find the legal possibility or even necessity of including Sharia in contemporary Russian reality, including norms, principles and institutions in the legislation. There are three modes of possible interaction between Sharia and state legislation. The first is represented by the direct inclusion of Sharia norms into the legislation. The second is legal acts which refer to historical or local traditions. The third is that Sharia provisions can be used for solving issues which are provided for by dispositive norms of state legislation
K10|The Concept of Law: A Brief Introduction to Jural Aspects of Classical Eurasianism|Jurists and historians have rarely highlightened jural aspects of classical Russian Eurasianism. There have been several attempts to describe Eurasianist jural philosophy as a coherent system, but they were not fully relevant to the source material. The paper focuses on problems in the background of the creation of holistic Eurasianist jurisprudence during 1920s and 1930s. It emphasizes that the complexity of this process depended on different institutional and especially conceptual terms. The Eurasianists displayed several different approaches to Law whose distinctions were based on metajuridical grounds – phenomenological ideas in the work of Nickolai Alekseev, who argued for legal individualism; the “Alleinheit” theory found in the writings of Lev Karsavin; and a positivist theory in paper by Nickolai Dunaev. Based on published works of Eurasianists and unpublished archival materials, this research concludes that these juridical views were contradictory. These contradictions meant it was impossible to create a coherent Eurasianist jural theory using the terms derived from the authors mentioned, despite the fact that Eurasianist views have some specific characteristics
K10|Data Economy Dimensions|Data is the â€˜new oilâ€™. Data has been widely regarded as the main innovation driver in information technology and several other segments of developed economies. Inherent value of data has a significant transformational power. Realization of value of data drives the rapidly expanding data-driven technology sector. Data is among the most prized assets of not only data-oriented technology companies but also governments and individuals. Data plays a central role in a growing spectrum of economic activities. Data economy has manifested its effects along a number of dimensionsâ€•particularly, trade, labor, education and government. However, to realize the full potential of data and manage its transformational power, it is necessary to understand the value of data, its influential spectrum, and enablers facilitating social and economic benefits. Despite the growing importance of data economy, there is a considerable lack of studies encompassing the associated range data oriented economic activities and their analysis. This work examines the dimensions of contemporary data economy and presents a pertinent encompassing perspective

K10|The constitution of economic liberty in Hong Kong|The constitutional foundations of economic liberty in Hong Kong, the freest economy in the world according to many, are little understood. So as the perceived spread of collusion, cronyism, and corruption in the territory ever since the 1997 transfer of sovereignty despite China’s promises that little change will be made to the pre-existing way of life. Relying on the analytical tools of constitutional economics, this article argues that the Beijing-ratified Hong Kong Basic Law preserved only the form of the territory’s original, British-descended, constitution, not the substance; as witness the insertion of contradictory interventionist mandates, and the consequent reversal of principal-agent relationship of government to the business elite. The erosion of economic freedom over the past 17 years is explicable, at least partly, by the entry into force of the Basic Law, which has transformed the Hong Kong state from the impartial and passive umpire it once was into a partisan social engineer and economic gamesman, thereby unleashing skyrocketing rent-seeking opportunities.

K10|Reactions to corporate insider’s transactions: Do legal stock market disclosure rules have an impact?|We test the impact on security prices of top manager’s requirement’s to disclose their own share transactions in the firm. Specifically we study whether buy or sales transactions convey relevant information for market participants thereby studying the effects of legal stock market disclosure rules. Based on a comprehensive collection of stock market announcements from Danish CEOs and chairmen we find that insiders’ transactions influence share prices. However, it appears that there is a surprisingly difference, as buy transactions by chairmen have a much higher impact compared to CEO transactions, which to our knowledge have not been noticed already by others. Thus, our event study shows that the Danish stock market seems to be efficient in the semi-strong from. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015

K10|Combining Of Local Communities In Measures Of Decentralization In Ukraine|This article highlights the problems of communities united under decentralization in Ukraine. Decentralization is a key to effective territorial development and the path to democratization as well as real democracy. Therefore, Ukraine urgently needs to ensure communities to have the right credentials and be able to implement them in the transfer of responsibilities and resources to lower levels of public administration by the central government. In order to weaken the centralization of power through decentralization so it would not lead to growth of the arbitrariness of local officials and growing public dissatisfaction with the government. And so, the government should create a legal and financial framework that would assure the possibility of local governments united communities and so they can have their own funds and powers to effectively address local issues.
K10|Fundamentals And Features Embedded In The Concept Of Sovereignty|The notion of “sovereignty” cannot be assessed only in the concept of state organization because it is a term that cannot operate singular; he only fits in the concept of the three constituent elements: population, territory and political power of the state. As a phenomenon, political power is conceived as a global power exercised within a community, its defining purpose being to organize it, to maintain it and even to defend it. In a general sense of the literature, “power is the ability of an organized and sustainable social agent to impose others to meet or achieve the decisive objectives it proposes in personal or general interest”. The concept of “power” must be judged in terms of institutional; in this case, the people or positions of power identify power in various bodies to which powers are delegated. Seen in this context, institutionalized power takes the form of state power and is exercised by him as a whole, particularly by different bodies of public authority. Therefore, in this case, the state appears as the exclusive holder of force control and domination that routinely wear out.
K10|Democratic Freedoms Exercised By Ngos|"Democracy is a model of government based on popular sovereignty, the participation of citizens in public affairs as responsible members of the social body. The phenomenon of political participation is an integral and complex recruitment of citizens in politics. It includes a variety of overwhelming participatory forms - from simple ones to some upper elementary characteristic of political leaders. Ultimately, political participation is presented as ""output” (output function), the real effect of a particular pattern of behaviour, as a reflection and manifestation of the specific processes of political socialization, its effectiveness. An unbroken tradition of theories of democracy has given more attention to political participation of citizens, which is interpreted as a primary means to defend individual rights, the duty of citizen, as an indication of the welfare policy of the company and finally as a condition sine qua non of democracy. Institutional democratic reforms uninsured active involvement of citizens in the governance process proved to be formal and ineffective."
K10|Parliamentary Immunity – Form Of Protection And Care For Lawmakers|"Parliamentary immunity is intended to protect and care for lawmakers in contradiction with parliamentary responsibility. The idea assumes to ensure the necessary Parliament conditions during his mandate, he should enjoy social protection. Narrowly, it may be included in the safeguards of the mandate parliamentary immunities. This paper seeks to materialize under the normative frame, this concept from which the parliament benefits. Parliamentary immunity is an institution that cares for both the constitutional law (""the Statute of Deputies and Senators”) and for parliamentary law (principally aspects of immunity, including elements of the case resulting from the regulations of the two rooms). When Romania joined the European Union and has representatives in the European Parliament, parliamentary immunity is necessary in the context of constitutional law compared, at European level."

A vide classification, from an election point of view, divides persons into voters and elected, the second category holding the social destinies of those from the first category, much larger obviously. The degree to which government leaders can be nominated, whether the population should or should not participate in nominating them through voting procedures, taking into consideration historical but also contemporary reasons, age requirements for acquiring the differentiated right to vote as well as the opportunity to be able to run and implicitly attain a public office or a public dignity position, all these along other aspects represent causes and consequences of the recognition and exercise of the right to vote and to be elected.
K10|The End Banking Secrecy in Post- Crisis Economics- First Step. Coty Germany and HSBC Swiss Cases|Inequality, distribution and growth are important topics in modern post- crisis economics and their interconnections are a favorite subject of economists and international and national institutions. There is strong evidence also that the end of banking secrecy wasn’t a real priority for authorities. On the other hand, unfairness generates economic and political instability that reduces investment and therefore growth. Economic contrast impedes the social consensus necessary to absorb shocks and sustain growth. In this context, what positions should the effects of money laundering and tax evasion, as a result of banking secrecy, occupy? What is the reason for not including banking secrecy among the causes for instability, inequity and, consequently, crisis? Two recent cases have prompted the adoption of measures on banking secrecy in the E.U. – the Coty dispute between Germany and a German bank (more specifically, the interpretation forwarded by CJUE) and the HSBC Swiss bank secret accounts scandal (respectively, the deal on bank accounts between E.U. institutions and Swiss banks). Currently, the Romanian economy is characterized by macroeconomic balance and microeconomic tensions – the GDP distribution in economy is inadequate. The disciplined (individuals and legal entities who comply with the law) are tense, the reason being that they do not experience economic growth. Many distribution added value channels are clogged by the indiscipline of other individuals and legal entities. The undisciplined are relaxed, because they acquire and unreasonably large part of the added value in the economy.
K10|Customary Law and Woman’s Rights within the African System of Human Rights Protection|Of all the regional law systems, the African system offers a peculiar place to moral values – a fact that is demonstrated by means of the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights which recognizes a special role to the African culture. The legal implementation of African traditions has determined, within the African nation-state, the establishment of a specific legal system that is organized upon two main levels (we refer to customary law and statutory law). Consequently, we can upheld the idea that this legal duality strongly impacts the sphere of the juridical protection of women’s rights; this is obvious as the traditional African values contain provisions that challenge the principle of gender equality meanwhile, statutory law is consistent with Western-inspired norms according to which gender equality is deemed as essential. In our paper, we aim to assess the issue of gender equality within the context of legal pluralism that is determined by the co-existence of customary law and statutory law by bearing in mind two fundamental hypothesis: (1) customary law is built of African moral traditions; it is unwritten and orally transmitted thus being adaptable to ever changing social realities; (2) statutory law is, on the other hand, written, unalterable and in agreement with international regulations that are destined to human rights protection and which are taught, by African scholars, to be the creation of Western legal schools. Within this framework, our analysis will take into consideration juridical institutions belonging to family law like marriage or divorce; furthermore, we will concentrate upon the manner in which these African customary practices influence the juridical protection of women’s rights. From the methodological point of view, we will use the hermeneutical method because all the dispositions belonging to customary or statutory law will be construed within a personal perspective.
K10|Tradition and Innovation in Legal Sciences|Starting from the ideas of some illustrious jurists as Piccard, François Gabby, we can say that over the ages there have been changes, the legal institutions have evolved, but at the same time, there were elements of continuity from one historical era to another, of institutions, ideas, concepts, on the legal phenomenon. Regarding this, a series of studies are raising a number of questions: whether we could identify, besides some immediate changes of legislation compatible with the new established order, and some elements of continuity with the past order.
K10|The Necessity of Setting up the Ad Hoc International Criminal Tribunals. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia: (1993-today)|This tribunal has been set up for the punishment of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is a United Nations structure established for the prosecution of serious crimes committed during the wars in the former Yugoslavia. The Tribunal is an ad hoc court, which sits in Hague, Netherlands, and was established by resolution 827 of the Security Council of the United Nations, adopted on May 25, 1993 (Ackerman, O’Sullivan, 2000), as a measure to restore the international peace and security, adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations (Onica- Jarka, 2009, p. 107).
K10|‘To Have and Have Not’: Are Rich Litigious Plaintiffs Favored in Court?|A long-standing debate centers on the role of the “Haves” and the “Have Nots” in litigation. It is often suggested that wealthier plaintiffs are more likely to be repeat players, who tend to prevail in disputes before the courts. Do wealthy repeat players indeed capture courts and succeed in shaping legal rules regardless of the intent of policy makers? This paper employs a unique historical data set that allows a direct test of these hypotheses, including information on the wealth of participants in civil district courts, their occupations, and the total number of lawsuits filed by each litigant over a long period. The results show that repeat players indeed tended to be wealthier, in occupations that likely benefited from creating a reputation for uncooperative litigation strategies. However, outcomes in court were independent of wealth, and related more to the type of case. Far from being under the sway of the “Haves,” early courts functioned as an effective enforcement mechanism for extensive markets in debt, that likely promoted economic growth during this period.

K10|Opportunities For Ict Use In The Notary Public Service|This paper looks at the notary public service in general and its scope of activities. In addition, it deals with the Notarial Code of Conduct (Code of Ethics) written by Vladimir Pappafava in 1896 and, in a certain way, provides a historical overview and comparison of public notary service in respect of the powers now and then. It is indicated that the notary public service, in terms of powers, has not changed much to the present time. Nowadays, when the development of computer science and technology has reached the point when it is almost impossible to follow it, the question is how and to what extent the notary public service should take advantage of such a wide range of technological capabilities. Along its development, information technology has been penetrating more and more into every segment of human life - both business and private. In addition to many benefits provided by information technology (acceleration of business, communications, etc.), it has also brought some technical problems that can lead to complete interruption of business. The contribution and role of information technology in the notary public service in the European Union Member States including the Republic of Croatia, as well as certain ideas regarding the use of opportunities afforded by information and communication technologies are also discussed.
K10|Freedom Of Speech In Relation With The Right To Private Life In The Digital Era|The Human Rights Council of the United Nations Organisation, remarking the „vast technological leaps” taking place in the digital era, as well as their impact on human rights nationally and worldwide, is considering the promotion of certain measures within a recent resolution.. The Council reminds „the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelationing of all human rights and fundamental freedoms”; it acknowledges the need for promoting and protecting these rights in the context of the fight against terrorism, but affirms especially the protection of the right to the freedom of opinion and freedom of speech, the right to privacy respect – domicile and correspondence, the protection of honour, reputation and the right to one’s own image – for all persons. Thus, it establishes and promotes a special procedure to this respect, based on the international law, but also of guarantees of efficient internal liability (stipulation of attack ways, non-arbitrary examination of basic principles related to legality, evaluation of proportionality in relation with the surveillance practices etc.). For this purpose it identifies principles, clarifies standards and good practices of the protection of the right to private and family life.
K10|Notion Sur L’Interpretation Des Normes Juridiques|Dans cet article, nous voulons prouver que la norme juridique fixée dans l’acte juridique normatif est une création intellectuelle, qui a un auteur nommé législateur. La norme juridique, quelle que soit la nature juridique, s’exprime par le langage des actes normatifs, constitués de signes écrits, de maniere que la personne qui les connaît est appelée alphabétisée. Aussi, les significations des textes normatifs ne sont pas faciles a trouver, car dans sa structure logique la norme juridique est compliquée et la structure logique de la norme ne coincide pas avec la structure technique-législative des actes normatifs, ayant, elle aussi, ses complications. En plus, il est nécessaire de connaître le lexique, la syntaxe, la morphologie de la langue nationale, la terminologie du langage juridique, on a besoin de connaissances d’histoire, de sociologie, de logique, de psychologie a un niveau qui nous permette des interprétations plus fideles que possible a l’intention, a la volonté, a la pensée du législateur. Il est connu que dans l’activité de réalisation et d’application du droit positif, l’interprétation est inévitable. Nous allons analyser le grand probleme pratique de l’interprétation dans le droit positif : celui de trouver les significations authentiques des normes des actes normatifs en vigueur dans un droit positif - l’interprétation de la loi - et l’interprétation concretes par intermédiaire ou sans intermédiaire des faits et des coupables - l’interprétation factuelle. Dans ce contexte, nous analysons l’ensemble d’opérations rationnelles d’abstraction, d’explication et d’argumentation des sens et des significations normatives qu’ont les objets juridiques – actes juridiques normatifs ou non, moyens de preuve - dans le but de trouver une solution a un probleme juridique théorique ou pratique.

The desire to reach the top of social organization, to be able to make decisions, have determined societies to organize and establish rules and limitation and sometimes even create certain system that function based on the rotation of political forces at government. The two great formulas of government are based on different principles regarding the means of designating the head of state, the term this public dignity can be held for and there are some state leaders with great power of decision and influence while their homologous exclusively detain rather symbolic or representative attributions.
K10|Theories De La Concurrence Et Conceptions De L’État|Quelles sont les implications des théories de la concurrence sur la façon de concevoir l’État ? La concurrence est célébrée depuis les origines de l’économie politique comme ce qui fonde sa prétention a etre une science (Mill, 1854, pp. 278-279). Arme dans la lutte qui, sous l’Ancien Régime, encastraient les marchés dans les rapports sociaux, fermaient leur acces a tous les producteurs et réservaient l’achat de divers biens a certains acquéreurs, la libre concurrence a été idéalisée comme le moyen naturel de fixer les prix et d’optimiser l’allocation des ressources rares. Combinée, dans une économie monétaire, avec les notions d’intéret et d’utilité, elle permet en effet de voir l’homme, conformément a l’habitus des capitalistes adoptant une mentalité quantitative (Jeannin, 1957, p. 131) comme un homo oeconomicus calculant au moyen de techniques comptables les couts, les avantages et les risques des différentes opérations échanges possibles et maximisant ainsi ses propres utilités (Demeulenaere, 2003, p. 86). Elle permet aussi et surtout d’imaginer l’existence d’un systeme autorégulateur de marchés « capable », sous certaines conditions, « d’organiser la totalité de la vie économique sans aide ou intervention extérieure » (Polanyi, 2009, p. 87)
K10|The Legality Control Made By The Prefect’S Institution On The Acts Of The Local Public Administration Authorities|The prefect may directly contest, in front of the administrative legal department, the acts issued by the local public administration’s authorities, if they find them illegal; the action is drawn within the time foreseen by the article 11 paragraph (1), from the law of the administrative legal department, time frame starting to flow from the moment the prefect communicates the act and in the terms foreseen by law. Article 124 of the Law nr. 215/2001 – Law of local public administration, republished, with the ulterior alterations and completions, regulates the law of local councils to „give in free use, for a limited time, the mobile assets and the real estates public or private, local or county property, according to the case, to the companies with no lucrative purpose, that develop the charity or public utility or public services activities”. From the content of the legal dispositions listed above it clearly results, that the local public authority decides, in exercising its attributions, only through decisions, in all fields attributed through law. The court of law has the duty to delimit the categories of these decisions, according to their legal nature of authority administrative acts, of acts of civil law, of commercial law etc, with the consequence of delimiting the material competence of the administrative legal department related to other courts. In order for the decisions adopted to constitute adopted acts/ issued as public power, even though to be censored in the conditions of the administrative legal department, these must aim the public or public property.
K10|The review of constitutional norms concerning local public administration in the view of the European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission)|The proposals of the Commission to review the Constitution of Romania were subject to the analysis of experts from the European Commission for Democracy through Law (the Venice Commission), who expressed their opinion in a report adopted at the 98th plenary session of the European body. The article analyzes the recommendations of the Venice Commission regarding the proposed changes to the constitutional norms governing local public administration, comprising some general aspects concerning the role and importance of this advisory body of the Council of Europe
K10|Tailoring Negligence Standards to Accident Records|Traditional economic models of accident law are static and assume homogeneous individuals under perfect information. This paper relaxes these assumptions and presents a dynamic unilateral accident model in which potential injurers differ in their probability of accident. Information about individual risk-type is hidden from the social planner and from each potential injurer. We ask how negligence standards should be optimally tailored to individual risk-type when this is imperfectly observable. We argue that information about past accident experiences helps to efficiently define negligence standards, narrowing the distance between first-best standards perfectly tailored to individual risk-type and third-best averaged standards. We finally show that negligence standards refined on the basis of past accident experiences and of individual risk-type do not undermine private incentives to undertake due care.
K10|Economic growth and the reform of the judicial system of Bulgaria in the period 2000-2015 (vision for a new measurement model)|The publication proposes a concept for new model for evaluation of the “reform of the judicial system”, different from those applied by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund where the economic growth rate of each country is measured. Their models, based on performance indicators, examine the “reform of the judicial system” as constant and floating in time, evaluated in certain periods of time. This fact obstructs the identification of the relative legislative miscarriages of every single judicial reform. The new model, proposed by the current study, discusses the possibilities how the presence of a single reform of the judicial system could be identified by a group of indicators. In this way it can be determined both the effectiveness of the reform of the judicial system and the government will for reform during its mandate. The model is especially useful to be implemented by countries with transitional economies when evaluating the correlation between the reform of the judicial system and the economic growth. As an example, in the current study the model is applied to the judicial system of Bulgaria.
K10|Role of Fiqh in Islamic finance|Fiqh, indicating Islamic law and the tools to produce it, covers all aspects of human dealings, including ones with the Creator, as embodied in Fiqh of devotions, and ones between human beings themselves as embodied in other branches of Islamic law like personal status law, political law, criminal law and financial law. Islamic financial law includes the Shariah nominated contracts that represent the bases for all Islamic banking and finance transactions including those that have been developed and modeled after the existing ones. However, developing or endorsing a financial product is a process that requires the Faqih (Shariah scholar) to employ and consult a variety of Fiqh instruments. These instruments are also prescribed and detailed in Islamic law; however, many Shariah specialists and observers have protested improper use of these instruments. The paper comes to first discuss the most important proper Fiqh instruments available to the Faqih to evaluate and endorse products and transactions in Islamic finance. It then elaborates on the instruments whose use in the domain of modern Islamic finance has allegedly reflected a departure from Shariah rules and tools of Ijtihad. The objective of this paper is to shed some light on the cotemporary Ijtihad in Fiqh of Finance in light of the guidelines provided by the Shariah in an attempt to draw the outlines of what constitutes a proper role of Ijtihad Fiqhi in Islamic finance.
K10|Impact of Unemployment on Crime in Europe|This study discovers how unemployment rate explains the changes in the crime rate tendency in Europe by the two-stage-least square regression. The crime rate in the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) area is found evidently more sensitive to unemployment than the non-EMU countries. The adoption of a common currency also strengthens the connections of the criminal problem among the EMU countries. We found the seriousness of the endogenous bias involved using the OLS methodology, so previous findings on the small effect of unemployment on crime rate obtained by employing the OLS methodology could be unreliable. Empirically, a one-percentage-point increase in unemployment increases the property crime by nearly 9% on average. The large unemployment effect implies that the increase in the unemployment rate that occurred after the financial crisis in 2008, followed by the European sovereign-debt crisis, may account for the trending increasing tendencies of the crime rate in Europe. The high unemployment effect revealed markedly different policy implications than those that have previously been considered in the literature. These findings suggest that the key determinants for governmental authorities in the EMU area successfully mitigating crime would greatly depend on how the governments resolve their economic recession.
K10|La Cohesión Social Económica y su Efecto sobre la el Pago de Impuestos en la Ciudad de La Paz|La presente investigación tiene como objetivo estudiar la cohesión social y su relación con la evasión de impuestos en Bolivia. La cohesión social, entendida en términos sencillos como aquellos elementos que mantienen unida a una sociedad, determina la cooperación entre individuos. Utilizando indicadores propuestos por la CEPAL y la información de la Encuesta de Cohesión Social del Instituto de Investigaciones Socio-Económicas de la Universidad Católica Boliviana “San Pablo” (IISEC-UCB), se ha determinado que el mayor problema en Bolivia es la disposición a pagar impuestos. La baja calidad institucional trae consigo bajos niveles de confianza en el Estado, por lo que la disposición a pagar impuestos también es baja. En base a información recopilada en la ciudad de La Paz mediante el diseño e implementación de una encuesta de opinión en el año 2014, se ha determinado que la probabilidad de pagar impuestos aumenta cuando la cohesión social es mayor, ceteris paribus. Esto presenta evidencia de que es importante no sólo enfocarse en los mecanismos de control de la evasión de impuestos, sino en las actitudes de las personas.

K10|Equal Employment Opportunities In The Recruitment And Selection Process Of Human Resources|The aim of this article is to examine the problem of the concept of equal employment opportunities in the HR recruitment and selection process. Due to the fact that in these processes, both the HR managers and the applicants are involved, this research is conducted separately among them. Thus, it will be determined if both sides share the same opinion with respect to the existence of this concept in the mentioned processes. Providing equal employment opportunities is crucial for any company and represents a key for selecting the real employees. Therefore, the research includes the existence of prejudices in the recruitment and selection process such as discrimination based on national and social origin, gender and sexual orientation, age, political affiliation etc. As an essential part of this concept, the legislation in the Republic of Macedonia and its impact in the process of generating equal opportunities will be considered.
K10|Terrorist as a Subject of International Law? -An analysis in the light of 9/11-|Starting from the definition of the subjects of international law, this essay looks at the main actors of the international community and the modern development of international law, which was and still is in particular characterised by widening the circle of subjects, due to the influence of globalisation. Non-Governmental Organisation and Multinational Enterprises will be in the focus as well as individuals and Liberation movements. These built the basis in the question if terrorists could and should be a subject of international law. The analysis shows that necessary legal norms, especially chapter VII of the UN-Charter do not impede the possibility of accepting private individuals or groups as subjects of the international legal system and signals a passive legal personality as a possible option.
K10|The right to free assistance of an interpreter and /or translator based on the example of Finland|This article examines the legal, theoretical and practical issues for participation of an authorised interpreter in criminal proceedings. Based on the analysis of international and national normative sources an investigation is conducted into legal personality of an interpreter, requirements level of his professional competence and its role in the observance and implementation of the rights of the suspect and the accused to a fair trial. An interpreter plays an important role in the enforcement and protection of the rights and freedoms of people who do not speak the language of the proceedings in the criminal case. The article is devoted to the problematic issues that arise under the influence of international law and the European Court of Human Rights on the transformation of the legal mechanism to protect the rights of suspects and defendants who did not know the language of proceedings and the role of a court interpreter.
K10|Applicability Of The Presidential System In Turkey|We need to mention about the presidential systems rather than a presidential system. As it is not possible to make a single definition of the presidential system, it is not possible to assess in the same category made the match a certain pattern of multiple presidential system. There are different state applications of the presidential system. So this system varies from country to country. For example, the US presidential system applied is different from the presidential system implemented in Latin America. In the presidential system applied in the US is strong in both the legislative and executive. In the US there is a strong legislature. The legislature is weak in Latin American countries such as Mexico and Venezuela. Presidents in these countries are extremely powerful. A common feature of these systems is that the president is elected by the people. So the president and parliament on all presidential systems is determined by different election. Therefore, there is two seperate sources of legitimacy based on the election of the president and parliament in presidential systems.
K10|Practices of case proceedings by the Supreme Court of Finland, suspect's right to defence by means of legal assistance|The right to protection of the suspect or accused of a criminal offense established by the Council of Europe, the UN General Assembly and the European Court of Human Rights, is one of the basic constitutional guarantees, designed primarily to provide reliable protection of human rights in criminal proceedings. The practices of the European Court (the case-law of the European Court) should be a defining aspect in the interpretation of national provisions of the Convention. This article is dedicated to a problematic issue of protecting the rights of detained suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings of the national courts of Finland and the implementation of jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, supported by the principles and standards of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as the decisions of the UN Committee on Human Rights. The article analyses norms of international law, judicial precedent of the European Court of Human Rights in the decisions of the Supreme Court of Finland and the review of applications to rescind prior court decision on the basis of a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights.
K10|Implementation of the presumption of innocence principle in European Court of Human Rights and legal proceedings of Finland|"The presumption of innocence is considered by the European Court of Human Rights, not only as a principle of criminal justice, but also as a ""concrete and real"" defendant's right to be presumed innocent until the moment of procedural instance described by paragraph 2, article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. A case procedure is based on the presumption of innocence and the interpretation of doubt in favour of the defendant, protects the suspect, meanwhile the officials authorized to conduct the preliminary investigation, are warned against voicing any allegations. Application of the presumption of innocence in Finland is regarded not only in criminal proceedings but also at a much wider spectrum - in tax, environmental, migration and commercial law. These cases are dealt with in the administrative and commercial courts.This article discusses examples for the application of presumption of innocence in the Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court of Finland."
K10|Considerations Regarding The Effects Of Legal Communication|This article addresses some aspects of legal communication or legal effects of communication. As such, legal communication can have positive and negative effects. Both effects are briefly analyzed, and for the negative effects of legal communication we have also presented proposals to reduce the negative effects of law communication. Thus, the article presents the positive effects of right communication in various branches of law such as civil, constitutional law or tax law. On the other hand, the negative effects of communication leading to the deterioration of the legal message, so that much of the legal message becomes legal noise. Another negative effect of miscommunication of law is the phenomenon of legislative inflation, which has a profound impact on the way in which legal rules are understood and respected by community members. All these negative effects produce serious consequencesin civil law, company law, tax law, and in many other areas of law.
K10|The Legislative Technique And Presumption Of The Obligation To Know The Law|Entitled as such to bring forward the law, the legislative institutions shall find the most appropriate expression in the legal language, in the content of legal norms and the manner this language is perceived by those to whom it addresses. In this respect, it makes use of certain specific procedures for bringing forward legal rules, procedures whose purpose is to explain and express as clearly as possible the legal rules it decides upon. The important proceedings used by the legislator are presumptions and fictions where the presumption considers that something is true, without any evidence and without proving its existence and the fiction is a certain process of the legislator or the judge by means of which a fact is deemed to exist or to be established although it does not actually exist neither has it really been established. An important presumption one can operate with is the pre sumption to know the law upon its publication, an presumption otherwise considered to be conclusive, unlikely to be challenged by anyone and under no circumstances. This presumption can have hard and undesirable effects in so that the individual called to account for the violation of law can bring evidence to testify he was actually in the effective impossibility of knowing the law.
K10|European Civil Code Between Desideratum And Reality|The principle of priority and direct application of European rules in relation to the provisions that we find in the national legislation, once assumed at European level, it has generated debates and concerns about the usefulness of a single legal act in private law matters. The idea of European Civil Code, appeared somewhere in the early 80s, is becoming more current and triggers a justified and sustained interest. Considering that the civil legislation of Community Member is a legislation dominated by tradition and peculiarities of culture, religion and temper, the issue of a European Civil Code forms as a project generating discussions, restraints and even rejec tions of the Member States in relation to this proposal. The current system of European legislative acts that apply immediately and priority in EU member states remains only a temporary solution and which generates difficulties in interpretation and affects the utility of the enactment. Clarifications on the pros and cons to promote a European Civil Codex will be analyzed primarily in terms of law and, last but not least in terms of political perspective, taking into account the Community objectives undertaken by accession treaties and the need for a legislative norm, especially European, to be predictable, transparent, useful and accessible. This paper intends to submit to debate both current doctrinal arguments, the blocking of such an approach, based on the principle of autonomy and the peculiarities of the legal system of each Member State, but also considering the practical arguments and of simplification of rules met in a European Civil Code assumed and applicable in the European space.
