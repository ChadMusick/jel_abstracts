B11|High Wages or Wages For Energy? An Alternative View of The British Case (1645-1700)|Energy was one of the keys to the remarkable increase in English GDP between 1650 and 1700. Increased per head physical activity and basal metabolic rate led to increased energy consumption. In response, subsistence wages, productivity, wages and incomes increased. Malthusian adjustment explains only 50 per cent of the increase in calorie intake, the other 50 per cent is associated with higher energy consumption. Non-agricultural wages began to differ from agricultural wages. British economic development occurred everywhere, in the city and in the countryside. This approach opens new perspectives to the debate between enclosures and open fields and why underemployment became common among the philosophers' British debates.
B11|Steuart, Smith, and the ‘system of commerce’: international trade and monetary theory in late-18th century british political economy|Though contemporaries, Adam Smith and Sir James Steuart are commonly portrayed as men belonging to different eras. Whereas Smith went down in history both as founder of Classical Political Economy and patron of economic liberalism, Steuart became known as the last, outdated advocate of mercantilist policies in Britain. Smith himself was responsible for popularizing the notion of the ‘system of commerce’ as an approach to political economy that dominated British thought during the early modern period. As it evolved into a historiographical concept, the mercantile system came to be seen as an international trade theory grounded upon the fallacious doctrine of the favorable balance of trade. In the Wealth of Nations, however, Smith puts limited emphasis on international trade as a theoretical concern. His analysis of the subject, moreover, was marred by lack of analytical clarity, which caused him to be chastised by some among his followers who adhered more enthusiastically to the free trade cause. Given Smith’s doubtful credentials as a free trade theorist, in this paper we try to analyze the reasons that led him and Steuart to be historically placed on opposite sides of the mercantilist divide. To do so, we analyze the works of both authors in depth, showing that their disagreements in matters of economic policy have chiefly to do with different views about the role of money in the economy. Additionally, we explore how early-19th century writers helped forge the intellectual profiles of both Steuart and Smith.
B11|Turgot, Smith and Steuart on Stadial Histories|The theory of the stages of society appeared in the mid-18th century. Following a successful reception over the course of the second half of the century, the four-stage theory was finally adopted by Classical Economics, holding that the exchange economy is the final outcome of a long period of economic development. This paper carries out a comparative analysis of the stadial histories of Turgot, Smith and Steuart. We found theories which were similar, but which were identical in the pre-eminence of the productive forces and economic organisation. Firstly, a number of dynamic principles are noted?i.e., a natural tendency to improve their conditions, a series of shocks that change the historical stage and the innovative capacity of some individuals. Secondly, the necessary conditions for the movement from the agricultural stage to commercial society do not coincide. Turgot requires an accumulation of capital, Smith uses the market and Steuart points to the artificial institutions created by merchants. This is the central point in order to understand the differences between their economic theories.
B11|The concept of economic thought Ibn Khaldun|This article describes the economic thinking of Ibn Khaldun. This study uses the historical approach of Islamic economic thinking through textual exegesis (text analysis). The results of this study indicate that the economic thought of Ibn Khaldun explains the concept of multidimensional economy involving various social aspects. Ibn Khaldun's economic concept implies an economic system that requires five components, namely sharia, government, society, ownership, free and fair economic activity.

However, the role of the government in carrying out development depends on public finance which in fact has problems in terms of management and implementation. In the perspective of Islamic economics, public finance is a top priority managed from the side of the sources of income and expenditure used in implementing pro-poor development so as to create prosperity for the community.
B11|Commercial and Economic Goals of the British in the Safavid Persia And the countries of South Caucasus in the 16th century|It is indisputable that the active work of the trade companies in the Tudor period was one of the factors determining economic power of England. Before the British East-India Company began to struggle with the Portuguese for the positions in India the representatives of the English ?Muscovy Company? had 7 visits in the East in 1558-1581.?After entering the Moscow market, the British tried to use the Volga rout and to establish trade relationship with India and China through Central Asia and Persia, but the trade with China was actually reduced to nil due to turbulent situation in oriental countries. Trade with India did not seem prospective either ? their hot climate and poverty of local people was not a favorable prospect for English broadcloth. ? Disillusioned with his plan about China and India, Jenkinson turned his attention to Safavid Persia (where the main export product was silk, so desirable for Europeans) and obtained a sanction from the ?Muscovy Company? to trade in that direction. However, he also needed permission of the Moscow ruler, Ivan Grozny for which Jenkinson offered his service that is apparent from the relazione about his trip to Persia. ?Jenkinson's notifications (which provides significant information about Shirvan located on the shores of the Caspian Sea and its neighboring Georgian kingdoms in the South Caucasus, where the raw silk was produced) clearly demonstrates the wide profile of the trips of British merchants - diplomatic flexibility and understanding of political situation, in addition to their primary economic interests. After reading and analyzing the entire context of his report, if we try to connect the facts of the fragments, where Anthony Jenkinson mentions the Georgians and compare them with the Persian and Georgian sources of that period, we can reconstruct of the historical events and correct understanding of the processes in 16th century Georgia.?Although, Jenkinson could not achieve privilegies in Kazvin, he managed to make contacts with Indian merchants, who gave him hope that he could trade with spices throughout Persia. More specific result was waiting for him on the way back to the South Caucasus, where he visited one of his most desirable hosts in all the Safavid Iran - the ruler of Shirvan, Abdula Han. He received the separate and valuable privilegies from him that allowed him to exchange English wool products into the Iranian silk.

B11|Classifications of innovations: Survey and future directions|The purpose of this paper is to focus on similarity and/or heterogeneity of taxonomies of innovation present in the economic fields to show as the economic literature uses different names to indicate the same type of technical change and innovation, and the same name for different types of innovation. This ambiguity of classification makes it impossible to compare the various studies; moreover the numerous typologies existing in the economics of innovation, technometrics, economics of technical change, management of technology, etc., have hindered the development of knowledge in these fields. The research presents also new directions on the classification of innovation that try to overcome these problems.
B11|La determinación de los precios en la teoría económica de Sir James Steuart|Resumen: Este artículo tiene como objetivo interpretar la teoría de los precios de Sir James Steuart. Para tal fin, se adopta la perspectiva clásica de los precios de producción, razón por la cual es necesario introducir hipótesis que justifiquen en Steuart la existencia de un excedente productivo y su norma de distribución. Sin embargo, los precios son determinados por los comerciantes y no por los productores, a través de un proceso teórico que implica distinguir dos etapas analíticas: por un lado, el acto privado del comerciante que determina los precios de venta y, por otro lado, el acto colectivo o competitivo que determina los precios de compra o de mercado. Al final se muestra que, si bien se puede justificar un análisis de los precios desde una perspectiva clásica, Steuart conserva su lugar en la tradición mercantilista. / Abstract : The aim of this paper is to interpret James Steuart’s theory of prices. To achieve this purpose, specials hypothesis about the surplus and his distribution rule are included into the classical theory of production prices. However, prices are determined by merchants and not by manufacturers, through a theoretical process that involves two analytical stages: on the one hand, the private act of the merchant determines the sales prices and, on the other hand, the collective or competitive act of the merchants determines the purchase prices. Although it is possible to demonstrate an affiliation of Stueart's thinking to the classical approach, he continues as a mercantilist economist.
B11|The Rural Economics of René de Girardin: Landscapes at the Service of l’Idéologie Nobiliaire|René-Louis de Girardin is remembered for having invited Rousseau at Ermenonville estate. Girardin believed it was necessary to further the debate on gardens on the basis of a principle of continuity that rejects any idea of enclosure. This made it possible to establish an agricultural model that increased production, and finally allowed the monopoly in grain sales to be broken. At the service of l’idéologie nobiliaire, his analysis shows the existence of a form of economic thinking in the second half of the 18th century that, giving primacy to agriculture, nevertheless cannot fall within the paths of physiocrats and agronomes.
B11|Други Канон И Маршалов План Као Модел Економске Политике<BR>[Other Canon and Marshall’s Plan as a Model of Economic Policy]|Serbian: Разматрају се основне карактеристике Маршаловог плана као типа економске политике. За разлику од политике саморегулишућег тржишта, која је заснована на (нео)либералној теорији и представљена Вашингтонским договором, политика маршаловског типа, активног уплива државе у привредне токове, заснована је на многовековној традицији и представљена Другим каноном. Обе врсте политика могу се историјски пратити до времена физиократа и меркантилиста, али у савременим условима потпуно адекватно могу да буду представљене плановима Моргентауа и Маршала, насталим за и примењеним у Немачкој после Другог светског рата. Моргентауов план одговара (нео)либералној политици и резултира деиндустриализацијом земље, док Маршалов план насупрот томе одговара политици Другог канона и резултира индустријализацијом земље. Из тих карактеристика следи да транзиционе земље за своје привреде треба да примене економску политику оваплоћену у Маршаловом плану. English: The paper considers the main characteristics of Marshall’s plan as an economic policy model. Unlike the self-regulating market policy, which is based on the neo-liberal policy and defined by the Washington Consensus, the Marshall-type policy, with its active state interference in economic processes, is based on the many centuries’ tradition and reflected in the Other Canon. Both policy types can be traced to the times of physiocrats and mercantilists, but in present circumstances they can be represented through Morgenthau Plan and Marshall Plan, originated after the World War Two and applied in Germany. Morgenthau’s Plan corresponds to the neoliberal policy and its consequence is the country deindustrialization, while Marshall’s Plan corresponds to the Other Canon policy and results in industrialization. Therefore, we deduce that transition countries need to apply the economic policy incorporated in Marshall Plan in order to develop their economies.
B11|A Just Price: Objections and Suggested Solutions|This paper examines the concept of a just price not as a historical but as theoretical problem. After a detailed exposition of the scholastic theory of value, price and commutative justice, the author identifies four main subjective-value-based objections to the concept of a just price and settles them one after another. These objections are 1) an apparent self-contradiction consisting in stating a subjective nature of utility and, at the same time, equality of value in exchange; 2) how can a voluntary exchange be unjust; 3) how can a just price be found in an isolated exchange of a unique good; 4) a missing satisfactory definition of a just price. The author suggests to settle the first objection by identifying the ontological status of the objective value. Leaning on a distinction of an objective value in use (virtuositas) and subjective desirability (complacibilitas) made by Saint Bernardino of Sienna and Saint Antonino of Florence, the author asserts that while complacibilitas is a potentiality of subjective desirability resting in an individual, virtuositas is a potentiality of usefulness resting in a thing. On account of this, a following solution is suggested: a particular usefulness is not purely subjective because it does not depend on a subjective perception of an individual; it is a metaphysical accident of a thing, not a metaphysical accident of an individual; a particular usefulness is not purely objective, either, because it is a relation to an individua; thus, equality in exchange means equality of potentiality of usefulness which is not a particular usefulness but a set of all usefulnesses concealed in the potentiality of the thing, even though they have not yet been actuated. The author suggests to settle the second objection by providing a logical proof for the assertion that an exchange in which one party suffers an unjust price is not a voluntary exchange and, on the grounds of this, the author demonstrates that an unjust exchange cannot be a voluntary exchange. Finally, the author suggests a definition of a just price which is applicable to any exchange, whether a competitive price exists or not.

B11|Die Selbstwahrnehmung der Wirtschaft: Entstehung und Wandel von Statistik und Ökonomik als Theorie für Eliten|"Die Statistik war in ihren Anfängen ""Staatszustandswissenschaft"", Fürsten erfassten darin in der Kammer ihr jeweiliges Territorium. Durch die Bevölkerungswissenschaft wandelte sie sich schrittweise zu einer formalmathematischen Theorie. Parallel dazu setzte sich die Geldökonomie immer mehr als herrschende Form durch und transformierte auch die Vorstellung von den handelnden Subjekten. Durch das Prinzip, nur jeweils Durchschnitte zu erfassen, wurde vor allem in der schottischen Tradition des Liberalismus aus der Ökonomik als ""moral science"" eine naturalistische Theorie autonomer Marktprozesse. Die Selbstwahrnehmung der Wirtschaft in Statistik und Ökonomik dient – ungeachtet ihrer vermeintlich neutralen, äußerlichen und formal-mathematischen Struktur – vorwiegend den Interessen einer herrschenden Elite."
B11|Retrospectives: What Did the Ancient Greeks Mean by Oikonomia?|"Nearly every economist has at some point in the standard coursework been exposed to a brief explanation that the origin of the word ""economy"" can be traced back to the Greek word oikonomia, which in turn is composed of two words: oikos, which is usually translated as ""household""; and nemein, which is best translated as ""management and dispensation."" Thus, the cursory story usually goes, the term oikonomia referred to ""household management"", and while this was in some loose way linked to the idea of budgeting, it has little or no relevance to contemporary economics. This article introduces in more detail what the ancient Greek philosophers meant by ""oikonomia."" It begins with a short history of the word. It then explores some of the key elements of oikonomia, while offering some comparisons and contrasts with modern economic thought. For example, both Ancient Greek oikonomia and contemporary economics study human behavior as a relationship between ends and means which have alternative uses. However, while both approaches hold that the rationality of any economic action is dependent on the frugal use of means, contemporary economics is largely neutral between ends, while in ancient economic theory, an action is considered economically rational only when taken towards a praiseworthy end. Moreover, the ancient philosophers had a distinct view of what constituted such an end—specifically, acting as a philosopher or as an active participant in the life of the city-state."
B11|Political Economy in the Pseudo-Aristotelian Oeconomica II and the German Cameralist Klock|Montchrétien was decidedly mercantilist. He praises the ancients, their honour and their self-discipline, but he notes, like Serra, that there was no concept of Political Economy in Antiquity. The words, however, appear for the first time in the pseudoaristotelian Oeconomica II, where the householding by a king, the householding of the governor of a province, the administration of a city (polis) and the household of a private citizen are distinguished; the term applies to the financing of a city economy. The book contains a multitude of prescriptions of how to finance a city by means of varying forms of taxation, gifts, forced loans and by means of manipulating the currency. Especially the latter schemes are of extreme interest for the historian of economic thought, as they reveal a remarkable understanding of metallist and nominalist conception of money. The paper tries to explain the contexts and then goes on to compare these doctrines with cameralism, using the comments published in 1651 by the German cameralist Klock on Oeconomica II. He treats the proposals as if they were made by contemporaries, assessing them from practical and moral points of view in a way that suggests a parallelism of institutions and ideas.
B11|Montchrétien Founder of Political Economy|Montchrétien is still appreciated as a literate and author of tragedies, but is gravely neglected as an economist. His book - Traité de l’économie politique (1615) - is one of the most important expression of mercantilism. Like for the other mercantilists, Montchrétien’s main concern was development through the expansion on manufactures, the organisation of the poor for labour, the increase of exportations and a keen economic competition with the other states. Montchrétien enriches his arguments by drawing from his immense erudition about far and recent history, mythology and also a detailed and deep knowledge of the social and economic problems of his time. But his most important achievement was the foundation of modern political economy as different from ancient household economy. Contrary to the common conviction that the title of his book was just an unintentional chance, we are set to show that Montchrétien was perfectly aware of the main features of the new economic science: management of social wealth in the public interest, growth of social wealth and a general welfare as the main aim, balance between private and public interest. Private interest is the spring of enrichment; its protection is the source of individual rights and of liberty. Public interest must ensure equal rights, welfare and protection of the poor.
B11|Nation-World: Autarky and Geo-economics in Montchrétien’s Traicté|In his Traicté de l’oeconomie politique (1615), Antoine de Montchrétien proposed a model of development, based on an autarkic economy, formulating analytical and political alternative to increasing integration of world trade, which in the seventeenth century was under Dutch and English hegemony. Montchrétien’s response to the problem of world trade integration focused on the establishment of a French colonial empire, completely self-sufficient and closed to international trade. Montchrétien proposed an “economic nationalism” connecting politics and the economy, in a perspective that would be called geo-economic, pitting nationalism against globalization to avoid the failure in international trade competition that could threaten the political survival and independence of the country’s national interests. This paper explores the analytical frameworks of Montchrétien’s autarkic model, which constitutes an exception in the 17th century literature, which is focused on the idea of commercial supremacy and the gains of trade in a context of international competition.
B11|Problems of Management by Balanced Long-Term Economic Development through Physical Economy|The purpose of the research is to substantiate physical and economic basis for economic development management. This refers to necessity to base management theory and practice on combination of classical and the latest economic and management provisions developed by devotees of the European science of the XVIII-XXI century with improvements made by Ukrainian scientists such as S.A. Podolinskyi, V.I. Vernadskyi and M.D. Rudenko. It discloses physical and economic basis for economic development management. Attention is paid to economic balance issues and analyses formulas, which should be taken as a basis to build complete model of economic balance that by its ontology is based on fundamental energy conservation and conversion law. It presents the balance summation of the annual yield and distribution of cereal crop in the conditions of extended reproduction, common reproduction and in the conditions of formation of distortion of public reproduction. It was proven that scientific heritage of Ukrainian thinkers enables to define edges of economic development management on a physical economy basis.

B11|The Modern Enterprise - Successor of Business Organization Forms in Ancient Rome and Medieval Europe|"In recent years, researchers and practitioners are increasingly interested in the role and influence of the forms of business organization on the economy and society. Interpretations of the role of companies in the modern period, ranging from enthusiastic support (as the most important invention of capitalism, an explanation of the Western civilization’s expansion) to moderate and often critical positions, where the company is seen as a solution, not necessarily optimal, to market imperfections. On the other hand, we often ponder upon the explanation of political, administrative and infrastructural success of ancient Rome: the state or the enterprise (the private initiative)? Closer to our time, we rediscover with amazement that the ""dark"" Middle Ages are not at all dark and lacking in progress, at least in terms of capitalist organization and logic. The development of trade in the two poles of medieval Europe (the Mediterranean and the Balto-Scandinavian area), of industry and trade in the North-Western quadrant (Flanders and neighbouring regions), was concurrent with the improvement of organizational forms of business, with the diversity and flexibility of entrepreneurial or even corporate frameworks. Of course, the study of historical sources (ancient or medieval) cannot provide direct answers or solutions to the questions of modern society, because the challenges of today are rather different to those of the past. On the other hand, understanding history can help companies to build a more complete and a wiser enterprise functionality and role in the modern society, to reformulate the questions and to find new solutions. Our paper, with a clear juridical perspective on economic history, focuses on the organization of firms in ancient Rome and medieval Europe, tries to provide examples, useful interpretations and diverse solutions to the problems of contemporary society and economy."
B11|Das Turgot Problem. The method of Economics|This paper examines A.R.J. Turgot’s explanation of the scope and method of economic science. We begin by highlighting two contradictory economic methodologies in Turgot’s writings according to the literature: one in his text on progress and another in his papers on concrete economic matters. An initial hypothesis in this paper holds that this ‘contradiction’ does not exist. To do so, we shall use his texts on scientific methodology, history of science and epistemology, mainly written during the decade of the fifties. The argument is that his taxonomy of sciences explains that the different methodologies observed by the literature, depending on the discipline, are the forms that the unit of science can take in each stage of the progress of the human spirit. A corollary to this hypothesis is that Turgot’s multi-disciplinary works describe a scene of the birth of economic science that is very removed from the political arena. Both debates on types of knowledge, the independence of disciplines, the specialized language and the association of authors are better explained from the sociology of science than from the history of political thought.
B11|New Wine in Old Flasks: the Just Price and Price-Controls in Jewish Law|The halakhah (Jewish law) includes legislation aiming at might be called “social justice.” These halakhot (pl.) include the laws of ona'ah and hafka'at she'arim / hayyei nefesh – roughly analogous to the famous Medieval “just price” laws – as well as legal restrictions on middlemen and speculators. In the light of modern economics, these Jewish laws, like all attempts at price-fixing, are shown to be self-defeating; the means conflict with the ends sought. The conflict between religion and science is not limited to cosmology and biology, but may include economics as well. It is proposed that the halakhah be modified in such a way as to preserve – as much as possible – the integrity of both the halakhah and economic science alike; when an ethical system makes certain scientific presuppositions, it is sometimes possible to preserve the ethical system by disentangling it from its non-essential scientific presuppositions.
B11|Ordenación de la actividad económica, ley natural y justicia en Aristóteles y en Santo Tomás<BR>[Ordination of economic activity, natural law and justice in Aristotle and Saint Thomas]|In Aristotle’s thought, economic activity refers to a kind or praxis consisting of allocating human and material means comprising the oikos –the domestic community- to fulfill its natural ends: ensure both life and means of life. By means of natural chrematistics -acquisitive art- families acquire the necessary means for that, coming from production and exchange. Families group together in the political community (polis) whose end is well living, according virtue, outstanding justice as the “perfect virtue”. For its part, the Christian ethos informs this complete system (polis, oikos and chrematistics) ordering towards its ultimate purpose (beatitudo) every human act, internal and external. In St. Thomas view, eternal law constitutes the order of Creation that man can freely accept. This law harmonizes necessity of irrational beings, loving God’s action (divine law), natural law, and the contingency of “human things” that include economy. Trading activity is licit if it is at oikos or polis disposal and according how is exercised, by following commutative justice. Familiar, political and religious man’s nature establishes what the natural-necessary consists of, embracing, apart from body goods, others goods derived from considering social status and the life chosen (civil, religious, active or contemplative). Economic activity based on this anthropological root has a specific place as a part of an ordered natural-legal totality that provides economy with a meaning and a sufficient moral guidance.
B11|A közös ős nyomában: modern nyugati közgazdasági gondolkodás és az iszlám hagyomány<BR>[In the Quest for the Common Ancestor: Modern Western Economic Thought and the Islamic Tradition]|This scientific essay aims to examine the relationship between Western mainstream economics and its Islamic counterpart. It shows that the creation of Islamic economics is a new scientific program, and representatives of this discipline do not agree on its methodological foundations. Islamic economics does not make a distinction between normative and positive scientific attitudes and sets the influence of human behavior as one of its important goals. To prove that there is potential for future convergence the author argues that the „Schumpeterian gap” in history of economic thought does not exist. Analysing the thoughts of Ibn Khaldun, the paper sets the ground for a new paradigm by representing Khaldun as a common ancestor of Western and Islamic economics.
B11|The Emperor?s New Mind: On Constantine?s I Decision to Legalize Christianity|Emperor Constantine?s I Edict of Toleration in 313 CE ended the age of Christian persecution in the Roman Empire, and heralded the era where Christian monotheism started displacing the dominant Greco - Roman paganism. Secular power and religious authority aligned together to govern the empire, so monotheism in the form of Christianity and Greco - Roman polytheism became strategic complements, as the Emperor lowered the existing ?higher price? for Christian monotheism. Was Constantine?s I decision right? By moving the capital from Rome to Constantinople, Emperor Constantine I had to solve a coordination problem among rational players throughout the empire. Adoption of rituals within a society results in the reinforcement or the inculcation of shared beliefs and values. Following Schelling (1960), when persons are confronted with coordination problems often seem to do surprisingly well when focal points provide to them a point of convergence for individual expectations. I argue in the present paper that Constantine?s I decision to legalize Christianity was followed by a set of carefully chosen strategic decisions essential to promote social coordination, and with the aim to convert the city of Constantinople into a strong focal point of religious rituals. The building of the Church of St Eirene (?The Church of Hagia Eirene?) and other Christian churches, alongside the exploitation of the administrative organizational structure of the Christian church that existed within the empire, were all part of expansion - deterrence strategies against the old pagan world, and also the need to create a strong focal point of religious rituals away from the Holy Land.
B11|Islamic conscious capitalism: a ‘Third Way’ in light of classical scripture|"The economic paradigm and framework advocated for in Islam is one that entails a unique combination of various socio–economic philosophies. This article advances the notion that Islam promotes a capitalistic economic model wrapped in its own garment of understanding—fashioned with threads of equity and stitched in patterns of benevolence and justice. This article examines the Islamic theological framework relating to the profit incentive and its spiritually–conscious methodology of capital procurement. The Qur’an contains around 370 references in regard to commerce, from which much of Islamic law relating to lending, banking and trading originates (Heck in Muhammad and the Arab roots of capitalism (Studien zur Geschichte und Kultur des Islamichen Orients)—Band 18. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, p 5, 85, 2006 ). This article intends to explore the potential that these teachings have for an Islamic ‘Third Way’ (i.e. an Islamic contribution to economic philosophy and discourse that is in-between of, or an alternative to, both the purely individualistic primary concerns on prices, profits, and private property inherent in ""pure"" capitalism, and the purely communal command economics of communism, which often negates or discourages the promotion of self-interests). Part I of this paper intends to introduce the reader to the various sources of Islamic ‘law’ and its scope. In doing so, the philosophical nature and objectives of the Shariah will become evident, through the exploration of specific theological economic teachings. Part II intends to study Islam’s theological attitude toward entrepreneurship and the profit incentive, as well as the concept of the potential for salvation through ethical profits. Part III explores, in light of classical Islamic scripture, the various prohibitions within the Islamic concept of the economy. In doing so, the paper shall explore how values and theories found in classical Islamic scripture have found contemporary application within the growing modern Islamic finance industry, for example, through Shariah ‘screens’ applied on market indicies, such as the Dow Jones Islamic Market Index. Part III shall also explore Islamic edicts with regards to business practices, as well as environmental ethics. In doing so, Part IV concludes that there can indeed be such an Islamic ‘Third Way’, drawn along similar shared values found amongst other world religions.

(1) Anthony Brewer (1992) claimed to find a fatal flaw in Cantillonâ€™s theory of value. The present author (1993) demurred. That objection has not been taken up (or dismissed) in subsequent discussion of Cantillonâ€™s work. We therefore have unfinished business. (2) A second issue has emerged. Modern â€œAustrianâ€ commentators (who express great admiration for Cantillon) are promoting a seriously erroneous misinterpretation of his theory of value. We think it is time both to put forward, against Brewerâ€™s allegation, a stronger defence of Cantillonâ€™s theory, and also to make the point that Cantillonâ€™s conception is fundamentally different from how (some) â€œAustrianâ€ admirers apparently see it.
B11|Economic forms, state socio-economic policy and socioeconomic ideas of Bulgarian society in the context of the orthodox Christianity (9th - first half of the 19th century)|The paper outlines some of the main characteristic features of Bulgarian social andeconomic thought during the period, dominated by the norms of OrthodoxChristianity. In the context of this thinking of the period before the appearance ofspecialized economic knowledge, several key elements can be identified, such asfirst, the strong role of the state, relied upon to help solving economic and socialproblems, which is praised and receives advice from intellectuals, and second, theethical approach, expressed in the desire to help the poor and to reject profits,considered as immoral (theft, usury, etc. in.), to negate the extremes of poverty, butalso of wealth.
B11|International Regulatory Documents With Special Regime Used By Romanian Principalities In Relations With The Ottoman And The Russian Empire|Although the existence of some regulating documents, called capitulations, concerning the relations on various plans, between the Romanian Country, Moldavia and the Ottoman Empire was known, the first one of these diplomatic documents, that have been operational over time, was discovered only in 1974. It was an act that had been granted to Mihnea Turkished, in the year 1585. This important discovery has been completed, with others that had the same purpose. In fact, they were some diplomatic documents, with the role of Treaty, which has regulated quite explicitly, the status of the two Romanian principalities, in relations with the suzerain power. The most important fact of their contents was the recognition of the internal autonomy of principalities and a certain degree of freedom, in relations outside the borders. The price was that Romanian countries paid was ,however, to never become hostile to Ottoman interests, integrating in the Ottoman foreign policy and paying an annual tribute.
B11|The issue of value in economic thought — Part 1: the evolution of views from the 5th century BC to the mid-19th century|This paper is devoted to the evolution of views on the category of value, which for more than two thousand years has been recognized as one of the most important economic concepts. It appeared in the literature thanks to Herodotus in the 5th century BC. Aristotle distinguished use value and exchange value, and demanded the exchange of goods of equal value. St. Thomas Aquinas argued that prices of traded commodities should be of equal value, and that this value is determined by the amount of labour, production costs, needs and income of buyers, as well as the amount of goods offered for sale. W. Petty found that the amount of labour determines the value of goods. The views of the aforementioned thinkers were developed by J. Locke, J. Steuart Denham and R. Cantillon, the last of whom pointed out that market prices oscillate around the proper value of affected goods. For A.R.J. de Turgot, the purchasing power and needs determine the value set by contractors. However, G.F. Le Trosne acknowledged that proper value is determined by use value, production costs and the abundance of things. These views on the objectively existing value of exchanged products were taken over and developed by A. Smith and D. Ricardo, who made value the foundation of the scientific system of economics. This role of the theory of value in economics was not undermined even by the critics of the classical school, including K. Marx, A.H. Müller, and H.Ch. Carey, although for K. Marx, as for D. Ricardo, the theory of value was an element that integrates the whole theoretical system. In turn, the precursors of the subjective-marginal movement, among others, F. Galiani, E.B. de Condillac, A.A. Cournot, and J.M. Hoene-Wronski made the value of goods dependent on the subjective feelings of individuals satisfying their needs or performing work.
B11|Rethinking of Coase Theorem: Externalities and Uncertainty|A behavior of economic agents in many respects depends on taking into account those conditions that have appeared around them. Traditionally, to such conditions, researchers have referred the uncertainty and factors of the institutional control, often projected on a value of the transaction costs. Studies in stimulants for any form of the agents’ behavior lead us to an analysis of the Coase theorem, which is expected to explain a number of similar regularities. However, ambiguous approaches to the theorem interpretation generate conflicts in a perception and identification of externalities. It is a solution to this challenge, which is a focus of this research. In a critical review of works by Coase and his followers, the theorem statement has been made clearer; we have also put forward a hypothesis on an origin of the externalities and introduced additional criteria to identify them. The paper has given a scientific rationale for an author’s assumption that the utility of impure goods depends on the vector of the externalities, which ultimately determines the stratification in a field of the externalities (positive or negative).
B11|The economics of peace and war in the Chinese military classics|While some classics of Chinese military and strategic thought, like Sun Tzu’s The Art of War, are well-studied by researchers and business professionals, lesser-known works in China’s military canon have been neglected. This article surveys seven major ancient Chinese texts and discusses the contribution of each to the political economy of peace and war. As a rule, the writings stress the importance of nonviolent conflict resolution and advocate the avoidance of war whenever possible. In addition, they also consider the role of the state in war-making, especially its methods of war finance and attempts to encourage or discourage economic activity. They generally warn the state to limit its expenditure and impositions on the population so as to encourage the production of resources for use in military campaigns, should they become necessary.
B11|Copernicus and the Quantity Theory of Money|"This paper examines Nicholas Copernicus’ monetary thinking to ascertain whether he is an early expositor of the quantity theory of money. The paper reviews the historical setting of the 1500s, considers the history of economic thought that pertains to the quantity theory of money, and considers prior translations and interpretations of Copernicus’ manuscript ""On the Minting of Money"" with our own translation. The paper finds that Copernicus’ monetary thinking is noteworthy for associating monetary policy instability with various economic effects, but he is not a quantity theorist or an advocate of policy positions associated with quantity theorists."

Sein Begriff der „politischen Arithmetik“ konnte sich allerdings gegen den vom europäischen Kontinent stammenden Begriff „Statistik“ – auch im britischen Mutterland Petty’s – nicht durchsetzen.

B11|Rituals and Focal Points in Byzantium under the Emperor Justinian I|Adoption of rituals within a society results in the reinforcement or the inculcation of shared beliefs and values. Following Schelling (1960), when persons are confronted with coordination problems often seem to do surprisingly well when focal points provide to them a point of convergence for individual expectations. I argue in the present paper that Emperor Justinian I (482 CE - 565 CE) in Byzantium followed a set of carefully chosen strategic decisions essential to promote social coordination, and with the aim to convert the city of Constantinople into a strong focal point of religious rituals. Emperor Justinian I in the spirit taken initially by the founder of the City of Constantinople Emperor Constantine?s I (272 CE - 337 CE), and more or less by all of Justinian I predecessors, had to solve a coordination problem among rational players throughout the empire. The rebuilding of the third Church of St Sophia (?Hagia Sophia?) in 562 CE following the Nika revolt in 532 CE, the protection of the property rights of the Christian church including its clergy and its monasteries, alongside the exploitation of the administrative organizational structure of the Christian church that existed within the empire, and the emperor?s stance that unity of faith is a precondition for the unity of the empire, created a strong focal point of religious rituals away from the Holy Land.
B11|Revisiting Cantillon's admirable theory of distribution and value - a misinterpretation corrected|This paper returns to an issue I discussed in a review article published some twenty years ago** The subject under discussion was Anthony BrewerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1992 study*** Richard Cantillon: Pioneer of Economic Theory. That review provided a vehicle for consideration of CantillonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theory of value, particularly for questioning BrewerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rejection of CantillonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s analysis, on the ground that he (Brewer) understood it to propose a dead-end Ã¢â‚¬Å“land theory of valueÃ¢â‚¬Â which attempted to account for equilibrium relative values in terms of quantities of Ã¢â‚¬Å“land embodiedÃ¢â‚¬Â. In the present paper a fuller critique of that land-embodied interpretation of CantillonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s value theory is presented. From what might be described as a Sraffian perspective, we Ã¢â‚¬â€œ contrary to Brewer - interpret Cantillon as offering a perceptive and valid analysis of the operation of the market mechanism in the case of a surplus producing system in which distribution is determined - exogenously to the price system - by social factors of property ownership and economic power. We suggest that, given CantillonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s view (in a pre-industrial context) of land as a countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s principal economic resource, he may be said to have told a general story associating equilibrium commodity prices (Ã¢â‚¬Å“intrinsic valuesÃ¢â‚¬Â) with the quantity and quality of land employed in production. Appreciating that an approach in terms simply of physical quantities of land could not serve to explain relative values under the complexity of real world conditions, he expressed his understanding in the form of a Ã¢â‚¬Å“cost of production theoryÃ¢â‚¬Â explaining intrinsic values as represented by the costs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ comprised of wages and rents measured in money Ã¢â‚¬â€œ incurred by entrepreneurs for the use of heterogeneous inputs of land and labour. Labour costs can be translated into land costs via CantillonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“ParÃ¢â‚¬Â. These production costs reflect both the use of resources and the balance of economic power within society. Thus, on the subject of Ã¢â‚¬Å“intrinsic valueÃ¢â‚¬Â we read Cantillon as following not a crude land-embodied treatment, but instead a cost of production approach, an approach which would be further developed by the Classics and Marx as appropriate to later economic and social conditions.
B11|Adam Smith and the Marquis de Condorcet. Did they really meet?|This article focuses on the alleged direct acquaintanceship between Condorcet and Adam Smith. Mistaken information about this issue was repeated many times in the literature of the late 1800s and 1900s. It is presumed that they met in France, during Smith’s journey there, chez Sophie de Grouchy. I will attempt to show that the meeting between the two authors was not in fact arranged by Sophie de Grouchy, Condorcet’s wife, even though she was very interested in Smithian theories, especially about the category of “sympathy”, as confirmed by her French translation of the Theory of Moral Sentiments. My purpose is to demonstrate that Madame de Condorcet did never meet Smith and, as a result, she could not have introduced Condorcet to Smith. A greater degree of probability can be attributed to the version that indicates Turgot as the intermediary between Condorcet and Smith. In my opinion, not even this hypothesis is totally convincing, because neither Smith nor Condorcet ever talk about their meeting. Moreover, there is no evidence of correspondence between them.
B11|Some considerations on the influence of economic liberalism in the May Revolution of 1810 in Buenos Aires, Argentina|The revolutionary process of May 1810 in Buenos Aires, capital of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, occurred within the context of the French Revolution, the United States’ struggle for independence and various changes in the European countries’ economies. Liberal ideas played an essential role, and the opinions of Belgrano, Vieytes and Moreno, among others, are the key to understanding the economic perspectives of the revolutionary men. Late mercantilists, physiocrats and classical economists marked these men’s economic thought. The purpose of this paper is to review these intellectual influences on the leaders of the May Revolution.
B11|Ökonomie und Moral: Eine kurze Theoriegeschichte|Die ökonomische Theorie hat mit Moral wenig oder gar nichts zu tun. In den gängigen Lehrbüchern der Mikroökonomie findet sich in den Stichwortverzeichnissen kein Eintrag zu Moral oder Ethik. Die Studierenden lernen über die Wirtschaft nachzudenken, aber sie lernen dabei nicht, systematisch über ethische Fragen zu reflektieren. Nach der neoklassischen Lehre, wie sie in den Lehrbüchern präsentiert wird, weist wirtschaftliches Handeln nicht grundsätzlich moralische Aspekte auf. Ein solcher Tatbestand ist erstaunlich. Er widerspricht (phänomenologisch) unseren ökonomischen Alltagserfahrungen und (theoriegeschichtlich) einer jahrhundertelangen Tradition, die vor gut zwei Jahrhunderten schrittweise aufgegeben und im 20. Jahrhundert durch dezidiert morallose Standpunkte ersetzt worden ist.
B11|Lex mercatoria|Lex mercatoria or Law Merchant (‘LM’) is said to be the self-made law of international commerce. According to its proponents, LM is an autonomous legal order that not only supplements state commercial law, but works as a substitute for it. The ‘ancient’ LM, which accompanied the commercial revolution in late medieval Europe, is taken as a blueprint for ‘new’ LM, a transnational law that develops in international commercial arbitration to govern modern global commerce. According to its opponents, ancient LM as a uniform customary law of Europe never existed. Rather it was dreamed-up in order to support the neo-liberal agenda of new LM. This paper investigates the historical and empirical foundations of these claims in the three dimensions of transnational dispute resolution, norm making, and enforcement. It is concluded that truly autonomous transnational legal regimes are industry-specific exceptions, where socio-economic sanctions are formally organized. Transnational commercial law in general is characterised by a hybrid mode of governance, which combines institutions of private (norms, arbitration, and social sanctions) and public (laws, courts, and enforcement) origin. However, the latter are disembedded from their domestic context to a considerable extent.
B11|La question de l'interdiction de l'intérêt dans l'histoire européenne. Un essai d'analyse institutionnelle|The purpose of this paper is to investigate the reasons why interest loan was prohibited or strictly regulated in European History, by all three monotheisms as well as by the Aristotelian tradition, and the Roman, Canonical and Civil medieval laws. The hypothesis, which is the basis of this argument, is that any market economy developed to a certain degree necessarily involves money lending and therefore a price for money. Those who attempted to prohibit it could not have ignored such an obvious fact. Consequently it is believed that prohibiting interest loan is an issue, which goes well beyond the concern with interest itself. And we assume that the understanding of such a phenomenon requires some institutional analysis. Classification JEL : B11, B15, K12, Z12
B11|The political economy of Byzantium: transaction costs and the decentralisation of the Byzantine Empire in the twelfth century|This thesis aims to contribute to an explanation of how the development of political institutions is influenced by the costs of information and exchange across society in a pre-modern context. The Byzantine Empire in the twelfth century presents an apparent paradox of an expanding economy alongside a weakening central state. Application of a dynamic transaction-cost framework can illustrate how political and economic decentralisation can rationally occur as non-state actors begin to gain a comparative transaction-cost advantage over the state. Geopolitical and economic developments of the late-eleventh and twelfth century empowered non-state provincial interests in the Byzantine Empire to the detriment of the central state apparatus, including the imperial bureaucracy. Economic growth, an increasingly fluid provincial political environment, and the decline of the imperial navy simultaneously raised the transaction costs of the state and lowered the transaction costs of local interests. This shift prompted the decentralisation of power that ultimately contributed to the destruction of the Byzantine state in 1204. The state faced increasing relative costs of information acquisition, security provision, and tax collection as provincial transaction costs declined and state networks were allowed to degrade. Decentralisation of political and economic power became first possible, then practical, and finally unavoidable in a process that fatally undermined the cohesion of the empire. This thesis uses a transaction cost framework to provide an economically informed explanation of political decline that complements the traditional politically focused narrative and begins to address the contradiction apparent in a state ruling over increasingly prosperous territory, yet proving so fragile by the closing years of the twelfth century.
B11|The Political Economy of the Poor: The Rise and Fall of the Workhouse System|The aim of this article is to describe the rise and fall of the workhouse system in connection with the developments that took place in economic thought, in the transition from Mercantilism to pre-classical and classical tradition. By examining the economic arguments emerging from the debate around the workhouse system, we shall focus on how ideas concerning wages, efficiency, labour market, workers' mobility, unemployment and human nature of the poor evolved throughout the period under scrutiny, trying to evaluate to what extent these views influenced the shaping of a new policy approach aimed at improving the effectiveness of the delivery of poor relief.
B11|Modern Social Science Concepts, Proportionate Reciprocity, Modesty, and Democracy|Proportionate Reciprocity, Modesty, and Democracy, are the key concepts in Aristotle’s economics of exchange. The following correspondence of these concepts with modern social science may be contemplated: (a) Ideally, reciprocal justice in bilateral bargaining to minimize expenditure given utility levels results in Pareto-efficient, envy-free, equitable outcomes. (b) Practically, bargaining under the threat or actual recontracting may act as a surrogate of reciprocal justice, leading to an N-person contract topology. (c) But, recontracting is subject to practical limitations too, in which case near-reciprocal justice/general equilibrium outcomes may be fostered if, as a surrogate of recontracting, modesty in interaction is exhibited in an evolutionarily-stable-strategy fashion. (d) That is, incomplete recontracting amounts to asymmetric agent-type information, which in turn lays the ground for injustices; the same lack of information prevents rectificatory justice from being efficient and hence, modesty can be efficient only if it operates as a social norm and hence, only in a modest polity, which can be no other than democracy.

B11|An Analysis of J.R. Commons’s Changing Views on the Role of Sovereignty in the Political Economy|This article distills the economic and current significance contained in the political economy of J.R. Commons. It compares descriptions of his three main works that discuss “sovereignty”: A Sociological View of Sovereignty (SVS), Legal Foundations of Capitalism (LFC), and Institutional Economics (IE). Through this comparison, we find that the role of sovereignty in his theory changed dramatically. First, in the period from SVS (1899–1900) to LFC (1924), the theory of sovereignty changes significantly from the standpoint of natural rights, which imply permanence of privileged customs, to “pragmatic philosophy” of the courts, in which laws are relevant to customs at certain times and places. Second, from the manuscripts of IE (1927–1928), sovereignty is defined as comprising part principles, which relate to each other and make up the whole principle, willingness. In other words, Commons views sovereignty as one perspective, which in turn has a high capability of explaining the socioeconomic system. Additional descriptions of IE (1934) derived from its original manuscripts repeatedly emphasize the “power” of economic concerns that are equal to or exceed the power of the state, as well as the importance of the “function” of sovereignty in pragmatic investigations of economic disputes. We distill the economic and current significance of IE. First, the value theory that constructs values institutionally and collectively starts from an analysis of sovereignty and joint evaluations. Second, sovereignty cannot be separated from an analysis of economic transactions. Third, this paper concretely shows elements of a “deliberate space” in which sovereignty and economic interests act in concert. J.R. Commons’s IE sets out specific knowledge on the interface between sovereignty and economic interests, and serves as a useful tool in reconsidering the organ of sovereignty.
B11|Monetary Instability, Lack of Integration and the Curse of a Commodity Money Standard. The German Lands, c.1400–1900 A. D|Currency debasement, defined as a loss of precious metal content (intrinsic value) of the circulating penny currencies over time, was a common feature in the monetary history of Europe, c. 1400–1900. Over the centuries the loss rate was sustained; between 1400 and 1900 A. D. the (south) German penny currencies lost close to 90 per cent of their intrinsic value. As prior to the twentieth century all circulating means of exchange derived their purchasing power from the value of the precious metal contained in them these debasements reflect considerable fluctuations in these coins’ exchange value. Whilst some of the possible origins of this have been addressed by previous research, comprehensive models are missing, and the social and economic consequences of this phenomenon have only seldom been studied. The present paper contributes to the debate, using long-run data on the circulating small change currencies in the German lands, c.1400–1900. After an introduction (I.) the second section puts the present case study into an international, historical and conceptual context (II.). A third section provides a brief sketch of German monetary history since the Middle Ages with special regard to penny currency debasement (III.). A fourth section analyses some of the reasons for this, highlighting further areas and directions of research which previous models have missed (IV.). A fifth section studies the social and economic costs of monetary fragmentation and coin debasement (V.). A sixth section concludes (VI.).
B11|La emblemática y el pensamiento económico español de finales del siglo XVI y principios del XVII/The Emblematic and Spanish Economic Thought of the Late Sixteenth and Early Seventeenth|En 1531 el jurista italiano Andrea Alciato (1492-1550) publicó la obra Emblematum liber que tuvo una gran influencia en toda la Europa de la Edad Moderna. El trabajo de Alciato estaba compuesto por una antología de textos poéticos que estaban ilustrados y que a su vez contenían cada uno de ellos un título o lema. Así, por medio de la ilustración y el lema se pretendía facilitar la comprensión o interpretación del texto por parte del lector. Esta obra es considerada el punto de partida de la emblemática que más tarde dio lugar al género literario de la emblemática. La obra de Alciato animó o a muchos autores a seguir el camino de los emblemas. La correspondencia entre el título -inscriptio-, la imagen -pictura-, con un texto explicativo -subscriptio o epigrama- dio lugar a un género consolidado que se extendió por Europa. Pues bien el objetivo de este trabajo es presentar la influencia que la emblemática tuvo en el pensamiento económico español de finales del siglo XVI y principios del XVII, en concreto en las obras de Cristóbal Pérez de Herrera (1556-1620) y Diego Saavedra Fajardo (1584-1648). In 1531 the Italian jurist Andrea Alciato (1492-1550) published Emblematum liber, a work that had a great influence on Europe. Alciato's work consisted of an anthology of poems that were illustrated, each of which had a title or theme. The purpose of the illustration and the title was intended to facilitate the understanding and interpretation of the text by the reader. Emblematum liber is considered the starting point of the emblematic which later gave rise to the emblematic literary genre. Alciato's work encouraged many authors to follow the path of the emblems. The correspondence between the title (inscription), image (pictura), and explanatory text (subscriptio or epigrama) gave rise to a consolidated gender that spread rapidly throughout Europe. The purpose of this paper is to present the influence that emblematic had on Spanish economic thought of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, in particular on the works of Cristóbal Pérez de Herrera (1556-1620) and Diego Saavedra Fajardo (1584-1648).
B11|Baltasar Gracián: El concepto de interés propio como guía de la acción humana/Baltasar Gracián: The Concept of Self- Interest as a Motive for Human Action|La obra de Baltasar Gracián, uno de grandes autores del siglo de oro español, ha interesado a filólogos, a filósofos morales y a teóricos políticos pero ha suscitado escasa atención a los economistas. Este papel indaga en la obra de este gran autor de barroco para resaltar el análisis de la naturaleza humana que se extrae de su obra, una noción de hombre muy similar a la de otros coetáneos españoles y que posee muchos de los atributos del homo oeconomicus, esa abstracción del hombre que iban a utilizar más tarde los economistas. The work of Baltasar Gracián, one of the great writers of the Spanish Golden Age, has been interesting for philolo¬gists, moral philosophers and political theorists but it has hardly been relevant for economists. This paper explores the writings of this great author of the baroque period in order to emphasize the analysis of human nature derived from his work. Gracián suggested a very similar notion to that used by other Spanish contemporaries: one which possessed a great number of the qualities of the homo oeconomicus, an abstract conception of the human being which most of the economists will subsequently embrace.
B11|The Classical-Keynesian Paradigm: Policy Debate in Contemporary Era|For almost a century, the famous C-K paradigm (formally known as Classics – Keynesian Paradigm) has been the apex of economic debate and research. The paradigm represents two schools of thoughts which, somehow, have prevailed till now. Economists who believe in either of the two schools have been at loggerheads, and they still are, to prove one theory better than the other. Numerous economic scholars of present era believe that with the changes that have occurred in the economic system, the world is turning back to classical model. But, there are others who believe that Keynes theory is still alive and valid. In this paper, we have tried to draw a brief comparison that highlights the major differences between the two theories with specific reference to the economic, political and social environment prevailing at time when these theories were generated. Paper also discusses the relevance of unending policy debate about these theories in the current era with special emphasis on policy implications with a view to draw pertinent lessons for the present and future.

The modern-day terminology used in connection with Aristotle sounds bizarre, but by this is meant that his thinking and answers on issues preoccupying social science for centuries, do not differ much from modern-day approaches to the same issues.
B11|Scarcity, self-interest and maximization from Islamic angle|This paper clarifies some misinterpretations of three foundational concepts in mainstream economics from Islamic viewpoint. These are scarcity of resources, pursuit of self-interest and maximizing behavior of economic agents. It argues that stocks of resources that God has provided are inexhaustible. But important is the availability of resources out of stocks to mankind. Availability is a function of human effort and the state of knowledge about resources over time and space. In that sense resources are scarce in relation to multiplicity of human wants for Islamic economics as well. Self-interest must be distinguished from selfishness. The motive operates on both ends of human existence: mundane and spiritual. Its pursuit does not preclude altruism from human life. Counter interests keep balance in society and promote civility. Islam recognizes the motive as valid. Maximization relates to quantifiable ex ante variables. Uncertainty of future outcomes of actions makes maximization a heuristic but useful analytical tool. The concept is value neutral. What is maximized, how and to what end alone give rise to moral issues. Modified in the light of Shari’ah requirements the three concepts can provide a firmer definition for Islamic economics centered on the notion of falah.
B11|Economía política de la modernidad<BR>[Political economics of modernity]|This article consists of three parts. The first response to the idea of ​​keeping TOCQUEVILLE own arguments in Old Regime and the Revolution, without reproducing copiously text line by line. This component is the main concerns and conflicting judgments about the revolution, the decisive role that the author gives to religion and how Europe was in ruins. Tocqueville is particularly interested in showing the exacting nature of feudal rights especially in France. Administrative centralization is an institution par excellence of the Old Regime and the same process. In the second part devoted several sessions to understand the reasons TOCQUEVILLE claims to show the history of property rights and land tenure. In the third session we show the influence of the Revolution and encyclopedic deviations could have brought the author. The reformist spirit of the French during the period from the fourteenth to the nineteenth centuries. Tocqueville scholars encounter numerous observations annotations that can supplement your readings.
B11|Tax Rate and its Determinations: An Opinion from Ibn Khaldun|Tax is an alternative method for a country to obtain revenue for spending. But the issue arises when there are differences of opinion on the tax rate. Economists argue that to obtain higher tax revenue, it is necessary to lower the tax rate. In this paper, an analysis of tax rates is conducted by looking at the findings of Ibn Khaldun in his book Muqaddimah. This study also examines other hypotheses related to taxation. The findings show that the optimal rate of taxation can be determined.
B11|Between Free Market and State Capitalism: How Islamic Economics System Shape the Future Global Economy?|Free market economy is proposed to deliver on the promises of improving the standards of living of most citizens. However, the economic crisis that happen repeatedly failed to produce what was promised. Then, state capitalism has to step in. The state capitalism also fails in the sense that the free market economy with rules/policy in favour of rich countries or state capitalism provide more people worst-off than benefits. The question arises on how the Islamic economic system could shape the free markets and the future of the global economy. Therefore, our aim in this paper is to find out the answer(s) on how Islamic economics system shape the future global economy could. Our analysis shows that Islam has its own economic system. The free market could be developed by taking the free market of Rasulullah (saw) and free market in holding wealth. The government policy directed towards no interest and creating a welfare system is welcome.
B11|Formation et phylogénie des concepts de « marché » dans l’économie politique au xviiie siècle|Comment les économistes du xviiie siècle ont-ils intégré le mot « marché » dans leurs énoncés ? Alors qu’il ne relève que des pratiques courantes jusqu’au début du xviiie siècle, le marché devient par la suite un concept économique dans les énoncés de plusieurs auteurs. Pour comprendre ce changement, une phylogénie des concepts du marché est nécessaire, car les études limitées à un ou deux auteurs ne sont pas en mesure d’en suivre le processus de formation, nécessairement polygénique. À travers les dictionnaires, les usages courants du marché laissent apparaître deux conceptions (sérielle et centrée), qui peuvent être reliées à deux formes savantes du marché : une forme simple (Cantillon, Turgot et Morellet) et une forme développée (Smith et Condillac). Ces liens doivent être combinés avec les conceptions de la valeur antérieures, afin de proposer un maillage phylogénique non linéaire. Il permet de conclure que les concepts métaphysiques relatifs à la providence n’ont pas participé au processus de formation des concepts savants du marché.
B11|The just price doctrine and contemporary contract law: some introductory remarks|This paper discusses the possibility of applying the insights provided by the doctrine of the just price to the current debate about contractual justice. After summarizing the just price doctrine and addressing the objections traditionally raised against it, the paper identifies the role that just price theory could play in contemporary contract law and suggests a general standard of proportionality in exchange as a constraint on the full application of freedom of contract.
B11|La esclavitud y la trata de negros en el pensamiento económico español, siglos XVI al XVIII|Entre el siglo XVI y el XVIII la esclavitud fue adquiriendo en el Imperio español una indudable importancia económica, tanto por el creciente peso de la mano de obra esclava en el Nuevo Mundo, como por la relevancia política, económica y administrativa de los sucesivos asientos. Sin embargo, la atención prestada a las cuestiones de la esclavitud y la trata en la literatura económica española fue decreciendo: éstas pasaron de tener un lugar en los textos escolásticos de los siglos XVI y principios del XVII, a convertirse en algo completamente marginal para los economistas ilustrados del Dieciocho. El propósito de este artículo es poner de manifiesto esta paradoja a través del análisis de los escasos textos de los teólogos escolásticos, arbitristas y economistas de la Ilustración que abordaron la esclavitud y la trata. La cuestión reviste interés, pues fueron tres centurias en las que los debates económicos en el ámbito del pensamiento español tuvieron un buen nivel, que se reflejó en la traducción a otras lenguas europeas de numerosas obras económicas españolas.
B11|Quand le luxe devient une question économique : retour sur la querelle du luxe du 18e siècle|Condemnation or glorification of luxury is a classic and recurrent question in the history of political ideas. Today, it continues to generate a set of conflicting emotions. In order to understand this debate, we chose to immerse ourselves in the history of economic thought, and, more specifically, in the quarrel of luxury that occurred during the Enlightenment. If luxury is immoral, it is not necessarily obnoxious, it participates in the circulation of wealth, maintains a certain industry and stimulates trade. The different positions of philosophers (Mandeville, Condillac, Montesquieu, Hume, Rousseau) and economists (Melon, Quesnay, Smith, Say) seem to reflect more a change in the systems of values (the interest and the useful versus the moral) than a real challenge of luxury consumption.

B11|Luxe, innovations et crise : les enseignements des économistes classiques|The aim of this article is to demonstrate that the Classical economists’ analysis can serve as a theoretical framework to explain the economic role of luxury. In the 18th century this school of thought was based on the political implications of trade and luxury, conceived as a kind of social innovation explaining the wealth of nations. During the first half of the 19th century, the Classical economic approach was formed around the links between luxury, technical innovation and economic crisis. JEL Codes: B11, B12, O30
B11|L'interdiction du prêt à intérêt : principes et actualité|These days, even countries sometimes have difficulties repaying just the interests generated by the debt. But, strangely, the medieval doctrine banned the charging of a profit on the lending of money. This theory advocated only the benefit generated from the capital invested should be shared between the lender and the borrower ex post according to an agreement drawn up ex ante. This article analyses the contribution of this theory and its underlying concepts. Part I presents the theories of rate regulation in the Ancient world. Part II analyses their developments in the Middle Ages under the influence of the canonists until the end of prohibition of usury in the 18th?century. The medieval approach is making a come back in France under a new form: the Islamic finance which outlaws interest and advocates the sharing of benefits. Part III examines the underlying doctrine of this form of financial intermediation to better understand its principles, differences with the scholastic theory and development paths.

B11|Beyond Thomas Mun: the economic ideas of Edward Coke, Francis Bacon and Lionel Cranfield|This paper proposes to approach the economic ideas which prevailed in England during the early 17th century by moving beyond the historical and analytical exegesis of the printed pamphlets of the time, and focusing instead on the intellectual perspectives brought to bear upon economic matters by three of the most prominent public figures of late Jacobean England: Lionel Cranfield, Francis Bacon, and Edward Coke. As civil servants, all three of them were directly involved in the formulation of public policies aimed at economic regulation. Bacon and Coke, however, approached this problem as part of a larger system of public policy whose purpose was to promote order and stability in the commonwealth at large. Cranfield, on the other hand, brought a mercantile perspective to bear on the matter, emphasizing the importance of a favorable balance of trade, and stressing the usefulness of quantitative data in the assessment of economic phenomena. It is concluded that while Tudor political and social philosophy still dominated the way in which the English crown dealt with problems of an economic nature, the new perspective introduced by Cranfield exerted a perceptible influence within official circles.
B11|Protection of competition in the contemporary global economy as a challenge for the competition theory|Although the phenomenon of competition is fundamental of the economic theory and policy, the scientists have not yet achieved the consensus concerning the kind of competition which should be protected. Contemporary researchers striving to find the answer to this question rely on their predecessors achievements and the recognition that all elements of the classical structure-conduct-performance paradigm are influencing each other. Thus, the current research on competition is conducted within the confines of the theory of economy and management and the protection of competition in the contemporary global economy constitutes a challenge for the competition theory in all three areas mentioned in the paradigm. Given the above, there are several issues of vital importance. Firstly, the development of MNs in the direction of diversified networks which are interconnected with different contractual and ownership multidimensional ties, secondly, the need to take into account the relations between the competitors on other geographical and product markets in the analysis of competition on the local market, and thirdly, the need to widen the traditional perception of the protection of competition to other areas, which have not been covered by antitrust policy so far.
B11|Inquiry into Lemercier de la Rivière’s entry into the circle of Quesnay|This paper proposes a new reading of the sources to release a new dating for entering Lemercier de la Rivière in intellectual circles of Quesnay and Mirabeau. In doing so, this Physiocrat generally accepted by commentators as a secondary author of the school led by Quesnay, appears as one of its founders.
B11|In the Shadow of François Quesnay: The Political Economy of Charles Richard de Butré|From 1759 to 1762, François Quesnay had systematically appealed to an obscure physiocrat, Charles Richard de Butré, when he had to make a numerical estimate or to do a nonelementary computation. In the present article, we use two important unpublished writings by Butré to discuss and assess the extent of his contribution to physiocratic theory. In these two works written at the end of 1766 and the beginning of 1767, Butré set himself to the task of deepening Quesnay’s political economy. Although he was, besides Quesnay, the only physiocrat who mastered the Tableau économique, he chose to develop his own analytical devices. In order to provide a more satisfactory presentation of the doctrine of the exclusive productivity of agriculture, Butré modified significantly the social classification adopted by Quesnay and all the other physiocrats. Finally, he imagined and drafted a theoretical system of public accounting that would measure and account for all kinds of economic activities, including those Quesnay had left out in his Tableau économique, such as external trade. We argue that the study of his work offers us an ideal vantage point to broaden our understanding of the nature and the history of Quesnay’s political economy.
B11|Economic cosmology and the evolutionary challenge|The intellectual histories of economics and evolutionary biology are closely intertwined because both subjects deal with living, complex, evolving systems. Because the subject matter is similar, contemporary evolutionary thought has much to offer to economics. In recent decades theoretical biology has progressed faster than economics in understanding phenomena like hierarchical processes, cooperative behavior, and selection processes in evolutionary change. This paper discusses three very old “cosmologies” in Western thought, how these play out in economic theory, and how evolutionary biology can help evaluate their validity and policy relevance. These cosmologies are: (1) “natural man” as a rational, self-sufficient, egotistical individual, (2) competition among individuals can lead to a well-functioning society, and (3) there exists an ideal optimal state of nature. These correspond to Colander et al. (2004) “holy trinity of orthodox economics”, rationality, greed, and equilibrium. It is argued below that current breakthroughs in evolutionary biology and neuroscience can help economics go beyond these simple cosmologies.
B11|New mercantilism: A perspective on how politics is shaping world metal supply|The major countries consuming metals tended historically to be also the major countries producing them. It was in their interest to promote mine development to provide low cost raw materials. Over the past fifty years, the share of global production accounted for by consuming countries has declined and producers and consumers of metals have been slowly moving into separate camps having distinct and differing interests. As a consequence of this, governments of producing countries have become more focused on how to maximise the benefit of metal extraction to their economies rather than on how to supply cheap raw materials; a tendency which has found expression in resource nationalism. Governments of consuming countries have in response become increasingly concerned about the implications of this tendency to their economic development and some countries, most notably China, have adopted robust policies to secure their supplies. Through their actions to influence capital flows within the mining industry and to force metals trade into channels which better serve their national interests (a process characterised here as ‘new mercantilism’), metal producing and metal consuming countries are reshaping global supply.
B11|Who is the Narrator of the Fable of the Individuality in Political Economy: Mandeville or Smith?|In this study, the historical roots of individuality will be examined. According to the view of economic individuality, pursuit of self-interest is the fundamental motivation for all of human beings. When we look into the eighteenth century, the main argument was whether the rise of the commercial society erosions the moral values or not. This argument was especially discussed by the philosophers of the Scottish Enlightenment. This subject was most throughly discussed by Adam Smith who finds a solution which is very important and also debatable to date. This solution actually created a problem which is called the Adam Smith problem. Smith, thanks to his approaches to this subject, became the creator of the individual of political economy. And this creates a situation in which his two important books namely Wealth of Nations and Theory of Moral Sentiments are not considered totally. In this context Theory of Moral Sentiments has been ignored and Smith’s individual is narrowed to an individual prototype which economics needs. In this study the adventure of the creation of the prototype, which has mentioned above, and the contributions of Adam Smith and Bernard Mandeville will be evaluated both with their agreements and contradictions.

B11|Antonio Serra’s Development Economics: Mercantilism, Backwardness, Dependence|"Antonio Serra wrote in 1613 an outstanding analysis, on the economy of the Reign of Naples, which is still very little known out of Italy; where he is largely recognized as the founder of the ""Southern question"". This article proposes a larger view of Serra’s pioneering achievements, by putting him in the context of the mercantilist approach for development, and of the general analyses both of backwardness and dependence. We try to show that mercantilism was in fact committed to the increase in production, not to the increase in gold (as the enduring bias wants). In this sense Serra was fully a mercantilist. He was the first to analyze the general features of economic backwardness: lack of manufactures, absence of a stable government which encourages export, investments and trade; lack of entrepreneurial occasions; poorness of trade. Serra also - together with the Spanish mercantilists - introduced for the first time the analysis of dependence, i.e. of the process that makes a backward economy dependent on - and blocked by - the prevailing interests of stronger economies. Apart from a few authors, this was to be rediscovered only in the 1960s by the economics of development."
B11|Between Nationalism And The Flat World Of Thomas Friedman|The present paper aims to disseminate the impact of globalization on the nation-state throughout the history. The research objective consists in the reviewing of the assertion of the globalization phenomenon and the conflicts it stirred at the national level by reasons related to cultural, economic, social or political issues. The analysis will be conducted by two antagonistic positions: an optimistic view according to which globalization has a positive effect overall and a pessimistic one under which globalization causes the decline of the nation-state. The main findings will show that nationalism is not doomed to disappear, but instead it will adapt over time and will steal from the benefits globalization brings everything that culturally, politically, socially, or economically suits to a certain nation.

B11|The Glue of Democracy: Economics, Warfare and Values in Classical Greece|In the present essay we analyse the links between the emergence of new arms and forms of war-emergence, the phalanx and its hoplites, and the trieres at sea, its economic base, and the emergence of democracy in classical Greece. We propose that the unique till then in the world phalanx formation, led to the development of particular values and ethics, which again were the necessary conditions for the emergence of democracy, then again, a unique phenomenon. We then turn to seapower, which according to our analysis was a sufficient condition for the establishment and endurance of democracy, because seapower led to a community of economic interests, on which direct democracies like Ancient Athens, were based.
B11|Quesnay and the analysis of the surplus in an agrarian capitalist economy|In order to discuss the ‘rational foundation’ of certain aspects of Quesnay´s theory we use a simple formalization of the necessary connections between assumptions about the techniques in use, the distribution of income between the classes and sectors, the system of relative prices. We argue that Quesnay´s system was a truly capitalist agrarian economy and that he was indeed a pioneer of the classical political economy/surplus approach to economics as identified first by Marx, Sraffa and Garegnani, the physical surplus of grains being the necessary basis for his analysis of the distribution and relative prices.

B11|Keynes Post Mercantilista|El pensamiento keynesiano puede entenderse como una suerte de derivación de las ideas mercantilistas. El sistema mercantilista no solamente se debe ver como un conjunto de comerciantes cuya pretensión más importante era la de hacer más rico al Estado y a ellos mismos, sino que también se debe analizar desde la perspectiva de la teoría económica, ya que para ellos era igualmente importante pensar en el empleo, por ejemplo. Las ideas de Keynes por su parte, no pueden verse en el vacío, sino que deben tratarse desde el contexto de la historia de las ideas y por lo tanto como producto del mismo devenir. El documento termina reconociendo los aportes que la teorías mercantilistas, en especial en la discusión sobre el empleo tiene el pensamiento keynesiano.
B11|On the geometric interpretation of the nonnegative rank|The nonnegative rank of a nonnegative matrix is the minimum number of nonnegative rank-one factors needed to reconstruct it exactly. The problem of determining this rank and computing the corresponding nonnegative factors is difficult; however it has many potential applications, e.g., in data mining, graph theory and computational geometry. In particular, it can be used to characterize the minimal size of any extended reformulation of a given combinatorial optimization program. In this paper, we introduce and study a related quantity, called the restricted nonnegative rank. We show that computing this quantity is equivalent to a problem in polyhedral combinatorics, and fully characterize its computational complexity. This in turn sheds new light on the nonnegative rank problem, and in particular allows us to provide new improved lower bounds based on its geometric interpretation. We apply these results to slack matrices and linear Euclidean distance matrices and obtain counter-examples to two conjectures of Beasly and Laffey, namely we show that the nonnegative rank of linear Euclidean distance matrices is not necessarily equal to their dimension, and that the rank of a matrix is not always greater than the nonnegative rank of its square.
B11|Poverty and Subsistence. The Mercantilist Point of View|The aim of this article is to look at ideas of social welfare in the English political economy from the 16th to the early 18th Century. In doing so, we shall focus upon the relationship between English Mercantilist economic thought and the evolution of the institutional framework established in order to cope with the problem of poverty and unemployment. In other words, rather than viewing Mercantilism as an “exercise in economic nationalism” we shall inquiry it under the perspective of social policy. Although the most credited assessments of Mercantilism have depicted it as a doctrine which supported a “ruthlessly materialistic ruling class which did not merely neglect but actively exploited the poor”, by placing the emphasis on the role played by the allowance system in the overall strategy of poor relief in England throughout the 17th Century we shall see that during the Mercantilist period social policies were not neglectful of the need of the poor. This reinforced the idea of a social Mercantilism.
B11|Cartels in the Kautiliya Arthasastra|This paper examines the legal-economic dimension of collusive manipulation of prices from the perspective of the Kautiliya Arthasastra, an ancient Indian treatise on law and statecraft, which is among the oldest sources of information about cartels. It identifies cartels in the treatise, shows that cartels were treated more severely than individuals who manipulated prices, assesses the efficacy of penalties from the perspective of deterrence, and discusses the evolution of relevant laws. The economic analysis presented in the paper throws new light on the controversy surrounding the internal consistency of the Arthasastra. The paper also highlights the need to take note of the moral-legal environment within which pre-modern markets operated before studying them with the help of models developed for modern markets.
B11|Lowndes and Locke on the Value of Money|The main goal of this article is to identify and critically examine the foundations of the monetary theories to which Lowndes and Locke appealed during their debate around the Great Recoinage of 1696. In the course of the investigation I came by the critical commentaries of Sir James Steuart and Karl Marx on the views of Locke and Lowndes on monetary theory. As these highly valuable commentaries are nearly absent from the standard literature, I present and critically assess them in this essay.

B11|Dogmen- und realhistorische Aspekte des Wohlfahrtsbegriffs|„Welfare“ and „wealth“ are discussed as central economic notions in the context of the history of economic thought. One focus is laid on the limits to economic growth discussed already by 18th century Physiocrats and in the 19th century especially by John Stuart Mill and W. Stanley Jevons; the other focus is on the evolution of neoclassical economics up to the 2nd half of the 20th century, with special emphasis on its various attempts establish utilitarian foundations for these notions.
B11|From Craft to Institution: Accounting in Italy from the Middle Ages to the Early Modern Period|The article describes the evolution of accounting from the simple registration­ technique to economic and social institution in medieval Italy. We used methods of institutional analysis and historical research. It is shown that the institutionalization­ of accounting had been completed by the XIV century, when it became a system of codified technical standards, scholar discipline and a professional field. We examine the interrelations of this process with business environment, political, social, economic and cultural factors of Italy by the XII—XVI centuries. Stages of institutionalization are outlined.
B11|Money – Between Medium of Exchange and Institution|As one of the most debated economic concepts, with the biggest egos caused both in theory and in practice, but also one of the oldest realities, historically speaking, of the human society, it was inevitable that the money be portrayed us in different instances, depending on the emphasis on its functions (medium of exchange, measure of value, tool for preserving value), on the forms it wears, on the content revealed by the analysis of indicators and monetary aggregates (money supply in circulation), on the institutions which regulate it or on the relations that condition or intermediate it. Of all these instances, two stood in the centre of debates and of the theoretical and empirical approaches which animated the economic thinking: money as a medium of exchange and money as an institution.
B11|How Capitalism, University and Mathematics as Institutions Shaped Mainstream Economics|The article shows that mainstream economics, which now includes such current as new institutional economics, is the result of an evolution shaped by three institutions (capitalism, university and mathematics) by imposing to the profession of economists their founding beliefs. These beliefs are: ‘laissez-faire’; ‘economic knowledge has a priori and exegetical character’; ‘all mathematical entities exist in reality’; ‘beauty is a criterion for theoretical constructions’; ‘scientific research is a play with axioms and rules of inference’. Because of these beliefs mainstream economics, based on mathematical constructions arbitrarily borrowed from the physics of the nineteenth century, remains cognitively sterile and socially detrimental.

B11|Market, civic virtues, and civic bargaining in the medieval and early modern age: some evidence from sixteenth century Italy|In the last decades, historians have shown that the modern market is rooted in the institutional system created in European towns since the middle ages. This approach leads us beyond the usual opposition between market and society or between public and private market. Indeed, in the medieval and early modern age, the market was part of a wider institutional design of civil life, which had a basic conceptual frame of reference in the notion of the common good, a feature typical of such organicistic and hierarchical societies. This paper explores the process of market construction in the medieval and early modern age. I firstly analysed the role of the market in these societies and then focused on the case of foodstuff provision: a key element of the non-written, ancient pact between rulers and people, based on the assurance of subsistence. As a basis for the study, I employed sixteenth century documents regarding Vicenza, a medium-sized town in the Republic of Venice. These show very clearly that, in general, market and price regulation was not the result of arbitrary interventions by public authorities; on the contrary, it was the result of a process of negotiation, which I call civic bargaining. This process involved—to various degrees—public authorities, landowners, merchants and guilds, and the town’s people, the pursuit of the common good being, in practice, a matter of balancing various needs and interests. Present-day economic and social public policies are, in many aspects, an inheritance of the institutional system created in the medieval and early modern age: knowledge of these origins is useful in the present debate regarding economic versus social development, as discussed at the end of the paper.

B11|Controversial and novel features of the Eurozone crisis as a balance of payment crisis|The European crisis appears as the n-th “this time is different” episode of the financial liberalisation sequence cum fixed exchange rates, capital flows from the centre to the periphery, housing bubble, current account (CA) deficit and indebtedness, default. In the author’s view, although Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) is not a satisfactory account of the history and nature of defaults, their title conveys the sense of a recurring pattern of unfortunate events. In this contribution the author examines some conventional and heterodox explanations that have been given for the nature of the balance of payments (BoP) disequilibrium of the Eurozone (EZ) members in relation also to the presumed German mercantilism. The paper discusses next two different interpretations of the causes of the rise in the sovereign spread of periphery countries: both do not clearly identify the nature of the EZ crisis as a BoP crisis. Finally, it focuses on the novel and controversial features of the EZ BoP crisis compared to previous experiences. These original tracts regard the role of the European Central Bank in refinancing banks in peripheral countries.
B11|Harmonic and Conflict Views in International Economic Relations: a Sraffian view|Research on the recent European financial crisis has prompted exploration of the harmonic and disharmonic views of international economic relations. The former, more liberal view is based on the Ricardian and Neoclassical trade theories. The latter is derived from pre-Smithian mercantilist conflict views of international trade. Here we investigated the contribution that Sraffian theory can offer the latter stream of thought. This contribution cannot be underestimated since it provides a rigorous analytical rebuttal of the Neoclassical theory of international trade and capital flows and supports the existence of absolute advantages, which are a source of potential trade conflict between nations. Kaleckian theory may also vindicate mercantilist attention to trade surplus. A disharmonic view of the international economic relations also springs from Political Realism, a major tradition in political science. Mercantilism and Political Realism converge in International Political Economy (IPE), a field that arose in the early 1970s as an attempt to bridge the gap between the disciplines of international economics and international relations. The nationstate is at the centre of Mercantilism and IPE. The Classical and Marxist approaches are not on easy terms with the notion of nation-state, so that it was also impossible to avoid this topic. This paper is a preliminary exploration of the complementarity of the Classical conflict view of income distribution and the disharmonic traditions of IER in opposition to the harmonic beliefs of economic and political liberalism
B11|Retrospectives: Hume on Money, Commerce, and the Science of Economics|David Hume (1711-1776) is arguably the most esteemed philosopher to have written in the English language. During his lifetime, however, Hume was as well if not better known for his contributions to political economy, particularly for the essays published as the Political Discourses (1752). Hume left his mark on the economic thought of the physiocrats, the classical economists, and the American Federalists. Adam Smith, who met Hume circa 1750, was his closest friend and interlocutor for some 25 years. Among modern economists, Hume's essays on money and trade have informed theorists of both Keynesian and Monetarist persuasions. In this essay, we begin by discussing Hume's monetary economics, and then spell out his theory of economic development, noting his qualified enthusiasm for the modern commercial system. We end with an assessment of his views on the scientific standing of economics, specifically his counterintuitive argument that economics could be epistemologically superior to physics.
B11|Las «Reflexiones sobre el estado actualdel comercio de España» (1761), de Simón de Aragorri: contenido, estudio de fuentes y primera interpretación|«Reflexiones sobre el estado actual del comercio de España» —Reflections on the current state of commerce in Spain— was anonymously published in 1761. At the time both the treatise and its author, the merchant Simón de Aragorri, were well known. Nevertheless, the work vanished for centuries and there was not known copy available at disposal of historians until now. This article analyzes Reflexiones emphasizing the context within which the treatise was drawn up, the author's environment, his intellectual sources, and the economic significance of the book. Conclusions suggest that the treatise is essentially a translation-adaptation of a work by the French economist Jacques Accarias de Serionne. The objective of the text was reorienting the domestic and overseas economic policy of the Spanish monarchy. In particular, it pretended a restructuration of the Spanish Public Finances and to solve the monetary distress caused by the entrance of precious metals. It also aimed at reorienting the Uztáriz and Ulloa's protectionist, interventionist and industrialist approach towards a new strategy of economic growth based on agriculture and free trade. Its foundations also aroused a substantial change on the transatlantic commercial relationships.
B11|The role of experts in the public assessment of England´s trade crisis of the early 1620´s|Economic pamphleteering in England during the early 17th century has often been described as an attempt to influence the course of public policy with the aim of either protecting vested interests or else promoting in earnest the adoption of a few mercantilist doctrines. However, these judgments pass over a more basic question: to what extent, if any, could members of the English business community influence public opinion and the policy decision-making process? Special consultations over pressing economic issues offered an opportunity for their voices to be heard, but the growing financial difficulties which the English crown faced at that time opened the main path available for their active engagement with public administration. Lionel Cranfield was by far the most successful of such cases during the period at hand, playing a leading role throughout the public debates which surrounded the trade crisis of the early 1620’s – over which the pamphlet literature, in contrast, seems to have exerted a much more limited impact.
B11|Trade, Money, And The Grievances Of The Commonwealth: Economic Debates In The English Public Sphere During The Commercial Crisis Of The Early 1620’S|The turbulent, crisis-ridden first half of the 1620’s was a rich period for economic pamphleteering in England, as has been long recognized in the specialist literature. What is less commonly appreciated is that economic reasoning was not, at that time, exclusively confined to the musings of merchants who sought to influence the course of public policy according to their own practical wisdom or corporate interests. In fact, economic distress was then a central topic for public debate throughout English society at large; it figured prominently both in parliament and at court, thus mobilizing most of the kingdom’s economic and political groups. Using a wide array of primary sources – parliamentary debates, Privy Council records, papers and correspondence by public officials – this paper aims to uncover the place occupied by economic reasoning and discourse within the English public sphere during the early 17th century. When seen against this background, it becomes apparent that the pamphlet literature actually came about as a response to a debate which was already well under way – a rather late chapter of which was the famous controversy among Malynes, Misselden and Mun, played out simultaneously in the political arena and in London’s printing houses.
B11|Tocqueville on Poverty in Industrial Democracies|In this paper I explore Tocqueville´s views on poverty and pauperism in democratictimes. Tocqueville´s explanation of economic and social phenomena linked to the raiseof equality, show the difficult dilemmas he foresaw with the consolidation of democracy and increasing industrialization. New social classes and the unequal access to wealth would generate a social problem which could, eventually, threaten freedom.
B11|Historia del crédito hipotecario en Colombia|En la historia de la política económica, el fomento de la construcción de vivienda ha sido un tema recurrente. En este artículo se hace un recuento de las diferentes maneras como se ha intentado hacer esto en Colombia a través de la historia moderna. La cuantificación se puede hacer a partir de 1923, una vez creados el Banco de la República y la Superintendencia Bancaria a raíz de las recomendaciones de la Misión Kemmerer. En los años treinta y cuarenta, la principal fuente de crédito para vivienda fue un banco estatal: el Banco Central Hipotecario (BCH). En los años cincuenta y sesenta, esta fuente fue complementada por el Instituto de Crédito Territorial (ICT), y el crédito bancario para vivienda diferente al BCH era mínimo. Solo a partir de los años setenta, en la era del UPAC (unidad de poder adquisitivo constante), el sector bancario formal financió el crédito de largo plazo para vivienda. A partir de los años noventa, el Estado otorga subsidios a familias de bajos ingresos para que estas puedan acceder al crédito para compra de vivienda de interés social. Finalmente, se ensaya promover la construcción durante la crisis económica del 2008, creando un subsidio de tasa de interés para la compra de vivienda popular. Además, la política tributaria se ha usado con el mismo propósito.
B11|Eudaimonía y la economía de la felicidad|En este documento se discuten las principales aproximaciones a la felicidad en la economía de la felicidad: el hedonismo y los enfoques de satisfacción con la vida. Es posible identificar una tensión entre dos principios importantes en esta literatura: 1) los individuos son los mejores jueces de su propia felicidad, y 2) el propósito de la economía debe ser la promoción directa de la felicidad. El artículo sostiene que el hedonismo choca con el primer principio. En el caso de las teorías de satisfacción con la vida, el enfoque restringido choca con ambos principios, mientras que el no restringido sólo con el segundo. El artículo también sostiene que esta rama tiene dificultades para presentar la felicidad como un concepto normativo consistente. Para mostrar esto se estudian las teorías de Aristóteles y Séneca porque: 1) tanto los economistas de la felicidad como los antiguos consideran que la felicidad es el fin último de la vida humana; 2) aunque estos economistas reconocen la importancia de las teorías eudaimonistas de la felicidad, su interpretación y uso no han sido satisfactorios; y 3) el debate entre Aristóteles y Séneca tiene implicaciones importantes sobre el carácter cuantitativo de la felicidad y la capacidad de las políticas públicas para promoverla. La lección principal de los antiguos es metodológica: la riqueza de sus discusiones radica en que las distintas escuelas eran conscientes de que la felicidad es principalmente un concepto ético, cuyo contenido ha de ajustarse a sus exigencias normativas. Éste es un punto que la literatura contemporánea parece haber pasado por alto.
B11|Tocqueville sobre la pobreza en las democracias industrializadas|En este texto exploro la visión de Tocqueville sobre la pobreza y el pauperismo en los tiempos democráticos. Su explicación de fenómenos económicos y sociales asociados al auge de la igualdad, muestra los difíciles dilemas que preveía con la consolidación de la democracia y la creciente industrialización. Nuevas clases sociales y un acceso desigual a la riqueza podrían generar un problema social que tarde o temprano amenazaría la libertad.
B11|Teoría económica y formación del Estado nación: mercantilistas y liberalistas|El Estado, a pesar de ser un tema por excelencia de la política, ha sido abordado de manera permanente por la economía desde su nacimiento hasta las teorías contemporáneas. Este texto presenta los aportes que la doctrina mercantilista y liberalista económica le dieron a la formación y constitución del Estado nación. La primera doctrina fue fundamental en su surgimiento y consolidación, aunque lo profundizó tanto que le dio la forma de Estado Absolutista; la segunda lo limitó y perfiló, dándole al Estado-nación la forma que aun hoy es vigente.
B11|The utility of a common coinage: Currency unions and the integration of money markets in late Medieval Central Europe|This paper employs a new method and dataset to estimate the effect of currency unions on the integration of financial markets in late Medieval Central Europe. The analysis reveals that membership in a union was significantly correlated with well-integrated markets. We also examine whether currency unions were endogenous. Our results indicate that where unions were established, markets had been significantly better integrated already in the preceding period. In addition, we show that currency unions created by autonomous merchant towns were better integrated than unions implemented by territorial rulers. The overall implication is that monetary diversity was a corollary of weakly integrated markets in late Medieval Central Europe.

B11|The ethical foundations of economics in ancient Greece, focussing on Socrates and Xenophon|Purpose - Economics had a strong linkage to ethics up to the 1930s but this has virtually disappeared today. Amartya Sen first sketched the historical relationship in his book Design/methodology/approach - Various ancient Greek primary sources are used to investigate the foundations of economics as an ethical enterprise. For Socrates, the primary sources are the reports of his conversations by two students: Plato and Xenophon.

B11|Merchants and councilors: intellectual divergences in early 17th century British economic thought [Merchants and councilors: intellectual divergences in early 17th century British economic thought]|During the early 1620's, England went through a period of intense economic disorders which sparked the interest of many in economic reasoning. The decade witnessed the emergence of the most relevant pieces of economic literature of the early Stuart era, but the debate was not restricted to the abstract confrontation of economic writers. The fundamental issue at stake in the controversies between Malynes, Misselden, and Mun - the integration of money and international trade in a coherent explanation of economic phenomena - was also the subject of much care in the public sphere at large. The parliamentary session of 1621, in particular, put in evidence not only the fundamental relevance of the matter for understanding England's economic maladies, but also the great difficulties involved in its investigation. By bringing all these elements together, this paper seeks to articulate a more dense and meaningful portrait of the prevailing state of economic ideas in early 17th century England.

B11|Mutamenti strutturali: modelli, metodi e principi in una nuova prospettiva<BR>[Structural changes: models, methods and principles towards a new perspective]|The study of structural changes is the theme of this work, where structural changes are correlated primarily with changes in the structure of production, which are caused by the evolution of technical progress and organizational changes in production. The analysis of models and theories of structural change carried out in this paper is twofold. On the one hand, it is possible to identify some basic principles that characterize these models, on the other hand, it should lead us to reconsider some important methodological issues in a new perspective, issues concerning the different methods of decomposition of the production systems, the problem of complexity and strategies to reduce this complexity. In the following pages, the investigation will be limited to the models of Leontief, von Neumann, Sraffa as these economists, similarly to classical economics, focused their study on the economic structure as a factor crucial to understanding the functioning of economic systems. The choice of models of Leontief, von Neumann and Sraffa is important, because they can identify the analytical principles and discuss some methodological issues, which are the basis of the analysis of structural change, with the aim of contributing to a new perspective and to further progress at epistemic level. This paper compares the Quesnay’s Tableau Economique, taken as a reference model, with the models of Leontief, von Neumann and Sraffa to capture the different characteristics of these models compared to the theoretical framework of Quesnay. The essay also seeks to identify within these models the main features on the analysis of structural change. It tries to indicate the possibility of a new and unified perspective on the methodological analysis of structural change but does notpretend to to offer a general theoretical model.
B11|Scarcity, self-interest and maximization from Islamic angle|This paper clarifies some misinterpretations of three foundational concepts in mainstream economics from Islamic viewpoint. These are scarcity of resources, pursuit of self-interest and maximizing behavior of economic agents. It argues that stocks of resources that God has provided are inexhaustible. But important is the availability of resources out of stocks to mankind. Availability is a function of human effort and the state of knowledge about resources over time and space. In that sense resources are scarce in relation to multiplicity of human wants for Islamic economics as well. Self-interest must be distinguished from selfishness. The motive operates on both ends of human existence: mundane and spiritual. Its pursuit does not preclude altruism from human life. Counter interests keep balance in society and promote civility. Islam recognizes the motive as valid. Maximization relates to quantifiable ex ante variables. Uncertainty of future outcomes of actions makes maximization a heuristic but useful analytical tool. The concept is value neutral. What is maximized, how and to what end alone give rise to moral issues. Modified in the light of Shari’ah requirements the three concepts can provide a firmer definition for Islamic economics centered on the notion of falah.
B11|The First Globalization Debate: Crusoe vs. Gulliver|Two of the earliest novels in English, Robinson Crusoe (1719) by Daniel Defoe and Gulliver’s Travels (1726) by Jonathan Swift, are widely perceived as an entertaining adventure story and a pioneering work of science fiction. Viewed by modern economists, however, they appear as expressions of opposing positions on the desirability of integration within a world economy. Crusoe demonstrated the gains from trade and colonization and the attendant social and political benefits. By contrast, Swift warned of complex entanglements that would arise from globalization, especially with foreign leaders who operated from theory and models rather than common sense.
B11|A Short History of the “Just Price” Controversy in the XII-th and XIII-th Centuries|This paper analyzes the contributions of some of the pre-scholastic and scholastic writers on the doctrine of the “just price”. According to their perspective it is difficult to establish an objective method for discovering the “just price” of goods on the market. On the contrary, they portrayed a theory in which the only instance that ultimately determines the price of goods is the subjective evaluations of those involved in the process of buying and selling. Moreover, the “justice” of an exchange of goods or price, results directly from the absence of fraud or violence. Therefore, a price is “just” if it is voluntarily set and accepted by parties.
B11|Usury, Calvinism, and Credit in Protestant England: from the Sixteenth Century to the Industrial Revolution|This study analyses the impact of Protestantism on interest rates in England from the 16th century to the Industrial Revolution. One of many myths about the usury doctrine - the prohibition against demanding anything above the principal in a loan (mutuum) - is that it ceased to be observed in Reformation Europe. As several authors have demonstrated, however, early Protestant Reformers, beginning with Luther, had essentially endorsed the long established Scholastic usury doctrines. The one major exception was Jean Calvin. Though retaining a strong hostility against usury, he permitted interest on commercial loans, while forbidding usury on charitable loans to the needy. That view may have been partly responsible for a crucially important breach in civil support of the usury doctrine. The first, in 1540, was an imperial ordinance for the Habsburg Netherlands permitting interest payments up to 12%, but only for commercial loans. In England, Henry VIII's Parliament of 1545 enacted a statute permitting interest payments up to 10% (on all loans); any higher rates constituted usury. But, in 1552, a hostile Parliament, with radical Protestants, revoked that statute, and revived it only under Elizabeth, in 1571. Since the maximum rate was also taken to be the minimum, subsequent Parliaments, seeking to foster trade, reduced that rate: to 8% in 1624, to 6% in 1651 (ratified 1660-61), and to 5% in 1713: a rate maintained until the abolition of the usury laws in 1854. The consequences of legalizing interest payments, but with ever lower maximum rates, had a far-reaching impact on the English economy, from the 16th century to the Industrial Revolution. The first lay in finally permitting the discounting of commercial bills. Even if medieval bills of exchange had permitted merchants to disguise interest payments in exchange rates, the usury doctrine nevertheless required that they be non-negotiable, held until maturity, since discounting would have revealed the implicit interest. Evidence for the Low Countries and England demonstrates that discounting, with legal transfers either by bearer bills or by endorsement, with full negotiability, began and became widespread only after the legalization of interest payments in both countries. The importance for Great Britain can be seen in the primary role of its banks during the Industrial Revolution: in discounting commercial bills, foreign and domestic, in order to finance most of the working capital needs for both industry and commerce. The second is known as the Financial Revolution; and its late introduction into England, from 1693, was in part due to the limits imposed on interest rates. In its final form (1757), it meant the establishment of permanent, funded, national debt based not on the sale of interest-bearing bonds but on perpetual annuities or rentes. The origins can be found in 13th-century northern France and the Low Countries in reaction to the vigorous intensification of the anti-usury campaign by the new mendicant orders, the Franciscans and Dominicans. Fearing for their mortal souls, many merchants refused to make loans and chose to finance town governments instead by purchasing municipal rentes (annuities). In 1250, Pope Innocent IV ruled that no usury was involved, because those buying rentes could never demand redemptions. Instead, they were licitly purchasing future streams of income. Continuing debates were not finally resolved until the issue of three 15th-century papal bulls (supporting Innocent IV). By the 16th century, the finances of most western Europe states had become largely dependent on selling both life and perpetual annuities. England was thus a late-comer, in importing this system of public finance. Fully immune to the usury laws, this Financial Revolution permitted the English/British governments to reduce borrowing costs from 14% in 1693 to just 3% in 1757, so that the British economy could finance both 'guns and butter', without crowding out private investments. Furthermore, since these annuities (Consols) were traded internationally on both the London and Amsterdam stock exchanges, they were a popular form of secure investments, which became, with land, the most widely-used collateral in borrowing for the fixed capital needs of the Industrial Revolution.
B11|A 'third culture' in economics? An essay on Smith, Confucius and the rise of China|China's rise drives a growing impact of China on economics. So far, this mainly works via the force of example, but there is also an emerging role of Chinese thinking in economics. This paper raises the question how far Chinese perspectives can affect certain foundational principles in economics, such as the assumptions on individualism and self-interest allegedly originating in Adam Smith. I embark on sketching a 'third culture' in economics, employing a notion from cross-cultural communication theory, which starts out from the observation that the Chinese model was already influential during the European enlightenment, especially on physiocracy, suggesting a particular conceptualization of the relation between good government and a liberal market economy. I relate this observation with the current revisionist view on China's economic history which has revealed the strong role of markets in the context of informal institutions, and thereby explains the strong performance of the Chinese economy in pre-industrial times. I sketch the cultural legacy of this pattern for traditional Chinese conceptions of social interaction and behavior, which are still strong in rural society until today. These different strands of argument are woven together in a comparison between Confucian thinking and Adam Smith, especially with regard to the 'Theory of Moral Sentiments', which ends up in identifying a number of conceptual family resemblances between the two. I conclude with sketching a 'third culture' in economics in which moral aspects of economic action loom large, as well as contextualized thinking in economic policies.
B11|Retrospectives: An Early Supply-Side-Demand-Side Controversy: Petty, Law, Cantillon|Early modern Europe in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries witnessed an unprecedented increase in the rate of economic growth, and governments entertained a wide range of proposals aimed at developing and harnessing foreign trade and emerging financial markets. In his magisterial survey of foreign trade doctrine titled Studies in the Theory of International Trade (1936), Jacob Viner pointed out that enlightened authors of that time were often nonbullionist mercantilists: they favored export promotion and import reduction not on the grounds that it would lead to an accumulation of gold, but on the grounds that it would increase trade and employment. My focus here is on how some key economists of this time period—William Petty, John Law, and Richard Cantillon—adumbrated disputes between supply-side and demand-side macroeconomics that have continued to the present day.
B11|Pauvreté et propriété privée dans l’encyclique rerum novarum|The social encyclical Rerum Novarum closely links the question of poverty with that of property, and invokes Thomas Aquinas. But on closer examination, the reasoning developed in favour of property departs from the scholastic thinker, since it maintains more affinities with the liberal tradition represented by J. Locke. While Aquinas links property to the common good, for Locke property is based on the rights of the individual. A re-reading of the encyclical, in light of its sources, permits greater precision of the nature of this issue, while enriching the current debate about private property and social property.
B11|Montesquieu et les pauvres|Montesquieu relates poverty not to a lack of patrimony but to the impossibility of working. He thus fully contributes to the modern, economic secular vision of poverty: poverty is not a matter of charity but of organizing labour. Montesquieu shares the liberal, optimistic creed that the development of wealth will end poverty, which can only be residual or accidental. Therefore, he criticizes the Colbertist policy of poorhouses, while promoting the necessity of temporary remedies to economic dysfunctioning. He mainly targets deliberate policies of low wages, while his definition of poverty aims at making an oxymoron of the working poor.
B11|The First Globalization Debate|Early in the 18th century, before the birth of political economy as a discipline, two of the earliest novels in the English language were published: Robinson Crusoe (1719) by writer and economic entrepreneur Daniel Defoe, and Gulliver’s Travels (1726) by the cleric and political adviser Jonathan Swift. The first was widely perceived as an entertaining adventure story, the latter as a pioneering work of science fiction. Both contain indirect comment on the foreign policy of Britain at the time. When viewed from the perspective of the modern economist, however, the works appear to be expressions of opposing positions on the desirability of a nation pursuing integration within a world economy. Crusoe demonstrated the gains from international trade and colonization and even the attendant social and political benefits. He explores the instinct to trade overseas, stages of growth, and the need for careful cost-benefit calculations. By contrast Swift warned of the complex entanglements that would arise from globalization, especially with foreign leaders who operated from theory and models rather than common sense. He makes a case for economic autarky.
B11|The amazing synchronicity of the Global Development (the 1300s-1450s). An institutional approach to the globalization of the late Middle Ages|In a new approach to a long-ranging debate on the causes of the Late Medieval Debasement, we offer an institutional case-study of Russia and the Levant. Avoiding the complexity of the “upstream” financial/minting centres of Western Europe, we consider the effects of debasement “downstream”, in resource-exporting periphery countries. The paper shows the amazing synchronicity of the worldwide appearance of the early modern trading system, associated with capitalism or commercial society. The centre-periphery feedback loop amplified trends and pushed towards economic and institutional changes. This is illustrated via the Hanseatic-Novgorodian and Italian-Levantine trade – under growing market pressure of the exploding transaction costs, the oligopolies gradually dissolved and were replaced by the British-Dutch traders. In this case-study the late-medieval/early-modern monetary integration served as the transitional institutional base for reducing transaction costs during a dramatic global shift. Highlighting centre-periphery links, a new trading outpost of Arkhangelsk rose synchronously with Amsterdam.
B11|Good or bad money?: debasement, society and the state in the late Middle Ages|This paper revisits the question of debasement by analysing a newly compiled dataset with a novel approach, as well as employing conventional methods. It finds that mercantile influence on monetary policies favoured relative stability, and wage-payers did not typically gain from silver debasement. Excess demand for bullion was not a major cause of debasement. Yet monetary issues were important. Warfare made the debasement of silver but not of gold more likely. Regime types had an importance comparable to that of warfare: Princes debased silver more often than monetary unions and especially city-states. It is likely that fiscal debasements were more frequent in principalities, not least because princes debased for fiscal reasons also in the absence exceptional needs. The conclusion discusses the implications of the findings.
B11|Oferta y demanda y el ciclo económico: una interpretación de la situación económica actual/Supply and Demand Sides and the Economic Cycle: An Interpretation of the Current Situation|Tomando como punto de partida las dificultades económicas actuales, se pretende, siguiendo el modelo cíclico de Ibn Jaldún, una aproximación a las oscilaciones de la actividad económica teniendo en cuenta simultáneamente los lados de la oferta y de la demanda, entendiendo que el protagonismo de uno y otro lado puede modificarse en el tiempo, o que los dos pueden actuar simultáneamente, como sería el caso en la situación económica actual a juzgar por los síntomas observados. Asimismo, se llama la atención sobre la complejidad existente en la práctica, si se tiene en cuenta la riqueza de las motivaciones humanas, frente al carácter unidimensional del homo oeconomicus smithiano, a partir del cual se han elaborado nuestras concepciones económicas. Starting from the current economic difficulties, we will try to increase our knowledge of economic cycle with the help of Ibn Khaldûn Cyclical Model, considering simultaneously the eventual shocks of demand and supply sides. Both of them may influence on the oscillatory movements of economic activity, separately (with different grades of emphasize each one, depending on the moment) or simultaneously. According to the observed symptoms, we think the last option should be the best explanation nowadays. We also have to remark the real complexity of economic functioning, having in mind the variety of human motivations versus the one-dimensional character of Smith’s homo oeconomicus, which is in the basis of our conventional economic conceptions.
B11|Quando o liberal e o socialista se defrontam: Bastiat, Proudhon e a renda do capital [Liberalism vs. Socialism: Bastiat, Proudhon and capital income]|This paper deals with the debate involving Bastiat and Proudhon over the legitimacy of the capital income. The first section presents an overview of the French political scenario at the time of the controversy. After that, the economic views of both authors are sketched in light of the liberal and socialist doctrines at the time. The third section introduces Bastiat's and Proudhon's initial contributions with regard to capital and interest concepts. Next, their economic and methodological arguments concerning the nature of a profit orientated society are confronted. The fifth section presents the final discussion over Proudhon's free credit proposal, harshly criticized by Bastiat. As concluding remarks, the effective length of the two protagonists' divergences is evaluated.
B11|Level of income and income distribution in mid-18th century France, according to Francois Quesnay|The paper uses the data from Francois Quesnay's writings to derive a social table for pre-revolutionary France, estimate country's mean income and income distribution. These Quesnay-based estimates are compared with more recent estimates of 18th century French incomes and inequality.
B11|Economics and Hegemony; Globalization and International Trade Agreements|This paper examines the concept of hegemony and its historical impacts on the Arabic and Islamic countries. It is foreseen that has long path applied by the Western countries as disclosed by trade applications and history of economic thought. Impacts on Arabic and Islamic countries were visible in terms of trade, balances and persistent debts. A strong tool is evident with the called for integration, interdependence and the generated dependency syndrome. The establishment of that mechanism depends on a theory which we present as the Hegemonic Stability. The Arabic and Islamic countries did not succeed to form their effective economic blocks in order to counter such hegemonic effects because of their internal political structure which affect the structure of their international trade and economic benefits.
B11|Ramón de Salas y la difusión de la fisiocracia en España|Ramón de Salas, professor at the University of Salamanca, wrote about 1790 an extended work that aimed at critically reading Genovesi’s Lezioni di commercio (1765-1767). In drafting so, he used a plurality of doctrinal sources that included French Physiocrats. The fact that this work was drawn up as study material, explains how different Salas’s disciples, such as José Marchena or Manuel Belgrano, contributed later on to spread the Physiocrat approach in Spain and Latin America. This article put focus on the group of philo-physiocrats gathered around R. de Salas in order to emphasize how the «économistes» economic ideas were usually showed up in Spain as interspersed with different economic doctrines and thus they had much deeper influence than historiography has traditionally conferred upon.
B11|Europe, German Mercantilism and the Current Crisis|Contributions to Brancaccio and Fontana (2011) look at a variety of aspects of the current crisis, some of them focusing on the contingent financial causes, others on the underlying contradictions of capitalist economies. In this context, less attention has been paid to the role of Europe and particularly Germany. Europe has not been distinguished by an assertive and cooperative economic policy stance in the aftermath of the current crisis. German mercantilist policies are said to be behind the European policy stance and a source of regional and global imbalances. After a brief examination of the main pillars of European economic policy and German behaviour during the present crisis, these notes suggest an embryonic interpretation of the origins of mercantilist behaviour, dwelling on the nature of mercantilism in economic theory and commercial practice, and of the allegedly German mercantilist model. The suggested interpretation is that in the German case, the national mystique of a trade surplus may have had a role in disciplining the labour market and at the same time assuring profits. Recent developments in Spring 2010 have shown the gravity of the European imbalances in the global crisis (see Cesaratto 2010) and the relevance of the background issues discussed in the present paper.

Utilitarianism and their different conceptions of time are the basis for different theories, which are even represented by different main characters. The three economic theories are original and theoretically innovative and we may use them as three different economic models. KEY Classification-JEL: B11, B12, B41, 010
B11|Byzantine Anonymous Folles In Malatya Archaeology Museum|895 Byzantium coins which were recorded in the inventory between 1970-2006 have been determined in the study carried out in Malatya Archaeology Museum in August 2008. 464 of these coins are anonymous folles. According to sources from that period and numismatic data anonymous folles was started to be struck during the period of John I. The copper coinage Byzantine Empire, between the accession to the throne of John I in 969 and the great monetary reform of Alexius I in 1092 is distinguished from that of earlier centuries in two respects. First, there is a portrait of Christ on copper coins, although it was an application preferred only on golden coins until that time. Second, they were not struck in the name of any emperor. 80% of the coins being the subject of the paper comes from Malatya and its surroundings. Therefore, anonymous folles in Malatya Archaeology Museum is a data group reflecting the Middle Age Byzantine Anatolia well and accurately.
B11|Usury Redux: Notes on The Scholastic Analysis of Usury by John T. Noonan|I summarize the key points of the scholastic theory of usury following The Scholastic Analysis of Usury by John T. Noonan. Usury is the sin of taking interest on a loan without a just title. According to Scholastic moral theology, interest on loans may be justified by the extrinsic titles to damnum emergens and lucrum cessans, i.e. for losses incurred or for profits lost. Implications of this teaching are discussed with regard to other contracts, such as partnerships, the census contract, bills of exchange and “dry exchange,” insurance contracts, and the so-called triple contract. Also discussed are the changes in the practices of confessors that occurred between 1822 and 1836.
B11|Merchants and councilors: intellectual divergences in early 17th century British economic thought|During the early 1620’s, England went through a period of intense economic disorders which sparked the interest of many in economic reasoning. The decade witnessed the emergence of the most relevant pieces of economic literature of the early Stuart era, but the debate was not restricted to the abstract confrontation of economic writers. The fundamental issue at stake in the controversies between Malynes, Misselden, and Mun – the integration of money and international trade in a coherent explanation of economic phenomena – was also the subject of much care in the political arena at large. The 1621 parliamentary session, in particular, put in evidence not only the fundamental relevance of the matter for understanding England’s economic maladies, but also the great difficulties involved in its investigation. By bringing all these elements together, the paper seeks to articulate a more dense and meaningful portrait of the prevailing state of economic ideas in early 17th century England.
B11|Interpreting a crisis: trade and money debates in England during the parliament of 1621|The parliament of 1621 witnessed extensive debating of economic issues by those engaged in finding solutions for the exacting crisis which then affected England. These proceedings offer the background against which some of the most relevant economic literature of the period was produced. As debates progressed, two contrasting perspectives gradually emerged. One of them argued that monetary imbalances were responsible for bullion outflows and sluggish economic activity, while the other believed that monetary flows were ultimately caused by an unfavorable balance of trade. These were exactly the same issues at stake in the controversy between Malynes and Misselden in the early 1620’s, to which Mun would provide a solution with his strict adherence to the balance of trade. Thus, through an analysis of economic debates in the 1621 parliament, this paper seeks to offer an essential element for understanding early XVII century British economic reasoning.
B11|Menger's Consumption Theory in the Light of Practical Thought|This article considers Menger's theory of consumption. It is about studying the depth of Menger's alleged Aristotelianism in the prism of practical thought, within which only Aristotle's economics takes all its meaning. It is shown that the mengerian theory of consumption is rooted in life conceived as need, thus channelling it into a problem of reproduction of the conditions of existence, which is characteristic of poietic reasoning. The study of the institutional context of consumption shows then that there also the practical dimension is missed. Hypothesis is made in conclusion that Menger's theory is part of a pragmatic frame.

Long-distance financial integration progressed in connection with the rise of the territorial state, facilitated by the synergy between princes and emperor.

He is one of the greatest thinkers that Islamic world has ever produced. He was a great scholar, and has written a large number of books, articles and booklets on different aspects of Islam. Economics has been one of the fields of his interest. It may be said that at least in the Sub-Continent, he was the person, who has established “Economics of Islam” as a separate branch of knowledge. In this context, he has highlighted the characteristics, principles and objectives of this system. On the pattern set by him, a large number of Muslim economic thinkers have followed his line of thinking. According to Maulana Maududi basic principles of Islamic economic systems are: private ownership, limits of halal and haram, economic equality, free economy and welfare role of state. Whereas this system is established to achieve the objectives of human liberty, simultaneous development of material and moral growth, establishment of justice, equal distribution of wealth, fulfillment of basic needs of people and co-ordination between different groups of society.

B11|Double Competition and Market Stability in Sir James Steuart|In this work we deal with the theory of price determination in Steuart’s writings; in particular with the concept of Double competition. The background is the evolution of the concept of market during the 18th century. Steuart proposed a theoretical construction in order to tackle the problem of price stability. The first part of the paper presents the method proposed by the authors in order to analyse the price formation in Steuart. We are going to propose a static approach made of periods. The second part develops the explanation of Steuart’s theoretical schema. Price determination is a breakdown process inside a monetary circulation system that ensures the transaction between agents, i.e. the market. Exchange mechanism occurs on a two-fold basis: among merchants and producers and then among consumers and merchants. However, every period is connected so that price fluctuation becomes a new economic problem. The two final sections of the paper are dedicated to the required external regulation. If market is unstable, merchants do not know how to bring this stability about. Maintaining a stable price depends on an authority outside the market. Steuart propose the way towards a smooth price vibration where State and stability are inseparable.
B11|Subjective Well-Being as Welfare Measure: Concepts and Methodology|Happiness research is on the rise, but is confounded by competing definitions of subjective well-being based on co-existing concepts, resulting in differing measures and giving rise to different potential policy applications. This paper motivates the societal necessity for using well-being indicators and gives a short overview of the relation between the concepts ‘subjective well-being’, ‘affect’, ‘life satisfaction’, and ‘happiness’. It describes their measurements and operationalizations in surveys, illustrates their philosophical roots, discusses their validity and reliability, and attempts to shed light on the scope of their policy applicability. Focus of this paper is on practical issues when applying measures of subjective well-being for policy evaluations. Target audiences of this paper are the interested public and laypersons, non-expert economists, and statisticians.
B11|Character, knowledge and skills in ancient Greek education: Lessons for today’s policy makers|The efforts to alleviate poverty by increasing social budgets have failed everywhere in the world and now the question is what else can be done to support those that are left behind. In this paper we search for illumination in the approaches to education that Athens and Sparta adopted in the peak of their power. Our findings indicate that both city-states confronted their challenges successfully because they managed to mold into the character of their citizens “ethos” compatible with the integrity of their institutions. On this ground, and given that “knowledge” and “skills” as engines of economic growth are in the interest of the individuals to accumulate, we conclude that an alternative policy to check the trend towards extreme individualism is to place priority on the character of citizens and pursue it through appropriate restructuring of educational curricula in the direction suggested by ancient Athens.
B11|Financial, economic and moral crisis – vector of durable development|The financial, monetary and banking crisis of 2008 started as a matter of crediting subpremiums in the United States only on the 2nd Quarter of the year and extended quickly in the 3rd Quarter in Western European and then in th e4th Quarter in the Center and Eastern Europe and even far away in Asia. The main ways of appearance are: lack of liquidity on the financial and banking market, as well as the important drop of the stocks values on the stock exchange market. There were a few resounding bankruptcies in the USA, two-three more important in the EU (showed below) that determined the Europeans to be more united as ever and to avoid thus such phenomena on the territory of the EU. The real cause of the crises repetition is in reality the defective individual and social EDUCATION. Hence, it is mandatory to change the way the citizens are educated during their entire life.

B11|Money for Nothing: The Sin of Usury|I present an overview of the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church on usury. In 1515, the Fifth Lateran Council defined “the real meaning of usury: when, from its use, a thing which produces nothing is applied to the acquiring of gain and profit without any work, any expense or any risk.” I argue that the economic conditions of the Middle Ages could not have justified any interest, but structural changes to the economy, including the abolition of slavery, inflation, and the emergence of markets for investment, justify interest on the basis of default risk, the costs of inflation, and opportunity costs.
B11|Vauban, la Défense et la cohésion de l'économie nationale|Generally we take into account Vauban’s work as divided into two parts: the Traité de l’attaque des places on the one hand, the project of Dîme royale on the other hand. On the contrary we point out the profound unity of this work from a methodological point of view and from a political point of view. Whatever is the field considered, Vauban, as a scientist, starts by a meticulous observation in the form of depth enquiry, proceeded with numerous experimentations and after theorizes in the fortification work and in the tax system. This thought is directed towards action: as an economist, Vauban is preoccuped with money and men’s savings; as a sociologist, he aims at social status improvement, as a geographer, he intends to the “pré carré” improvement. To put an end to this analysis, we consider the way of this work was considered by contemporary, historians or economists and what is its originality. JEL: B11, N43
B11|The Process of Circulation in Quesnay's Tableau Économique|At the end of the 17th century capitalism had become the new social and economic order in northern Western Europe. Ever since the trading channels through which money and commodities change hands between the different agents, the actual sequence of these all-comprising monetary exchange processes, and the intertwining of the processes of production and circulation have always been a central issue in heterodox economic thought. The paper discusses Quesnay´s contribution to the theoretical foundation of the social process of circulation of capital in a monetary production economy in the Tableau économique. Additionally, the accounting dynamics of the circulation process of the agricultural kingdom is described by means of system of credit-debit tables currently used by German authors.

B11|The Economic History of Sovereignty: Communal Responsibility, the Extended Family, and the Firm|Economic institutions encompassing increasingly sophisticated concepts of risksharing and liability flourished in Europe beginning in the High Middle Ages. These innovations occurred in an environment of fragmented local jurisdictions, not within the framework of the territorial state. In this short paper we attempt to sketch a unifying approach towards the interpretation of the emergence of these institutions. We argue that communal responsibility in medieval city-states created incentives for excessive risk-taking by individual merchants, and that the emergence of firms mitigated this problem. We also find that entity shielding in the sense of HANSMANN, KRAAKMAN, AND SQUIRE [2006] arose endogenously and is not primarily the result of regulation by local authorities.
B11|‘The big problem of the petty coins’, and how it could be solved in the late Middle Ages|In this paper, the problem of why low-purchasing power silver coins depreciated relative to high-purchasing power gold coins is examined. The standard explanation by Sargent and Velde is refuted. It is argued that the relative stability of gold was due to the demand from consumers able to detect debasements and to choose other suppliers; the rulers’ fear of a loss of reputation therefore allowed them to commit to monetary stability. Consumers of silver were less able to detect changes in the standard and therefore willing to accept debased coins, which meant that rulers could not easily commit to preserving stable silver currencies. The problem could be solved by establishing an independent agency responsible for monetary policies. As infringements of these agencies’ autonomy would be obvious to a wider audience, rulers could then commit to respecting monetary stability. Data on the standards of urban and princely currencies supports the conclusion that this mechanism solved the problem of maintaining the stability of low-purchasing power silver coins.
B11|To take or to make?: contracting for legitimacy in the emerging states of twelth century Britain|The early twelfth century was notable for the centralization and consolidation of royal governance in the centre as well as the periphery of Europe. This paper presents a model of medieval kingship in which consent for the king’s rule is founded upon a network of bargains and agreements between the king and magnates who hold local power. The model is applied to the administration of Scotland under King David I (1124–1153). David I consolidated and expanded his authority by providing magnates who held local power with incentives to cooperate through the strategic distribution of revenue and provision of protection services, including the enforcement of property rights, dispute resolution and the facilitation of exchange. This theory is also used to explain Scotland’s appropriation of land in northern England following the death of Henry I of England in 1135, and its loss of the same territory after David I died in 1153.
B11|The Ohlin-Keynes Debate on the German Interwar Reparations Revisited| This paper analyzes the debate between Ohlin and Keynes on the question as to whether Germany was able to make the payments specified in the Dawes Plan. Keynes argued that Germany was able to collect the money but unable to transfer it to the victors because there existed an insurmountable “transfer problem”. Ohlin replied that such a “transfer problem” did not exist and, therefore, that Germany was able to make the payments stipulated by the Dawes Committee. This paper analyzes the positions of the two contenders and argues that the problems are not correctly delimited and that the theoretical bases of the contenders show serious deficiencies. It also brings to light some interesting theoretical and practical paradoxes that neither Keynes nor Ohlin dealt with.
B11|The myth of Bryson and economic thought in Islam|The inspiration for the present note comes primarily from a statement in the old edition of the Encyclopaedia of Islam. In its volume four on page number 595, Heffening (1934) states that to Helmut Ritter ‘the whole economic literature of Islam can be traced to economics of Neo-pythagorean Bryson’ (emphasis added). In 1917 the German writer Ritter edited and translated Abu Ja`far al-Dimashqi’s treatise Kitab al-Isharah ila Mahasin al-Tijarah. In his introduction of the book he noted the said remark. It is this unqualified statement that we dispute here.

B11|Economic and Religious Choice: A Case-Study from Early Christian Communities|The aim of this paper is to elaborate an evaluative framework of religious choice within the early Christian communities reconstructed through the narrative of a New Testament Epistle, 2Peter, based on an economic approach to moral dilemmas identified in this context. Thus the work concentrates on the stances, attitudes and social practices of deviant members who engaged in free-riding within early Christian congregations and were exposed to serious self-control problems. In our attempt to employ economic theories of religion, we are in a position to better assess the efficiency of early Christian responses to the entry of competing groups in the religious market of this era, as well as to identify and explore the sort of criteria that determine the intertemporal choices of distinct religious actors.

Whereas Marx built his political and scientific criticism on economic analysis, Rousseau believed this analysis could not be the starting point for understanding social organization. Their monetary theories can explain this difference.

Sans malheureusement pouvoir créer un véritable parti, ils n’ont été que des fonctionnaires faisant partie d’une classe politique en formation.

B11|La política ilustrada y el libre comercio de granos: las ‘Reflexiones económico-políticas’ (1768) de Tomás Anzano|This article analyses Reflexiones económico-políticas (1768) by the economist Tomás Anzano, whose contribution has almost been ignored historiographycalIy. An important work in the Spanish literature of the 18th century, Reflexiones must be contextualized within the debate on the agrarian markets liberalization and, in particular, subsistence goods developed by the European Enlightenment. Reflexiones constitutes an original and pragmatic but at the same time a moderate adaptation to the real interior market of the liberal legislation of 1765. Anzano's proposals on agriculture, based in the scholastic theory of prices, should take into account the contemporary political background: the Enlightened economic reform, the growing weight of the royal prerogatives in the political institutions, and the beginning of the economic demands of the territories that made up the Borbonic monarchy. AH together links Anzano to the structure of political power, because he was a part of it and also due to the fact that he stablished closed relationships with two of the main Aragonese politicians at that time: Manuel de Roda and the Count of Aranda.
B11|Contract enforcement and institutions among the Maghribi Traders: Refuting Edwards and Ogilvie|Edwards and Ogilvie (2008) dispute the empirical basis for the view (Greif, e.g., 1989, 1994,2006) that multilateral reputation mechanism mitigated agency problems among the eleventh-century Maghribi traders. They assert that the relations among merchants and agents were law-based. This paper refutes this assertion using quantitative and documentary evidence thereby vindicating the position that the legal system had a marginal role in mitigating agency problems in long-distance trade in this historical era. Edwards and Ogilvie constantly present legal actions in non-trade related legal cases as evidence for a reliance on the legal system for matters pertaining to long-distance trade. Their criticism of Greif’s documentary analysis also fails scrutiny. The claim that merchants' relations with their overseas agents were law-based is wrong. This paper is based on quantitative analyses of the corpuses containing the hundreds of documents on which the literature relies and a careful review of the documents and the literature Edwards and Ogilvie cite. Their assertion is shown to be based on unrepresentative and irrelevant examples, an inaccurate description of the literature, and a consistent misreading of the few sources they consulted. In particular, their examples for the use of the court are mainly taken from mandatory legal procedures associated with sorting out the assets and liabilities of deceased traders’ estates. Such examples do not support the claim that agency relations were law-based. The quantitative analysis reveals that empirical basis for the multilateral reputation view is stronger than originally perceived. This paper also sheds light on the roles of the legal system and reputation mechanism during this period.

B11|Money and Markets:Introduction|In the history of economic thought the relationship between money and market has been interpreted from two contrasting points of view. On the one hand, money is seen as an instrument created by individuals to overcome the difficulties involved in barter, its basic function being as a medium of exchange, while the other view has it that money developed before the market and that its principal function is that of a standard of value. Evidently, therefore, in the former case the unit of account function is seen to have emerged from a practice (exchange of goods and services) based on the advantages to be had for individuals seeking to maximise their utility, while in the latter case money emerges as a rule adopted by members of the community (the political authorities promoting it and ensuring it be respected) which pre-dates the market. As in the case of money, also for the market two approaches have come into confrontation in the course of the history of economic thought. With the first the market is seen as a column bearing the economies characterised by private property and freedom of enterprise. It represents the means by which members of society democratically come to decisions about the use of resources and distribution of income. In the second approach, on the other hand, the market is seen as the means by which decisions on the use of resources and distribution of income, once taken by the groups enjoying economic command, are passed on to the other members of society to be implemented. In the first case the market lies at the heart of the system and serves to prevent the enjoyment of privileges and position rents by some members of society excluding others, while in the second it merely plays a supporting role for the existing patterns of power.

Cantillon’s Essai sur la nature du commerce en général (1755) is considered a major work in the context of the economic literature of the European Enlightenment, and, therefore, its analytical and normative aspects have been widely studied. However, the characteristics of its international circulation, with some exceptions, like its diffusion in France and Great Britain, are less known. Taking as a starting point the available research, the article mainly focuses on three case studies to asses the reception of the Essai among the Spanish economists. KEY Classification-JEL: B11, B31
B11|L'échange et la loi. Le statut de la rationalité chez Rousseau|The economic thought of Jean-Jacques Rousseau has often been reduced to some pieces on money, inequalities, luxury and autarky. Compared to contemporary writings of Quesnay, Smith or Hume, it has been considered for long as backward. Jean Mathiot has however shown that, far from being backward-looking, Rousseau’s economic thought can been seen as a significant move of the political philosophy in its relation with political economy. The ambition of this article is to show, through the example of the economic exchange, that the relation between politics and economics cannot be reduced to an hegemony of the political rationality. The economic rationality appears, on the contrary, constituent of the legitimate civil state including in its most negative expression, I mean autarky.

B11|Le Rôle Des Préférences Individuelles Dans La Controverse Condillac-Le Trosne Sur La Valeur Et Les Prix|The various interpreting traditions agree to state that if there is a point on which Condillac and the Physiocrats disagree, it is indeed that of the value and the prices. However, by studying the controversy between Condillac and Le Trosne on these subjects, this article takes at first the opposite course of this point of view. It shows that a transposition of the arguments of the one in the language of the other, reduces to a very few things the divergences between the two men. Le Trosne so adopts a position on the individual evaluation of goods which is very close to that of Condillac, whereas the later explains the setting of prices mostly by calling upon the confrontation of supplied and demanded quantities, in the way of his Physiocratic opponent. The real caesura is actually underlying the debate between the two men, but is never expressed clearly. For Condillac, it is the individual choices, through the change in preferences, that modify prices, while the Physiocrat thinks actors' preferences have no incidence on them.
B11|Why should we consider Rousseau as an economist?|The received idea is that he could not miss the science of modernity. But if we investigate what can be considered as the economic thought of Rousseau, we must be distinguish two different lines of thought: one which has to do with the division of labour (to be mostly found in Emile and the second Discourse), the other one, about economics proper, to be found in the Discourse on Political Economy. In this latter work, we see that Rousseau is keen on maintaining the difference between two social spheres: the family and the civil, or political, sphere. There is no possibility, for him, of a universal or uniform pattern of rational behaviour equally valid in both areas. As to division of labour, he sees it not as a means to independence, but, on the contrary, as a way of becoming more and more dependant of the others. That is why economic processes should be submitted to political control in order to be conducive to liberty.
B11|The notion of work in the Emile of J.J. Rousseau|"According to Rousseau, work teaches us wisdom about time and a sense of selfness and reality which protect everybody from imagination, passions and society harms. ""The worker does not dream"" will say S.Weil. What notion ofwork is here implied? Nothing which could be later found in classical Political Economy, Marx or the socio-economy. Rousseau indeed thinks work is an access to economy, but his economy remains under the rule of the usevalue. It is a qualitative economy."
B11|Rousseau, ethic and economy. The model of Clarens in the Nouvelle Héloïse|Rousseau offers a reformulation of the concept of economy that can clear the contemporary debate devoted to the relations between ethic and economy. His philosophy allows to define economy according to ethic categories: ethic values and economic values enter in an exchange system; economy aims at prosperity but it is animated by ethic rules and motivations such as compassion or benevolence. Ethic is also understood in a economic way. Rousseau's moral economy is an art of enjoyment which includes both material enjoyment and moral enjoyment.
B11|Rousseau and division of labor: from robinson to the economic agent|"Rousseau shares with neo-classical theory a characterization of the economic agent, as a producer, based on the figure of Robinson. But whereas neo-classical economy expresses, through Robinson, the rational behavior of any economic agent, Rousseau considers on the contrary that the individual inserted in division of labor risks, unfortunately, to divert from Robinson behavior. For him, division of labor does not add a coordination problem to the problem of individual choice; it corrupts the agent's judgment and desires. A ""good"" division of labor would be one in which the agent would find again Robinson's judgment and independence. It is not feasible."

In this period and in particular during the Industrial Revolution the economists argue the main effects of inventions and machines for consumers and entrepreneurs such as reduction of price, change of labour, improvement of international competition, rise of salaries, unemployment, economic growth and wealth of nations. Their discussions which are relevant, put forward the basis of the modern discipline of the Economics of innovation.
B11|Kautilya on Time Inconsistency Problem and Asymmetric Information|Although Kautilya does not provide any formal analysis, his approach contains almost all the ingredients of a game theory. He was certainly not aware of the numerous new jargons, such as sequential rationality, Bayes-Nash equilibrium, subgame perfection, backward induction, and forward induction, which have been added to the vocabulary during the past few decades to study strategic interactions. However, he clearly lays out an extensive form of a game and lists all the possible options available to a king on each node. He incorporates foresight, asymmetric information, and the possibility of ‘time inconsistency’ into his analysis of strategic interactions.
B11|Individual deliberation, moral autonomy and emotions: Rousseau on citizenship|The present study addresses the question of uncertainty in individual deliberation in Rousseau’s philosophy. Accordingly, it intends to consider in a new light his account of virtue and citizenship which cannot possibly be defined as systematic obedience to the general will. Weakness of the will, indeterminacy and prudence have not yet been adequately emphasized, despite some convincing evidence. Chapter XI, book III, of the Social Contract on the death of the body politic, for example, prompts us to reconsider the individuals’ allegiance to the general will. However, it would be equally extreme to dismiss the core of his thought which affirms the legitimate superiority of the general will over particular desires. Rather it will be illustrated here that, when brought together, these two propositions provide a fruitful way of approaching this ethical issue.

B11|The usury doctrine and urban public finances in late-medieval Flanders (1220 - 1550): rentes (annuities), excise taxes, and income transfers from the poor to the rich|The objectives of this study are three-fold. The first is to rebut Charles Kindleberger’s famous dictum that usury ‘belongs less to economic history than to the history of ideas’; and in particular to demonstrate that the resuscitation of the anti-usury campaign from the early 13th century led to a veritable financial revolution in late-medieval French and Flemish towns: one that became the ‘norm’ in modern European states from the 16th century (in England, from 1693): a shift in public borrowing from interest-bearing loans to the sale of annuities, usually called rentes or renten. That anti-usury campaign had two major features: (1) the decrees of the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215, which provided harsh punishments – excommunication -- for both unrepentant usurers and princes who failed to suppress them; and (2) the establishment of the two mendicant preaching orders: the Franciscans (1210) and the Dominicans (1216), whose monks preached hellfire and eternal damnation against all presumed usurers – including, of course, anyone who received any interest on government loans. There is much evidence that from the 1220s, many financiers in many French and Flemish towns, fearing for their immortal souls, preferred to accept far lower returns on buying rentes than the interest they would have earned on loans. These rentes, based on 8th-century Carolingian census contracts, had two basic forms: (1) life-annuities, by which a citizen purchased from the government, with a lump sum of capital, an annual income stream lasting a lifetime, or the lifetime of his wife as well; (2) perpetual annuities, by which the annual income stream was indeed perpetual, or until such time as the government chose to redeem the rentes, at par. Initially, some theologians opposed sales of rentes as subterfuges to cloak evasion of the usury doctrine. But in 1250-1, Pope Innocent IV declared them to be non-usurious contracts, essentially because they were not loans. Subsequent popes in the 15th century confirmed his views and the non-usurious character of rentes, on two conditions: (1) that the buyer of the rente could never demand redemption or repayment, and (2) that the annual annuity payments (and any ultimate redemptions) be in accordance with actual rent contracts: i.e., that the funds be derived from the products of the land. Ecclesiastical authorities soon agreed that taxes on the consumption of the products of the land (and sea) met this test: i.e., taxes on beer and wine (which always accounted for the largest share), bread, textiles, fish, meat, dairy products, etc. The second objective is to measure the importance of 'rentes' in the civic finances of Flemish towns, in terms of both revenues and expenditures: from the annual town accounts Ghent (14th century only), and Aalst (1395-1550), where they had far greater importance. The related third objective is to measure the burden of the excise taxes for master building craftsmen in Aalst, in tables that measure the values of the excise tax revenues expressed in real terms: first, in the equivalent number of ‘baskets of consumables’ (which form of the base of the Consumer Price Index), and second their value in terms of the annual money-wage incomes of master masons (for 210 days). This provides an entirely new look at the late-medieval ‘standard of living’ controversy – with indications that this consumption-tax burden sometimes rose from about 13,200 to almost 30,000 days’ wage income, for a town of perhaps 3600 inhabitants (but obviously less dramatic on a per capita basis). That tax burden rose the most strongly when, by other indications, real wages (RWI = NWI/CPI) were also finally rising; and thus possibly these real wage gains were largely eliminated. That per capita tax burden would have been all the greater if, in the course of the 15th century, Aalst had experienced the same decline as did small towns of Brabant, to the east, on the order of 25%, and some other Flemish towns, in which the population decline varied from 9% to 28 %. In earlier publications I had challenged the widespread view that the era following the Black Death, with a radical change in the land:labour ratio, came to be a ‘Golden Age’ of the artisan and labourer. I contended instead that frequent inflations eroded or eliminated wage gains, and thus that periodic rises in real wages were due essentially to steep deflations combined with pronounced wage-stickiness. As I also calculated, English artisans in the 1340s had earned real wages that were about 50% of the Flemish; but by the 1480s, they had narrowed that gap (with much less inflation) to about 80%. That gap was probably even smaller, until the 1640s, when England’s Parliament finally imposed similar excise taxes on consumption.
B11|Perception of market and pricing among the sixteenth century Muslim scholars|The present paper investigates the perception of market and mechanism of pricing among the sixteenth century Muslim scholars, a period hitherto unexplored. In the commencement it briefly states the insufficient attention that the subject of market – the most fundamental element of Economics – has received in the conventional economics. To set a proper perspective it examines the situation in the Islamic tradition in earlier centuries before it studies the understanding of market and pricing among the Muslim scholars of the study period. It also deals with their stand regarding the price regulation. For comparison purpose, it examines the treatment of market and pricing in the work of their contemporary Western scholars. The paper ends with a note on 'just price', one of the most important economic concepts in the medieval period.
B11|The Paradox of Happiness: Evidence from the Late Pre-Classical and Classical Economic Thought|A number of studies have shown that considerable increases in real per capita income do not correspond to equivalent increases of reported individual happiness.This finding has been termed the paradox of happiness. The paper discusses this paradox by drawing from the history of economic thought. More specifically, it argues that the idea of basic and non-basic needs can be an alternative way of approaching this paradox. The basis of this idea can be found in pre-classical economic thought and also in the works of major classical economists. Thus, it is shown that preclassical and classical views on hierarchical consumption, basic needs and their links with happiness and material consumption might provide an alternative explanation of the happiness paradox.
B11|David Ricardo, Contemporary Economist|David Ricardo (1772-1823) was one of the most important economists of the world. He got fortune, he became banker and then he turned towards the study of Political Economy. What did this important economist bring new within the economic thinking, considered by the economic critics as a “liberalist pessimistic”, he who was among the first who introduced the biologic factor in the development equation? This is what the current study is outlining by pointing out to some updated coordinates and ranking him among the first well-known contemporary economists in the world.

B11|Tawney's Century (1540-1640): the Roots of Modern Capitalist Entrepreneurship in England|Richard Tawney (1880-1962), who taught at the London School of Economics from 1917 to 1949, was unquestionably one of the very most important economic historians that England has ever produced: so much so, indeed, that the era of his major research and publications, 1540 - 1640, has justly come to be known as ï¿½Tawneyï¿½s Centuryï¿½. Those publications, and the debates that they provoked, concern the origins or roots of modern capitalism and (implicitly) capitalist entrepreneurship that were supposed to have been established in this century. Though the roots of those economic developments, in particular those leading to more modern forms of industrial capitalism, may indeed lie in that century, nevertheless the main thesis of this study is that most of their positive fruits are instead to be found in the ensuing century of 1640 - 1740, the century preceding the advent of the modern Industrial Revolution. Tawneyï¿½s seminal scholarship, towards these ends, was concerned with two major issues. The first considered in this study is his 1926 monograph: Religion and the Rise of Capitalism, which in part was designed to promote, in the English-speaking world, Max Weberï¿½s famous thesis (1905) on ï¿½The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalismï¿½. Both works focused on how three elements of one Protestant sect in particular, the Calvinists (from 1536), came to influence so deeply that Protestant Ethic and new ethos of modern capitalism: Predestination, the Calling, and ï¿½Worldly Asceticismï¿½. The significance of this form of Protestantism in England is that Calvinists and other Non-Conformists or Dissenters, those who refused to conform to the Church of England after the 1660 royalist Restoration, constituted about one half of the known scientists, innovators, and entrepreneurs from the later 17th century and through the Industrial Revolution era (1760-1820), though constituting only 5 percent of the population. The debate concerns the roles of their restricted (legislated) minority status and of schools and superior educational systems that they had to establish, but also the applicability of the Weber-Tawney thesis, in explaining their superior economic performance. Tawneyï¿½s second major issue was that of ï¿½agrarian capitalismï¿½, along with the supposed ï¿½rise of the gentryï¿½: involving the transfer of vast amounts of land from the old aristocracy, the crown and church together, and finally the free-holding yeomanry into the hands of a non-aristocratic upper class who were far more predisposed and able to engage in profit-maximizing agriculture, especially through enclosures and the technology of the New Husbandry. But if Tawney dates this shift from Henry VIIIï¿½s Dissolution of the Monasteries, in 1536, this study contends that the real shift, but certainly a major shift, to ï¿½agrarian capitalismï¿½, involving enclosures and the New Husbandry, again came only after the 1660s. To provide a contrast to Tawneyï¿½s work, this study examines two alternative theses on the origins of modern industrial capitalism within Tawneyï¿½s century (1540-1640): (1) Earl Hamiltonï¿½s thesis of ï¿½Profit Inflationï¿½, one fully endorsed by Keynes; and (2) John Nefï¿½s ï¿½Early Industrial Revolution in Tudor-Stuart Englandï¿½. The Hamilton thesis is rejected in this study, with the contention that its true importance was to inspire Nefï¿½s counter-thesis: on the decisive shift from wood and charcoal fuels to coal fuels, which in turn required very major technological changes (in furnace designs), which in turn led to major increases in industrial scale, and (for Nef) to true ï¿½industrial capitalismï¿½. This study, noting the importance of Wrigleyï¿½s similar thesis on a shift from an organic (wood-based) to an inorganic (coal-based) industrial economy, supports the essence of the Nef thesis ï¿½ but only for the period after 1640 (with new data). Finally, this study considers two other related changes so necessary for the development of early-modern capitalism, in this era: the development of the Full Rigged or Atlantic Ship (but from the 1450s) and the overseas joint-stock trading companies. Again, their major impact came after 1660, with the ï¿½New Colonialismï¿½ (Hobsbawm) or ï¿½Commercial Revolutionï¿½ (Davis). The study also considers the history of the English joint stock companies, from the first joint-stock company, in overseas trade (the Muscovy Company of 1553) to the Bubble Act of 1720, which restricted their formation until 1825. Also included is their role in the so-called ï¿½Financial Revolutionï¿½ from 1694 to 1757 (ï¿½Pelhamsï¿½s Conversionï¿½ of the national debt).
B11|La Economía en los diccionarios y las enciclopedias del Siglo XVIII en España|This article tackles with the economic content of the Spanish encyclopaedic literature of the 18th Century. After having analysed the genealogy of the dictionaries of commerce of the European Enlightenment, the paper studies the Spanish projects, as well as the economic content of the Spanish encyclopaedic literature of the Eighteen Century. The works analysed gather the translations of foreign works, but mainly the Spanish original compilations that embraced encyclopaedias, specialized dictionaries on political economy or commerce and other dictionaries on topics linked to economics, like agriculture, arts and crafts, geography or public finance. Lexicographical dictionaries, in particular those that defined the terms related to arts and crafts, have been also studied.
B11|« Équilibre » et fiscalité au Siècle des lumières. L'économie politique de Jean-Joseph Graslin|The Jean-Joseph Graslin’s Essai analytique sur la richesse et sur l’impôt [1767] is at the same time one of the most brilliant critical analysis of physiocracy and the synthesis of a systematic thought which announces the sensualist political economy of the end of the Ancien Régime. The author, who argues in terms of needs and utility, describes a generalized trade economy in which the prices of goods and the means of production are determined by market forces. Refusing the logical framework of Quesnay and his disciples, Graslin defines an “equilibrium” which includes social inequalities and taxation. Classification JEL : B11, B31
B11|Les Monnaies De La Republique. Un Retour Sur Les Idees Monetaires De Jean Bodin|Bodin’s monetary writings are mainly centred on the relationship between currencies and sovereignty. He aims at designing a monetary system that would be forgery, debasement and degradation proof. Having explained his conception of money and false money, we expose the way Bodin seeks to constrain the exercise of monetary sovereignty: by submitting debasements not to law but to the contract, by setting up an ideal monetary system and finally by defining an international constraint. The monetary sovereign power, which is absolute in its principle, appears to be under constraint in its exercise.
B11|Information and efficient allocation of productive means in a decentralized economy: Organization of markets in Turgot and Gustave de Molinari's works|This article shows the influence of Turgot over Gustave de Molinari's studies in efficient allocation of productive means in a decentralized markets economy. From Turgot's works on spatial organization of markets's grain as an answer to the spatial information problem, Molinari makes deeper the discussion on allocation of means. His contribution resids on the extension of Turgot's analysis to all of goods, in particular to labor, and on the connection, he makes, betwenn spatial organization of markets and the properly working of the gravitation process of prices which permits an efficient sectorial allocation of productive means
B11|Rodney Hilton, Marxism and the transition from feudalism to capitalism|An eminent medievalist and one of the most influential of the small band of Marxist historians working in the UK before 1968, Rodney Hilton’s work on the development of the English feudal system into industrial capitalism was, despite its renown, ultimately mistaken. The problems with Hilton’s account were largely inherited from Maurice Dobb, whose interpretation of Marxist theory led him to exaggerate the role of class struggle to the exclusion of other factors. These assumptions about the importance of class struggle in the transition from feudalism to capitalism were carried over from Dobb’s early work to the work of Hilton and the Marxist historians who followed him. Dobb’s account was predicated upon the inevitable failure of feudalism – an assumption that failed to explain the preceding five-hundred years of success and expansion. This paper looks at how Dobb’s revised understanding of the role of markets in socialist economies subsequently filtered through to Hilton’s reassessment of markets under feudalism, identifies the flaws in the analysis Dobb offered, and traces how these assumptions were carried through to the work of Hilton, before finally offering an alternate diagnosis of the “feudal crises” of the Marxist canon in terms of technical innovation.”
B11|A.-R.-J. Turgot and the Construction of an Economic Agent called Entrepreneur|The entrepreneurial function as just one factor of production is actually being the point of a depth discussion in entrepreneurship research. It could be the cause of some confusion which impeders theoretical developments and it also makes difficult the effectiveness of pro-entrepreneurial programs. The aim of this article is to analyse the origin of this factor of production. For this purpose, we look back to the 18th century in order to analyze Turgot’s works (1727-1781) by means of a new conceptual framework that distinguishes between different productive agents. A series of analytical problems are exposed when the entrepreneurship is linked to a separate economic agent.
B11|The Conceptual Roots of Work Effort in Pre-classical and Classical Economic Thought|In modern literature, the concept of work effort is used as an additional explanation of involuntary unemployment. In particular, it is assumed that higher wages have a positive effect on work effort and this is the fundamental point of the efficiency wage models of involuntary unemployment. However, as it is often the case, the concept of the workers' effort was not new but it was an idea that can be found in the works of a number of pre-classical and classical economists. This paper discusses the conceptual roots of the idea from the late 17th until the middle of the 19th centuries. For instance, there is evidence of the connection between wages, work effort and consumption in the works of North, Hume, Steuart, Smith, Young, Crumpe, Ricardo, Senior, McCulloch, Babbage, Longfield, J.S. Mill and others. The paper also assesses the similarities and differences of their views with current approaches to work effort.
B11|Cash waqf: is it a usurious piety?|The context of this discussion is Mandaville’s paper with the caption “Usurious Piety: The Cash Waqf Controversy in the Ottoman Empire” published in International Journal of Middle East Studies, August 1979, No. 10, pp. 289-308.). It gave an impression that the cash waqf meant practicing usurious activities under the disguise of a pious endowment. Otherwise a very informative work, its heading is misleading. The present paper critically examines this paper.
B11|Morality, institutions and economic growth: Lessons from ancient Greece|We show that the character and the morality of citizens are important ingredients of economic growth because they go hand in hand with the great institutions of private property, democ-racy, and free markets. Our approach enables us to establish this result by reference to the structure and performance of the ancient economies of Athens and Sparta during the period 490-338 BC. Athens grew vastly wealthier than Sparta essentially because its institutions were optimally adjusted to confront the basic scarcity of grains, whereas the institutions of Sparta were optimally adjusted to sustain its military supremacy. However, in both cases there emerged systems of morality, which secured the operating efficiency of their institutions. Therefore, poor countries in search of potent strategies for rapid economic growth should not just try to emulate the institutions of economically advanced countries. At the same time, they should put the emphasis of their efforts to setting up agoge systems, so as to infuse into the character of their citizens compatible “ethos”. For, without the latter, no matter how success-fully they adapt the institutions of democracy and free markets, rapid economic growth will be inhibited from the lack of an environment of generalized morality. In this regard, the ideal type model of agoge is the one that prevailed in ancient Athens 25 centuries ago.
B11|Ritorno alle Riduzioni|In one of his earlier articles, Giancarlo Mazzocchi argued that the Paraguay Reductions could not be considered communist since they showed an evolution towards more independent work on plots entrusted to individual families. But he did not give any evidence of this surmised evolution. Indeed, the historian Eberhard Gothein offered a compelling reason why this could not happen. Work on public and private plots had to be monitored, and it was almost impossible to monitor work performed on private plots. The Reductions can be seen as arising from an implicit contract whereby the Guarany tribes yielded sovereignty to the Jesuit leaders, in exchange for (i) safety from the Spanish colonists and (ii) subsistence. Thus subsistence for the Guaranis become a basic, public task of the Reductions. Thus considered, the «Guarany republics» do qualify as communistic. That education was also carried out publicly, thus engendering an «ethical state», is another concurrent consideration.
B11|Cantillon, Quesnay, and the Tableau Economique|Schumpeter argued, long ago, that Quesnay's tableau economique was based on Cantillon, but this claim has never been spelled out in detail and seems not to have been generally accepted, since many writers still write of the tableau economique as though it were Quesnay's alone. This paper examines the relation between Cantillon and Quesnay in more detail than before and argues (a) that the relation between Cantillon's analysis of circulation and Quesnay's tableau is too close to be a coincidence, but (b) that the use Quesnay put it to is quite different from its role in Cantillon's system.
B11|Business culture and entrepreneurship in the Ionian Islands under British rule, 1815-1864|This paper explores the emergence of a business culture among merchants and entrepreneurs in the Ionian Islands during the period of British rule (1815-1864). New forms of business organisation (the joint-stock company), and novel commercial practices, such as advertising, represent examples of institutional but also cultural change. The petitions of merchants, submitted to the central administration, demonstrate the specific strategies used to pursue commercial interests. The changes introduced during the period of British rule, continuing long-established relations with western economic powers, and the existence of a multi-cultural business world in the port towns of the islands advanced the business opportunities for the merchants resident there (foreigners or nationals) but also advanced the integration of the Ionian Islands to the wider Mediterranean and world market. The Ionian Islands case provides an opportunity to look at the formation of networks and institutions through the articulation and promotion of interests by merchants. The paper proceeds as follows; theoretical and historiographical influences are acknowledged and clarified first while the aspects of institutional change and the new forms of business organisation are presented afterwards. These are followed by examples of petitions submitted by merchants on commercial issues, and some attempts to draw conclusions and generalise from the Ionian case are made at the end.
B11|Montesquieu as an economist (In French)|The purpose of this paper is to reappraise Montesquieu’s thinkings in economy. To Joseph Schumpeter his economic is insignificant - without originality force, or scholarship. According to John-Maynard Keynes, Montesquieu was the real French equivalent of Adam Smith, the greatest of French economists, head and shoulders above the physiocrats in penetration, clear-headedness and good sense. This controversy invites us to undertake an investigation of Montesquieu’s views in economy. This article explores thoughtfully his works and proposes an application of heuristic reading systematic and very progressive too. About all of the subjects (interest rate, money, luxury expenditures, state’s position in society, taxation, public debt, international trade) we try to place Montesquieu in the opposition between interventionism and laisser-faire. Through this analysis J-B. Say, J-M Keynes, J. Schumpeter opinions on Montesquieu become clear especially on interest rate issue. Finally, we conclude that Montesquieu is one of the few French economists to propose a monetary analysis of the interest rate, but his liberal doctrinal leads him to reject all the form of interventionism particularly in the monetary sphere. Definitely, Montesquieu’s just one link of the liberal chain in Europe.
