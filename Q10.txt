Q10|Corporate social responsibility and the role of rural women in sustainable agricultural development in sub‐Saharan Africa: Evidence from the Niger Delta in Nigeria|Low productivity among female farmers when compared with their male counterparts is considered an outcome of limited access to agricultural land and inputs. The objective of this investigation was to assess the impact of multinational oil companies' (MOCs') corporate social responsibility (CSR) on rural women's access to modern agricultural inputs in the Niger Delta, Nigeria. A total of 700 rural female farmers were sampled across the region. Results from the use of a logit model indicated that CSR recorded significant success in agricultural development generally, but has undermined equality. This implies that if a woman's agricultural productivity is continuously hindered by unequal access to agricultural resources (or opportunities) and widespread inequality will limit poverty reduction efforts in Nigeria. The results also showed that women depended on CSR of MOCs for policy dialogue and advocacy for women's access to agricultural land and inputs. Supporting agricultural initiatives that focus on empowering women would boost food security in sub‐Saharan Africa.
Q10|Multinational Oil Companies in Nigeria and Corporate Social Responsibility in the HIV/AIDS Response in Host Communities|We assess the impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) of multinational oil companies (MOCs) on HIV/AIDS prevalence in Nigeria’s oil producing communities. One thousand, two hundred households were sampled across the rural communities of Niger Delta. Using logit model, the main result indicates that General Memorandum of Understandings (GMoUs) have not significantly impacted on factors behind the spread of HIV/AIDS in rural communities. This implies that the impact of the disease on MOCs business, employees and their families, contractors, business partners and the oil communities has not inclined downward. The findings suggest that CSR offers an opportunity for MOCs to help address HIV/AIDS prevalence through a business case for stakeholders’ health in the region. It calls for MOCs to improve GMoUs health intervention on sensitization campaigns, funding testing and counselling centers, subsidizing anti-retroviral drugs, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, rehabilitation of orphaned and vulnerable children and other cares for people living with AIDS.

Q10|Corporate Social Responsibility in Nigeria and Rural Youths in Sustainable Traditional Industries Livelihood in Oil Producing Communities|Since the first oil well was drilled in Nigeria, traditional economies have suffered neglect, and rural youths do not see a future for themselves in traditional industries livelihood (TIL). We examine the impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) of multinational oil companies (MOCs) on youths’ participation in TIL. A total of 1200 youths were sampled across the rural Niger Delta. Results from the use of a logit model indicate a significant relationship between CSR and TIL. The findings suggest increased general memorandum of understanding (GMoU) interventions in canoe-carving, pottery-making, cloth-weaving, mat-making, and basket-weaving to revive the traditional economic activities in Nigeria.
Q10|Electronic wallet technology and the enabling environment of smallholder farmers in Nigeria|Purpose â€“ The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the impact of growth enhancement support scheme (GESS) on the enabling environment of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Its special focus is to investigate the GESS impact on access to rural farm credit and transport cost of smallholder farmers in the agricultural transformation agenda (ATA) in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach â€“ This paper adopts a survey research technique, aimed at gathering information from a representative sample of the population, as it is essentially cross-sectional that describes and interprets what exist at present. A total of one thousand, two hundred farmers were sampled across the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. Findings â€“ Results from the use of a double-hurdle model indicate that the GESS has a significant impact on farmersâ€™ access to credit, but does not significantly affect rural farm transport cost, which subsequently influence the price of food in the country. Practical implication â€“ This implies that if the federal government of Nigeria is to work towards an ideal agricultural transformation agenda, transport networks should be closely aligned with the GESS priorities to provide connectivity to rural areas that provide most of the countryâ€™s agricultural output. Originality/value â€“ This research adds to the literature on agricultural and rural development debate in developing countries. It concludes that embracing rural finance and transportation infrastructure should form the foundation of the ATA in Nigeria, which in turn would provide the enabling environment for more widespread rural economy in sub-Saharan Africa.
Q10|Corporate social responsibility in Nigeria and multinational corporations in the fight against human trafficking in oil-producing communities|In Nigeria, human trafficking is a hidden crime, driven by the current economic situation of the country. The Nigerian government has demonstrated significant efforts to combating human trafficking in the country by creating the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP). The incidents of human trafficking in the Nigeriaâ€™s oil-producing communities have remained among the highest in the country and higher than the national average. The objective of this investigation was to determine the impact of a new corporate social responsibility (CSR) model of multinational oil companies (MOCs) on the fight against human trafficking in the host communities. A total of one thousand, two hundred households were sampled across the rural communities of Niger Delta. Results from the use of a combined propensity score matching and logit model indicated that MOCs hold the key to combating human trafficking by fostering effective partnership across different sectors, if highest CSR priority is assigned to reducing incidents of human trafficking in the oil-producing communities. Embracing the fight against human trafficking should form the foundation of General Memorandum of Understanding (GMoUs) practice, which in turn will provide the enabling environment for more widespread responsible business. As most of the human trafficking in the Niger Delta is exploited by relatives or friends; MOCs should involve traditional and religious leaders in the fight and set up GMoU clusters interventions specifically for anti-trafficking agencies including NAPTIP, the police and immigration to support their actions and improve efficiency.
Q10|Les performances économiques de l’élevage européen : de la « compétitivité coût » à la « compétitivité hors coût »|"The European Union (EU) has, since a long time, an important role in the international livestock industry chains, both in terms of production and trade. In spite of a strong restructuring movement, mainly due to factor productivity gains, European livestock brings together farms that are still very heterogeneous in terms of productive combinations, size, social structuring, intensification and economic performance. To report on it, and based on data issued from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), an analysis of the diversity of structural and economic situations is conducted for farms specializing in the production of milk, beef and pigs/poultry, for the ten most productive EU Member States in animal production. This stage is a necessary prerequisite for reflection which begins after on the main levers of the economic performance of European animal productions. Two types of levers are then distinguished. The first concerns ""cost competitiveness"". It successively discusses the substitutions between factors of production, the economies of scale, the geographical concentration of production, the structuring of sectors and the influence of agricultural policies. The second concerns « non-cost competitiveness ». It deals with the sanitary quality of animal productions, the differentiation of products and production processes, and the conditions for the capturing of added value induced by producers."
Q10|Le volet agricole de l’Observatoire Socio-Économique de la LGV Bretagne Pays-de-la-Loire|[paper in French] In the frame of the socio-economic monitoring of the Bretagne-Pays-de-la-Loire high-speed line (LGV BPL), a dedicated working group has been set up to study the direct and indirect impacts of the infrastructure on the farming sector. Gathering all the concerned stakeholders, this group aims to coordinate and follow the progress of the various studies on the topic. Three of this studies are presented here in addition to a benchmark description of the main agricultural characteristics in the concerned area. Are so reported a study on the degree of farmland fragmentation, another one on the size change dynamics of farms, and a last one dealing with farmers’ adaptation strategies in reaction to such a large project. Even though these studies have not yet all produced operational results, we hope that they will all contribute to objectivize the debate which arose when the project was launched and the observatory was set up.
Q10|Cows, cash and climate: Low stocking rates, high-performing cows, emissions and profitability across New Zealand farms|Using the New Zealand Monitor Farm Data (NZMFD), this paper explores the cost-effectiveness of two mitigation options to reduce biological greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on farms: reducing stocking rate (SR; the number of cows per effective hectare of dairy land); and increasing animal performance (AP; measured by production of milk solids (MS) per cow). These mitigation options have been defined as “no cost” because, if applied together, they could reduce the carbon footprint of farms while also maintaining or even improving profits (de Klein & Dynes, 2017). We evaluate the effect of these mitigation options on three main variables: milk profitability of the farm (cash operating surplus (COS)/ton of MS produced); emissions intensity (ton CO2eq/ton of MS produced); and the value of emissions (COS/ton CO2eq). The paper has two main findings: high-AP farms show significantly lower emissions intensities and higher milk profitability; and higher SRs on farms are significantly associated with lower emissions intensities while not being significantly associated with milk profitability or negatively associated with profit per hectare. These results imply that higher levels of AP reduce the GHG intensity of the farm and increase profit – a “no-cost” option – but unless either the SR or the area under dairy farming fall, an increase in AP will lead to an increase in absolute emissions. However, our results cast doubt on the idea that reducing SR is a no-cost way to achieve absolute emission reductions. The two options do seem to constitute a no-cost outcome when combined, but potentially the same mitigation could be achieved with lower loss of profit by reducing the area of dairy land while maintaining high SRs and increasing the performance of the animals.
Q10|The Development of Modern Agricultural History within Economic History in Spain|This paper analyses the evolution of modern agricultural history in Spain within the framework of the development of the discipline of economic history. This analysis is divided into five thematic parts: production, productivity and technical change; the international insertion of Spanish agriculture; the institutional framework; long-term visions; and finally, recent developments and some deficits. It is interesting to emphasize that research on agricultural economic history in Spain has been carried out adopting methodologies, questions and developments similar to those of researchers from other advanced countries. Spanish agricultural economic history is one of the most powerful in the international context.
Q10|The fundamental causes of economic growth: a comparative analysis of the total factor productivity growth of European agriculture, 1950-2005|In recent decades, the debate on economic growth has largely focused the role-played by institutions, geography, trade, and culture. In line with this concern, this study analyses the underlying causes of agricultural productivity growth in Europe in the second half of the twentieth century. To achieve this objective, a calculation of the Total Factor Productivity growth in European agriculture is made and an econometric model is proposed to determine the importance of these fundamental causes. Our study highlights that inclusive institutions, policies to support agriculture that do not discourage innovation, qualified human capital and a full openness to international trade are key factors for favouring growth of productivity in agriculture.
Q10|Adecuación de tierras y el desarrollo de la agricultura colombiana: políticas e instituciones|La adecuación de tierras, en general, y el riego, en particular, desempeñan un papel muy importante en el crecimiento y el desarrollo de la agricultura. Por ejemplo, la irrigación impacta la mayor productividad de los cultivos, lo que repercute en un mayor nivel de ingresos de los agricultores y en la reducción de la pobreza rural. En Colombia, a pesar de que la política agropecuaria ha tenido como uno de sus principales instrumentos la adecuación de tierras, en la actualidad, la utilización del riego en las actividades agropecuarias se encuentra lejos de sus potenciales. Esto contrasta con los avances que en esta materia han tenido algunas naciones latinoamericanas (como Brasil, Chile, México y Perú). Dada la importancia que tienen la adecuación de tierras y el riego para el crecimiento y el desarrollo de la agricultura y el sector rural, así como el importante potencial de expansión que tiene el sector agropecuario del país, Fedesarrollo adelantó el presente estudio, cuyo objetivo es establecer la situación actual de la adecuación de tierras y el riego en Colombia y, con base en dicho análisis, proponer las medidas de política e institucionales necesarias para expandir el uso del riego en las actividades agropecuarias.
Q10|Análisis de experiencias de modelos asociativos como mecanismo para el desarrollo empresarial en la ruralidad|En este trabajo estudiamos algunos de estos modelos, con un enfoque diferente. A saber, analizamos modelos asociativos de características diferentes, identificamos buenas y malas prácticas y hacemos recomendaciones de política. Para ello, recolectamos información cuantitativa y cualitativa –entrevistas, registros e información secundaria– de empresas y productores de nueve modelos asociativos en cuatro sectores: palma, cacao, leche y panela. El trabajo está organizado de la siguiente manera. Después de esta introducción, en el segundo capítulo presentamos el marco conceptual para caracterizar los diferentes modelos asociativos de agricultura por contrato y hacemos explícitos sus principales riesgos. En el tercer capítulo se explica la metodología para la selección de casos, se presentan los modelos a estudiar y se describen los aspectos más importantes de cada uno. En el cuarto capítulo elaboramos un resumen comparativo de los estudios de caso y en el quinto presentamos las conclusiones y recomendaciones en diversos frentes, entre otros respecto a precios remunerativos, productividad y calidad, acceso al crédito y formalización laboral.

Q10|Punjab’s Agricultural Innovation Challenge|Fifty years ago, Punjab embarked on its famous Green Revolution, leading the rest of India in that innovation, and becoming the country's breadbasket. Now its economy and society are struggling by relative, and sometimes even absolute, measures. Using the original Green Revolution as a benchmark, this paper discusses five areas of challenge and promise for a new round of agricultural innovation in Punjab. These are: complexity of the agricultural economy, complementary inputs such as infrastructure, switching costs (including risks), balancing frontier innovation and adaptation, and the relative roles of the public and private sectors.
Q10|Устойчивост На Селското Стопанство В България<BR>[Sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture]|"This paper gives answer to topical and debated research and practical questions at the current stage of development of Bulgarian agriculture - „what is sustainability of agriculture"", „how to assess sustainability of agricultural in the conditions of EU CAP implementation in the country“, and „which are critical factors for improvement of socio-economic and environmental sustainability in the sector“. Evolution of the „concept“ of agrarian sustainability and the major approached for its assessment are discussed More precise definition of sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture is suggested and the requirements for the system of its assessment are characterised. For the first time a new „governance“ pillar of agrarian sustainability is included along with the universally accepted economic, social and environmental pillars (aspects). Practically applicable for the specific conditions of Bulgarian agriculture holistic framework for assessing sustainability level of agrarian systems of different types (sector, sub-sector, region, ecosystem, agricultural farm) is suggested. The later included 25 principles, 66 criteria, and 163 indicators and reference values for assessing integral, governance, economic, social and environmental sustainability as well as approach for their calculation, integration and interpretation. Approbation of the elaborated framework in assessment of agrarian sustainability at various levels (national, sub-sector, region, (agro)ecosystem, and farm) is made on the base of official statistical, etc, information and original farm surveys. Critical factors for improving sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture are identified, and recommendation made for amelioration of research and assessment practices, public policies and farming strategies for sustainable development.

Q10|Изследване На Екологическите Дадености И Културни Ресурси За Развитие На Туризма В Селските Райони На България И Китай<BR>[Study of ecological endowments and cultural resources for tourism development in rural areas of Bulgaria and China]|The research target is to analyse the development degree of the rural tourism in all its varieties in Bulgaria and China, its role for achievement of a sustainable and diversified development, as well as to assess the synergic effects of the protection and restoration of the ecologic and cultural wealth and to create a tourist product for a sustainable and viable rural development. The study was made on the base of a detailed examination of the existing Bulgarian and foreign literature in the area of the sustainable development of the tourism in rural areas. The elaborated methodology provides a reliable and complex assessment of the synergy of tourism development in rural communities on the conservation, the sustainable use of ecological and cultural resources, as well as the contribution to the overall development of the local economy. In the scientific literature and the contemporary scientific thought more attention is paid to the strengths, natural and other conditions to be turned into a driving force for preserving and vitalising rural communities. The tourism is conceived as a sector with a special promising opportunity for the development of these territories. The formation of a sustainable and recognisable tourist product in rural areas is based on multiple elements: climate, locality, sand, sea, landscape, infrastructure, hospitality, life quality, life style, health and regional specificity. For the aims of the study has been chosen two pilot municipalities in Bulgaria – Strelcha and Hissarya. Both municipalities are neighbouring geographically, but belonging to two different administrative regions – Pazardzhik and Plovdiv. The economies of the two pilot municipalities although similar, show several differences as a result of different reasons, analysed in-depth. One feature in common for both pilot regions and one of the most significant resource for the tourism development in these municipalities is the hot mineral springs. The research of the situation and the opportunity of hot water use enable making analysis of the effects and contributions of this resource for the regions. It is established that both in Bulgaria and in China, according to the particularities, similar in nature but different in form and specificity approaches have been applied to create a sustainable tourism product by creating tourist clusters based on the regional resources of the regions, which will lead to the utilisation of potential touristic capital. Wonderful prerequisites are available, which should be examined in a long-term outlook, for Bulgarian natural conditions, specific for rural areas, to become an attractive tourist product for the growing and increasingly developing demand of the Chinese tourist industry and of the rising flow of Chinese travellers.
Q10|Does Agricultural investment still promote economic growth in China? Empirical evidence from ARDL bounds testing model|One of the major unresolved research issues in agriculture is the question as to whether agricultural investments still a promoter of economic growth at the regional and local levels. The concern is not with the agricultural benefits, principally measured as food security, but whether there are additional development benefits from these investments. In this paper, we have developed a new approach to study the impact of agricultural investment on economic growth. By taking the case of China, this study is based on the Auto-Regressive Distributive Lags (ARDL) approach that is proposed by Pesaran et al (2002). The empirical estimate yields interesting results. In the short and long terms, agricultural investment has a positive effect on economic growth. The findings of this research have important implications for further policy designs that seek to maintain the agricultural sector in China in the future.

Q10|Revisiting Allen's nitrogen hyphotesis from a climate perspective (1645-1740)|Building on Allen’s Nytrogen Hypothesis, this paper assesses the role of climate change in the English Agricultural Revolution. Our results show that, while Nitrogen-fixing plants, better cultivation and improved seeds explain half of the variation in yields, the changing climatic conditions characterizing the cooling period (1645-1715) and the subsequent warmer phase account for the remaining variation. Given that the colder and more humid climate existing during the second half of the 17th-century and early 18th-century negatively affected yields, farmers’ efforts during this period were even higher than what it is implied by the observed yields. Increasing temperatures in the next phase (starting c.1715), however, had a positive effect on agricultural productivity, so the role of the farmers in this stage has been previously over-rated.
Q10|An Evaluation Of Agricultural Trade In India: A Special Study Of Selected Agricultural Commodities|India since ages has been known to be an agrarian country. Indian agriculture and allied activities consist of 54.6% of the population (census 2011) and contributes 17.4% to the country?s Gross Value Added for the year 2016-17 (Current prices). India?s agricultural export amounts to $33.87 billion as of 2017, and it is 10.5% of total exports of the country.The paper is classified in the various parts like introduction, objectives, review of literature, research methodology, growth rates in agricultural commodity trade, India?s agriculture trade, foreign trade policy by the government on agriculture, conclusion and suggestions.The growth in trade for agricultural commodity of India was analyzed by employing an exponential model of the form Yt = abteu. In the present research paper agricultural trade, the data has been collected from the secondary sources from the economic survey, annual reports from the agricultural ministry and so on at the same time has been analyzed and evaluated by using Carl Pearson?s co relation co efficient test. After the systematic analysis of the data there has been suggestions made by the researcher to improve agricultural trade to strengthen Indian economy
Q10|Life cycle assessment and life cycle costing in measuring the eco-efficiency performance of winter rape production|In the mitigation policy, agricultural activities are gaining growing importance. International and national regulations require the use of sustainable production methods. This means that the attention focused on the current recommendations shifts from a set of minimum requirements to recognize environmental effects throughout the life cycle of products. Farming and food production are also expected to comply with the second pillar of sustainability which is related to the economic aspects of production. Important operational dimension of sustainability assessment is a concept of eco-efficiency, which is defined as creating more value or generating less cost with less environmental impact. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) are appropriate methodologies to investigate the eco-efficiency of production systems within the life cycle. The aim of the study was to perform the comparative analysis of cash crop production in different farming types by applying the LCA and LCC methods. Carbon Footprint (CF) was applied as a single most important measure of environmental impact of production. The study was conducted in 69 farms, located in the Wielkopolska and Lubelskie regions (Poland) during the period 2017-2018. The analysed farms represented key agricultural activities, according to the classification of the EU: a) milk production, b) pig production, c) field crops, d) mixed livestock production (pig and milk). The chosen types of production are represented by the largest number of farms in Poland. The selection of the study group, according to the set criteria, were based on the information of Wielkopolski and Lubelski Agricultural Advisory Centres. The LCA and LCC analysis were carried out in similar phases corresponding to LCA standard: goal and scope definition, environmental life cycle inventory, life cycle impact assessment and interpretation. In winter rape production average value of CF was equal to 1003 kg CO2 eq per 1 tonne of grain (functional unit). The highest value of CF was observed in milk farming in Wielkopolska region of 1254 kg CO2 eq. Average aggregated cost of production related to the functional unit was 1084 PLN, with the highest value of 1222 PLN found in the pig farming in Lubelski region. Preproduction phases linked with the direct inputs levels contributed mostly to a high overall cost of rape production in pig farming and to the CF value of winter rape in farms specialised in milk production. *This work is a part of a research project No. 2016/21/B/HS4/01963 financed by the National Science Centre, Poland.
Q10|Climate change, chemical fertilisers, and sustainable development â€“ panel evidence from Tanzanian Maize farmers|We study the impact of rainfall risk on fertiliser use by Tanzanian maize farmers using newly available spatially disaggregated agronomic survey data on Tanzanian maize producers. We show that fertiliser use is highly sensitive to rainfall risks. Our discussion embeds these findings into the wider debate around environmental sustainability and mineral fertilisers, thus relating directly to the countryâ€™s government efforts of climate mainstreaming into their (agricultural) policies. We conclude that chemical fertilisers are useful for agricultural productivity growth but that they should be used to supplement more economically and environmentally sustainable practices.
Q10|Regression tree analysis of soil fertility and agro-economic practices and the effects on yield in Tanzania|Food security and yield production have been extensively studied in regard to fertiliser response in the context of Sub-Saharan Africa. Soil fertility gradients within farms interact with other complex factors such as plot management, alongside bio-physical as well as socio-economic constraints, to create extensive heterogeneity in yield production. Hence, blanket recommendations regarding increasing inputs may not just lead to limited or no change in productivity but may affect long term sustainability. To try and explore the relationships between these factors, Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis was used to simplify the effect of plot management decisions. Data was from the focal plots of the 2016 and 2017 Tanzanian Agronomy Panel Survey (TAPS 2017; n = 580) with a range of yields and socio-economic contexts (2.10tha-1 â€“ 3.68tha-1). Results suggested that in low resource fields, management factors are subservient to extreme soil degradation while in high resource fields good management such as optimal planting are needed for maximum predicted yield (4.48tha-1; n = 51). Boundary line analysis was conducted, and maximum yield-nutrient response values calculated. The yield gap obtained suggested only up to 60% of locally obtainable yield is reached, highlighting the necessary balance between intensity of resource use and good management for sustainable and sufficient crop production, especially in the case of extreme soil degradation.
Q10|The Effects of Land Markets on Resource Allocation and Agricultural Productivity|We assess the effects of land markets on misallocation and productivity by exploiting policy-driven variation in land rentals across time and space arising from a large-scale land certification reform in Ethiopia, where land remains owned by the state. Our main finding from detailed micro panel data is that land rentals substantially reduce misallocation and increase agricultural productivity. Our evidence builds from an empirical difference-in-difference strategy, an instrumental variable approach, and a calibrated quantitative macroeconomic framework with heterogeneous household-farms that replicates, without targeting, the empirical effects. These effects are nonlinear, impacting more farms farther away from efficient operational scale, consistent with our theory. Using our model, we find that more active land markets reduce inequality, an important concern for the design of land policy. We also find that the positive effects of land markets are mainly driven by formal market rentals as opposed to informal rentals. Finally, our analysis also provides evidence that land markets increase the adoption of more advanced technologies such as the use of fertilizers.
Q10|Weather shocks, poverty and crime in 18th-century Savoy|Did weather shocks increase interpersonal conflict in early modern Europe? I address this question by exploiting year-to-year seasonal variations in temperature and detailed crime data I assembled from Savoyard criminal procedures over the period 1749–89. I find that temperature shocks had a positive and significant effect on the level of property crimes, but no significant effect on violent crimes. I further document how seasonal migration may help to increase the coping capacity of local communities in which they were widely used. Migrant labourers brought remittances to supplement communities’ resources and also temporarily relieve their communities of the burden of feeding them. I show that temperature shocks were strongly associated with increase in the property crimes rate, but the effect is much lower in provinces with high levels of seasonal migration. I provide historical evidence to show that the inflow of remittances may drive this relationship.
Q10|Is there a Latin American agricultural growth pattern? Factor endowments and productivity in the second half of the twentieth century|In this article we discuss whether there was a single Latin American pattern of agricultural growth between 1950 and 2008. We analyse the sources of growth of agricultural production and productivity in ten Latin American countries. Our results show that the differences between these countries are too strong to establish a single pattern for this region. However, certain common trends may be observed, such as the growing importance of labour productivity to explain agricultural production growth and the increasing importance of TFP to explain agricultural labour productivity growth.
Q10|Agrarian distress in India: Possible solutions|Agrarian distress in India, built-up over time, has further deteriorated recently. At the height of the farm output, Indian farmers are a disappointed lot. Despite spectacular rise in agricultural production, they continue to languish in poverty. The underlying reasons for agrarian distress in India are: a) unviable agriculture; b) ineffective Minimum Support Prices (MSP) system; c) adverse terms of trade; d) rural indebtedness; and e) inefficient value chain in agriculture. There is a need to provide medium term solutions to the problem so that sub-optimal solution like loan waiver can be avoided. Among available solutions, government procurement operation covering all major crops may not be feasible, while price-hedging mechanism through derivative instruments like forward/future trading in farm products is yet to be popular among farmers. There is a great potential to protect farmers from distress sale through a composite insurance scheme, which can cover risks arising out of both crop failure and market failure. The value chain of agricultural products needs to be completely revamped to integrate farmers directly to the ultimate consumers. Long-term solution of the agrarian distress lies in improving farm productivity by a series of measures like mass irrigation programme through inter-linking of rivers, diversification of agriculture, smart farming by using latest technology. A scheme of exit route for distress farmers may go a long way in alleviating the situation.
Q10|Off-Farm Participation, Agricultural Production and Farmersâ€™ Welfare in Tanzania and Uganda|Panel data from the Living Standards Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture for Tanzania and Uganda were analyzed to investigate the impact of off-farm participation on agricultural production and farmersâ€™ welfare. Using strategies ranging from simple least squares to a dynamic panel model, we demonstrated how each of the intermediate models, such as the random effects Tobit model, could tackle censoring bias. Our results reveal that off-farm participation had a negative impact on agricultural production in both countries, though the impact was positive on welfare for Tanzania only. Policy makers should consider the complexities surrounding the formulation of pro-agriculture and pro-welfare policies aimed at producing desirable outcomes from off-farm participation. In that effort, policies that minimize the trade-off between agricultural production and off-farm participation and which enhance positive welfare effects are vital.
Q10|Identifying barriers to adoption of “no-cost” greenhouse gas mitigation practices in pastoral systems|New Zealand scientists have suggested that multiple pastoral farming practices could reduce on-farm biological greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while maintaining (and in some circumstances even increasing) farm profits (e.g. de Klein and Dynes, 2017). However, these win–win practices (which we define as “no-cost” mitigation practices) are reported to be under-adopted in New Zealand (Reisinger et al. 2018). The focus of this paper is to identify barriers affecting the adoption or expansion of no-cost mitigation practices by farmers in New Zealand. We define and categorize barriers to adoption using a typology of barriers developed by Jaffe (2017). This typology provides a comprehensive list and precise/accurate description of multiple barriers that might be present in farming contexts. First, we confront the typology with empirical evidence in the literature studying the barriers to the adoptions of technologies and practices in the context of pastoral farming. Although the evidence on perceptions and adoption of GHG emissions mitigation options in New Zealand is very limited, several of the barriers in Jaffe’s typology have been evidenced by researchers as affecting the decisions to adopt different innovative technologies and practices on farms. To complement the literature review and, more importantly, focus on no-cost GHG mitigation practices, we conducted interviews with 14 farmers in different regions of the country. In these conversations we discussed different managerial and practical implications of five different no-cost farming practices, with the aim of identifying barriers that affect their adoption or expansion. We describe in the paper more than 40 quotes obtained from farmers, from which we identified the occurrence of 16 different barriers. Among these, the “Unsureness about practicality”, “risk and uncertainty” and “complex interactions” barriers showed as the most frequent barriers identified as causing under-adoption of the evaluated practices. In addition, different types of perceived costs (financial barriers), such as “modelling mismatch” and “learning and adjustment”, have been pointed out as a limitation for adoption (which are captured by barriers category “arguably efficient” in Jaffe’s typology). We also found that in some cases non-financial barriers seem to be interconnected – in especial the case when the interactions’ complexity increases the riskiness of the outcome (the “risk and uncertainty” barrier) and makes it difficult to see whether the mitigation option is practical (a barrier of “unsureness about practicality”).
Q10|The Unintended Impacts of Agricultural Fires: Human Capital in China|The practice of burning agricultural waste is ubiquitous around the world, yet the external human capital costs from those fires have been underexplored. Using data from the National College Entrance Examination (NCEE) and agricultural fires detected by high-resolution satellites in China during 2005 to 2011, this paper investigates the impacts of fires on cognitive performance. To address the endogeneity of agricultural fires, we differentiate upwind fires from downwind fires. We find that a one-standard-deviation increase in the difference between upwind and downwind fires during the exam decreases the total exam score by 1.42 percent of a standard deviation (or 0.6 point), and further decreases the probability of getting into first-tier universities by 0.51 percent of a standard deviation.
Q10|The Value of Biodiversity as an Insurance Device|This paper presents a benchmark endogenous growth model including biodiversity preservation dynamics. Producing food requires land, and increasing the share of total land devoted to farming mechanically reduces the share of land devoted to biodiversity conservation. However, the safeguarding of a greater number of species is associated to better ecosystem services – pollination, flood control, pest control, etc., which in turn ensure a lower volatility of agricultural productivity. The optimal conversion/preservation rule is explicitly characterized, as well as the value of biological diversity, in terms of the welfare gain of biodiversity conservation. The Epstein-Zin-Weil specification of the utility function allows us to disentangle the effects of risk aversion and aversion to fluctuations. A two-player game extension of the model highlights the effect of volatility externalities and the Paretian sub-optimality of the decentralized choice.
Q10|On the role of probability weighting on WTP for crop insurance with and without yield skewness| A growing number of studies in finance and economics seek to explain insurance choices us- ing the assumptions advanced by behavioral economics. One recent example in agricultural economics is the use of cumulative prospect theory (CPT) to explain farmer choices regarding crop insurance coverage levels (Babcock, 2015). We build upon this framework by deriving willingness to pay (WTP) for insurance programs under alternative assumptions, thus extend- ing the model to incorporate farmer decisions regarding whether or not to purchase insurance. Our contribution is twofold. First, we study the sensitivity of farmer WTP for crop insurance to the inclusion of CPT parameters. We find that loss aversion and probability distortion in- crease WTP for insurance while risk aversion decreases it. Probability distortion in losses plays a particularly important role. Second, we study the impact of yield distribution skewness on farmer WTP assuming CPT preferences. We find that WTP decreases when the distribution of yields moves from negatively- to positively-skewed and that the combined effect of proba- bility weighting in losses and skewness has a large negative impact on farmer WTP for crop insurance.

Q10|The wealth of the Swedish peasant farmer class 1750–1900: Composition and distribution|Using about 1,730 probate inventories, this paper studies the wealth of peasant farmers in Sweden for the years 1750, 1800, 1850 and 1900. The Gini coefficient for the farmers’ wealth grew from 0.46 in 1750 to 0.73 in 1900. Average wealth grew rapidly, tripling over the nineteenth century. Looking in greater depth at four local areas (Kullings, Sjuhundra, Lagunda, and Bara hundreds), we show that over the period the diversity of farmers’ wealth grew, as did their financial sophistication; borrowing and lending patterns became more complex and the use of banks and other institutions grew while personal financial transactions became rarer. Farmers who lived close to the major grain markets in Stockholm and the mining district Bergslagen were wealthier than others, as were farmers on fertile plains and, in 1900, those living in coastal areas. Increased market access by 1900 – in terms of cities and foreign demand – meant that farmers well-placed in terms of geography and infrastructure benefited much more than farmers on what became the periphery, as regional inequality within the farmer class increased. Over the nineteenth century land prices increased much more in some areas than in others, but in the country as a whole they rose steeply.
Q10|Effetti economici e sociali del sisma sugli allevamenti dell’Alto Maceratese|Il contributo analizza la filiera zootecnica dell’Alto Maceratese danneggiata dal sisma del 2016. Rispetto ad alcune difficolta storiche (marginalità territoriale e spopolamento), questa analisi si è concentrata sugli effetti del sisma. In collaborazione con i veterinari della Regione Marche, è stato somministrato ad un campione di 55 famiglie di allevatori un questionario semi-strutturato al fine di osservare le caratteristiche socio-economiche degli allevamenti (prevalentemente a media quota e dediti nella metà dei casi unicamente all’attività zootecnica) e i danni prodotti dal sisma (ad abitazioni, patrimonio zootecnico e strutture agricole). L’ultima sezione del questionario raccoglie alcune proposte di miglioramento nella fase di ricostruzione. Proprio la rigenerazione dei territori colpiti, infatti, sembra porre ambizione sfide che riguardano il ripristino delle attività lavorative e il ritorno della popolazione sul territorio.
Q10|Determining the Inflationary Effects of El Niño and La Niña in the Philippines|"This paper investigates whether climate ""shocks"" (or short-term but sharp changes in climatic conditions), El Niño and La Niña, have significant impacts on inflation in the country. Using regional panel data and information from PAGASA, this study finds that both of these weather shocks have significant effects on the general price level in the Philippines, along with interest rate, foreign exchange, and unemployment rate. Further, the results also indicate that long-term changes in climatic conditions, specifically average temperature and rainfall, do not have any significant impacts on prices. These findings are consistent with the literature that point to the fact that successful adaptation to long-term changes in climatic conditions negates any potential negative impacts to the economy. The study concludes that adaptation must be expanded not only to respond to long-term changes in climatic conditions, but also to short-term but intense changes in temperature and rainfall."
Q10|Estudio sobre el impacto socioeconómico del sector agroindustrial de la caña en Colombia|El presente estudio identifica y cuantifica los impactos socioeconómicos de la agroindustria de la caña en Colombia, así como los impactos regionales de la actividad agrícola de la producción de caña de azúcar y de las actividades industriales de la producción de azúcar, bioetanol y cogeneración de energía. Los impactos se miden y se analizan a partir de métodos cuantitativos y cualitativos.
Q10|International Commodity Prices and Civil War Outbreak: New Evidence for Sub-Saharan Africa and Beyond|A new dataset by Bazzi and Blattman (2014) allows examining the effects of international commodity prices on the risk of civil war outbreak with more comprehensive data. I find that international commodity price downturns sparked civil wars in Sub-Saharan Africa. Another finding with the new dataset is that commodity price downturns also sparked civil wars beyond Sub-Saharan Africa since 1980. Effects are sizable relative to the baseline risk of civil war outbreak. My conclusions contrast with those of Bazzi and Blattman, who argue that the new dataset rejects that commodity price downturns cause civil wars. The reason is that I calculate commodity price shocks using time-invariant (fixed) export shares as commodity weights. Bazzi and Blattman also calculate commodity price shocks using export shares as commodity weights but but the exports shares they use are time-varying. Using time-invariant export shares as commodity weights ensures that time variation in price shocks solely re ects changes in international commodity prices. Price shocks based on time-varying export shares partly re ect (possibly endogenous) changes in the quantity and variety of countries' exports, which jeopardizes causal estimation.
Q10|Operationalizing the SAARC Food Bank: Issues and Solutions|The SAARC Food Bank (SFB) embodies collective effort of South Asian countries to ensure food security at times when emergencies lead to largescale disruptions in food production, transportation, accessibility and availability. In view of the urgent need for an appropriate institutional architecture to address the ever-rising food security concerns in South Asia, issues of proper operationalization of the SFB have assumed critical importance. This paper enquires into the underlying reasons why this regional arrangement has failed to deliver the expected results and how to raise the efficacy of the SFB in order for it to service its stated mandate of deploying food reserves to affected areas during food emergencies. Based on a comparative study of select international best practices and primary surveys, the paper offers concrete recommendations for determination of thresholds that should define food emergency situations, modalities of distribution of food from the SFB, design of pricing strategies, maintenance of the food stock and ensuring quality of the reserves, derestriction of trade in food grains during emergencies, establishment of a dispute settlement mechanism, and options for institutional tie-ups with similar outfits.
Q10|The Spatial Efficiency Multiplier and Common Correlated Effects in a Spatial Autoregressive Stochastic Frontier Model|We extend the emerging literature on spatial frontier methods in a number of respects. One contribution includes accounting for unobserved heterogeneity. This involves developing a random effects spatial autoregressive stochastic frontier model which we generalize to a common correlated effects specification to account for correlation between the regressors and the unit specific effects. Another contribution is the introduction of the concept of a spatial efficiency multiplier to show that the efficiency frontiers from the structural and reduced forms of a spatial frontier model differ. To demonstrate various features of the estimators we develop we carry out a Monte Carlo simulation analysis and provide an empirical application. The application is to a state level cost frontier for U.S. agriculture which is a popular case in the efficiency literature and is thus well-suited to highlighting the features of the estimators we propose.
Q10|The Impact of Agricultural Subsidies on Farm Production: A Synthetic Control Method Approach|Czech farmers experienced an enormous exogenous shock when they joined the common agricultural market (CAM) and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in 2004. Using the World Bank's dataset, we apply the synthetic control method to establish a counterfactual case of the Czech Republic food production index in the absence of the CAM and CAP. The results show that the Czech Republic would have had a higher food index if it had not entered the CAM and CAP. Moreover, we show that the CAP and CAM had different impacts on farms in the Czech Republic and Bulgaria, which have the most comparable agriculture according to the results of the synthetic control method.
Q10|Farmers’ perception of Controlled Traffic Farming (CTF) and associated technologies|This report presents descriptive results from a recent survey conducted with the objective of assessing the use of Controlled Traffic Farming (CTF) practices and associated precision farming technologies among farmers in eight European countries. About 26 % of the surveyed farmers use some CTF systems of which 45 % apply CTF on their entire farm. For the CTF users, the major motives to use CTF are to reduce soil structure damage and to improve efficiency (reduce cost) followed by a desire to make more profit. Concern about heavy machinery – induced soil compaction and perceptions about the potentials of CTF are considerably high. However, adoption appears to be constrained mainly by: high cost of machinery modification and RTK purchase, lack of compatibility of equipment and also GPS systems from different manufacturers, and lack of decision support systems. Issues about evidence on demonstrated benefits under local conditions and availability of contractors are also mentioned as limiting factors.
Q10|The Effectiveness Of Development Aid For Agriculture In Sub-Saharan Africa|Agriculture is the major source of livelihood for the majority population in Sub- Saharan Africa, but its productivity is not only low it has started showing signs of decline since 2012. The paper seeks to find out whether official development assistance for agriculture is effective. The data for development assistance for agriculture are broken down into the major agricultural sectors in receiving countries.
Q10|Responsible use of crop protection products and Nigeriaâ€™s growth enhancement support scheme|We examine the impact of the federal government of Nigeriaâ€™s (FGN) growth enhancement support scheme (GESS) on responsible use of crop protection products (CPPs) in rural Nigeria. Results from the use of logistic regressions show that GESS significantly impact on farmersâ€™ access to CPPs, but does not significantly impact on farmersâ€™ knowledge and skill of CPP application, and in several cases the misuse has led to deterioration of soil fertility. Findings suggests that embracing information on recommended CPPs, dose rates, dilutions, timing, frequency of applications and precautions should form the foundation of GESS activity attributable to CPPs in sub-Saharan Africa.
Q10|The impact of e-wallet on informal farm entrepreneurship development in rural Nigeria|Transforming agriculture from a largely subsistence enterprise to a profitable commercial venture is both a prerequisite and a driving force for accelerated development and sustainable growth in sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this investigation is to assess the impact of the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) e-wallet programme on informal farm entrepreneurship development in rural Nigeria. Informal sector farmers are those that are not legally registered at the national level though could be connected to a registered association. The research is motivated by the absence of literature focusing on the problem statement or objective of study. One thousand, one hundred and fifty-two rural farmers were sampled across the six geo-political zones of Nigeria. Results from the use of a bivariate probit model indicate that the mobile phone-based technology via the e-wallet programme is a critical factor that has enhanced farm entrepreneurship in rural Nigeria. However, results also show that the impact of mobile phones (as a channel to accessing and using modern agricultural inputs) is contingent on how mobile networks are able to link farmers who live in rural areas and work mainly in farming. The results suggest that increasing mobile phone services in rural Nigeria enhances farmersâ€™ knowledge, information and adoption of improved farm inputs and by extension, spurs rural informal sector economic activities in sub-Saharan Africa. Implications for practice, policy and research are discussed.
Q10|Young Rural Women Participation in the E-Wallet Programme and Usage Intensity of Modern Agricultural Inputs in Nigeria|We assess the extent young rural women (YRW) participate in the federal government (FGN)e-wallet programme and the subsequent impact on usage intensity of modern agricultural inputs in Nigeria. Six hundred YRW were sampled across six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. Using double-hurdle, results show that YRW rarely participate in the e-wallet programme due to the cultural and traditional context which is anchored in beliefs, norms and practices that breed discrimination and feminized poverty. This implies that Nigeriaâ€™s agricultural transformation agenda would only succeed if the FGN is able to draw on all its resources and talents, and if the YRW can be able to participate fully in the e-wallet programme. This will require intensified efforts to eliminate discrimination and promote equalities. To bridge the gender gap, the federal ministry of agriculture and rural development should pay close attention to the extent the participation of unmarried girls and young women, including nursing mothers in the e-wallet programme, may be limited by the cultural and/or domestic and child care duties. The findings suggest that FGN should discourage gender disparities in unequal access to agricultural inputs and pervasive, inequality, especially over ownership of agricultural land that limit womenâ€™s contribution to household food baskets.
Q10|Adoption of improved crop varieties by involving farmers in the e-wallet program in Nigeria|The amount of improved seed used in Nigeria is extremely low. Overall, only 5 to 10 percent of cultivated land is planted with improved seeds, and about 10 percent of rural farmers use improved varieties. The objective of this investigation was to identify determinants of adoption of improved seed by farmers not participating in and those participating in the federal governmentâ€™s e-wallet program in Nigeria. We determined the impact of the e-wallet program on adoption of improved seed in rural areas. One thousand, two hundred (1200) rural farmers were sampled across six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. Results from the use of a bivariate probit model indicated that the e-wallet program continued to become increasingly popular among rural farmers; and that farmersâ€™ literacy, ownership of a mobile phone, value output, mobile network coverage, power for charging phone batteries and contact with extension agents were the positive determinants of farmer participation in thee-wallet program. Cultural obstacles to married women, growersâ€™ age, and increased distance to registration and input collection centers reduced farmersâ€™ tendency to participate in the e-wallet program. The results also showed that rural farmers depended on the e-wallet program for increased use and adoption of improved seed in Nigeria, to boost food security in sub-Saharan Africa. The results suggested the need for an improved e-wallet model by lessening constraints mostly associated with rural information and communication infrastructure, and distance to the registration and input collection centers.
Q10|Responsible use of crop protection products and Nigeriaâ€™s growth enhancement support scheme|We examine the impact of the federal government of Nigeriaâ€™s (FGN) growth enhancement support scheme (GESS) on responsible use of crop protection products (CPPs) in rural Nigeria.

Q10|Measuring the financial efficiency of agricultural cooperatives in South Africa: An application of the Simar-Wilson methodology| The SA government has favored cooperatives over other types of corporate entities in its programmes for rural development. This study examines financial efficiency and its determinants for 387 agricultural cooperatives in SA using a two-stage double bootstrap approach. Bias-corrected Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) efficiency estimates are obtained in the first-stage for the agricultural cooperatives. Next, a Double Bootstrapped Truncated Regression model was estimated to obtain bias-corrected scores. The model was designed to obtain DEA scores for financial efficiency. First-stage results indicate that many agricultural cooperatives are relatively inefficient. Results of the second-stage analysis identified significant determinants of efficiency as age of cooperatives, size, gender of management, governance indicators and training. Governance indicators negatively influencing efficiency indicate institutions that prioritize non-financial goals and consequently compromise on governance quality. The deviation from institutional control mechanisms most likely emerges in a weak institutional environment. Various types of training influenced financial efficiency meaning that an understanding of training needs across institutions is crucial for equipping and empowering cooperatives towards financial efficiency. The study shows that the design and implementation of suitable training programs are prerequisites for addressing financial efficiency of agricultural cooperatives. Key words: Agricultural cooperatives, Data envelopment analysis, Financial efficiency, Two-stage double bootstrap method, South Africa JEL codes: Q10, Q12, Q13
Q10|Soil resource and the profitability and sustainability of farms: A soil quality investment model|There is a growing public concern for soils and the maintenance or enhancement of soil quality. Actually, soil resource plays a central role in issues regarding food security and climate change mitigation. Through their practices, farmers impact the physical, biological and chemical quality of their soils. However, in a strained economic environment, farmers face a trade-off between short term objectives of production and profitability, and a long term objective of soil resource conservation. In this article, we investigate the conditions under which farmers have a private interest to preserve the quality of their soil. We also characterize the optimal management strategies of soil quality dynamics. We use a simplified theoretical soil quality investment model, where farmers maximise their revenues under a soil quality dynamics constraint. In our production function, soil quality and productive inputs are cooperating production factors. In addition, productive inputs have a detrimental impact on soil quality dynamics. It appears that in some cases, farmers have a private and financial interest in preserving the quality of their soil at a certain level, since it is an endogenous production factor cooperating with productive inputs. However, situations can occur wherein the cooperative production benefits of soil quality and productive inputs are smaller than the marginal deterioration of soil quality due to productive inputs. In this case, one cannot draw conclusions about the existence of an equilibrium.
Q10|On the role of probability weighting on WTP for crop insurance with and without yield skewness|A growing number of studies in finance and economics seek to explain insurance choices using the assumptions advanced by behavioral economics. One recent example in agricultural economics is the use of cumulative prospect theory (CPT) to explain farmer choices regarding crop insurance coverage levels (Babcock, 2015). We build upon this framework by deriving willingness to pay (WTP) for insurance programs under alternative assumptions, thus extending the model to incorporate farmer decisions regarding whether or not to purchase insurance. Our contribution is twofold. First, we study the sensitivity of farmer WTP for crop insurance to the inclusion of CPT parameters. We find that loss aversion and probability distortion increase WTP for insurance while risk aversion decreases it. Probability distortion in losses plays a particularly important role. Second, we study the impact of yield distribution skewness on farmer WTP assuming CPT preferences. We find that WTP decreases when the distribution of yields moves from negatively- to positively-skewed and that the combined effect of probability weighting in losses and skewness has a large negative impact on farmer WTP for crop insurance.
Q10|Agriocliometrics and Agricultural Change in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries|Before the industrial revolution, agriculture was the most important economic activity of traditional societies. The spread of industrialisation processes, first throughout a large part of the western world and later across many more countries, gave rise to an abundance of literature on the role of agriculture in these processes. The initial perspectives offered by economic history, particularly for the British case, and the approaches of development economics specialists, largely based on previous studies by economic historians, became subject to reconsideration when numerous studies emerged that, from a cliometric point of view, sought to evaluate the changes experienced by agriculture and their contribution to economic growth. In this context, the objective of this study is to use these contributions to analyse the profound transformations that have occurred in agriculture around the world over the last two centuries.
Q10|International Commodity Prices and Civil War Outbreak: New Evidence for Sub-Saharan Africa and Beyond|A new dataset by Bazzi and Blattman (2014) allows examining the effects of international commodity prices on the risk of civil war outbreak with more comprehensive data. I find that international commodity price downturns sparked civil wars in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Effects are sizable relative to the baseline risk of civil war outbreak. My conclusions contrast with those of Bazzi and Blattman, who argue that the new dataset rejects that commodity price downturns cause civil wars. The reason is that I calculate commodity price shocks using time invariant (fixed) export shares as commodity weights. Bazzi and Blattman also calculate commodity price shocks using export shares as commodity weights but the exports shares they use are time varying. Using time-invariant export shares as commodity weights ensures that time variation in price shocks solely reflects changes in international commodity prices. Price shocks based on time varying export shares partly reflect (possibly endogenous) changes in the quantity and variety of countries' exports, which jeopardizes causal estimation. I also show that setting time-invariant export shares equal to average export shares over the sample period, can be a way of dealing with attenuation bias due to mismeasured export shares. When I differentiate between agricultural commodities on the one hand and minerals, oil, and gas on the other, I find stronger increases in the risk of civil war outbreak following downturns in agricultural commodity prices.
Q10|Maize and precolonial Africa|Columbus's arrival in the New World triggered an unprecedented movement of people and crops across the Atlantic Ocean. We study a largely overlooked part of this Columbian Exchange: the effects of New World crops in Africa. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that the introduction of maize increased population density and slave exports in precolonial Africa. We find robust empirical support for these predictions. We also find little evidence to suggest maize increased economic growth or reduced conflict. Our results suggest that rather than stimulating development, the introduction of maize simply increased the supply of slaves during the slave trades.
Q10|What Stayers Do? Capital Endowments and On-Farm Transitions in Rural China|While much research on China has focused on rural to urban migration and transitions of rural households away from agriculture, little is known about the changes within the rural agricultural sector. Yet, the agricultural sector continues to account for a large share of employment. We study the determinants of transitions from subsistence farming into either formal agricultural employment or agricultural self-employment. We pay particular attention to the role of capital endowments. We find that financial capital plays a relatively limited role, compared to natural, human, social and political capital.
Q10|Оценка На Аграрната Устойчивост В България На Ниво Район, Екосистема, Подотрасъл И Стопанска Организация<BR>[Assessment of agrarian sustainability at regional, ecosystem, sectioal and farm levels in Bulgaria]|This paper applies interdisciplinary framework and assesses the level of agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria at regional, ecosystem, sectioal and farm levels. Factors for increasing agrarian sustainability are also identified, and directions for improving research, managerial and assessment practices suggested.
Q10|New Trends in Kyrgyz Foreign Policy|Kyrgyzstan’s foreign policy is characterized to be multi-dimensional or multi vector concentrated on the consolidation of flexible and many-sided external relations with its neighboring states and regional players. In the historical perspective, international relations experts and scholars argue that “Kyrgyzstan’s first president Askar Akaev is considered to be the founder of the multi-vector foreign policy in the Kyrgyz Republic”(Dimensions, p.62). As a result, the new-born country started to participate in international foreign policy agendas through signing bilateral agreements with its allies and attracting intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations from various corners of the world. It is argued that there are several factors which cause multi-vector policy. If some political experts highlight that it is connected due to size and dependency of Kyrgyzstan from other countries, others also refer to poor economic situation and security concerns. In this regard Yasar Sari stated “Geopolitical and geo-economic situation of Kyrgyzstan complicated the development of an independent foreign policy. Therefore, Kyrgyzstan introduced a multi-vector foreign policy”(2017, p.137) One could agree with the fact that Kyrgyzstan, like Tadjikistan, is economically poor and has relatively less natural resources than other Central Asian countries. Indisputably, it was one of the main factors to strengthen cooperation and partnership in regional scope and beyond the region. The paper aims to investigate the new tendencies from the major three dimensions of external foreign policy which are regional, continental and global areas. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kyrgyz Republic, “The regional approach is implemented to strengthen good and friendly relations with neighboring states, continental approach is aimed at developing diplomatic relations with major powers like Russia, the USA the European Union, China, Turkey and the global approach prioritizes active engagement in UN system”(Dimensions, 2008, p.64). Therefore, this paper will strongly attempt to introduce with the main transformations under the governance of the president Soorobai Jeenbekov and will tackle recent political events in the formation of foreign policy objectives of the state nowadays. The paper focuses on question: What foreign policy actions and resolutions have been produced since the presidency of Sooronbai Jeenbekov in Kyrgyzstan?
Q10|Пољопривреда Краснодарске Покрајине И Агрохолдинг Кубањ<BR>[Agriculture of Krasnodar Krai and Agroholding Kuban]|Serbian. У раду се анализира пољопривреда Краснодарске покрајине, једног од мањих, али економски развијенијих субјеката сложено уређене Руске Федерације (РФ). Најпре је дат географски и друштвеноекономски приказ Краснодарске покрајине. По величини територије и броју становника упоредив с мањим европским земљама, попут Аустрије, Чешке или Републике Ирске, односно Данске, Финске и Словачке, овај регион је нешто мањи и слабије насељен од Србије. Разноврсност рељефа, климатских услова и велика природна богатства чине повољне услове за његов економски и друштвени развој. Посебно су развијени агроиндустријски комплекс и туризам, што и представља знак распознавања региона не само у оквирима Русије, већ и ван њених граница. У производњи низа пољопривредних култура Краснодарска покрајина заузима водеће, или једно од водећих места у оквирима Руске Федерације. Дат је кратак приказ Агрохолдинга Кубањ, највећег и најзначајнијег пољопривредно-прехрамбеног предузећа у Покрајини и једног од највећих у РФ, чије је седиште у г. Уст-Лабинск, и који има активе у више од 20 агропредузећа у неколико рејона Краснодарске покрајине. Земљишни фонд АгроХолдинга чини 112 хиљада ха, број запослених је око 5 хиљада људи. Привредна сарадња Србије с Русијом у целини знатно заостаје за оном из времена СФРЈ и СССР, али ће у будућности свакако бити повећана, а у оквиру тога и сарадња с Краснодарском покрајином, која се неће заснивати само на трговинским односима. English. This article analyzes the agriculture of the Krasnodar Krai, one of the smallest but economicaly most developed subjects of complexly organized Russian Federation. At the beginning it was provided a geographic and socio-economic description of Krasnodar Krai. Its size and population are comparable to the ones of smaller European countries, such as Austria, Czech Republic, Republic of Ireland or Denmark, Finland and Slovakia. In comparison to Serbia, this region is somewhat smaller and less densely populated. Its landscape and climate diversity, as well as an abundance of natural resources make a good starting point for a further economic and social development of the region. The agro-industrial complex and tourism are especially developed in this region and are considered its strong points both within Russia and outside its borders. In the production of many agrarian products Krasnodar Krai is leader, or at the top in the Russian Federation. It is also given the short survey of the AgroHolding Kuban, greatest and most important agriculture and food enteprises in the Krasnodar Krai, and one of the greatest in Russia. The level of industrial cooperation between Serbia and Russia is considerably lower than in the times of SFRY and USSR. However, it will certainly increase in the future, leading to an intensification of cooperation with Krasnodar region which will not only be based on trade relations.
Q10|Постижения И Предизвикателства На Устойчивото Аграрно Развитие В България И Китай<BR>[Achievements and challenges of sustainable agrarian development in Bulgaria and China]|This paper summarizes the main achievements and most important challenges of agrarian sustainable development in Bulgaria and China at current stage. The study has found out that, in the last several decades in Bulgaria and China took place unprecedented modernization of institutional structure in agriculture as legislation and regulation framework has been innovated along with the extent and modes of public intervention/and support to the sector, the importance and diversity of provide and collective structure of production, marketing, food security, eco-management, etc. Simultaneously in Bulgaria and China and in the individual regions of each country exists a considerable specificity of socio-economic conditions, natural resources, institutional structure, cultural and historical development, efficiency of public governance and multiple challenges. The contemporary agrarian development in both countries is characterized with a number of similar socio-economic and ecological challenges most important of which are: low comparative productivity and competitiveness of a great portion of agricultural production; unequal public support to different type of farms, subsectors of production and regions of the country; increasing discrepancies in income and living standards of population in different regions, sectors of economy and type of economic organizations; insufficient involvement of all interested parties at all levels of decision making, control, sustainability assessment, etc.; aging of population in rural areas and lack if young and qualified labors in farms; existence of large informal sector with uncontrolled products for quality, safety, intellectual property, ecology, etc. and with dominating informal (including illegal) structures; significant adverse impact of agrarian development on agricultural lands, waters, air, biodiversity, etc.; serious risks for food security in the future in accordance with the trends in production and consumption, etc. Having in mind the importance of such comparative studies they have to continue and deepen with the employment of micro economic and other data, in-depth and case studies, etc.
Q10|Farewell to Agriculture? Productivity Trends and the Competitiveness of Agriculture in Central Asia|Agricultural productivity in the Central Asian republics of the USSR stopped growing from the late 1970s and declined in the 1990s when the transition to the market occurred. As a result, most agricultural goods were uncompetitive on the both the domestic market and the world market, and the agricultural trade balance deteriorated as imports grew faster than exports. Although there have been a few success stories – cereals in Uzbekistan, meat production in Azerbaijan, oil seeds in Kazakhstan – the overall picture is not one of agriculture as the driving force of the region’s future growth. We argue, however, that the relative decline of agriculture is consistent with international experience. In ‘economic miracle’ countries, the share of agriculture fell faster than in other countries because the sector donated labour to the industrial sector, which was the engine of growth. The problem in Central Asia is not the slow growth of agricultural output, but the slow growth of productivity in agriculture, which fails to increase the competitiveness of agricultural products and leads to an inability of the rural population to move to more productive industrial activities.
Q10|Analyse spatiale de la localisation de la production agricole des plantes irriguées et non irriguées : Cas de la Tunisie<BR>[Spatial analysis of the location of the agricultural production of irrigated and non-irrigated plants: Evidence from Tunisia]|This study analyzes the spatial location of agricultural production of both irrigated and non-irrigated plants in Tunisia in 2012. At the micro-spatial level, the results show that the location movements of agricultural production of irrigated and non-irrigated plants confirm the existence of a spatial dynamic between Tunisian governorates. Moreover, the findings of the global autocorrelation test provide evidence for the presence of a positive spatial autocorrelation between the considered variables.
Q10|Responsible use of crop protection products and Nigeria’s growth enhancement support scheme|We examine the impact of the federal government of Nigeria’s (FGN) growth enhancement support scheme (GESS) on responsible use of crop protection products (CPPs) in rural Nigeria. Results from the use of logistic regressions show that GESS significantly impact on farmers’ access to CPPs, but does not significantly impact on farmers’ knowledge and skill of CPP application, and in several cases the misuse has led to deterioration of soil fertility. Findings suggests that embracing information on recommended CPPs, dose rates, dilutions, timing, frequency of applications and precautions should form the foundation of GESS activity attributable to CPPs in sub-Saharan Africa.
Q10|The impact of e-wallet on informal farm entrepreneurship development in rural Nigeria|Transforming agriculture from a largely subsistence enterprise to a profitable commercial venture is both a prerequisite and a driving force for accelerated development and sustainable growth in sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this investigation is to assess the impact of the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) e-wallet programme on informal farm entrepreneurship development in rural Nigeria. Informal sector farmers are those that are not legally registered at the national level though could be connected to a registered association. The research is motivated by the absence of literature focusing on the problem statement or objective of study. One thousand, one hundred and fifty-two rural farmers were sampled across the six geo-political zones of Nigeria. Results from the use of a bivariate probit model indicate that the mobile phone-based technology via the e-wallet programme is a critical factor that has enhanced farm entrepreneurship in rural Nigeria. However, results also show that the impact of mobile phones (as a channel to accessing and using modern agricultural inputs) is contingent on how mobile networks are able to link farmers who live in rural areas and work mainly in farming. The results suggest that increasing mobile phone services in rural Nigeria enhances farmers’ knowledge, information and adoption of improved farm inputs and by extension, spurs rural informal sector economic activities in sub-Saharan Africa. Implications for practice, policy and research are discussed.
Q10|Актуальное Состояние И Проблемы Сельского Хозяйства Сербии<BR>[Actual Status and Problems of Serbian Agriculture]|Russian. В статье представлен дескриптивный анализ актуального общего состояния сельского хозяйства в Республике Сербия.

In the paper core the data about agriculture production are demonstrated, especially on technical crops. It is also shown the critique view on Serbian agriculture with comparative previous data. At the end it was introduced the actual problems of Serbian agriculture.
Q10|Subject Pools and Deception in Agricultural and Resource Economics Experiments|Abstract The use of student subjects and deception in experiments are two controversial issues that often raise concerns among editors and reviewers, which might prevent quality research from being published in agricultural and resource economics (ARE) journals. We provide a self-contained methodological discussion of these issues. We argue that field professionals are the most appropriate subjects for questions related to policy or measurement, and students are the most appropriate subjects for scientific research questions closely tied to economic theory. Active deception, where subjects are provided with explicitly misleading information, has been avoided in the mainstream economics discipline because it can lead to a loss of experimental control, lead to subject selection bias, and impose negative externalities on other researchers. Disciplinary ARE journals may want to abide by these norms against deception to maintain credibility. Interdisciplinary ARE journals may have more flexibility, although it is important to provide guidelines to avoid too much reviewer-specific variation in standards. For ARE researchers, we suggest employing a deception-free experimental design whenever possible because we know of no field in which deception is encouraged.
Q10|Soil resource and the profitability and sustainability of farms: A soil quality investment model| There is a growing public concern for soils and the maintenance or enhancement of soil quality. Actually, soil resource plays a central role in issues regarding food security and climate change mitigation. Through their practices, farmers impact the physical, biological and chemical quality of their soils. However, in a strained economic environment, farmers face a trade-off between short term objectives of production and profitability, and a long term objective of soil resource conservation. In this article, we investigate the conditions under which farmers have a private interest to preserve the quality of their soil. We also characterize the optimal management strategies of soil quality dynamics. We use a simplified theoretical soil quality investment model, where farmers maximise their revenues under a soil quality dynamics constraint. In our production function, soil quality and productive inputs are cooperating production factors. In addition, productive inputs have a detrimental impact on soil quality dynamics. It appears that in some cases, farmers have a private and financial interest in preserving the quality of their soil at a certain level, since it is an endogenous production factor cooperating with productive inputs. However, situations can occur wherein the cooperative production benefits of soil quality and productive inputs are smaller than the marginal deterioration of soil quality due to productive inputs. In this case, one cannot draw conclusions about the existence of an equilibrium.
Q10|Promoting Metropolitan And Periurban Agriculture In Urban Climate: The Madre Project|The paper presents an approach to put forward Metropolitan and Peri-Urban Agriculture (MPA) in the framework of the MADRE Interreg MED project. The MADRE project, which stands for ?Metropolitan Agriculture for Developing and innovative sustainable and Responsible Economy?, is designing a methodological framework in order to identify and characterize best practices of MPA in Mediterranean urban conurbations. Aiming at promoting a change process in the metropolitan food supply model, the project will focus on identifying key factors that foster and hamper MPA development according to stakeholders actively involved in MPA, i.e. key players from the quadruple helix involving private actors (farmers, producers and SMEs), civil society (consumers? groups, NGOs), academia and research and public authorities. It should be noted that the MPA innitiatives started to be more and more considered as an important factor for supplying food to the city dwellers, not only in developing countries but also to the metropolitans of the Northern sphere. It can play a crucial role towards encountering climate change by backing up urban ecosystems and urban biodiversity. To address the challenges of MPA, the approach proposed by MADRE partners is to allow a technical and political empowerment of local food production networks of five countries (France, Greece, Italy, Albania and Spain) through the development of a transnational cluster of MPA stakeholders. Such a transnational organization and networking, will allow those actors to foster their eco-innovation capacity (i.e. producers? innovation, consumers? innovation, social innovation, territorial innovation, transnational innovation and academic research) and thus to increase their impact on national, regional and metropolitan policies. Although there are still gaps of knowledge and uncertainties in studying sustainability issues for the three pillars (environment, economy and society) the proposed approach provides a roadmap for decision-makers to put forward urban agriculture in an organized manner. (This paper has received funding from the ERDF through the MED Interreg Programme under Grant Agreement No. 1MED15_1.1_M3_138).
Q10|Environmental perception of resident farmers in agroforestry yards|The objective of this study was to investigate aspects related to the perception of sustainable agriculture, especially on agroforestry yards, on rural properties of family farmers. Considering the proposed objectives, the present research is methodologically characterized as quantitative, exploratory and descriptive. The work was carried out on rural properties of the family farmers of the Rural region of Ponte Alta, Gama Administrative Region, in the city of Brasília, Federal District, Brazil. The questionnaire used was composed of five blocks of questions, structured according to the objectives to be reached, in order to identify the profile of the family farmers, use of the yard, and environmental perceptions. The data treatment was performed through descriptive statistical analysis, using the R² software. We interviewed 99 people aged between 18 and 83 years with an average age of 49 years. Family farmers in the Ponte Alta - Gama region have little education. About 40% of the interviewees did not finish high school. Most farmers plant for the purpose of feeding, amounting to 96.97%. Then, the main reason is the trade, with more than half of the respondents, 57.58%. Finally, the other reasons were not so relevant, leisure with 14.14%, landscaping with 13.13%, occupational therapy and others with 8.08%. 45% of the informants refer to water as the main factor of the environment, while 75% have the perception that deforestation is the main source of aggression to natural resources. The agroforestry yards, in addition to ensuring a rich and diverse diet, both for self-consumption or to market surpluses in the local marketing channels, allows the planting and conservation of forest species important for the conservation of nature and softens environmental impacts on small farms. The study of perception in ethnobotanical and socio-forest relations can favor a more sustainable use of environmental resources.
Q10|Risk attitudes, knowledge, skills and agricultural productivity|Agriculture is a risky business contingent on risks and uncertainty. Without strong technical knowledge, farmers tend to rely heavily on heuristics and subjective judgments to deal with their daily business. It is crucial to understand farmersâ€™ practices to provide suitable supports. This study uses a rich data set from a long panel household survey to assess farmersâ€™ agricultural productivity in Hue province of Vietnam that we combine with data collected from special surveys conducted in 2014 and 2015 focusing on farmersâ€™ knowledge, skills and risk attitudes. It aims to provide an overview of the environment in which farmers do business under constraints. Particularly, we investigate the relations among risk attitudes, farmersâ€™ knowledge, management ability and agricultural productivity by using univariate and bivariate analyses. The results indicate a large variation in farmersâ€™ knowledge. Most of them have low degree of technical knowledge, but show higher subjective knowledge. Agricultural performance tends to be more dependent on subjective knowledge than technical knowledge. Accordingly, farmers received limited support from the extension institutions. While risk attitudes are significantly correlated with farmersâ€™ knowledge and decision-making ability in livestock production, it has no direct significant relation with agricultural performance. The previous outcome showed that livestock productivity is prone to fluctuation, risk-taking should be important for farmers to cope with shocks. This study suggests extension services to fill the gap between subjective knowledge and technical knowledge and to build a significant linkage between risk-taking and learning to improve farmersâ€™ abilities and consequently enhance agricultural productivity.
Q10|EU labour in agricultural sector of the United Kingdom|Today, many EU states face labour shortages in different sectors of economy, including agricultural sectors. Labour migration represents the solution which enables countries to cope with this problem. This is also the case of agricultural sector of the United Kingdom. After the EU enlargement, out of all old Member States only the United Kingdom alongside with Ireland and Sweden granted people from the Central and Eastern Europe countries free access to their labour markets. In case of the UK this was seen as strategic step, since the government recognized the important role of migrant workers in the growth of the UK’s economy. Soon after enlargement, the UK became favourite destination of migrant workers from A-8 countries. In 2007, when another two countries – Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU, the economic situation was different and the UK decided to apply transitional arrangements. Despite this, there were a lot of migrants coming to the UK and most of them were working in agriculture, since for seasonal agricultural workers there was an exception. After the restrictions were removed in January, 2014, migration inflows from Bulgaria and Romania almost doubled. Before referendum in 2016, migration was an important issue and one of the main arguments of Leave campaign. Using available statistical data, the paper examines migration flows to the UK and describes key features of migration from EU with special focus on A-10 countries. The main objective is to evaluate the importance of migrant workers from these new Member States in the agriculture and food manufacturing industry of the UK and reveal possible implications associated with Brexit.
Q10|The impact of agricultural activities on urbanization: evidence and implications for India| As a part of the development process, India is currently going through a transformation from agriculture based economy to industry and service lead urbanized economy. However, no formal quantitative research has been done on this phenomenon. In this perspective, based on Matsuyama’s (1992. Agricultural productivity, comparative advantage and economic growth. Journal of Economic Theory, 58(2), 317–334. doi:10.1016/0022-0531(92)90057-O) theoretical framework and using panel data model, the impact of agricultural activities on urbanization in India is analyzed in this paper. For the analysis 15 major agricultural states of India are considered for the period of 1981–2015 by sourcing data from mainly Census of India and Ministry of agriculture, government of India. The results indicates that overall agricultural activities measured by share, growth rate and total agricultural production, amount of cultivated land area, amount of rainfall and rural male employment have a negative effect on urbanization. However, some specific agricultural activities such as higher consumption of fertilizer, state government expenditure on agriculture, production of major crops (wheat, bajra and pulses), rural female employment in agriculture, and rural literacy rate have had a positive impact on urbanization. The results also show that the effect of agriculture productivity is positive on urbanization for a less trade open economy like India. Finally, it is suggested that there is need of higher agricultural development in order to achieve a higher level of urbanization in India. For this purpose use of technology in agriculture sector along with higher level rural education is required. Finally, we need to have balanced rural and urban policy for a smooth rural- urban transformation in India.
Q10|Framework for analyzing and assessing the system of governance and the level of agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria and China|This framework is a part of a bilateral research cooperation project between Bulgaria and China on „Governing and Assessment of Agrarian Sustainability - Experiences, Challenges, and Lessons from Bulgaria and China“ funded by the Bulgarian Science Fund and the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (http://bg-china.alle.bg/). First, major definitions are presented. After that a Framework for analyzing the system of governance of agrarian sustainability is outlined. Finally, a Framework for assessing sustainability levels of agriculture is presented. Theoretical and mythological approaches are previously presented by another publication (Bachev, Ivanov, Toteva, Sokolova). This framework is being used for analyzing the system of governance and the level of agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria and China, and comparative analysis between two countries
Q10|Growth Performance and Resource Use Efficiency of Maize in Bihar: An Economic Perspectives|The present investigation was undertaken to evaluate the growth in area, production and productivity and resource use efficiency of maize in various agro-climatic zones of Bihar. The growth pattern in production and productivity were also observed to be positive and statistically significant. The trends in area, production and productivity were also observed positive for both the growth models, linear and compound.The resource use efficiency was evaluated zone-wise and for state as whole levels using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique for the block period 2008-09 to 2010-11. Technical efficiencies at state level in maize production were found to be 64% for kharif maize and 71% in rabi maize. Allocative mean efficiencies for kharif and rabi maize were calculated 68% and 65%, indicating that farmers could reduce costs by 32% and 35% by using optimum proportions of inputs considering it’s prices while selecting it’s quantities. Farmers of zone-II of Bihar are well known for large scale production of rabi maize, but still there exist technical inefficiency by 24% and AE by 9%. The value of cost efficiency (CE) emphasizes the reduction of cost by 30% to produce exiting level of output at least cost. The farmers of zone-III are more technically sound as compared to zone-I, zone-II and thus, even at state level too, the TE was observed 88% and 87% for kharif and rabi maize, respectively but AE is very less as compared to other zones i.e. 52% for rabi maize
Q10|Oyster Mushroom as Cash-Crop Fungus Cultivated|Oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) is a fungus that much-loved by the community. In addition to the delicious, oyster mushrooms are also very beneficial to the health of the body. High nutritional content with a variety of essential amino acids contained in it, Oyster mushrooms also contain other compounds that are important for the medical aspects. It is easily cultivated and derives income as cash for the farmer. In nature, oyster mushrooms grow only in certain seasons in limited quantities So the oyster mushroom has a good prospect to be cultivated. Oyster mushrooms can be grown in the wood powder media packed in plastic bags. In oyster mushroom cultivation activities include: preparation of tools and materials, preparation of raw materials, mixing media, composting, pasteurization, inoculation, incubation, growth and maintenance, harvesting, postharvest and marketing.
Q10|Sustainability level of Bulgarian agriculture|This paper presents a holistic approach for assessing agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria based on its economic, social and ecological aspects on sectoral macro-level. It is based on official statistical and other information as well as on expert evaluation. Our study has found that the Bulgarian agriculture on macro-level has good sustainability. Some of the sustainability aspects have higher levels (e.g. the economic aspect) while others (social and environmental) are inferior. Study results could help in focusing the political efforts, so that the agrarian sustainability, in its social and ecological aspect, could be increased. However, a further research is needed to evaluate the level of sustainability at micro-level, so that the major issues and problem areas are addressed accordingly.
Q10|Сельское Хозяйство России В Свете Итогов Всероссийской Сельскохозяйственной Переписи 2016 Года<BR>[Agriculture in Russia from the perspective of results of 2016 Russian Agricultural Census]|"The textbook was prepared with regard to the publication of the preliminary results of 2016 Russian Agricultural Census as at 1 July 2016. They reflect the current state of multistructural agriculture in Russia, which resulted from the transformation after 1990, the development of market relations and the implementation of the state agrarian policy for the period after 2006 Russian Agricultural Census. The manual briefly examines the general state of agricultural resources in Russia as a whole and their changes during the period of the implementation of state programs in 2006-2016, and some methodological approaches to analyzing the results of the census were proposed.

Q10|Land use, forest preservation and biodiversity in Asia|Continuous increase in one side of human populations and on the other side on the number of extinct and endangered species in Asia requires appropriate land use and forest preservation. Forests provide a number of benefits such as regulation of global climate and ecosystems, provision of raw materials and wild foods for local communities, watershed protection for a region, national income from ecotourism, carbon sequestration, being a landscape and habitat of rare species. This introduction provides summary for land use, forest preservation and biodiversity policy in Asia.
Q10|Is Aid for Agriculture Effective in Sub-Saharan Africa?|One of the key economic development challenges facing Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is its low agricultural productivity. Governments, donors, and foreign investors have underinvested in African agriculture even though research evidence shows that higher agricultural productivity would boost economic growth and poverty reduction. Solutions to the problem require a number of interconnected strategies, including, but not limited to, research on seeds and inputs, extension services, rural development, credit, institutional, and trade and price stabilization policies. We use the system two-step Generalized Method of Moments to examine whether official development assistance (ODA) for agriculture and rural development is helping to boost agricultural productivity. We find a positive relationship between ODA and agricultural productivity. However, when broken down into the main agricultural ODA recipient sectors, there is a substitution effect between food crop production and industrial crop production. While there exists a positive relationship between ODA for industrial and export crops output per worker (agricultural productivity), ODA for food crops has a negative relationship. Better public institutions and economic freedom are also found to enable agricultural productivity growth and to increase the ODA effectiveness. We correct the results for spurious correlation assuming that more ODA might be allocated where agricultural productivity is already increasing due to some other factors. Concerning the determinants of ODA allocation, we find that the allocation of ODA for agriculture is primarily determined by agricultural need, and that the expected effectiveness increases the ODA receipts. Finally, there is a weak ODA-led structural economic change effect in SSA. Labor released from agriculture to the urban sector(s) has a positive market effect on agriculture but is not engendering significant structural economic transformation.
Q10|Agricultural Mobility of Tribes: A Village -Level Study in Kerala|This paper epitomizes the dynamics in agrarian livelihood of a tribal community. The study probes the transformation taking place over the period with a focus on their agricultural patterns. Outcome of the inquiry reveals that a shift in the pattern and practices of cultivation enforced by the outside elements as a direct outcome of the injection of money economy has not fulfilled the targeted benefits in their life. It has disrupted not only their resource base but their livelihood fabric also. The additional risk of irreversible climate changes further erodes the livelihood trajectory of this resource oriented group. If not checked timely, the situation will result in further downward mobility in agricultural as well as livelihood.
Q10|Researches regarding the confirmation of sunflower hibrises by influence of technological verifications in the south water area of Romania|The main purpose of this paper is to determine the best sunflower hybrids (Helianthus annuus) suitable for the southern part of Romania, which under different conditions of fertilization and technology will lead to the achievement of large and stable productions. The experience was located at INCDA Fundulea, on a uniform chernozem soil in terms of fertility and microrelief. The experimental module was of the trifactor type and was arranged according to the subdivision parcel method in three rehearsals. The cultivation of the plants was carried out under optimum conditions, specific to the culture area, in the non-irrigated version, the genotypes taken into study consisting of three hybrids: Performer, Barolo RO and PR64A89. The conclusions are to determine the associated influence of three crop factors, namely plant density, fertilization and hybrid influence on sunflower production under the climatic year 2013.

Study on price developments|This paper is based on analysis of the sugar market at national and European level on the development of prices for the sugar market which will analyse the problems leading to stagnation and imbalance national sugar production, try solving the problems identified at national level taking as examples beet farms in Europe for analysing prices. Through sugar market perspectives we have identified the proposed strategy for market development, her objectives and factors affecting the price of sugar in Romania, evolution of prices and consumer price indices.
Q10|Institutional Intervention and the Feminization of Farm Sector: Lessons of Experiments with KDMS and MKSP in Kerala|Two transitions-the migration of male workers to urban areas in pursuit of remunerative jobs and the growing discontentment among the farmers with regard to the expectation of farm profits-that the farm sector has seen recently are said to be contributing to the evolution of a kind of transformation in Indian farm sector which is nothing but an emerging phenomenon of feminization of farm activities. But the grey side of this seemingly inevitable transformation lies in the distribution of land holdings, a kind of gender disparity in the distribution of operational holdings, which, given institutional interventions like the KDMS, can be solved in future. The advent of MKSP has given fillip to the process of farm feminization in Kerala. These bright aspects notwithstanding, certain systemic lacuna have been found in the functioning of MKSP under the KDMS model. The field study unequivocally raises certain apprehensions as to the excessive political interference camouflaged in the functioning of the programme. The study also calls for the effective institutional interventions in enhancing the effectiveness of MKSP in accelerating the pace of feminization of farm sector.
Q10|Productivity, technical efficiency and technological change in French agriculture during 2002-2014: A Färe-Primont index decomposition| The objective of the article is to assess productivity change in French agriculture during 2002-2014, namely total factor productivity (TFP) change and its components technological change and technical efficiency change. For this, we use the economically-ideal Färe-Primont index which verifies the multiplicatively completeness property and is also transitive, allowing for multi-temporal/lateral comparisons. To compare the technology gap change between the six types of farming considered, we extend the Färe-Primont to the meta-frontier framework. Results indicate that during 2002-2014, all farms experienced a TFP progress. Pig and/or poultry farms had the lowest TFP increase, while beef farms had the highest (19.1%). The latter farms had the strongest increase in technical efficiency, while technological progress was the highest for mixed farms. The meta-frontier analysis shows that field crop farms’ technology is the most productive of all types of farming.
Q10|The Impact of Exchange Rate Pass-Through on Implicit Price Index of Iran's Agriculture Sector: An Application of M-GARCH and Threshold Regression Models|"The impact of exchange rate changes on prices called ""Exchange Rate Pass-Through (ERPT)"" is an important issue in economics. Changes in the exchange rate can affect agricultural product prices through the import prices of raw materials. Also, the dependency of the agricultural exports on the exchange rate can accelerate this relationship. Bearing in mind the strategic position of agricultural products, dealing with the above issue should be highly regarded by the agricultural sector policymakers. The purpose of the present paper is to study the impact of ERPT on the implicit price index of Iran's agriculture sector. It also deals with the possibility of any threshold value for the exchange rate from 1971-2014 .To do so, using time series data from the Central Bank of Iran, Multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (M-GARCH) and Threshold Regression (TR) models have been estimated. The estimation results indicate that the past shocks of nominal exchange rate had a positive impact on the agriculture implicit price index. Also, the findings of the threshold regression estimation show that applying ERPT to implicit price index of agriculture products revealed a threshold value of 9226 Rials. In other words, an increase in the exchange rate higher than the threshold level will cause a much higher increase in the implicit price index of agriculture products in Iran."
Q10|The Goose that laid the golden eggs? Agricultural development in Latin America in the 20yh century|In the last third of the nineteenth century, a large majority of Latin America adopted export-led models of growth, mostly based on agricultural exports. In some countries, this strategy produced significant results in terms of economic development but in most of the countries, the strategy was not successful, either because of too slow growth in exports or because linkages with the rest of the economy were very weak and there was no significant growth-spreading effect. After WWII, Latin America turned to a new model of economic development: the import substitution industrialisation (ISI). The ISI policies penalised export-led agriculture. The 1980s and 1990s were characterised by an expansion of adjustment policies and structural reforms. The new strategy consisted of mobilising resources in competitive export sectors, including agriculture.
Q10|Development models, agricultural policies, and agricultural growth: Peru, 1950-2010|Throughout its history, Peru, as a small open economy, has undergone cycles of crisis and recovery, usually linked to fluctuations in the international market. The Peruvian economy has always been an exporter of primary products and an importer of manufactured goods This paper has a two-fold aim: to identify the salient characteristics of the development models and policies affecting Peruvian agriculture since the mid-twentieth century, and to identify what effect they have had on agricultural production and productivity based on an estimation of total-factor productivity (TFP) for the 1950-2010 period.Development strategy models have ranged from the diversification of primary exports, to import-substitution industrialisation, and the promotion of non-traditional exports, which is the current model. These strategies have determined the outcome for agriculture.
Q10|Technical efficiency of dairy farms in Uruguay: a stochastic production frontier analysis|The productivity of Uruguayan dairy farms has been consistently growing for the last 40 years. This process has implied the adoption of new technologies which have had significant effects on the production system. The efficiency with which available technologies are used influence output growth. Hence, assuring and enhancing dairy farms’ productivity and efficiency represent an important challenge to improve the competitiveness of the sector and achieve sustained economic growth. The overall objective of this study is to analyze the efficiency performance of dairy farms in Uruguay. Using a cross-sectional database, this study estimates a Cobb-Douglas stochastic production frontier and technical inefficiency model for dairy farms to determine the effect of each input on the production frontier and the principal factors that explain differences in farm efficiency. Results show that the number of milking cows has the highest effect on production, followed by the total consumption of feed, including concentrated feed, hay and silage. Although veterinary, agronomic and accounting assistance matter, the major determinants of efficiency differences are farmers’ specialization in dairy farming and the usage of artificial insemination. Overall, farm profiles indicate that those in the high efficiency group achieve a higher level of milk production than those less efficient; and they produce under a more intensive production system than farmers in low efficiency groups.
Q10|On the Structural Transformation of Rural Africa|From 2000 to 2014, per capita GDP in sub-Saharan Africa increased by almost 35% in real terms, doubling in some countries. Such progress has happened while agricultural productivity growth remained low in the aggregate, despite some bright spots, and poverty reduction has been steady but discouragingly slow. This paper argues that ending extreme poverty will require structural change in agriculture and in rural African economies more broadly. Drawing on a range of recent research, this paper outlines broad priority areas for policy actions to accelerate productivity and initiate structural change in the agriculture sector and the rural non-farm economy.
Q10|Key policy actions for sustainable land and water use to serve people|To achieve food security for all, new resource policies for sustainable land and water use are needed. Land, water and energy need to be considered jointly in policies, not in isolation. United Nations, G20 countries' policy makers, corporate and civil society actors, and those of other countries should act in coordinated fashion in the following four policy areas on which specific proposals are made in this policy paper: 1) focusing land, and water resource policies on human wellbeing, 2) investing in and sharing water, agricultural and energy innovations, 3) making wider use of digital opportunities for sustainable agriculture, and 4) re-designing global governance of agriculture and food.
Q10|F.R.A.N.Z.-Studie: Hindernisse und Perspektiven für mehr Biodiversität in der Agrarlandschaft|Zu Beginn des Demonstrations- und Dialogprojekts 'F.R.A.N.Z. - Für Ressourcen, Naturschutz und Landwirtschaft mit Zukunft' wurden 2017 bundesweit Landwirte und Berater zur Umsetzung von Biodiversitätsmaßnahmen in landwirtschaftlichen Betrieben in Deutschland befragt. In 44 leitfadengestützten Interviews und drei Gruppendiskussionen berichteten die Befragten über aktuelle Hemmnisse und Verbesserungsmöglichkeiten in der landwirtschaftlichen Praxis. Im Fokus standen Agrarumwelt- und Klimamaßnahmen und weitere regionale Programme. Neben den agrarpolitischen Rahmenbedingungen und konkreten Erfahrungen mit Maßnahmen wurden betriebswirtschaftliche, produktionstechnische und administrative Aspekte angesprochen. Auch die Vereinbarkeit mit den Wertvorstellungen Dritter sowie die konkrete Beratungsleistung kamen zur Sprache. Der Fragebogen bestand überwiegend aus halboffenen und offenen Fragen, die dazu dienten herauszufinden, welche Gründe aus Sicht des Betriebsleiters ausschlaggebend bei der Entscheidung für oder gegen die Umsetzung von Biodiversitätsmaßnahmen sind. Folgende Kernaussagen lassen sich aus den Antworten ableiten: - Die Wirtschaftlichkeit des Betriebs darf nicht beeinträchtigt werden. - Die Sicherheit über den Fortbestand der Programme in der bestehenden Form sowie die Sicherheit bezüglich der Kenntnis von Auflagen werden als unzureichend angesehen. - Die Notwendigkeit von Sanktionen wird anerkannt, es herrscht jedoch große Angst vor Anlastungen bei unbewussten/nicht zu verhindernden Verstößen (z. B. witterungsbedingt). - Mehr Flexibilität bei Bearbeitungsterminen, Abmessungen und der generellen Ausgestaltung der Maßnahmen ist eine zentrale Forderung der Befragten. - Ein wichtiges Anliegen aller Beteiligten ist es, die Ziele und Erfolge der Maßnahmen verstärkt durch Beratung und Öffentlichkeitsarbeit zu kommunizieren. - Die Verbesserung des Images des eigenen Betriebs und der Landwirtschaft allgemein stellt ein wichtiges Motiv der Befragten für die Umsetzung von Maßnahmen dar. Die Befragung hat gezeigt, dass sowohl harte Faktoren wie die Wirtschaftlichkeit als auch weiche Faktoren wie das Image über die Umsetzung von Maßnahmen entscheiden. Um eine bessere Akzeptanz zu erreichen, müssten die Maßnahmen flexibler an regionale Ansprüche angepasst werden. Ebenso gilt es, die Kommunikation innerhalb der Landwirtschaft, aber auch nach außen in Richtung Gesellschaft/Bevölkerung zu intensivieren.
Q10|Abschätzung des Schadpotentials von Hochwasser- und Extremwetterereignissen für landwirtschaftliche Kulturen|Der folgende Bericht untersucht die ökonomischen Auswirkungen von Hochwasser auf die Landwirtschaft in Deutschland anhand von Hochwasserrisikogebieten sowie die Auswirkungen von extremen Dürre und Frostereignissen auf landwirtschaftliche Erträge von Weizen, Roggen, Gerste, Raps, Kartoffeln, Mais und Zuckerrüben. Damit baut der Bericht auf das Projekt 'Agrarrelevante Extremwetterlagen und Möglichkeiten von Risikomanagementsystemen' auf, welches vom Bundesministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft (BMEL) beauftragt und gefördert wurde und 2015 abgeschlossen wurde (Gömann et al. 2015). Der Literaturüberblick über die zukünftige Entwicklung von Hochwasserereignissen zeigt überwiegend eine steigende Tendenz von Hochwasserereignissen in der Zukunft, wobei das Ausmaß des Anstiegs regional und zwischen den Studien unterschiedlich ist. Insgesamt konnte in den Analysen ein maximaler Erlösverlust von 394 Mio. € beim Ackerland (davon 189 Mio. € auf Getreideflächen) ermittelt werden, wenn im Jahr 2010 100 Prozent der HQ100-Fläche in Deutschland betroffen gewesen wären. Für die Abschätzung der monetären Schäden von weiteren Extremwetterereignissen wurde der in Gömann et al. (2015) verwendete Schätzansatz geringfügig weiterentwickelt. Bei Winterweizen stellen die Verluste aufgrund von Kahlfrostextremereignissen mit ca. 30 Mio. €/Jahr den wichtigsten der untersuchten Schäden dar. Auch Trockenheit/Dürre zu unterschiedlichen Zeiten des Vegetationsverlaufes sowie extreme Hitze in der Blütezeit führen zu deutlichen Schäden auf sektoraler Ebene. In der Summe lagen die berechneten Schäden aufgrund von Trockenheit/Dürre/Hitze bei ca. 40 Mio. €/Jahr. Alle untersuchten Extremereignisse zusammen summieren sich auf 78 Mio. €/Jahr auf. Die Situation bei Wintergerste stellt sich insgesamt recht ähnlich dar und die Kosten summieren sich zusammen auf 36 Mio. €/Jahr auf. Für Winterraps summieren sich alle untersuchten Extremereignisse auf 47 Mio. €/Jahr, für Körnermais auf ca. 12 Mio. €/Jahr auf. Bei Kartoffeln haben Schäden aufgrund von extremer Sommertrockenheit die größte Bedeutung für Betriebe ohne Bewässerung, gefolgt von Ertragsverlusten aufgrund von Spätfrösten und Staunässe. Für Zuckerrüben konnten Schäden nur das Ereignis 'Extreme Sommertrockenheit' bestimmt werden. Diese belaufen sich auf ca. 7 Mio. €/Jahr.
Q10|Betriebs- und Unternehmensstrukturen in der deutschen Landwirtschaft: Workshop zu vorläufigen Ergebnissen und methodischen Ansätzen|Viele landwirtschaftliche Unternehmen in Deutschland setzen sich aus mehreren rechtlich selbständigen Betrieben zusammen. Dabei sind die landwirtschaftlichen und landwirtschaftsnahen Betriebe oftmals auf mehrere Familienmitglieder aufgeteilt. Insbesondere durch Professionalisierung und Wachstum in landwirtschaftsnahen Diversifizierungsbereichen entstehen gewerbliche Betriebe neben dem landwirtschaftlichen Betrieb. Diese Entwicklung und deren statistische Erfassung können Schwierigkeiten bei Politikanalysen mit sich bringen. Aus diesem Grund wurde am Thünen-Institut ein Projekt zur Analyse der Betriebs- und Unternehmensstrukturen in der deutschen Landwirtschaft gestartet. Ziel des Projektes ist es festzustellen, wie verbreitet komplexe Strukturen sind und wie diese in der offiziellen Agrarstatistik erfasst und dargestellt werden. Im Rahmen des Projektes wurde bislang eine regionale empirische Studie auf Basis von Experteninterviews durchgeführt, um die Verbreitung komplexer Strukturen einzuschätzen. Ferner wurden die vorhandenen Daten zu Landwirtschaft- und landwirtschaftsnahen Bereichen sowie die angewandten Erhebungsmethoden mit Hilfe von Literatur- und Datenrecherchen sowie zahlreichen Experteninterviews sondiert. Im Rahmen des Projektworkshops wurden die Zwischenergebnisse des Forschungsvorhabens präsentiert und diskutiert. Die bisherigen Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die aktuelle Methodik der offiziellen Agrarstatistik nur einen Teil der für die Politikanalyse und -beratung relevanten Einheiten in Bezug auf Betriebs- und Unternehmensstrukturen abdecken kann. Ferner wurde festgestellt, dass die aktuell vorliegenden Informationsquellen zur Landwirtschaft und zum landwirtschaftsnahen Bereich keinen wesentlichen zusätzlichen Erkenntnisgewinn in Bezug auf Betriebs- und Unternehmensstrukturen liefern können, solange diese nicht kombiniert werden. Im weiteren Verlauf des Projektes ist es geplant, die Relevanz einzelner Betriebs- und Unternehmenseinheiten (z. B. Biogasanlagen) einzuschätzen und diese Einheiten mit den zugehörigen landwirtschaftlichen Betrieben zu verknüpfen. Die Ergebnisse sollen mit einer empirischen Studie vervollständigt und die Auswirkungen der Berücksichtigung komplexer Strukturen auf die Analyse der Einkommenslage der landwirtschaftlichen Haushalte abgeschätzt werden. Im Rahmen des Workshops wurden vier Impulsvorträge zu folgenden Themen gehalten: (1) Umgang mit komplexen Unternehmen im Statistischen Unternehmensregister; (2) Auswirkung fehlender Informationen zu komplexen Strukturen auf die Politikanalyse und -beratung; (3) Handhabung komplexer landwirtschaftlicher Betriebe in der offiziellen Agrarstatistik und (4) agrarstatistisches System in Österreich.
Q10|Bank concentration and sectoral growth: Evidence from Chinese provinces|This paper studies the relationship between bank concentration and economic growth in China. It uses panel data for 31 provinces and 8 different sectors over the period 2001–2013. Using two-stage least squares regressions, we find that bank concentration negatively and significantly impacts sectoral growth for Chinese provinces. This finding has relevant policy implication for policy-makers and academics since it suggests that the low level of bank concentration in the Chinese financial sector promotes economic growth, a finding that this is highly relevant in this period of economic slowdown.
Q10|The social costs of second-best policies: Evidence from agricultural GHG mitigation|This paper investigates the social costs of second-best agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation policies. Adjustments along the land use and input intensity margins are represented within a regionalized optimization model of California crop production calibrated to economic and agronomic information. Second-best policies relying on spatially aggregated GHG emission factors lead to small abatement efficiency losses, while policies targeting a single GHG lead to moderate losses. In contrast, policies targeting a single input entail large abatement efficiency losses, which nonetheless can be reduced by combining instruments.
Q10|Agricultural commercialization and nutrition revisited: Empirical evidence from three African countries|The transition from subsistence to commercial agriculture is key for economic growth. But what are the consequences for nutritional outcomes? The evidence to date has been scant and inconclusive. This study contributes to the debate by revisiting two prevailing wisdoms: (a) market participation by African smallholders remains low; and (b) the impact of commercialization on nutritional outcomes is generally positive. Using nationally representative data from three African countries, the analysis reveals high levels of commercialization by even the poorest and smallest landholders, with rates of market participation as high as 90%. Female farmers participate less, but tend to sell larger shares of their production, conditional on participation. Second, we find little evidence of a positive relationship between commercialization and nutritional status. As countries and international agencies prioritize the importance of nutrition-sensitive agriculture, better understanding of the transmission channels between crop choices and nutritional outcomes should remain a research priority.
Q10|Labor productivity and employment gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa|Drawing on a new set of nationally representative, internationally comparable household surveys, this paper provides an overview of key features of structural transformation – labor allocation and labor productivity – in four African economies. New, micro-based measures of sector labor allocation and cross-sector productivity differentials describe the incentives households face when allocating their labor. These measures are similar to national accounts-based measures that are typically used to characterize structural change. However, because agricultural workers supply far fewer hours of labor per year than do workers in other sectors in all of the countries analyzed, productivity gaps shrink by half, on average, when expressed on a per-hour basis. Underlying the productivity gaps that are prominently reflected in national accounts data are large employment gaps, which call into question the productivity gains that laborers can achieve through structural transformation. Furthermore, agriculture’s continued relevance to structural change in Sub-Saharan Africa is highlighted by the strong linkages observed between rural non-farm activities and primary agricultural production.
Q10|Food inflation and food price volatility in India: Trends and determinants| The study analyzes food inflation trends in India over the last decade. Annual trends show that different commodities have contributed to food inflation in different years and that no single commodity shows uniformly high inflation. A decomposition exercise shows that eggs, meat, fish, milk, cereals, and vegetables were generally the main contributors to recent food inflation. The contribution of pulses, except pigeon peas (arhar), and of edible oils remained low. Fruits and vegetables displayed a much higher degree of intrayear volatility, and high-weight commodities in the national consumption basket also showed very high inflation rates, which is a cause for concern. Results of the econometric analysis show that both supply and demand factors are important. Cereal and edible oil prices appear to be mainly driven by supply-side factors such as production, wage rates, and minimum support prices. For pulses, the effects of supply- and demand-side factors appear almost equal. The prices of eggs, meat, fish, milk, and fruits and vegetables appear to be driven mainly by demand-side factors.
Q10|Can Phosphate Salts Recovered from Manure Replace Conventional Phosphate Fertilizer?|Pig farming produces more manure than can reasonably be spread onto surrounding fields, particularly in regions with high livestock densities and limited land availability. Nutrient recycling offers an attractive solution for dealing with manure excesses and is one main objective of the European commission-funded project “BioEcoSIM”. Phosphate salts (“P-Salt”) were recovered from the separated liquid manure fraction. The solid fraction was dried and carbonized to biochar. This study compared the fertilizing performance of P-Salt and conventional phosphate fertilizer and determined whether additional biochar application further increased biomass yields. The fertilizers and biochar were tested in pot experiments with spring barley and faba beans using two nutrient-poor soils. The crops were fertilized with P-Salt at three levels and biochar in two concentrations. Biomass yield was determined after six weeks. Plant and soil samples were analysed for nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium contents. The P-Salt had similar or even better effects than mineral fertilizer on growth in both crops and soils. Slow release of nutrients can prevent leaching, rendering P-Salt a particularly suitable fertilizer for light sandy soils. Biochar can enhance its fertilizing effect, but the underlying mechanisms need further investigation. These novel products are concluded to be promising candidates for efficient fertilization strategies.

Q10|Development and Testing of a Device to Increase the Level of Automation of a Conventional Milking Parlor through Vocal Commands|A portable wireless device with a “vocal commands” feature for activating the mechanical milking phase in conventional milking parlors was developed and tested to increase the level of automation in the milking procedures. The device was tested in the laboratory and in a milking parlor. Four professional milkers participated in the experiment. Before the start of the tests, a set of acoustic models with speaker-dependent commands defined for the project was acquired for each milker using a dedicated “milker training procedure”. Two experimental sessions were performed by each milker, with one session in the laboratory and a subsequent session in the milking parlor. The device performance was evaluated based on the accuracy demonstrated in the vocal command recognition task and rated using the word recognition rate (WRR). The data were expressed as %WRR and grouped based on the different cases evaluated. Mixed effects logistic regression modeling was used to evaluate the association between the %WRR and explanatory variables. The results indicated significant effects due to the location where the tests were performed. Higher values of the %WRR were found for tests performed in the laboratory, whereas lower values were found for tests performed in the milking parlor (due to the presence of background noise). Nevertheless, the general performance level achieved by the device was sufficient for increasing the automation level of conventional milking parlors.
Q10|Practices for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Rice Production in Northeast Thailand|Land management practices for rice productivity and carbon storage have been a key focus of research leading to opportunities for substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. The effects of land management practices on global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) from rice production within the farm gate were investigated. For the 13 study sites, soil samples were collected by the Land Development Department in 2004. In 2014, at these same sites, soil samples were collected again to estimate the soil organic carbon sequestration rate (SOCSR) from 2004 to 2014. Surveys were conducted at each sampling site to record the rice yield and management practices. The carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions, Net GWP, and GHGI associated with the management practices were calculated. Mean rice yield and SOCSR were 3307 kg·ha −1 ·year −1 and 1173 kg·C·ha −1 ·year −1 , respectively. The net GWP varied across sites, from 819 to 5170 kg·CO 2 eq·ha −1 ·year −1 , with an average value of 3090 kg·CO 2 eq·ha −1 ·year −1 . GHGI ranged from 0.31 to 1.68 kg·CO 2 eq·kg −1 yield, with an average value of 0.97 kg·CO 2 eq·kg −1 yield. Our findings revealed that the amount of potassium (potash, K 2 O) fertilizer application rate is the most significant factor explaining rice yield and SOCSR. The burning of rice residues in the field was the main factor determining GHGI in this area. An effective way to reduce GHG emissions and contribute to sustainable rice production for food security with low GHGI and high productivity is avoiding the burning of rice residues.
Q10|State Support in Brazil for a Local Turn to Food|The local turn to food is often claimed to be a way to increase the value-added component retained by primary producers and to provide healthy, fresh and affordable food to consumers. Rio do Grande do Sul in Brazil has several governmental support programs that aim to empower family farmers and open up new market opportunities for them. This article examines these programs, investigates how small-scale farmers engage with them and the resultant changes in farming and marketing practices that ensue. The article uses cluster and content analysis to identify and interpret the extent, and the different ways, in which these farmers engage with and make use of the local knowledge and innovation system. The results provide useful insights into how policy instruments improve the performance of family agribusinesses, helping them to make better use of the resources available to them, encouraging farm diversification, and strengthening local interrelations between producers and consumers.
Q10|Beyond Food Provisioning: The Transformative Potential of Grassroots Innovation around Food|The newly-emerged ethical foodscape includes multiple expressions of innovation around food. With reference to the Italian context, this paper focuses on the transformative potential of the experiences of social innovation, innovative grassroots initiatives, which have been significantly contributed to shaping the food culture and production-consumption practices during the last two decades. While still consolidating their fundamentals and facing the challenge of growth, the networks behind them continue to be engaged in an effort of innovation, inside and outside their niche. The paper explores these dynamics. Understanding how these networks are managing their transformative capacity and what are the opportunities and challenges arising in the relation with the mainstream system may help to better capture and value the potential of this innovation niche, drawing useful lessons for fostering its expression and for a broader transition to more equitable and sustainable food systems.
Q10|Rice Cultivation and Greenhouse Gas Emissions: A Review and Conceptual Framework with Reference to Ghana|Rice is an essential crop in Ghana. Several aspects of rice have been studied to increase its production; however, the environmental aspects, including impact on climate change, have not been studied well. There is therefore a gap in knowledge, and hence the need for continuous research. By accessing academic portals, such as Springer Open, InTech Open, Elsevier, and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology’s offline campus library, 61 academic publications including peer reviewed journals, books, working papers, reports, etc. were critically reviewed. It was found that there is a lack of data on how paddy rice production systems affect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly emissions estimation, geographical location, and crops. Regarding GHG emission estimation, the review identified the use of emission factors calibrated using temperate conditions which do not suit tropical conditions. On location, most research on rice GHG emissions have been carried out in Asia with little input from Africa. In regard to crops, there is paucity of in-situ emissions data from paddy fields in Ghana. Drawing on the review, a conceptual framework is developed using Ghana as reference point to guide the discussion on fertilizer application, water management rice cultivars, and soil for future development of adaptation strategies for rice emission reduction.
Q10|Efflux of Soil Nitrous Oxide from Applied Fertilizer Containing Organic Materials in Citrus unshiu Field in Southwestern Japan|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from agricultural fields are an important source of the increasing atmospheric N 2 O concentration. We conducted a two-year investigation of soil N 2 O emissions induced by the application of combined organic and synthetic fertilizer (COS) and distilled silage waste (DSW). Three experimental treatments were applied to a Citrus unshiu field in January 2013 in Ehime, Japan: no fertilizer (NF), COS, and DSW. The applied nitrogen (N) from DSW was 192 and 244 kg N ha −1 in the first and second years, respectively, although the N application in COS was 192 kg N ha −1 in both years. The main N forms in COS and DSW were ammonium- and nitrate-N, respectively. Soil N 2 O and carbon dioxide fluxes, soil chemical properties, and mineral N leaching from topsoil were measured. The soil N 2 O flux increased after fertilization in COS and DSW, and a higher N 2 O efflux after supplemental fertilization was induced by warm and wet soil conditions. The emission factor of N 2 O was higher in COS (2.02%) than in DSW (1.18%), while N leaching was higher in DSW than in COS. The organic materials remaining after the application possibly increased the N 2 O emissions in the summer season. Therefore, to mitigate N 2 O emissions in citrus orchards, fertilizer containing organic materials should be applied during a cool and dry season.
Q10|Small-Scale Vegetable Farmers’ Participation in Modern Retail Market Channels in Indonesia: The Determinants of and Effects on Their Income|The rise of supermarkets in Indonesia since the end of the 1990s have been transforming the food retail sector and providing further market opportunities for small-scale farmers, in which most of Indonesia’s farmer falls into this category. The aim of this paper is to examine the supermarket participation and its effect on the well-being of small-scale farmers. We compare the differences between participants and non-participants in supermarket channels in order to explore the constraints on supermarket participation. By applying a treatment effects model which allows capturing the possibility of selection bias, we examine the factors that determine farmers’ participation as well as the effect on their income. The results show that younger farmers with higher levels of education, irrigated land, who have packaging equipment and storage facilities, and are located near paved roads, are more likely to participate in the supermarket channels. On the other hand, farmers who have sprayer equipment are more likely to participate in the traditional market channels. The effect analysis shows that small-scale farmer participation in the supermarket channels can boost their income.
Q10|Durum Wheat Cover Analysis in the Scope of Policy and Market Price Changes: A Case Study in Southern Italy|Agricultural land systems are the result of human interactions with the natural environment, and subjective evidence of socio-economic and environmental interactions has been demonstrated. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to analyze empirically the link between agricultural market and policy, as well as the environmental response due to changes in crop management by local stakeholders. In this study, we propose a cross investigation and analysis to bring the link between vegetation cover, policy, market and farmer’s behavior to light. Our methodology is a combination of a rational positive and analogical approach between the quantifiable and non-quantifiable agents on a temporal basis. The method is applied to a dominant mono-crop agricultural watershed in Southern Italy that has been dedicated to durum wheat cultivation. In this region, we studied the relationship between the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), durum wheat market price, vegetation cover and land allocation. As a first step, we conducted a separate analysis for each factor, exploiting Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observed Leaf Area Index (LAI) to analyze the land vegetation space–time distribution over the period 2000–2014 and three Land Satellite (Landsat) validated images as check-points for the agricultural pattern and CAP’s reforms. We used the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) and Eurostat data to investigate the on-farm accountancy and the durum wheat market price changes, respectively. Based on the study period, we developed a storyline of the major relevant CAP’s policy changes. In a second step, we conducted a comparative analysis where the CAP’s reforms were used as interpretational support, the land allocation and the on-farm accountability for CAP’s implementation, the price of durum wheat and the LAI for analytical comparison. We found interesting insights regarding the non-agronomic driving forces of LAI dynamics. The behavior of the individual farmers is influenced by the CAP policy that has been implemented by using profitability as the stimulus for the decision making of the farmer. This explains the correlation of the trend between the market price, the LAI of durum wheat and their associated dynamics.
Q10|Mitigating Global Warming Potential and Greenhouse Gas Intensities by Applying Composted Manure in Cornfield: A 3-Year Field Study in an Andosol Soil|A 3-year study was conducted in cornfield to evaluate how composted cattle manure application affects net global warming potential (GWP; the sum of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4 ) minus net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB)) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI; net GWP per unit of plant biomass yield). In the first experiment, conducted from 2010 to 2012, five fertilization strategies that included an unfertilized control plot, inorganic fertilizer-only plot, two plots with inorganic fertilizer plus composted cattle manure, and composted cattle manure-only plot were established. In the second experiment composted cattle manure was applied in autumn 2012 and the field was subdivided into three plots in spring 2013, with one plot receiving additional composted cattle manure, the second plot received additional inorganic fertilizer and the third plot did not receive any additional fertilization. Fluxes of N 2 O, CH 4 and CO 2 were measured using the static closed chamber method. NECB was calculated as carbon (C) inputs minus C output (where a negative value indicates net C loss). In experiment 1, manure application significantly increased NECB and reduced net GWP by more than 30% in each of the three years of the study. GHGI in the manure-amended plots was lower than in other plots, except in 2012 when the manure-only plot had higher GHGI than fertilizer-only plot. Application of inorganic fertilizer alone increased GWP by 5% and 20% in 2010 and 2011, but showed a 30% reduction in 2012 relative to the unfertilized control plot. However, due to higher net primary production (NPP), fertilizer-only plot had lower GHGI compared to the control. Application of inorganic fertilizer together with manure showed the greatest potential to reduce GWP and GHGI, while increasing NPP and NECB. In experiment 2, additional manure or inorganic fertilizer application in spring increased NPP by a similar amount, but additional manure application also increased NECB, and decreased GWP and GHGI. Manure application, as a partial substitute or supplemental fertilizer, shows potential to mitigate GWP and GHGI.
Q10|Advances in Eco-Efficient Agriculture: The Plant-Soil Mycobiome|In order to achieve a desirable ecological and sustainable agriculture a thorough understanding of the plant-soil mycobiome is imperative. Commercial industrial agriculture alters greenhouse gas emissions, promotes loss of plant and soil biodiversity, increases pollution by raising atmospheric CO 2 , and releases pesticides, thus affecting both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Diversified farming systems, including perennial cultivated pastures, are among worldwide strategies that aim to reduce terrestrial greenhouse gas emissions and deal with threats to global sustainability. Additionally, stimulation of soil microbes and appropriate soil management can influence soil interactions as well as the rates of organic matter decomposition and the release of gases. Agricultural soil microbial communities play a central role in ecosystem processes and are affected by biocontrol agents, biofertilizers, and exposure to pesticides, the extent to which is yet to be fully elucidated. Intercropping different plant species is beneficial, as this can increase carbon fixation by plants, transferring carbon to the soil, especially via mycorrhizas, thus modifying interplant interactions. This review focuses on agro-ecosystems, showing the latest advances in the plant-soil interface (the mycobiome) for an eco-efficient agricultural production.
Q10|Achieving Sustainability: Insights from Biogas Ecosystems in India|This paper focuses on how the use of renewable energy technologies such as biogas can help to achieve environmental and socio-economic sustainability. It combines research on sustainable consumption and production, natural and industrial ecosystems and renewable energy adoption to develop a framework for an industrial ecosystem for biogas for bottom-of-the-pyramid and rural populations. The framework suggests that three dimensions of industrial ecosystems and a meta-dimension can be embedded in the design of a new industrial ecosystem for biogas to facilitate environmental and socio-economic sustainability. Case studies of an organization engaged in using biogas to create a sustainable bioenergy ecosystem for rural populations and two organizations producing biogas in urban India provide support for the framework.
Q10|Assessment of Photosynthetic Pigment and Water Contents in Intact Sunflower Plants from Spectral Indices|Under water-limited conditions, monitoring water and chlorophyll status is essential to avoid restrictions in crop growth and yield. This study was carried out to assess water and chlorophyll contents from spectral indices in sunflower plants. The hybrid Sunbright Supreme was cultivated inside a non-acclimatized greenhouse until the start of the flowering stage, and later was maintained in a growth chamber with the purpose of submitting the plants to a slow and progressive dehydration rate for 12 consecutive days. Spectral (reflectance and transmittance), leaf masses (fresh and dry), and total chlorophyll measurements were accomplished in sunflower plants. The water stress caused a reduction in the water and chlorophyll contents, resulting in linear and nonlinear decreases for the spectral indicators Water Index (WI) and Chlorophyll Content Index (CCI), respectively. The low scattering of the average values around the fitted models indicates that WI and CCI were effective in representing changes in water and chlorophyll status for sunflowers ( R 2 = 0.912 and R 2 = 0.905). The benefits of using hand-held optical meters for reflectance and transmittance are that they enable rapid, accurate, and nondestructive assessments of water and chlorophyll contents in sunflower plants from radiometric indicators.
Q10|Changes in the Polyphenolic Profile, Carotenoids and Antioxidant Potential of Apricot ( Prunus armeniaca L.) Leaves during Maturation|Apricot ( Prunus armeniaca L.) leaves were studied to assess the potential of apricot leaves for future studies and their applications in nutraceutical and bioactive functional ingredients. The changes in the phenolic profile, carotenoids, pigments and antioxidant potential were studied at four maturation stages. Polyphenols and carotenoids were studied using reversed-phase HPLC-DAD. Pigments, total phenolic contents and radical scavenging activity were also measured. Results revealed twelve phenolic compounds in the apricot leaves. The major phenolic compounds were 3- O -caffeoylquinic acid (14.6–49.6 mg/g), 4- O -caffeoylquinic acid (0.56–7.5 mg/g), 5- O -caffeoylquinic acid (5.6–25.7 mg/g) and quercetin-3- O -glucosides (8.6–19.9 mg/g), while others include caffeic acid and derivatives of coumaric acid and kaempferol. Significant changes were observed in polyphenolic compounds during maturation. Lutein (56.7–65.7 µg/g), neoxanthin (0.66–4.79 µg/g), 5,6-epoxy-α-carotene (5.89–7.9 µg/g), and β-carotene (12.3–26.9 µg/g) were the major carotenoids. There were significant variations in the carotenoids, pigment contents, total phenolic contents and radical scavenging activity during maturation. In conclusion, significant variation occurred in the polyphenolic profile, carotenoids contents and antioxidant potential of apricot leaves under the studied conditions.
Q10|Ammonia and Methane Emission Factors from Cattle Operations Expressed as Losses of Dietary Nutrients or Energy|The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of published literature on ammonia (NH 3 ) and enteric methane (CH 4 ) emissions from beef and dairy cattle operations to obtain statistically representative emission factors based on dietary intakes of nutrients or energy, and to identify major causes of emission variations. NH 3 emissions from lagoon or other manure storage facilities were not included in this review. The NH 3 and CH 4 emission rates, expressed as a percentage losses of dietary nutrients or energy, demonstrated much less variation compared with emission rates expressed in g/animal/day. Air temperature and dietary crude protein (CP) content were identified as two major factors that can affect NH 3 emission rates in addition to farm type. Feed digestibility and energy intake were identified as two major factors that can affect CH 4 emission rates expressed as a percentage losses of dietary energy. Generally, increasing productivity and feed efficiency represented the greatest opportunity for mitigating NH 3 or CH 4 emissions per unit of livestock product. Expressing CH 4 loss on a digestible energy basis rather than a gross energy intake basis can better represent the large variation among diets and the effects of varying dietary emission mitigation strategies.

Q10|Effect of Organic and Inorganic Fertilizers on Soil Properties and the Growth, Yield and Quality of Tomato in Mymensingh, Bangladesh|Field trials were conducted on tomato for yield and quality of fruits using different types of organic and inorganic fertilizers at the horticulture farm of Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU), Mymensingh. Fertilizer treatments were tested on two varieties of tomato ca. Roma VF and BARI 15. The fertilization treatments were T1, vermicompost (12 t/ha); T2, compost (10 t/ha); T3, integrated plant nutrient system (IPNS) or mixed fertilizers (organic 2/3 part and inorganic 1/3 part); T4, inorganic fertilizers; and a control (T5). Results showed growth and yield (20.8 t/ha) in tomato were higher in the IPNS treatment. A higher number of fruits per plant (73.7) and plant height (73.5 cm) were obtained from mixed fertilizers (organic 2/3 + inorganic 1/3) or IPNS (integrated plant nutrient system) in Roma VF than other treatments. Fruit yield and diameter were found statistically significant. No significant difference was observed in the quality (total soluble solids) of tomato fruits in both varieties’ response to the treatments. The electrical conductivity and pH of the soil were improved by the application of organic manure.
Q10|Guest Editorial: Conservation Tillage for Organic Farming|There is interest in reducing or even eliminating tillage in organic production systems. In this special Issue, research teams in Europe and North America summarize recent and on-going efforts to develop conservation-tillage systems that can be used on commercial organic farms. While progress is being made in the development of organic no-tillage (no-till) systems, considerable work still needs to be done before there will be wide-spread adoption by organic farmers.
Q10|The Impact of a Warming Micro‐Climate on Muooni Farmers of Kenya|Rainfed agriculture has become highly vulnerable to the depleting water resources in most arid and semi‐arid tropics (ASATs) under the effect of climate change. The impact has certainly been very high in Muooni catchment where more than 99% of the natural forest has been cleared. The warming micro‐climate is accelerated by extended deforestation, unsustainable irrigation, and water over‐abstraction in the catchment by eucalyptus and other exotic trees. The dwindling crop yields add to the farmer’s suffering. Farming communities have created various innovative ways of coping with a warming environment to increase their agriculture resiliency. These include, among others, rain water management, reforestation and agro‐forestry. To what extent have these practices been disturbed by the increasing temperatures, and decreasing rainfalls and river discharges in Muooni catchment? This study used statistical forecast techniques to unveil the past, current and future variations of the micro‐climate in Muooni catchment, and relevant factors determining farmers’ vulnerability to drought. Muooni catchment is warming by 0.8 to 1.2 °C in a century as a result of a changing micro‐climate. These changes are mainly driven by deforestation due to the high urbanization rate and agricultural practices in Muooni catchment. Centennial rainfall is subsequently plummeting at 30 to 50 mm while discharges are decreasing from 0.01 to 0.05 m3∙s−1, with unmet water demands of 30% to 95% and above. In view of the current trends of the population growth and urbanization in Muooni, agricultural expansion is seriously threatened if no appropriate policy, extension service and science based emergency measures are put in place by the Government of Kenya.
Q10|Suppression of CH4 Emission by Rice Straw Removal and Application of Bio‐Ethanol Production Residue in a Paddy Field in Akita, Japan|To elucidate the effects of rice straw removal and rice straw‐based bio‐ethanol production residue application on rice growth and methane (CH4) emission from a paddy field, a lysimeter experiment with three treatments (application of rice straw after harvesting (the rice‐straw plot); removal of rice straw and the application of bio‐ethanol production residue (the Et‐residue plot); removal of rice straw (the no‐application plot)) was conducted over three years. Though the grain yields in the Et‐residue and no‐application plots tended to be slightly higher than that in the ricestraw plot, there were no significant differences among the plots (530–546 g∙m−2). Suppression of CH4 emission by the treatments was found clearly in the early part of the growing season. The total CH4 emissions during the rice‐growing season (unit: g∙C∙m−2∙period−1) followed the order of the noapplication plot (11.9) < the Et‐residue plot (14.6) < the rice‐straw plot (25.4), and a significant difference was found between the no‐application and rice‐straw plots. Consequently, bio‐ethanol production from rice straw and a following application of its residue to paddy fields is considered to be a promising technology which can obtain new sustainable energy and suppress CH4 emission without any inhibition on rice growth.
Q10|Development and Evaluation of Poly Herbal Molluscicidal Extracts for Control of Apple Snail ( Pomacea maculata )|Golden Apple Snail (GAS) is the most destructive invasive rice pest in Southeast Asia. The cost of synthetic molluscicides, their toxicity to non-target organisms, and their persistence in the environment have propelled the research of plant-derived molluscicides. Most research efforts have focused on individual plant extracts for their molluscicidal potency against GAS and have not been proven to be entirely effective in rice field conditions. Selective combination of synergistically acting molluscicidal compounds from various plant extracts might be an effective alternative. In this direction, ethanolic extracts from six different plants (Neem, Tobacco, Nerium, Pongamia, Zinger, and Piper) were evaluated against Pomacea maculata Perry. Of the various combinations studied, a binary extract (1:1) of nerium and tobacco (LC 90 177.71 mg/L, 48 h), and two tri-herbal extract formulations (1:1:1) of (nerium + tobacco + piper) and (nerium + tobacco + neem) were found to be most effective, with LC 90 values of 180.35 mg/L and 191.52 mg/L, respectively, in laboratory conditions. The synergistic effect of combined herbal extracts resulted in significant reduction in LC 90 values of the individual extracts. The findings of this study demonstrate that the selective combinations of potent molluscicidal herbal extracts are effective for management of P. maculata under laboratory conditions.
Q10|Fusarium Wilt Affecting Chickpea Crop|Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) contributes 18% of the global production of grain legume and serves as an important source of dietary protein. An important decrease in cropping area and production has been recorded during the last two decades. Several biotic and abiotic constraints underlie this decrease. Despite the efforts deployed in breeding and selection of several chickpea varieties with high yield potential that are tolerant to diseases, the situation has remained the same for the last decade. Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceris (Foc) is the major soilborne fungus affecting chickpeas globally. Fusarium wilt epidemics can devastate crops and cause up to 100% loss in highly infested fields and under favorable conditions. To date, eight pathogenic races of Foc (races 0, 1A, 1B/C, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) have been reported worldwide. The development of resistant cultivars is the most effective method to manage this disease and to contribute to stabilizing chickpea yields. Development of resistant varieties to fusarium wilt in different breeding programs is mainly based on conventional selection. This method is time‐consuming and depends on inoculum load and specific environmental factors that influence disease development. The use of molecular tools offers great potential for chickpea improvement, specifically by identifying molecular markers closely linked to genes/QTLs controlling fusarium wilt.
Q10|Phytochemistry and Agro-Industrial Potential of Native Oilseeds from West Africa: African Grape ( Lannea microcarpa ), Marula ( Sclerocarya birrea ), and Butter Tree ( Pentadesma butyracea )|Ethnobotanical investigations on local oilseed species in Burkina Faso revealed that oils from tree oilseeds are frequently used for food, cosmetics and traditional medicine by local people. To test the bio-preservative capacity, the effect of the oilseed extracts on the stabilization of Shea butter was evaluated. Levels of bioactive phyto-components were evaluated through several methods. Some aspects of the quality of oilcakes were evaluated based on their inhibitory capacity on the endogenous digestive enzymes of cattle. For fat stabilizing quality, the extract from Lannea microcarpa Engl. & K. Krause has showed the largest increase (91.47%) in the Rancimat induction time (TIR) of Shea butter. Using DPPH and FRAP methods for prevention or scavenging of free radicals, the results evidenced the highest activity with extracts of L. microcarpa . With respect to the feed quality of the oilcakes, the IC 50 obtained with α-amylase and trypsin have showed that the ethanolic extracts of Pentadesma butyracea Sabine (1824) is less toxic for cattle. These results suggest that phenolic compounds extracted from these native oilseeds, especially those of Lannea microcarpa , can be used as biological antioxidants for bio-preservation of edible fats. In addition, the by-products of the oil-extraction can be valorized as nontoxic and protein-rich oilcakes for livestock feed.
Q10|Changes in Carbon Cycling during Development of Successional Agroforestry|Successional agroforestry systems (SAFS) mimic the structure of natural forests while providing economical outputs. This study clarifies how carbon cycling and carbon sequestration change during successional development of SAFS. In Brazil, three successional stages of SAFS, 6, 12, and 34 years old, were compared in terms of carbon balance. Aboveground biomass, fruit harvest, litterfall, soil respiration, and soil organic carbon were measured for two years and analyzed. Carbon sequestration expressed by net primary productivity increased with age of SAFS from 9.8 Mg·C·ha −1 ·year −1 in 6-year-old system to 13.5 Mg·C·ha −1 ·year −1 in 34-year-old system. Accumulation of plant biomass and increased internal carbon cycling in SAFS led to an intensive sequestration of carbon. SAFS can be a sustainable way of agricultural production on vulnerable tropical soils.
Q10|Impacts of Rural Labor Resource Change on the Technical Efficiency of Crop Production in China|This paper probes effects of the evolvement of labor resources on technical efficiency in crop production in rural China. Based on twelve years of data on crop production of 30 provinces in China, a stochastic frontier production function model is used to measure crop production efficiency in three crop-functional areas—the production area, the consumption area, and the balanced area. Then effects of both quantity and quality change in labor force on technical efficiency in different regions of China are analyzed. Results show that rural China generally has an increasing number of employees shifted to non-agricultural sectors and a decreasing trend of the stock of human capital. However, both these two changes in rural labor force have significantly positive effects on improving crop production efficiency. In addition, China’s technical inefficiency is at an average of 22.2%. Dynamically, the technical efficiencies show a tendency to rise steadily throughout China and in three areas, while the consumption area possesses the highest technical efficiency. Those results may lend some experience for other countries that are currently experiencing rural labor force and economic transition.
Q10|Surface and Subsurface Transport of Nitrate Loss from the Selected Bioenergy Crop Fields: Systematic Review, Analysis and Future Directions|Nitrate loss from bioenergy crop fields has attracted considerable attention during the last few years because of its potential negative impact on aquatic and human health. Both controllable and uncontrollable factors for nitrate loss have been the subject of several previous studies. Due to differences in climate, biophysical dissimilarities and land management characteristics in different parts of the world the factors affecting nitrate loss are often inconsistent and hence difficult to generalize. Therefore, reanalyzing the experimental field or plot scale studies to understand the nitrate loss factors in crop fields is useful and necessary in developing management strategies for reducing nitrate loss. This research synthesized and investigated 36 peer reviewed scientific journal articles related to selected bioenergy crop fields that included: continuous corn, corn in rotation with soybean, switchgrass and Miscanthus to conduct a meta-analysis of the available research. In this study, factors such as drain tile spacing, tillage practices, type and timing of the fertilization rate, irrigation and various other factors, which are challenging to represent in regression equations, were also systematically analyzed. In addition, various other agronomic characteristics that are attributed too nitrate loss are caused by perennially planted bio energized crops such as Miscanthus and switchgrass. Results indicated that 49% of nitrate loss through surface runoff from corn fields is directly related to the annual precipitation and fertilization rate. Multiple linear regression equations were developed to estimate the annual subsurface nitrate loss for the continuous corn fields with a R 2 value of 0.65, 0.58 and 0.26 for sandy loam, silty loam and clay loam, respectively. Our analysis resulted in the conclusion that corn has a 2 to 3 times higher nitrate loss in surface runoff compared to switchgrass. Likewise, continuous corn and corn in rotation with soybean contributed more than 9 times the subsurface loss of nitrate compared to the established subsurface loss attributed to the Miscanthus and switchgrass.
Q10|Evaluation of Pectin Extraction Conditions and Polyphenol Profile from Citrus x lantifolia Waste: Potential Application as Functional Ingredients|The citrus by-products pectin and polyphenols were obtained from Citrus x lantifolia residues. The use of acid type, solute-solvent ratio, temperature, and extraction time on pectin yield recovery was evaluated using a factorial design 3 4 ; pectin physicochemical characterization, polyphenol profile, and antioxidant activity were also determined. Results indicated a total polyphenol content of 3.92 ± 0.06 mg Galic Acid Equivalents (GAE)/g of citrus waste flour in dry basis (DB), with antioxidant activity of 74%. The presence of neohesperidin (0.96 ± 0.09 mg/g of citrus flour DB), hesperidin (0.27 ± 0.0 mg/g of citrus flour DB), and ellagic acid (0.18 ± 0.03 mg/g of citrus flour DB) as major polyphenols was observed. All of the factors evaluated in pectin recovery presented significant effects ( p < 0.05), nevertheless the acid type and solute-solvent ratio showed the greatest effect. The highest yield of pectin recovery (36%) was obtained at 90 °C for 90 min, at a ratio of 1:80 ( w / v ) using citric acid. The evaluation of pectin used as a food ingredient in cookies elaboration, resulted in a reduction of 10% of fat material without significant texture differences ( p < 0.05). The pectin extraction conditions and characterization from these residues allowed us to determine the future applications of these materials for use in several commercial applications.
Q10|Nitrous Oxide Emission from Organic Fertilizer and Controlled Release Fertilizer in Tea Fields|A field experiment was conducted for two years in the Green Tea Laboratory of Saitama Prefectural Agriculture and Forestry Research Center, Iruma, Saitama, Japan from March 2014 to December 2015. Controlled release fertilizers (CRF) or organic fertilizers (ORG), which are a mixture of chicken manure and oil cake, were applied with the amount of 450 kg·N·ha −1 ·year −1 in 2014 and 397 kg·N·ha −1 ·year −1 in 2015. Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from soil in green tea fields were measured by the closed chamber method. The results showed that CRF has significantly lower N 2 O compared to ORG. The cumulative N 2 O emissions from CRF accounted for 51% of N 2 O emissions from ORG fields and 138% of control with no fertilizer treatment. The N 2 O flux from the row was higher than that under the canopy, since fertilizer was applied on the row. However, the total emission from the area between the rows was lower than that under the canopy because the area ratio between the row and canopy was 1:5.
Q10|Impact of Practice Change on Runoff Water Quality and Vegetable Yield—An On-Farm Case Study|Intensive agricultural practices in farming systems in eastern Australia have been identified as a contributor to the poor runoff water quality entering the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). A field investigation was carried out to measure the off-farm water quality and productivity in a coastal farming system in northeastern Australia. Two vegetable crops (capsicum and zucchini) were grown in summer 2010–2011 and winter 2011 respectively using four different management practices (Conventional—plastic mulch, bare inter-row conventional tillage and commercial fertilizer inputs; Improved—improved practice with plastic mulch, inter-row vegetative mulch, zonal tillage and reduced fertilizer rates; Trash mulch—improved practice with cane-trash or forage-sorghum mulch with reduced fertilizer rates, minimum or zero tillage; and Vegetable only—improved practice with Rhodes grass or forage-sorghum mulch, minimum or zero tillage, reduced fertilizer rates). Results suggest improved and trash mulch systems reduced sediment and nutrient loads by at least 50% compared to conventional systems. The residual nitrate nitrogen in soil accumulated at the end-of-break crop cycle was lost by deep drainage before the subsequent sugarcane crop could utilize it. These results suggest that future research into establishing the linkages between deep drainage, groundwater quality and lateral movement into adjacent streams is needed. The improvement in runoff water quality was accompanied by yield reductions of up to 55% in capsicum and 57% in zucchini under trash mulch systems, suggesting a commercially unacceptable trade-off between water quality and productivity for a practice change. The current study has shown that variations around improved practice (modified nutrient application strategies under plastic mulch, but with an inter-space mulch to minimize runoff and sediment loss) may be the most practical solution to improve water quality and maintain productivity. However, more work is required to optimize this approach and thus reduce the size of any potential productivity and profitability gap that would necessitate an expensive policy intervention to implement.
Q10|Effect of Organic, Inorganic Fertilizers and Plant Spacing on the Growth and Yield of Cabbage|The impact of chemical farming and the negative consequences on the environment and human health in Bangladesh are on the rise. Organic farming is gaining attention and increasing globally because it is eco-friendly, safe and has benefits for human health. A field study was conducted at the horticulture farm of Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU), Mymensingh, to evaluate the growth and yield performance of cabbage cv. Atlas—70 using organic and inorganic fertilizers in various plant spacing arrangements. Two factor experiments were conducted on plant spacings of 60 cm × 40 cm (S 1 ), 60 cm × 50 cm (S 2 ) and 60 cm × 60 cm (S 3 ) and fertilizers vermicompost (T 1 ), biogen (T 2 ), integrated plant nutrient system (IPNS) Organic (⅔) + inorganic (⅓) (T 3 ) and inorganic (T 4 ). IPNS (T 3 ) application increased the marketable yield (54.77 t·ha −1 ) of cabbage. The highest marketable yield (48.75 t·ha −1 ) was obtained with a plant spacing of 60 cm × 40 cm (S 1 ). No significant variation was found in plant spacings S 1 and S 2 . The treatment combination of S 2 T 3 recorded the highest plant height (37.81 cm), plant spread (47.75 cm), cabbage head (21.80 cm), stem length (12.31 cm), thickness of the cabbage head (12.53 cm) and marketable yield (65.0 t·ha −1 ). The results suggest that IPNS (T 3 ) combining organic and inorganic fertilizer applications with a 60 cm × 50 cm spacing (S 2 T 3 ) increases the yield performance of cabbage.
Q10|Global Biofuels at the Crossroads: An Overview of Technical, Policy, and Investment Complexities in the Sustainability of Biofuel Development|Biofuels have the potential to alter the transport and agricultural sectors of decarbonizing societies. Yet, the sustainability of these fuels has been questioned in recent years in connection with food versus fuel trade-offs, carbon accounting, and land use. Recognizing the complicated playing field for current decision-makers, we examine the technical attributes, policy, and global investment activity for biofuels (primarily liquids). Differences in feedstock and fuel types are considered, in addition to policy approaches of major producer countries. Issues with recent, policy-driven trade developments are highlighted to emphasize how systemic complexities associated with sustainability must also be managed. We conclude with near-term areas to watch.

Q10|The Value of Biodiversity as an Insurance Device|This paper presents a benchmark endogenous growth model including biodiversity preservation dynamics. Producing food requires land, and increasing the share of total land devoted to farming mechanically reduces the share of land devoted to biodiversity conservation. However, the safeguarding of a greater number of species is associated to better ecosystem services – pollination, flood control, pest control, etc., which in turn ensure a lower volatility of agricultural productivity. The optimal conversion/preservation rule is explicitly characterized, as well as the value of biological diversity, in terms of the welfare gain of biodiversity conservation. The Epstein-Zin-Weil specification of the utility function allows us to disentangle the effects of risk aversion and aversion to fluctuations. A two-player game extension of the model highlights the effect of volatility externalities and the Paretian sub-optimality of the decentralized choice.
Q10|Managing Water: Rights, Markets, and Welfare|This article investigates key aspects related to managing water resources, and explores their implications for economic efficiency: incomplete property rights; overallocation of water; the divergence between water entitlements and productivity of water use. These issues are explored in a production model with a single input, water drawn from a common source, and two main insights are offered. First, a novel result relating welfare and water entitlements is established, an equivalence between the socially optimal and legal assignment of water rights, via a set of social weights implied by the rights assignment. It is also shown that, for water entitlements for which the divergence between productivity and entitlements is substantial, no set of valid social priorities can lead to the socially efficient allocation. Second, considering a hypothetical water market with an endogenous price, it is found that trade in water is unable to eliminate allocative inefficiency, and that taxes have unexpectedly moderate effects on trade and welfare, with the majority of tax shifts canceled out by changes in demand. In addition, trade is not effective at facilitating efficiency-enhancing reallocation of water under scarcity when entitlements diverge substantially from productivity. The results here highlight important new connections between welfare and water entitlements and the limitations of market-based instruments under incomplete property rights, and have implications for designing property rights regimes for managing water under scarcity.
Q10|How Tight are Malthusian Constraints?|We provide a methodology to estimate the elasticity of agricultural output with respect to land - the Malthusian constraint - using variation in rural densities across different locations. We use district-level data from around the globe on rural densities and inherent agricultural productivity to estimate the elasticity for various sub-samples. We find the elasticity is highest in areas that are suitable for temperate crops such as wheat or rye, and loosest in areas suitable for (sub)-tropical crops such as cassava or rice. We show theoretically that a higher elasticity results in greater sensitivity of non-agricultural employment and real income per capita to shocks in population size and productivity, and confirm this with evidence from the post-war mortality transition.
Q10|Characterization Of The Of Red Fresh Tomato Value Chain In Mexico , Caracterizacion De La Cadena De Valor Del Tomate Rojo Fresco En Mexico|Agriculture is an important activity globally for its contribution to food production for human and livestock consumption. It is important to ensure quality at every stage of the process, from production to marketing, so that healthy products are provided and priced according to quality. Value Chain study becomes more important for its impact on the local economy. Therefore, it is important to study value chains considering the different participants in the chain links. The aim of this study was to perform the characterization of the Value Chain of fresh tomato in Mexico proposed by the National Council of Producers of Tomato NPO (Consejo Nacional de Productores de Tomate A.C.in Spanish). This was done through a documentary analysis that considers this product sector, as well as the identification and characterization of links involved in the production process and marketing. When the analysis of tomato Value Chains was completed, primary activities were identified, as well as support. In the link marketing a high dependence of intermediaries is required to get the product to the consumer
Q10|Recent changes in measurement of India's GDP: Overall issues and some focus on agriculture|This paper discusses (a) changes in measurement in industry and services (b) changes made in agriculture sector and (c) major issues on the measurement of GDP in new series. There are long term or legacy issues in agriculture, industry and services. The paper examines 10 major issues on measurement of GDP in the new series. These are: (1) MCA 21 data problems; (2) separation of Quasi corporations from household sector; (3) effective labour input method; (4) high growth rate of GDP vs. ground realities; (5) GDP at market prices vs. GVA at basic prices vs. GDP at factor prices; (6) GDP production and GDP expenditure method; (7) single vs. double deflation; (8) price deflators WPI vs. CPI; (9) nominal growth vs. real growth; (10) reference point for growth: advance estimates, provisional estimates, first revised estimates and second revised estimates. In our view, although there are some gaps in the measurement of GDP the new series and the methodology adopted are based on 'best advice' from experts available in the country. The issues discussed in the paper will be useful for next base revision of National Accounts Statistics.
Q10|Farmers' Preference On Conditions In Manufacturing Pineapple Sale Contract In Rayong Province|This paper aimed to evaluate farmers’ preferences on condition attributes in a manufacturing pineapple sale contract. Data were collected from 300 pineapple farmers in Rayong province in the cropping season 2015 using paper-based questionnaires. Conjoint analysis model was employed to analyze the attribute ranking. Consequently, farmers were grouped by using cluster analysis in order to study attribute ranking for each group. The analytical results revealed that farmers’ preferences were affected respectively by coverage-crop insurance option, price option, contract quantity and input supply arrangement. Finally, the attribute set that was found to obtain the highest total utility included guaranteed minimum prices, total quantity purchase and partial coverage-crop insurance. The farmers were segmented in 2 groups due to their preferences. The first group of farmers mostly had their planted areas between 20-40 rais and attended at least one training program concerning agricultural knowledge. The most important attribute of the first group was coverage-crop insurance option. Most of the second-group farmers had a small area planted and never attended the training. The price option was the most importance attribute for the second group. The suggestion from this study was that farmers, pineapple manufacturers and related government sectors jointly set a reasonably minimum guaranteed price that is consistent to the cost of production. Moreover, coverage-crop insurance could be added in a manufacturing pineapple sale contact in order to increase the farmers' confidence in their production.
Q10|Farm Household Incomes And Reforming The Cap| Low and variable farm income has been a main rationale for heavy government intervention in agricultural markets and income transfers to farmers whether in Europe in response to disruptive agricultural imports and low world prices at the end of the 19th century or in the US in response to the Great Depression. While the future of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is again discussed and new directions are examined, it is fundamental to know to what extent low and variable farm income is still a problem in contemporary European agriculture and a valid rationale for designing the new CAP. In this context, this paper first examines the income level and distribution of farm households compared to those of non-farm households for a selection of OECD countries. Second, the paper econometrically investigates whether explanations for low farm income given in the literature apply to the selected OECD countries for the 1980-2000 period. Third, the paper concludes with some policy implications. Both the descriptive and econometric analyses use the microeconomic dataset from the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS). This dataset contains socio-demographic, income and expenditure data that are collected at the household level through household-based budget surveys. These data are recorded in the LIS dataset in a harmonized way for the 30 countries that currently participate in the LIS. Average income levels as well as indicators of poverty and inequality are calculated for farm and non-farm households for the OECD countries that have at least three waves of data in the LIS dataset with a minimum of 30 identified farm households surveyed in each wave1. Three sets of explanations for low farm household income drawn from the literature review of Gardner (1992) are successively investigated: (i) the commodity market conditions, (ii) the earning disequilibrium between sectors, and (iii) the compensating differential for skill differences and non-pecuniary aspects2. Preliminary results confirm that in most of the 12 selected OECD countries the average farm household income is greater than the average non-farm household income. Lower average farm household income tends to occur sporadically for some years in only six of the 12 selected OECD countries. In five of the nine selected European countries, the average farm household incomes clearly tend to improve compared to the average non-farm household incomes during the 1985-95 period. They are well above the average household incomes. The incidence of poverty tends to be less severe among farm households than nonfarm households except for two European countries. In contrast, the intensity of poverty tends to be more severe among farm households than non-farm households in most countries. This implies that in general there are relatively fewer poor farm households compared to non-farm households but the severity of their poverty is stronger. In addition, the income distribution is more equal among farm households than non-farm households in all countries. In the final version of the paper, it is expected that each set of explanations for low farm household income would play a role in understanding the evolution of farm household incomes across countries. Depending on whether one set of explanations tends to dominate the others in one particular group of countries, public interventions can be designed and emphasized in a new CAP for improving and stabilising incomes of farm households.
Q10|Uncovering The Deep Roots of Conflict|This research establishes that the emergence and persistence of intrastate con ict incidence since 1960 are in uenced by regional agro-ecological factors captured by the extent of variation in crop yield potential. Our results based on cross-country and grid-level analysis indicate that higher potential crop yield variability within a country that is exogenous to both human intervention and regional culture increases the likelihood of intrastate con ict. Our ndings are robust to the inclusion of various geographical, institutional, and potentially confounding economic development correlates.
Q10|Crop Disease and Agricultural Productivity|Crop diseases and how they are managed can have a large impact on agricultural productivity. This paper discusses the effects on agricultural productivity of Verticillium dahliae, a soil borne fungus that is introduced to the soil via infested spinach seeds and that causes subsequent lettuce crops to be afflicted with Verticillium wilt. We use a dynamic structural econometric model of Verticillium wilt management for lettuce crops in Monterey County, California to examine the effects of Verticillium wilt on crop-fumigation decisions and on grower welfare. We also discuss our research on the externalities that arise with renters, and between seed companies and growers due to Verticillium wilt, as these disease-related externalities have important implications for agricultural productivity.
Q10|Market Implications of Integration of Asian Rice Markets|This paper explores how the integration of rice markets in ASEAN countries influences the import, export, production, consumption, and prices of rice in those countries, as well as in the rest of the world. The analysis describes current policies applied to ASEAN rice markets, then evaluates the ten-year impacts of two reform scenarios using the OECD-FAO Aglink-Cosimo model. The first scenario involves the elimination of tariffs within the region, while protection vis-à-vis countries outside the region remains unchanged. The second scenario involves closer price integration across the region, again with protection versus countries outside the region unchanged. The analysis finds that opening up the regional trade market will lead to greater overall production, consumption and trade across the region. The overall welfare gains are over fifteen times higher with full price integration, as opposed to just tariff reform. Significant price changes create winners and losers within all countries, underscoring the need for complementary policies to accompany a rice market integration agenda.
Q10|A Survey Of Farm Management And Reproductive Managment Strategies On U.S. Commercial Dairy Farms| Management strategies in the dairy industry, including those involved in dairy cattle reproductive management, continue to evolve as new technologies are introduced. In June of 2014, 2,980 surveys were sent to dairy farms in the United States. The survey was developed to obtain data regarding management and performance of currently operating dairy farms. Most of the operations were owned by a single operator, but the management team often incorporated other individuals such as other family members, nutritionist(s) or veterinarian(s). Although many operators still used paper records and did not include written contracts when dealing with suppliers, many used sophisticated reproductive management programs.
Q10|Is Aid for Agriculture Effective in Sub-Saharan Africa?|One of the key economic development challenges facing Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is its low agricultural productivity. Governments, donors, and foreign investors have underinvested in African agriculture even though research evidence shows that higher agricultural productivity would boost economic growth and poverty reduction. Solutions to the problem require a number of interconnected strategies, including, but not limited to, research on seeds and inputs, extension services, rural development, credit, institutional, and trade and price stabilization policies. We use the system two-step Generalized Method of Moments to examine whether official development assistance (ODA) for agriculture and rural development is helping to boost agricultural productivity. We find a positive relationship between ODA and agricultural productivity. However, when broken down into the main agricultural ODA recipient sectors, there is a substitution effect between food crop production and industrial crop production. While there exists a positive relationship between ODA for industrial and export crops output per worker (agricultural productivity), ODA for food crops has a negative relationship. Better public institutions and economic freedom are also found to enable agricultural productivity growth and to increase the ODA effectiveness. We correct the results for spurious correlation assuming that more ODA might be allocated where agricultural productivity is already increasing due to some other factors. Concerning the determinants of ODA allocation, we find that the allocation of ODA for agriculture is primarily determined by agricultural need, and that the expected effectiveness increases the ODA receipts. Finally, there is a weak ODA-led structural economic change effect in SSA. Labor released from agriculture to the urban sector(s) has a positive market effect on agriculture but is not engendering significant structural economic transformation.
Q10|Multinational Oil Firmsâ€™ CSR Initiatives in Nigeria: the Need of Rural Farmers in Host Communities|We examine the impact of multinational oil firmsâ€™ CSR on agricultural production using binary logit model equation. The result indicates a significant relationship between CSR and agricultural production in oil host communities in Nigeria. This implies that CSR of a multinational oil firm is a critical factor for increasing participation of rural dwellers in agricultural production. The findings suggest for improved CSR investment of multinational oil firms on subsidized fertilizer, certified seed, crop protection products, farm power and rural transportation infrastructures.

Q10|Productivity, technical efficiency and technological change in French agriculture during 2002-2014: A Färe-Primont index decomposition|The objective of the article is to assess productivity change in French agriculture during 2002-2014, namely total factor productivity (TFP) change and its components technological change and technical efficiency change. For this, we use the economically-ideal Färe-Primont index which verifies the multiplicatively completeness property and is also transitive, allowing for multi-temporal/lateral comparisons. To compare the technology gap change between the six types of farming considered, we extend the Färe-Primont to the meta-frontier framework. Results indicate that during 2002-2014, all farms experienced a TFP progress. Pig and/or poultry farms had the lowest TFP increase, while beef farms had the highest (19.1%). The latter farms had the strongest increase in technical efficiency, while technological progress was the highest for mixed farms. The meta-frontier analysis shows that field crop farms’ technology is the most productive of all types of farming.
Q10|A Survey Of Farm Management And Reproductive Managment Strategies On U.S. Commercial Dairy Farms|Management strategies in the dairy industry, including those involved in dairy cattle reproductive management, continue to evolve as new technologies are introduced. In June of 2014, 2,980 surveys were sent to dairy farms in the United States. The survey was developed to obtain data regarding management and performance of currently operating dairy farms. Most of the operations were owned by a single operator, but the management team often incorporated other individuals such as other family members, nutritionist(s) or veterinarian(s). Although many operators still used paper records and did not include written contracts when dealing with suppliers, many used sophisticated reproductive management programs.
Q10|Veterinarians and Student Loan Debt: Is the Burden Too Much?| United States student loan debt has escalated over the last decade and created public debate over the driving factors as well as the economic and social consequences. Despite repeated warnings about the effects of an uncontrolled student loan market, the available statistics showing all dimensions of the problem, and extensive literature on the causes of the increasing educational debt, the problem remains real in the United States. This paper uses 2016 American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Census of Veterinarians data along with a survival model to determine the ability of veterinarians to service their educational debt and the effect of debt on wellness. While it may not be easy for them, it appears that most veterinarians have enough income to pay off their student debt. Veterinarians with student debt are more likely to own or co-own a private practice than those with no debt, which might be due to the need to finance purchase of the practice. The burden of carrying such debt has significant effects on veterinarians’ wellness: burnout and secondary traumatic stress scores increase with the level of debt.
Q10|Consumer Willingness To Pay For Tennessee Certified Beef| Beef producers in Tennessee have expressed interest in the creation of an in-state certified beef program. Therefore, an online choice experiment was conducted to evaluate Tennessee consumer preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for Tennessee Certified Beef and other beef attributes that are likely to appear on Tennessee beef. Tennessee Certified Beef is defined as beef originating from animals born, raised, finished, and harvested in Tennessee. Results of two treatments, a Control Treatment in which consumers were not given the attribute definitions, and an Information Treatment in which consumers were given the attribute definitions, were compared for both steak and ground beef. Data was analyzed using a random parameters logit model. Results of both treatments indicate steak consumers valued Tennessee Certified Beef more highly than all other individual attributes including Certified Angus Beef, grass fed, no hormones administered, and Master Quality Raised Beef. Results for ground beef showed consumers most highly valued the attributes no hormones administered and Tennessee Certified Beef. Results suggest that Tennessee beef consumers would be willing to pay a premium for Tennessee branded beef.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q10|Changing Impacts of Beef Demand on Cattle Producers| Economists have long recognized changes in consumer demand directly impact stakeholders throughout corresponding supply chains. However, empirical applications quantifying how demand signals are transmitted through vertically connected industries are limited. One study which provided empirical linkages between changes in retail level U.S. beef demand and economic welfare of beef producers was provided by Marsh (2003). However, given the changing landscape of the beef industry, changing consumer preferences, and globalization this paper is outdated. Our analysis aims to provide an improved quantification of how changes in retail and export beef demand are transmitted to different members of the beef industry.
Q10|Grass-Fed Beef Enterprise Efficiency Analysis in the U.S| We determine technical and scale efficiencies, scope economies, marginal productive contributions for inputs and outputs, and efficiency drivers for U.S. grass-fed beef enterprises. Average technical efficiency was 0.82. Increasing returns to scale and scope economies were found. Results suggest grass-fed beef enterprises can be scale efficient at >100 grass-fed beef animals.
Q10|Food Waste in Rural Households| The paper examines food waste volume generated by a sample of rural households accounting for four different categories of food waste. Food waste does occur and some of it is unavoidable leading to the question how to manage it. This study identifies factors responsible for the volume of food waste by category, but also identifies factors influencing the decision to collect food waste in household for the purpose of local biogas production. Tobit technique is applied to identify factors, demographic and socio-economic characteristics of consumers and their households that influence the percentage of wasted food by type. A separate decision equation identifies supporting or limiting factors influencing the decision to sort food waste for biogas production. Education, gender, age, household size, and employment status have been identified as relevant characteristics determining the volume of wasted food and the decision to support using food waste for biogas generation.
Q10|Monetary policy, Farm sector income and Farm Household Well-being --a VECM Analysis| Farm sector seems to be countercyclical to the household well-being and general economy. In recent years the farm sector is experiencing downtrend with net farm income significantly drops from 2013 high. On the other hand, average farm household income keeps booming, even has higher growth rates than average U.S. household income. Considering the whole economy fully recovered, Federal Reserve started to hike interest rate in 2015. This paper aims to address the linkage and equilibrium among farm sector income, farm household well-being and macroeconomic monetary policies empirically. By using Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), we show both the ratio of average farm household income to U.S. household income and the off-farm earnings of farm household are cointegrated with CPI. Farm portion of farm household income, although strongly positive correlated with farm sector net income, is not cointegrated with either CPI or farm sector net income. Towards sector level analysis, farm sector net income, Federal Funds Rate (FFR) and CPI are proved to be all cointegrated. CPI is dominating the decision of FFR and further affecting net farm income. Combining our results from household level and sector level, a jump in FFR can lead to slower pace of CPI and farm sector net income, then dragging down the ratio of average farm household income to U.S. household income and the off-farm earnings. In the next few years with FFR goes up, we expect farm sector income will keep in relatively low level and farm household may suffer from reduced off-farm earnings. Related farm supporting policies are then discussed conceptually.
Q10|Meta-Analysis of Multiple Treatments Experiments| Limited theoretical and empirical work have been conducted to synthetize multiple treatment experiments commonly used in agricultural field sciences. The main objective of this study was to extend the current meta-analysis literature by developing a flexible econometric model to evaluate multiple treatment data. The proposed method is based on random effects meta-regression and mixed effects models. The model is illustrated on a publicly available series of nitrogen field experiments on corn production in the upper Midwestern United States. Stochastic plateau theory integrated with econometric meta-analysis methodology was used to determine the agronomic optimal nitrogen application rate and shape of the functional form of corresponding yield potential.
Q10|The Effects of Land Markets on Resource Allocation and Agricultural Productivity|We assess the role of land markets on factor misallocation in Ethiopia--where land is owned by the state--by exploiting policy-driven variation in land rentals across time and space arising from a recent land certification reform. Our main finding from detailed micro data is that land rentals significantly reduce misallocation and increase agricultural productivity. These effects are nonlinear across farms--impacting more those farms farther away from their efficient operational scale. The effect of land rentals on productivity is 70 percent larger when controlling for non-market rentals--those with a pre-harvest rental rate of zero. Land rentals significantly increase the adoption of new technologies, especially fertilizer use.
Q10|Testing the General Validity of the Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem|We exploit Japan's mid-nineteenth century transition from autarky to open trade to test Alan Deardorff's (1982) seminal and parsimonious autarky price formulation of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem. Factor price data from Japan's late autarky period impose a refutable restriction on Japan's factor content of trade. Our data are constructed from many historical sources, including a major Japanese survey of agricultural techniques and a rich set of nineteenth century comparative cost studies. Evaluating Japan's factor content of trade during 1865-1876 under alternative theoretical assumptions about technology, we provide robust evidence in favor of the Heckscher-Ohlin hypothesis.
Q10|Nutritious food without fire: environmental and nutritional impacts from a solar stove field experiment| Much of the population in rural sub-Saharan African relies of firewood or charcoal to prepare food. Population pressure is speeding the rate of deforestation, raising the monetary and opportunity costs of cooking meals. We use a field experiment in Zambia to investigate the impact of solar cook on the money households spend on charcoal and the time allocated to collecting firewood. Additionally, we examine changes in diet that result from the reduction in the cost of meal preparation. Preliminary results indicate that the provisioning of solar cookers is cost effective (household savings on charcoal over a 12 month period exceed the cost of the stove) and increases dietary diversity by reducing the cost of preparing grain legumes.
Q10|An Assessment Of The Site-Specific Nutrient Management (Ssnm) For Irrigated Rice In Asia| Site-specific nutrient management (SSNM) provides guidelines for effective nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium management to help farmers make better decisions on fertilizer input and output levels in rice production. I evaluated the assumptions underlying the SSNM strategy for rice in the top rice producing countries in the world: India, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Using a generalized quadratic production function, I explored whether major nutrients are substitutes as inputs, and if there are complementarities between inorganic fertilizer and soil organic matter (SOM). I also used non-nested hypothesis framework to contrast the quadratic model against the linear von Liebig model. Results showed that the relationships among major nutrients vary across sites – some inputs are complements, some are substitutes, and some are independent. In addition, I found that the SOM significantly affects the economic returns to nitrogen fertilizer inputs. Accounting for these relationships in the fertilizer recommendation algorithm can make the SSNM strategy more adaptive to farmer’s fields. In areas where soils have limiting organic matter content, fertilizer subsidy or distribution might not be appropriate means to support rice production. Increased rice productivity can be achieved through integrated soil fertility management and adoption of soil conservation technologies.
Q10|Days Suitable for Fieldwork in the US Corn Belt:Climate, Soils and Spatial Heterogeneity| Days suitable for field work (DSFW) is an important piece of data for production agriculture and agricultural extension focused on practical decision making about investment in farm machinery and cropping systems management. It is, however, noteworthy that there has been limited attention paid to DSFW. To fill this gap, this study tries to answer two research questions: (1) what is the trend in DSFW during the planting and harvest period from 1980-2010? (2) what is the accuracy of a predictive econometric model of DSFW based on agro-environmental data? To tackle the economic dimensions of DSFW, we model DSFW consistent with two major approaches in climate change impacts on agriculture: the Ricardian approach and the panel estimation approach. We first specify the regression model of DSFW in panel model from two conceptual approaches: the response function and the factor demand function of cost minimization. Both approaches provide consistent regression specification of fixed and random effects models. We construct an unbalanced panel of weekly DSFW observations, historic weather data, and soil data in five Corn Belt States for 1980-2010 at the Crop Reporting District (CRD) level to implement out-of-sample and in-sample prediction analysis. The results show that the random effects model is the most suitable model to perform climate change response analysis for our data. This paper contributes to the literature in three ways. First, the analytical derivation of two econometric interpretations of DSFW and link them to econometric model specification strategies are easily extended to other agro-environmental analysis. Second, the estimation results for panel models empirically demonstrate that random effects model could be proper model specification taking into account soil effects. Lastly, we discuss that DSFW could be an important constraints for policy corresponding to climate change and its adaptation.
Q10|Agricultural Technology Adoption under Multiple Constraints: An Analysis of System of Rice Intensification (SRI) in India| The study analyses the role of multiple binding constraints such as information, extension services, availability of labourers and irrigation in conditioning System of Rice Intensification (SRI) adoption by rice farmers in selected rice producing districts of India. The multiple thresholds that farmers need to overcome are analysed using a multi-hurdle model which explicitly incorporates the impact of constraints in adoption decisions. The results showed that age of the farmer reduced the access to information whereas the size of the farm increased the access to information. Gender of the head of the household, education, membership in farmer organisations etc. was crucial in getting access to extension services. Age of the household head, full time farming etc. increased the availability of labourers. Type of soil and terrain were found to be important in getting access to irrigation facility. District wise disparities showed that the disparities were the highest in the case of accessing information and followed by extension services. Although factors influencing the intensity (in terms of acres) as well as the depth of adoption (in terms of packages) were slightly different household assets, number of improved rice varieties known, membership in farmer organisations, risk etc. were significant in influencing the adoption decisions.
Q10|Economic Impact Of The Sugarcane Aphid Outbreak In South Texas| The sorghum industry is threatened by a new invasive pest, the sugarcane aphid (SCA), capable of causing substantial damage to crop production and local economies. Little work has been conducted to assess and better understand the economic implications of the SCA outbreak. The objective of this study was to estimate the economic impact of SCA in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV), Texas, where 11.5% of the state production is located. Local producers were surveyed to gather detailed information about yearly crop yields, crop acreage, insecticide application decisions, and management and production practices. Collected data were used to estimate the reduction in growers’ profit associated to the SCA infestation, as well as the monetary value of the prevented loss attributed to control efforts. Sorghum industry losses were then used to assess the overall economic impact of the SCA outbreak in the LRGV economy in terms of output, value-added, labor income and employment effects.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q10|Comparing the trends and strength of determinants to deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon in consideration of biofuel policies in Brazil and the United States|Recent assessments of the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with increased production of liquid biofuels in the U.S. have found that a relatively large share of these emissions is related to land-use change in other countries, with Brazil playing a prominent role. However, most of the existing analyses including EPA's RFS assumptions about indirect land-use change (ILUC) do not reflect recent data on deforestation rates in Brazil, which have been declining. There seems to be evidence that agricultural producers in Brazil are intensifying crop and livestock production and incorporating new land at lower rates than in the recent past. Additionally, the competition for forestry areas, and in particular between agriculture, pastures, and planted forests is poorly understood, and not explicitly taken into account in previous assessments in several modeling exercises. This paper provides a review of several of the major factors that will determine the need to incorporate additional land to production in response to a demand increase, for example as a result of biofuel policies. This additional land that may need to be brought into production is critical as it will affect significantly the environmental credentials and in particular carbon footprints of different biofuels. Among the factors reviewed are the potential for yield intensification in response to higher returns (intensification effects), and the limited existing evidence in yield drags as areas are incorporate to crop production (extensification effects). Scenario analysis using an augmented version of the CARD/FAPRI agricultural modeling system (augmented to include planted forests in Brazil) seem to provide evidence, that intensification of crops and livestock production in countries like Brazil, and of competition with planted forests reduces the pressure for deforestation of natural areas. We also highlight that the explicit modeling of planted forests as a user of land, allows for the inclusion of the competition of this activity (and its resistance to give away area) with the more traditionally modeled crops and pastures.
Q10|ARMS Respondent Errors: A Case of Farm Service Agency Loans| Many studies have used the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) to research various aspects involving the agricultural sector in the United States, including studies focused at the farm level. Since nonresponse and inaccurate reporting may cause significant bias in statistical analysis, research is conducted to estimate the magnitude of response error in the farm debt section of Phase III in ARMS. USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) data on Farm Loan Program (FLP) borrowers with end of year debt are matched with ARMS respondents for years 2001, 2004, 2006, and 2007. A multinomial logit model is estimated to identify demographic, structural, and financial characteristics of FSA borrowers who refused to indicate if they had end of year farm debt, or who accurately or inaccurately classified their farm operations as having end of year farm debt on the ARMS. Additionally, estimates of the magnitude of response errors in ARMS for both FSA direct and guaranteed FLPs are estimated. The current study estimates that 12.9 percent of direct FLP respondents and 9.9% of guaranteed FLP respondents indicated “no” to the question on having end of year farm debt when they should have indicated “yes”. Also, those responding “no” are found to have their ARMS total debt outstanding less than their FSA total debt outstanding. Direct FLP operators are more likely to report “no” and, therefore, under-report end of year debt in the ARMS if they had a lower total FSA debt outstanding balance, had a greater value of crop production relative to total production, or had a lower gross cash farm income. Guaranteed FLP operators are more likely to under-report their debt in the ARMS if they had an operating line of credit loan, had a greater share of production from crops, or had a lower gross cash farm income. They are less likely to under-report their debt if they either had some college education, were eligible for socially disadvantaged loans, or were beginning farmer eligible. These results are of keen interest to those using ARMS data and those responsible for collecting ARMS data. The results allow researchers using ARMS data to appraise operator debt status to be better informed about potential data limitations. For example, estimates of the share of farm operations with little or no debt may be overestimated. Also, the results could assist the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service in developing improved imputation techniques to estimate farm debt from the ARMS, especially for those respondents indicating “no” as to having end of year debt in the Farm Debt section of the ARMS.
Q10|Adapting to Climate Change Through Tile Drainage: A Structural Ricardian Analysis| This paper provides the first estimates of the effects of climate change on agriculture while explicitly modeling tile drainage. We show in a simple conceptual model that the value of precipitation should differ between drained and non-drained land, implying that pooling these lands could bias estimates of the effects of climate change on land values. We test this hypothesis by estimating a Structural Ricardian model for U.S. counties east of the 100th meridian. Consistent with our theoretical model, our estimates show that the value of precipitation is higher on non-drained lands.
Q10|Biofuel Potential in Mexico: Land Use, Economic and Environmental Effects| This paper aims to develop a framework to forecast biofuel policies impacts about fifteen years ahead in Mexico, where there have been several attempts to introduce biofuels into the market but so far no success. Technically, we develop an endogenous-price mathematical programming model emphasizing the Mexican agricultural and fuel sectors, which are embedded in a multi-region, multi-product, spatial partial equilibrium model of the world economy. There is a module for the U.S. and another for Rest of the World. Mexico is disaggregated into 193 crop districts. Production functions are specified for 14 major crops as well as livestock. Biofuel can be produced both from dedicated crops and from agroindustrial residues. We consider three policy alternatives as well as a base case in which, as now, liquid fuels are all derived from fossil sources. The first alternative consists of subsidies to biofuel producers, the second of blending mandates and the third of both combined. Biofuel imports are allowed in all cases. Results show some losses for fuel and agricultural consumers, that are not offset by both ethanol producer and GHG emissions reduction gains. This suggests that some compensating redistribution may be needed if these policies are to be seen as politically sustainable.
Q10|A Comparison of Stated and Revealed Risk Preferences using Safety-First| In this paper we determine the risk preferences of crop producers using the safety-first method. Our methodology is unique, since it utilizes both price and yield risk in the producer’s optimization problem. We then compare the derived preferences with the stated preferences of the producers. The stated preferences are obtained from a lottery-style game designed to elicit producers’ risk preferences. The study is conducted with data from producers in Nebraska, Iowa and South Dakota and the results indicate that there is in fact a relationship between the preferences derived from our structural model and the ones stated by the producers in the game. This is an important result from a policy-making perspective, as it validates the use of behavior elicitation surveys about risk preferences. Such surveys are often easier to administer and less expensive than collecting information on revealed preferences.
Q10|The effect of Brazilian corn and soybean crop expansion on price and volatility transmission| This study aims to examine if the most recent changes in the Brazilian corn and soybean production have caused significant changes in prices and volatility transmission between Brazilian and U.S. markets. In addition to using econometric time-series methods tests to analyze price transmission among grain and oilseeds markets, we investigated the volatility spillover across U.S. and Brazil markets using causality in variance tests. Since structural break tests indicated the presence of one breakpoint, the sample was split in two periods: 1996-2006 and 2007-2014. Results suggest that the level of market integration has increased during the second period (2007-2014) with higher sensibility to price changes compared to the first period (1996-2006).

Q10|Agri-environmental subsidies and French suckler cow farms’ technical efficiency accounting for GHGs| In this article we assess the impact of agri-environmental subsidies on farms’ technical efficiency, when the latter is measured with and without accounting for greenhouse gases (GHGs). The application is to a sample of beef cattle farms located in grassland areas in France during the 1993-2013 period. In a first stage we calculate robust technical efficiency accounting for both good output (meat) and bad output (GHGs). In a second stage we regress the different technical efficiency scores on a set of explanatory variables including agri-environmental subsidies as an amount received by the farmer related per livestock unit. The results indicate that these subsidies had a positive impact on farms’ technical efficiency among the farmers that have adopted agri-environmental measures. This is the first work on the effect of subsidies on technical efficiency including environmental outputs, and it does not confirm the negative effect generally found in existing studies based on classic technical efficiency.
Q10|Index-based Costs of Agricultural Production (INCAP) – A new cost and risk analysis tool| Producers of agricultural commodities are exposed to numerous uncertainties regarding output and input prices, crop yields, yield responses to inputs and the like. In agricultural risk analyses, relevant developments or events are usually measured in economic terms resulting in a positive or negative impact on farm incomes. We develop a novel data set: the ‘Index-based Costs of Agricultural Production’ (INCAP) that can be used to quantify risk-related statistics associated with standardised production systems. Activity-specific gross margins and their stochasticity can be measured at an arbitrary level of aggregation. The aims of this article are to present the structure and scope of INCAP and to demonstrate its potential use in agribusiness, farm extension programmes and policy analyses. Wheat production in Austria is presented as an example.
Q10|Cultivos leñosos en Aragón: evaluación económica de una eventual prohibición del glifosato| [ES]Los sistemas de agricultura de conservación están asociados al uso de glifosato como prin-cipal herbicida en las explotaciones de leñosos. La reciente polémica sobre sus posibles efectos nocivos en la salud ha aumentado la preocupación de los agricultores ante una posible prohibición de su uso en un futuro cercano. En este trabajo se estima el coste asociado a una eventual prohibición de glifosato para los cultivos de leñosos en Aragón. Se calculan los costes de las estrategias alternativas en agricultura de con-servación para el control de arvenses: tratamientos herbicidas sin glifosato, mínimo laboreo y cubiertas vegetales espontáneas y sembradas. [EN]Conservation agriculture systems are linked to glyphosate as the main herbicide in tree crops. The recent debate on possible negative effects over human health has increased the farmers’ concern about an eventual prohibition of glyphosate in the future. The aim of this paper is to estimate the costs asso-ciated with an eventual prohibition of glyphosate in tree crops of Aragon. The costs of different alternative strategies were calculated: substitution of glyphosate in chemical control, minimum tillage, and natural or planted vegetal covers.
