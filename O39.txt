O39|Does Scientific Progress Affect Culture? A Digital Text Analysis|We study the interplay between scientific progress and culture through text analysis on a corpus of about eight million books, with the use of techniques and algorithms from machine learning. We focus on a specific scientific breakthrough, the theory of evolution through natural selection by Charles Darwin, and examine the diffusion of certain key concepts that characterized this theory in the broader cultural discourse and social imaginary. We find that some concepts in Darwin’s theory, such as Evolution, Survival, Natural Selection and Competition diffused in the cultural discourse immediately after the publication of On the Origins of Species. Other concepts such as Selection and Adaptation were already present in the cultural dialogue. Moreover, we document semantic changes for most of these concepts over time. Our findings thus show a complex relation between two key factors of long-term economic growth – science and culture. Considering the evolution of these two factors jointly can offer new insights to the study of the determinants of economic development, and machine learning is a promising tool to explore these relationships.
O39|毎勤データ修正の生産性分析への影響|本稿は、「毎月勤労統計調査」（毎勤）データの修正が、企業レベルの生産性分析に及ぼす影響を定量的に検討する。その結果によると、第一に、平均的には計測される生産性への量的な影響はわずかだが、ごく少数ながら比較的大きな生産性の修正が生じる企業がある。第二に、労働時間修正前後のデータを併用して生産性上昇率を計測すると、一貫して修正前のデータだけを用いるよりも計測誤差が大きくなる傾向がある。第三に、企業特性と生産性の関係についての過去の実証研究の結論が、今般の毎勤データの修正によって定性的に覆る可能性はほとんどない。しかし、生産性向上が重要な政策課題となる中、エビデンスに基づく政策形成のため、2011年以前の毎勤データについても可能な限り再集計が行われることが期待される。

O39|Conference Presentations and Academic Publishing|We quantify the contribution of conferences to publication success of more than 4,000 papers presented at three leading economics conferences over the 2006-2012 period. We show a positive link between conference presentation and the publishing probability in high-quality journals. Participating in major conferences is also associated with improved metrics for other measures of academic success such as the number of citations or abstract views. While the results are broadly similar across fields, annual meetings of the American Economic Association are particularly valuable in these dimensions. We also find that female authors appear to gain less from conferences than male authors.
O39|Digitalization and Firm Performance in Thailand: Evidence from Firm Dividend Payout Policy|Digitalization has continuously transformed economy in the global landscape, including developing countries in ASEAN region. Accordingly, Thailand has established a framework for digital economy development alongside with the ?Thailand 4.0? policy to enhance the country competitiveness. As part of this initiative, healthcare services are profoundly promoted and aimed to be Asia?s capital of health and wellness, as well as a number of digital projects are initiated to drive forward this digitalization. Consequently, businesses in both ICT and healthcare sector should be beneficial from this policy, and should reveal in their financial performance. In corporate finance, firm?s dividend decision could provide useful information about firm performance, and might be taken into consideration when making their investment decision. This paper examines the relationship between dividend per share and financial performance using panel data from Thailand listed firms in ICT and healthcare sectors during the period 2009-2018. In order to investigate such relationship, return on asset (ROA) is a proxy for firm financial performance while firm size, asset tangibility and leverage are treated as controlled variables. Regression results confirms the differences of such relationship between the two sectors. In ICT sector, both firm size and dividend per share shows positive and significant relationship to the firm performance, which provide evidence in support of both Signaling and Bird-in-hand hypotheses of dividend policy theory. Contrary, there is no clear evidence from firms in the Healthcare sector, whose financial performance only depends significantly on asset tangibility but not on dividend.
O39|The probability of automation of occupations in Italy|There is a rising concern for technological unemployment due to the current digital revolution. In order to estimate the probability of automation of occupations we applied two methods: occupation-based approach [Frey and Osborne (2017]) and task-based approach [Nedelkoska and Quintini (2018)]. We found that occupations with a high risk of automation require many routine activities, whereas occupations at low risk require abilities like perception, manipulation, creative intelligence and social intelligence. In Italy, based on the occupation-based approach, 33.2% of workers face a high risk of replacement; this percentage decrease at 18.1% if we apply the task-based approach. Male workers appear to face a higher risk of replacement than female ones. Actual automation may be lower than expected as it depends on many factors, such as technical feasibility, economic benefits that can be obtained and job creation thanks to technology itself. Finally, we stress the importance to adopt some policies; education and training of employees seems to be the most effective one.
O39|Classifying Patents Based on their Semantic Content|In this paper, we extend some usual techniques of classification resulting from a largescale data-mining and network approach. This new technology, which in particular is designed to be suitable to big data, is used to construct an open consolidated database from raw data on 4 million patents taken from the US patent office from 1976 onward. To build the pattern network, not only do we look at each patent title, but we also examine their full abstract and extract the relevant keywords accordingly. We refer to this classification as semantic approach in contrast with the more common technological approach which consists in taking the topology when considering US Patent office technological classes. Moreover, we document that both approaches have highly different topological measures and strong statistical evidence that they feature a different model. This suggests that our method is a useful tool to extract endogenous information.
O39|Impact of counterfeiting on the performance of digital technology companies|Counterfeiting activities target companies in various sectors, including digital technology companies, defined as companies that produce and/or commercialize at least one physical product that incorporates a digital technology, excluding the merchandising related to the company brands. Counterfeiting is a fraudulent activity that potentially damages the economic and innovation performance of companies and can pose major threats to global competition and economic growth. However, the actual impact of counterfeiting on the performance of companies has not been tested empirically, due to methodological problems, including the lack of data on counterfeiting at the firm-level. Furthermore, prior theoretical studies have speculated that counterfeiting could have in part a beneficial effect on the performance of companies, due to indirect advertising, calling for empirical investigations to shed light on the issue. The goal of the present study is to provide empirical evidence on the impact of counterfeiting on both the economic and innovative performance of digital technology companies at the firm-level and on the global scale. To this aim, a new database was created combining data on counterfeiting activities during 2011-2013 (OECD-EUIPO, 2016) with financial information and patent data from 2009 to 2015. The result is a firm-level database that enables unprecedented analyses on the impact of counterfeiting on performance of digital technology companies. About 9% of the seizures of counterfeits that were illegally traded across borders during 2011 2013 involved goods commercialized by digital technology companies, equivalent to about the 9.1% of the total value of seizures. Collectively, about 11% of companies affected by illegal international trade of counterfeits are digital technology companies. The majority of these (58%) are big corporations with Operating Revenues greater than USD 1 bn. These account for 77% of the number of total seizures, and 84% of the value of seizures related to the digital technology companies. SMEs, defined as those with Operating Revenues up to USD 50 million, represent 21% of digital technology companies targeted and account for 5% of total seizures and 6% of the total value of seizures. The industries mostly targeted are electronics (both consumers’ electronics and electronics for industrial use), automotive and digital media. The digital technology products commercialized in frauds of IPRs include computer hardware and electronic components, batteries, sensors, autoparts, optical instruments, videogames, and recording of movies and motion picture. About 34% of digital technology companies affected by international trade of counterfeits are located in the EU28 or EFTA, 41% are located in North America, 23% are located in Asia. Within the EU28, UK, Germany, France and Italy are the countries hosting the largest number of targeted digital technology companies. Within the EU28, Germany and UK, followed by Belgium and Ireland, are the most-common country of destination of seized counterfeits. The overwhelming majority of seized goods related to digital technology companies is imported from Asia. 51% of these are imported from China, 41% comes from Hong Kong, China, 3% from Singapore. Other economies of provenance account each for less than 1% of the seizures. The vast majority (93%) of seizures affecting digital technology companies are due to violations of trademarks, and only a minority are due to violations of design models (4%), and copyrights (2%). Less than 1% of the seizures are due to violations of patents. However, seizures enacted in defence of patents are those that have the highest mean value. The analysis of infringed companies with respect to a control samples of non-infringed companies indicates that counterfeiting targets specifically highly profitable companies, with high propensity to innovate. Indeed, digital technology companies are more likely to become target of counterfeiting when they have larger Operating Revenues, and when they perform at a higher level in terms of profitability (return on total assets), prior to the window of observation. Target companies also have on average larger patent portfolios, prior to the observation of counterfeiting activities. Digital technology companies located in EU28 are on average less likely than companies located outside of EU28 to be the target of counterfeiting activities. Results from impact analyses indicate lower growth rates of operating profits for digital technology companies targeted by counterfeiting with respect to control samples of firms not affected by counterfeiting. In particular the econometric models provide evidence of a negative impact of counterfeiting on both EBITDA (Earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation) and EBIT (Earnings before interest taxes). This result is robust across different estimation methods, model specifications and time windows. The data reveals only a weak negative impact on operating revenues, with limited statistical confidence. Conversely, there is no significant evidence that counterfeiting affected the investment in Fixed Assets of targeted firms with respect to the control sample. The results about the negative impact of counterfeiting activities on operating profits are in line with reports of greater costs incurred by these companies to enact anti-counterfeiting strategies, reported in prior descriptive literature. These practices include the broadening of product ranges, with fewer scale-economies and the enactment of anti-infringement procedures, such as ‘conspicuous packaging’, more screening and origin certifications, development of licensing downstream retailers and direct self-enforcement aimed at limiting the circulation of counterfeits. Results do not provide support for the existence of indirect positive spillover effects, as hypothesised by the theoretical literature, according to which infringed companies might benefit from an advertising effect due to the greater diffusion of brands from the counterfeiting activities. Indeed, at least for what concerns digital technology companies, there is no evidence of any positive effect of infringement on sales of original products. The digital technology companies that were affected by counterfeiting on average increased their patent portfolios during the observation period, but less than the digital technology companies that were not affected by counterfeiting. However, the result is not robust to the inclusion of control variables and to the adoption of alternative measures of innovation performance (Intangible Assets). It certainly merits further research, once more data on counterfeiting become available. Overall, the results indicate that counterfeiting activities harm the economic performance of targeted digital technology companies, by eroding their operating profits. The effect on innovative performance is negative, but still inconclusive due to insufficient dataset, and cannot exclude that counterfeiting may harm the propensity to innovate of digital technology companies. The analysis rules-out the existence of any positive spillover from counterfeiting.
O39|The efficiency of Portuguese Technology Transfer Offices and the importance of university characteristics|Studies on the efficiency of TTOs have mainly focused on well-developed countries (US and UK), whereas intermediate technology countries have been rather neglected. This study intends to complement existing empirical work on this matter by providing evidence on Portugal, an intermediate technology country, which has invested quite heavily in technological support infrastructures (including TTOs) in the last decade. Using the Data Envelopment Analysis approach to 18 Portuguese TTOs over the period 2007-2011, we found that TTOs had improved their efficiency especially in the more upstream stages of the technology transfer process (invention disclosures and priority filings). Additionally, based on econometric models, we found that universities characteristics do matter, with universities with a large number of accumulated patents and publications being associated to more efficient TTOs in terms of invention disclosures and priority filings. Moreover, the regional industrial basis, most notably the weight of the manufacturing industry and new high- and medium-tech firms in regions where the university is located, contributes significantly to the efficiency of TTOs, in both the more upstream (invention disclosure and priority filings) and downstream (start-ups) phases, reflecting the importance of strong business regional spillovers for TTOs efficiency.
O39|Public insurance and climate change (part one): Past trends in weather-related insurance in New Zealand|Climate change appears to be increasing the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events, negatively affecting communities as well as posing long-term sustainability challenges to insurance (risk transfer) mechanisms. New Zealand’s public natural hazard insurer, the Earthquake Commission (EQC), covers homeowners for damage to land (and in some cases to dwellings and contents) caused by landslip, storm or flood. We comprehensively explore the EQC claims data to investigate these weather-related claims from 2000-2017. We find no clear upward trend yet emerging in the number of claims or their value. We find that the northern regions of both islands are the source of most claims, that only a handful of weather events caused a large proportion of EQC’s weather-related pay-outs, that the average property lodging a weather-related claim is located twice as close to the coast as the national average, and that properties with claims usually are cited on much steeper land than the typical property in New Zealand. We also explore their relation between claims and socio-economic characteristics, finding that higher income neighbourhoods appear to be those most benefiting from the EQC coverage for weather events.
O39|OECD 2017 OURdata Index: Methodology and results|This paper presents the methodological process and results of the OECD 2017 Open-Useful-Reusable Government data Index (OURdata Index). It is meant to present the methodology and outline the data collection and verification process; discuss key findings of the composite indicators including overall country scores and scores by pillars and sub-pillars; and show the outcomes of different statistical tests to assess the robustness of the results, including tests to evaluate the sensitivity of the indicators to various weighting schemes. The paper highlights the relevance of the Index to support the design and monitoring of open government data policies and practices leading to socio-economic outcomes and to the improved performance and efficiency of public sector organisations.
O39|A Business Model Bridging Knowledge Gaps|Starting with a case-study we illustrate an emerging business model for the Industrial Internet of Things that applies to other ITC-based industries as well. We formalize this business model by importing the concept of structural holes into semantic networks and suggest that a similar logic applies to conceptual maps of consumers’ behaviour, too.
O39|Future developments in cyber risk assessment for the internet of things|This article is focused on the economic impact assessment of Internet of Things (IoT) and its associated cyber risks vectors and vertices – a reinterpretation of IoT verticals. We adapt to IoT both the Cyber Value at Risk model, a well-established model for measuring the maximum possible loss over a given time period, and the MicroMort model, a widely used model for predicting uncertainty through units of mortality risk. The resulting new IoT MicroMort for calculating IoT risk is tested and validated with real data from the BullGuard's IoT Scanner (over 310,000 scans) and the Garner report on IoT connected devices. Two calculations are developed, the current state of IoT cyber risk and the future forecasts of IoT cyber risk. Our work therefore advances the efforts of integrating cyber risk impact assessments and offer a better understanding of economic impact assessment for IoT cyber risk.
O39|Impact Of Technological Changes On Hrm Competency Frameworks|The IT industry is witnessing rapid change due to technological advancements that are being made and adapted in organisations every day. This research aims to study how these changes have affected the HR department at a multinational IT professional services firm in India, in terms of the changes in their HR roles and role-specific competencies.Two global HRM Competency Models ? SHRM Competency Model 2012 and the HRCS Model 2016 by Michigan-Ross ? have been studied in detail and combined to form an exhaustive list of 18 core competencies for HR professionals. On analysing the HR roles at the organisation under study, it was found that there are 11 unique roles which leverage these 18 competencies. Interviews have been taken of senior and junior resources in the HR roles identified, to take their inputs on the impact of technological changes (in the organisation and industry) on their roles and how they see the core competency requirements for their role changing in the future.It was found that across all roles, there is a need to understand business better and move away from just performing activities to adding thoughtful value in every contribution made. Competencies required for such a shift are different than those for today?s nature of work, which is already seeing great transformation.
O39|Long-run dynamics of the U.S. patent classification system|Abstract Almost by definition, radical innovations create a need to revise existing classification systems. In this paper, we argue that classification system changes and patent reclassification are common and reveal interesting information about technological evolution. To support our argument, we present three sets of findings regarding classification volatility in the U.S. patent classification system. First, we study the evolution of the number of distinct classes. Reconstructed time series based on the current classification scheme are very different from historical data. This suggests that using the current classification to analyze the past produces a distorted view of the evolution of the system. Second, we study the relative sizes of classes. The size distribution is exponential so classes are of quite different sizes, but the largest classes are not necessarily the oldest. To explain this pattern with a simple stochastic growth model, we introduce the assumption that classes have a regular chance to be split. Third, we study reclassification. The share of patents that are in a different class now than they were at birth can be quite high. Reclassification mostly occurs across classes belonging to the same 1-digit NBER category, but not always. We also document that reclassified patents tend to be more cited than non-reclassified ones, even after controlling for grant year and class of origin.
O39|Knowledge flows, firms' competencies, and patent citations: an analysis of the trajectory of IBM|In a knowledge economy, the creation, distribution and use of knowledge become decisive factors to reinforce firms' competitiveness. At the firm level, the process of innovation involves, fundamentally, the creation of new knowledge, which implies the integration and recombination of existing knowledge that may come from different sources and locations. The analytical difficulties to deal with this subject generate a literature that tries to quantify and analyze knowledge flows between economic agents using patent citations. Those citations may provide clues for intra and inter-firms knowledge flows. The paper analyses information about patents granted by IBM in the USPTO, which is used to map knowledge flows and to correlate these flows with the evolution of IBM competences and growth strategies.
O39|Prizes versus Contracts as Incentives for Innovation|The procurement of an innovation involves motivating a research effort to generate a new idea and then implementing that idea efficiently. If research efforts are unverifiable and implementation costs are private information, a trade-off arises between the two objectives. The optimal mechanism resolves the tradeoff via two instruments: a monetary prize and a contract to implement the project. The optimal mechanism favors the innovator in contract allocation when the value of innovation is above a certain threshold, and handicaps the innovator in contract allocation when the value of innovation is below that threshold. A monetary prize is employed as an additional incentive but only when the value of innovation is sufficiently high.
O39|Determinants of citation impact: A comparative analysis of the Global South versus the Global North|The impact of the scientific output produced by different nations in different fields varies extensively. In this article, we apply bibliometric and econometric analysis to study how citation impact varies across countries. This paper differs from previous research in that a cross-section model is put forward to account for such variation. A special focus is given to the Global South, as countries in this group have been converging with the Global North recently. We find that previous citation impact, level of international collaboration and total publications in a specific scientific field are important determinants of citation impact among all nations. However, specialization in particular scientific fields seems significantly more important in the Global South than in the Global North. These findings imply that most lower- and middle-income countries would better concentrate their resources in generating higher critical masses in specific fields, in addition to pursuing long-lasting international collaboration partnerships, as these actions may lead to higher impact research.
O39|Health, Human Capital and Domestic Violence|We study the impact of a medical breakthrough (HAART) on domestic violence and illicit drug use among low-income women infected with HIV. To identify causal effects, we assume that variation in women's immune system health when HAART was introduced affected how strongly their experience of domestic violence or drug use responded to the breakthrough. Immune system health is objectively measured using white blood cell (CD4) counts. Because the women in our sample were informed of their CD4 count, it is reasonable to assume they react to it. Using this identification strategy, we find that HAART introduction reduced domestic violence and illicit drug use. To explain our estimates, we treat health as a form of human capital and argue that women with more human capital face stronger incentives to make costly investments with future payoffs, such as avoiding abusive partners or reducing illicit drug use.
O39|Accelerating Digital Trade in Latin America and the Caribbean|The Internet roared to the scene in Latin America and it is transforming the way Latin Americans interact, shop, bank, and spend their time. The Internet is changing regional consumption patterns, the landscape of regional companies, and the region's economic prospects. Disruptive digital technologies riding on the web -cloud-based services, e-commerce, 3D printing, Internet of Things, and so on- are empowering LAC companies of all sizes to dramatically cut costs, improve customer service, and create brand new products and services. The region is also home to innovative digital companies run by intrepid entrepreneurs, some of whom have accessed significant investments from Silicon Valley and grown into some of the leading digital companies. The Internet, in short, has opened tremendous new opportunities for LAC economies to become more productive, expand opportunities for entrepreneurship, and drive inclusive economic growth.
O39|Will Technological Change Save the World? The Rebound Effect in International Transfers of Technology|Abstract Technological change and its transfer to developing countries is often portrayed by policy-makers as a critical part of the solution to a resource problem such as climate change, based on the assumption that the transfer of resource-conserving technologies to developing countries will result in reduced use of natural capital by those countries. We demonstrate here, in a capital conversion based model of development, that the free transfer of resource-conserving technologies to developing countries will increase the options available to those countries, but that the way that they expend these options need not be in the direction of conserving resources. This is another example of the potential for a rebound effect to determine ultimate outcomes, here in the context of international technology transfer policy. The transfer of technologies is as likely to simply move developing countries more rapidly down the same development path as it is to alter the choices they make along that path. For this reason, the transfer of resource-conserving technologies, without incentives provided to alter development priorities, may not result in any resource-conservation at all.
O39|Kamuda Yenilik: İstanbul’daki Kamu Kurumları Üzerinden Bir Araştırma<BR>[Innovation in Public Sector: A Survey for Measuring Innovation in Public Sector Organizations in Istanbul]|Bu çalışma kamuda yeniliğin amaçlarını, itici güçlerini ve önündeki engelleri belirlemeyi ve İstanbul’daki kamu kurum ve kuruluşlarının yenilik alanındaki mevcut durumlarını ortaya koymayı hedeflemektedir. Bu amaçla geliştirilen anket formu İstanbul’daki kamu kurum ve kuruluşlarına gönderilerek cevaplamaları istenmiştir. En çok gerçekleştirilen yenilik türünün hizmet yeniliği olduğu ve büyük kurumların küçük kurumlara göre daha yenilikçi oldukları sonucuna ulaşılmıştır. Yenilik faaliyetlerinin sadece %17'si işbirliği yapılmaksızın kurum bünyesinde gerçekleştirilirken, en çok işbirliği özel sektör ile yapılmıştır. Kurumların %31,5’inin yürüttükleri yenilik faaliyetleri ya da projeleri için finansal desteklerden yararlanırken, genç personele sahip kurumların desteklerden daha fazla yararlandığı belirlenmiştir. Yenilik faaliyetlerinde bilginin kaynağı olarak kurum içi kaynakların kurum dışı kaynaklara kıyasla daha önemli bir yere sahip olduğu görülmektedir. Benzer bir durum yenilik faaliyetlerinin arkasındaki itici güçlerin değerlendirilmesinde de ortaya çıkmaktadır. Kamuda yeniliğin önündeki engellerin başında kurumlarda yeniliği destekleyen ödül ve teşvik mekanizmalarının olmaması gelmektedir. Kamu kurumlarında uzun vadeli plan yapmanın zorluğu, bürokratik idari yapılanma ve finansal kaynakların yetersizliği, yeniliğin önündeki diğer başlıca engeller olarak karşımıza çıkmaktadır. Kamu kurumlarında yeniliğin çoğunlukla kamu hizmetlerinde etkinliğin artırılması, hizmet kalitesinin ve kullanıcı memnuniyetinin artırılması ve idari işlem yükünün azaltılması amaçlarıyla gerçekleştirildiği sonucuna ulaşılmıştır.
O39|Design Flexibility In Product Forms|Flexibility in product Design has been defined as the ?Ability to change or adapt with economy of time, effort, cost or performance.? Hence Flexibility ensures the greater economy, adaptability and evolution of the product.The form and aesthetics of a product is its unquestionable determinant of success in the market. In today?s market, companies have to keep up with fast changing technologies, fashion trends, economy and user needs. This paper presents a review on the role of flexible design in finalising the form of a product, for achieving economy by design. The research work includes studying the form of few successful smartphones and cars and; from their understanding, deriving how forms played the role in success of the product in the market while the product and its iterations themselves follow flexible design.
O39|Technological Progress, Labour Productivity and Economic Growth: Disentangling the Negative and Positive Effects|This study simply claims that technological progress has positive and negative effects on the labour productivity, so, on the economic growth. Technological progress may have a negative effect on economic growth because of skills obsolescence of labour. For this reason, if the nature of technological progress is assumed as Harrod-neutral for the steady-state analysis, then, the net effect of the technological progress on the economic growth can be examined. Using Hicks-neutrality, it cannot be possible to investigate positive and negative effects. The present study offers a simple calculation procedure in order to disentangle the positive and negative effects. Finally, the study tries to introduce capital-deepening-induced technological progress, if the growth rate and contribution of technological progress is found negative while there is positive economic growth and the steady state conditions are hold at the final state.
O39|Massive Open Online Research: A Collaborative Approach to Tackle Wicked Research Issues|Humans are hardwired as problem-solvers. Education and research enable us to solve complex problems. Even decades ago, we could safely send a crew to the moon and back. A moon-bound project is a very challenging and complex problem, but it is a tame one. The problem is clearly defined and the challenge becomes how to find the best solution. As the world and our understanding of issues becomes more interconnected, there is a different type of problem in the horizon - ?wicked? problems. A wicked problem is normally complex and challenging, but differs from the ?tame? problem because there is no agreement in terms of problem definition. A wicked problem does not allow for the ?choice? of best solution. Solutions tend to only mitigate the problem and sometimes generate unpredictable consequences. For instance, mitigating climate change is an issue that requires a level of ingenuity that cannot be achieved by a limited group of people, regardless how brilliant they are. It cannot be addressed by our dominant scientific, reductionist, discipline-based, and proprietary approach either. This paper proposes Massive Online Open Research (MOOR) as an alternate approach to deal with wicked research issues. In terms of organization, this paper includes a thorough literature review on online collaboration, focusing on the dynamics of knowledge creation and innovation. Sample open online research initiatives are described and analyzed in the light of the literature review. Based on the literature review and real cases, a MOOR framework is proposed and discussed. Limitations and opportunities for future research are also included.
O39|Adverse selection in informal maize markets in Benin| We use panel data from Benin to investigate potential adverse selection in informal maize markets by matching farmers’ maize sales with their knowledge, practices and perception of maize quality. Evidence suggests that rural households market a lower share of their grain stocks when they have better knowledge about quality issues and also invest in improving quality. This is most likely because there is no quality control and the price premium received for higher quality maize is not sufficient to incentivize improvements or investments in storage. We also find that farmers who sell a larger share of their maize stocks into markets might perceive that their storage practices impair quality. This behaviour is observed in the use of chemical protectant for which knowledge and information are limited in rural areas. Our findings highlight the need to develop long term grades and standards in African grain markets to ensure product differentiation and therefore develop rural markets through improved sale transactions. There is also need to provide rural sellers with better access to information about quality issues along with appropriate storage practices and technologies.
O39|Aplicação da técnica P/F de Brass em um contexto de rápida queda da fecundidade adolescente: o caso brasileiro na primeira década do século|"The age-specific fertility rate of women with 15-19 years old (f1) showed a decline between Brazilian's census of 2000 and 2010, for the first time since the inclusion of the information of children born alive in the last 12 months. The decline was meaningful: about 30%. This phenomenon has an important consequence to Brass P/F ratio: It generate an error in the fertility rate accumulated until de age group 20-24 years old (F2), and, by consequence, a P2/F2 overestimated, which we use to correct the Total Fertility Rate (fertility level) calculated from census. Therefore, our aim is to propose an alternative to the original Brass P/F ratio using the Brazilian census (2010). The results show that the alternative proposed here generated estimates close to the births enumerated in the ""Sistema de Informação de Nascidos Vivos"" (SINASC/DATASUS). That is an indication that the alternative proposed here is adherent in a fast fertility decline scenario."
O39|The information infrastructure of knowledge-based economies in the years 1995–2010|Aim: The objective of this article is to make a brief presentation of the information infrastructure as one of the four pillars of the knowledge-based economy (KBE). It also attempts to construct (based on taxonomic methods and applying seven diagnostic variables) a synthetic measure for assessing the degree of the development of information infrastructures in 29 KBEs in the time period 1995–2010. Motivation: The work structure is subordinated to the so defined objective and comprises the introduction, overview, measurement and analysis of the level of the development of information infrastructure in KBEs, and a brief summary. Results: The results of the research obtained by the author allowed the creation of four rankings of the level of the development of information infrastructure in the 29 analysed KBEs and led to the formulation of the conclusion that in the time period 1995–2010 the average level of the development of information infrastructure in the 29 economies grew steadily (with the highest values noted in highly developed KBEs), and the range of variability decreased significantly.
O39|The ‘fit’ between forward-looking activities and the innovation policy governance sub-system|Forward-looking activities (FLAs) can influence innovation systems in various ways to a significant extent. This paper focuses on changes induced by FLAs in the innovation policy governance sub-systems (IPGSs) of the national innovation system (NIS). Our knowledge is surprisingly limited even on this subset of FLA impacts, despite several decades of practice and non-negligible analytical efforts. We propose new taxonomies of FLAs and IPGSs and explore hypotheses on the likely ‘fit’ between different types of FLAs and various IPGSs. Countries selected to illustrate the relevance of our analytical framework include Germany, Greece, and Hungary. Our intention is contribute to a more refined theory building concerning the role and likely impacts of FLAs. Further, as a better understanding of impacts supports the design of more appropriate and effective FLAs, as well as more insightful evaluation of FLAs, this approach is of practical relevance, too.
O39|Social and Business Innovations: Are Common Measurement Approaches Possible?|This article reviews various approaches to measuring business innovation with the aim of drawing lessons for measuring social innovations, and offers several methodological and policy conclusions. First, Innovation Union Scoreboard (IUS) indicators, in principle, could be useful in settings where the dominant mode of innovation is based on R&D activities. In practice, however, both R&D and non-R&D-based modes of innovation are important. IUS, therefore, only provides a partial picture. Social innovations can rely on R&D-based technological innovations; their essence, however, tends to be organizational, managerial, and behavioural changes. The IUS indicators do not capture these types of changes. Second, an assessment of the 81 indicators used to compile the Global Innovation Index reveals that it would not be fruitful to rely on such indicators to capture social innovations. Third, given the diversity among innovation systems, a poor performance signalled by a composite indicator does not automatically identify the area(s) necessitating the most urgent policy actions; only tailored, thorough comparative analyses can do so. Finally, analysts and policy makers need to be aware of the differences between measuring (i) social innovation activities (or efforts); (ii) the framework for social innovations (pre-requisites, available inputs, skills, norms, values, behavioural patterns, etc.); and (iii) the economic, societal, and environmental impacts of social innovations.
O39|Social and Business Innovations: Are Common Measurement Approaches Possible?|This article reviews various approaches to measuring business innovation with the aim of drawing lessons for measuring social innovations, and offers several methodological and policy conclusions. First, Innovation Union Scoreboard (IUS) indicators, in principle, could be useful in settings where the dominant mode of innovation is based on R&D activities. In practice, however, both R&D and non-R&D-based modes of innovation are important. IUS, therefore, only provides a partial picture. Social innovations can essentially rely on R&D-based technological innovations; their essence, however, tends to be essentially organizational, managerial, and behavioural modifications. The IUS indicators do not capture these types of changes. Second, an assessment of the 81 indicators used to compile the Global Innovation Index reveals that it would not be fruitful to rely on such indicators to capture social innovations. Third, given the diversity among innovation systems, a poor performance signalled by a composite indicator does not automatically identify the area(s) necessitating the most urgent policy actions; only tailored, thorough comparative analyses can do so. Finally, analysts and policy makers need to be aware of the differences between measuring (i) social innovation activities (or efforts); (ii) the framework for social innovations (pre-requisites, available inputs, skills, norms, values, behavioural patterns, etc.); and (iii) the economic, societal, and environmental impacts of social innovations.
O39|Electronic ‘Knowledge Factories’ versus Micro-environment of Innovation: Who Will Win?|The end of the 20th century was marked by several studies that revealed the collective mechanisms of the development of knowledge as a joint activity in working teams. Thus, the idea that acquiring knowledge was an unproblematic transfer of what is already available and can be unilaterally transferred and assimilated was rejected [Lave, Wenger, 1991]. The aim of this paper is to study the possibilities of electronic network platforms to use the collective nature of knowledge in the interests of further developing knowledge and innovation through online communication of professionals. Based on a literature review on the development of knowledge, the paper compares the basic principles of knowledge application in formulating new decisions during real joint activity and during online communication within specialized platforms for ‘knowledge exchange’. The author argues that electronic networking platforms contribute to the fragmentation of knowledge representation of participants, eluding a common sense and purpose. Thus, such platforms blur the boundary between knowledge and information. The article indicates that the desire to increase the effectiveness of collective creativity via online communication risks not developing competencies, discretion, and exploration of others’ experiences. Instead, this desire leads to strengthening external control and separation of functions into primary routine operations when an individual participant is valued not for his/ her knowledge and previous experience, but for his/ her communicative capabilities. The produced effect is akin to the industrial revolution of the machine era; when this effect is widespread, there are risks that knowledge workers will be turned into easily replaceable, piecemeal workers. To avoid this, electronic platforms should either learn to recreate the conditions of offline micro-environments of innovation, or not claim to fulfil the role of knowledge production.
O39|Approaches for scientific collaboration and interactions in complex research projects under disciplinary influence|This paper reviews the approaches to breaking disciplinary barriers in complex projects by arguing that in addition to the way transdisciplinary research has been explored, other sets of concepts including social capital and research value chains can effectively enhance and strengthen the transdisciplinary narrative. The need for scientists to work together have been there for a long time. As the inter-linkages between society and the environment gets more apparent, complex and compelling; collaboration, cooperation and integration across multiple social and epistemological perspectives become more important. Scientific disciplines distinguished it through different forms of interests, perspectives, assumptions, priorities, vocabularies, methodologies and communication styles. These elements together constitute professional knowledge communities at the level of disciplines or sub-disciplines into which they socialize. Disciplinary protectionism, low level of understanding of other disciplines, power control and beneficiaries of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary outputs often forms the basis for weaker collaborations. Breaking these barriers by working together in complex projects to solve real life problems using sustainable inter and transdisciplinary approaches are long overdue. Integrating ideas, perspective and people with different disciplines are continuous processes that require clarity of communication, patience, good leadership and consensus building. From the review it is clear that; it is not about the mechanics of organizations, projects or teams, or structures, ontologies and epistemologies of these disciplines that solves these real life problems, but by accepting the social networks and barriers affecting interdisciplinary communication; by generating social capital and cohesion, by effectively building teams and ensuring cultural understanding amongst all actors who have roles to play on the problem or project in question.
O39|Productivity Growth and Entrepreneurship in Pakistan: The Role of Public Policy in Promoting Technology Management|Numerous public announcements are made regularly in Pakistan about moving towards a knowledge economy. These appear to be wishful thinking in the absence of any coherent understanding of the role of technology and its spillovers as major drivers of development and growth as well as lack of clarity about the manner in which science and technology are organized in Pakistan. Pakistan has not really been able to manage the major organizational changes brought about by the techno-information revolution of the 21st century. Its competitiveness is falling, organizational changes are slow and workforce skill levels are inadequate – all of which have stalled productivity and innovation. Pakistan faces a serious risk of deindustrialization unless the dynamics and disruptive nature of modern technology are better understood and embedded as a key pillar of public policy in order to enhance productivity and innovation. This article attempts to define the nexus between technology and entrepreneurship and show how it differs from scientific research. It also examines the role of public policy in promoting productivity growth and entrepreneurship through better policies in technology management.
O39|Innovation Activity Of Family Business In South-West Planning Area|The family business in Bulgaria occupies a considerable place among companies that operate in all sectors of the economy. It contributes significantly the economic development of different regions in the country and collaborates reducing the unemployment and creating jobs, as well as providing flexibility of the market. What is typical for the family business is that it boasts high responsibility towards the outcome. Not only the product or service quality is particularly important for the family business but also is the companies’ reputation among the customers. In this sense, the proper and effective management of innovation activity is essential and significant. In this regard, the objective of this article is to analyze the innovation of the family enterprises from the South-west planning area.

O39|Financing Research and Development Activities in the Construction Materials Industry. Comparative Study|Financing the research and development activities is an essential issue nowadays. Even if it seems costly, this activity became very important on a market where competitors appear constantly, providing products adjusted both technically and economically. In order to maintain a high level, investments are of utmost importance, including for research and development. Our scientific undertaking presents on a lower scale the evolution of three construction materials manufacturers in the world, as well as their evolution both in the field of financing research and development activities, as well as their position in the world classification established based on the process of financing this activity.
O39|Innovación y emprendedurismo: Ordenando el rompecabezas de la Nueva Gestión Empresarial de la Innovación<BR>[Innovation and entrepreneurship: Sorting the puzzle of the New Business Management of Innovation]|This essay aims to clarify the puzzle of new principles and techniques in the field of business management of innovation. These new principles and techniques were born in a widely-connected world with an increasing presence of startups and innovative companies in order to meet pervasive market uncertainty and facilitate implementation of “new-to-market” innovations. The focus is placed on the implications for competitive strategy and business management of innovation. Instead of drawing on Schumpeterian concepts, we use the modern notion of “disruptive” innovations (those upsetting the rules of the game and old structures in a business or industry), as well as the principles and techniques recently developed to approach the uncertainties and costs of innovations: customer development and lean startup. We compare two paradigmatic styles of innovation: the startups’ stereotype (the American style) and that of “innovation transfer” (German-European style). Then, we discuss the main orientations of innovation policy with regard to the new industrial initiatives (Industry 4.0 in Germany and Europe and advanced manufacturing in USA) and their counterpoint of startups' innovating creativity across a connected world at the edge of an information revolution.
O39|Innovation and public understanding of science: possibility of new indicators for the analysis of public attitudes to science, technology and innovation|In the context of a knowledge-based economy, in the last 50 years, countries and international organisms have systematized many indicators to evaluate inventive and innovative capacity, mainly related to science. But these indicators have almost exclusively focused on the supply side of invention and innovation, in which attention is given to people (entrepreneurs), organizations practicing research and development (R&D) and innovative companies and virtually none to the end users, like consumers or organizations not connected to R&D/innovation. Aiming at facing this insufficiency, this paper proposes new models to analyze innovation through indicators that show the relationship between the realms of science, technology and innovation and society as a whole. These sociocultural indicators represent the set of propensities to innovate in a given social group. Therefore, from the confluence of investigations in the field of Public Understanding of Science and Innovation Studies, five indicators of the propensity to innovate were chosen: efficiency, creativity, trust in science and technology, uncertainty tolerance and cooperation.
O39|Recent economic theorising on innovation: Lessons for analysing social innovation|This paper reviews recent economic theorising on innovation from the angle of analysing social innovations (SI). It is structured as follows: Some of the basic notions used in innovation analyses are considered in section 2, focusing on the subject, objectives and levels of change. Section 3 reviews how innovation is understood in particular models of innovation and analysed by various schools of economics highlighting the types of actors and knowledge perceived as relevant in these various approaches. The notion of innovation systems (national, regional, sectoral, and technological ones) and its analytical and policy relevance is explored in section 4. Lessons relevant for analysing social innovation are drawn at the end of each sub-section, and the most important of those are reiterated in the concluding section.
O39|Potential and Limitations of Virtual Advice in Wealth Management|Technological developments and changing customer preferences are placing demands upon the classical way that private banking clients and wealth management are advised by banks. This article analyzes how the traditional advisory model, whereby the client adviser and the customer interact in the form of a personal dialogue, could be altered by means of virtual advisory models. Based on survey results by wealth management clients in Switzerland, Germany, and Austria, current preferences are analyzed in terms of advice characteristics, and future potential as well as obstacles to the virtual consultation are discussed. A hybrid advisory model offered by established wealth managers appears to be the most promising advisory model for the main customer segments in wealth management.
O39|The Intellectual Development of Supply Chain Management: 1996 ? 2015|Supply chain management aims to provide the coordination and execution of planning and decision-making in multi organization-wide production and distribution. This study intended to identify the intellectual development of supply chain management in the last two decades using the author co-citation analysis. The author co-citation analysis is frequently used to produce maps of prominent authors and identify the intellectual structure of the research field.In this research, we have collected 749 academic papers on the supply chain management from the year 1996 to 2015. With these papers, we analyze the references of the papers for the author co-citation analysis method. Then, we produced a correlation matrix of the major author co-citation matrix and conducted multi-variate analysis such as factor analysis and clustering analysis. The major findings including the intellectual structure of supply chain management will be discussed in the conference in details. The limitation of the research and suggestion for further research will also be presented.
O39|İnovasyon İndeksi Yardımıyla Türkiye’de İllerin Rekabetçilik Analizi: Düzey-III Örneği|In this study, it has aimed to reveal the competitiveness of the provinces on the level of 26 NUTS considered spatial units in Turkey. The innovation index was calculated in the analysis in which total of 22 variables taken into account and used factor analysis to present the competitiveness of the provinces. In this sense, provinces are grouped with their relative innovation index value. In this context, the development gap between regions for Level-III regions in Turkey has found. According to the results of our analysis, Istanbul takes the first place with 24.01 index value. Ankara with index value of 14.03 and Kocaeli by 7.93 index value follow Istanbul. Ağrı, Bitlis and Muş ranked at the last three rows of the innovation index. Grouping was made between provinces with similar indices and six homogeneous groups were determined in total. Istanbul, Ankara, Kocaeli, Izmir and Bursa took place in the primary group consisting of provinces whose innovation capacity developed. There are a total of 14 provinces in the last group and their innovation capacity development classified as the sixth degree.
O39|The effect of innovative activity in firm performance and development: Analysing data from eurozone|Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of Innovative Activity on firm performance and growth. Active Research and Development is considered to be directly related with development, prosperity and growth, in micro and macro level and a key factor in hindering economic recession. Design/methodology/approach – We analyse economic data from listed firms of selected eurozone country-members in order to associate Research and Development with performance indicators in firm and country level. For that purpose, several firm data were collected from WorldScope data base and macroeconomic data from Worldbank database. The period examined is between 2002 and 2012, with a special focus on current financial crisis (after 2007). The empirical process includes, descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis. Findings – Findings indicate the crucial effect of innovative process in economic performance and development in firm and country level. The latter highlights the urgent need for public support in order to spur innovative activity and high-tech exports, especially in countries that were heavily affected by recession. Research limitations/implications – Some research limitations are the large number of missing cases in WordScope database, as many firms after the beginning of current crisis exit stock market. Furthermore, the other part of the economy, the Small and Medium Enterprises does not exist in the analysis, as listed firms are mainly large and mature companies. Originality/value – The results tend to highlight the need for common policy measures in eurozone, in regard to such issues, instead of imposing horizontal budgetary constraints in specific countries (like Southern Europe), hindering the vicious recessionary circle.
O39|Technological revolutions and speculative finance: Evidence from the British Bicycle Mania|"Technological revolutions are often accompanied by substantial stock price reversals, but previous literature has produced competing explanations for why this is the case. This paper brings new evidence to this debate using data from the innovation-driven British Bicycle Mania of 1895-1900, in which cycle share prices rose by over 200 per cent before collapsing by more than 75 per cent. These price patterns are not fully explained by fundamentals or by changes in the nature of risk associated with cycle shares. Instead, the evidence from the Bicycle Mania supports the hypothesis of Perez (2009), who argues that new technology, high short-term profits, and loose monetary conditions increase the level of speculative investment, ""decoupling"" share prices from fundamentals."
O39|Innovations in the Enterprises from the Furniture Industry|The results from studies of innovation in furniture enterprises for the period 2006-2012 are monitored more than 600 small and medium-sized enterprises for the production of furniture in Bulgaria. As a result, they are characterized specific innovation activities and results, and compared with the average performance. Highlighted are the barriers to innovation and recommendations are made in the observation of innovation in the furniture industry.
O39|Foreign Direct Investment, Productivity, Demand for Skilled Labour and Wage Inequality: An Analysis of Uruguay|" type=""main"" xml:id=""twec12180-abs-0001""> This study seeks to identify the causal effects of foreign ownership on productivity, the demand for skilled labour and wage inequality. With this aim, we use differences-in-differences techniques for a panel of Uruguayan manufacturing firms in the period 1997–2005. Our results seem to indicate that FDI causes higher productivity and increased demand for skilled labour. Furthermore, although average wages are higher in foreign-owned firms than in domestic ones, the wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers is wider. It follows that promoting foreign investment enhances productivity. In addition, due to the greater demand for skilled workers, policies such as training schemes would be conducive to raising productivity still further, while other social policies could help to mitigate the wage inequality effects."
O39|Innovation systems and knowledge communities in the agriculture and agrifood sector: a literature review|This article examines how research on the agriculture and agrifood systems mobilizes the concept of Innovation System (IS). A literature review on the IS provides an analytical framework for determining its theoretical frame of reference, its area of application and its uses. Based on this framework, a bibliometric analysis of international journals on innovation and agriculture reveals the existence of four knowledge communities, each of which addresses a specific angle of how the IS concept is applied to deal with the specific dimensions of innovation in the agricultural / agrifood sector. The current challenge is to promote exchanges between these communities, particularly between the one that applies an evolutionary approach and the epistemic community, which seeks to build its own concepts originating from the farming system approach and rural sociology.

O39|Intellectual property rights and developing countries: The north-south-east model|This study examines the effects of intellectual property protection on developing countries by using a three-pole global economy model. Although the classical North-South framework is a very useful method to represent the conflict between the developed and the developing world, the present study claims that it does not exactly reflect the heterogeneity within developing countries in some cases; such as intellectual property and technological production. Therefore, a three-pole world economy which consists of the following regions has been designed in this study; a region that only innovates high-technology goods (the North), a region that innovates low-technology goods and imitates northern high-technology goods (the East) and a region that only imitates eastern low-technology goods and northern high-technology goods that have been already imitated by eastern imitators (the South). This setup enables us to define the global imitation process as a chain system which allows southern region to imitate also the northern goods that have been imitated by eastern imitators before.To observe the effects of the possible policy choices, the theoretical model has been simulated. The results reveal firstly, northern region benefits from tighter intellectual property protection in any case; secondly, stronger IPR protections in the East reduces eastern imitation and enhances southern imitation sectors which target eastern imitation; thirdly, an IPR strengthening policy in the South certainly exerts negative effects in southern region while it brings benefit to eastern region in some aspects; e.g. relative wages. Particularly the third finding shows that the new three-pole approach on the analysis of intellectual property protection explicitly reflects the presence of an absolute conflict of interests within the developing world. Moreover, it proves that for developing countries with relatively low technological capacity there is no possibility of benefiting from tighter protection of the local intellectual property rights.
O39|Prospects for Telemedicine Adoption: Prognostic Modeling as Exemplified by Rural Areas of USA|Experts predict that in the majority of countries state healthcare expenditures will continue to rise. Usage of telemedicine applications – the use of information and communications technologies (ICT) in order to provide clinical health care at a distance – will help optimize the costs of healthcare in the long-term. The main advantages of telemedicine include reducing the number of doctor’s errors, saving both patients and physicians time, and improving the efficiency of healthcare organizations. It also ensures timely and quality services for large segments of the population living in remote territories with difficult socio-economic conditions, particularly rural areas. The paper forecasts the adoption rate of telemedicine in US rural areas by using the Bass Model. The model is considered quite versatile as it can be used across a wide range of products and services. Nevertheless, the Bass model has some limitations related to how it estimates missing data. Calculation errors can be related to numerous barriers, which affect the adoption rate of telemedicine. These barriers include: high costs of production and exploitation of hi-tech equipment; physicians insufficiently prepared to adopt and use the latest technologies in their daily work; as well as possible concerns of patients about the quality of remote healthcare service.
O39|Knowledge Assets In Services Across Industries And Across Time / Los Activos De Conocimiento En Diversas Industrias De Servicios A Lo Largo Del Tiempo|This paper explores the question of whether knowledge assets are more developed in services industries than in non-services. The concept of the “knowledge economy” has always gone hand-in-hand with growth in the percentage of the economy represented by services. Two multi-year, multi-industry datasets are used to directly compare the knowledge asset levels in service industry firms against those in non-service industry firms. Service industries do, indeed, reflect higher levels of intellectual capital in recent years, but did not do so a decade ago. Further, there is considerable evidence of changes in specific service and non-service industries over the time period, adding details to the finding that knowledge development is not static but does vary over time and circumstance. These results open up a number of promising research directions that could lead to a better understanding of the nature of these differing circumstances and how better strategic choices might be made regarding investments in knowledge management. / Este artículo analiza la cuestión de si los activos de conocimiento están más desarrollados en las industrias de servicios que en las de no servicios. El concepto de “economía del conocimiento” siempre ha ido de la mano del crecimiento de la economía representada por el sector servicios. Se utilizan dos conjuntos de datos plurianuales y multisectoriales para comparar de manera directa los niveles de activos de conocimientos en las empresas de servicios con las empresas que no son de servicios. Las empresas de servicios sí muestran niveles más altos de capital intelectual durante los últimos a˜nos, si bien esto no era así hace una década. Asimismo, existen numerosas pruebas de cambios en industrias concretas de servicios y de no servicios durante el período de tiempo analizado, que incorporan matices al hallazgo de que el desarrollo de conocimiento no es estático, sino que varía en función del tiempo y las circunstancias. Estos resultados abren una serie de prometedoras vías de investigación que podrían dar lugar a un mejor entendimiento de la naturaleza de estas diversas circunstancias y a cómo podría llevarse a cabo una mejor selección estratégica en lo que respecta a las inversiones en gestión del conocimiento.
O39|Service Innovation And Its Impact: What Do We Know About? / Innovación En Servicios Y Su Impacto: ¿Qué Es Lo Que Sabemos?|Despite the growing body of literature concentrating on service innovation, empirical research focusing on measuring its impact, mainly at firm-level, remains scarce. Adopting the perspective that the ability to monitor the service innovation process and to assess its impact is a pre-condition to properly manage it, we conduct a literature review of recent empirical studies on the measurement of service innovation to ascertain our current body of knowledge. We restrict our review to the period covering 2006 to 2014, as previous research has been extensively covered by Adams, Bessant, and Phelps (2006) and concentrate on published empirical academic articles which clearly examine “service innovation” and its impact on performance. Relying on several inclusion and exclusion criteria, thirteen empirical studies were retained and are discussed in this paper. Although this study does not claim to be exhaustive, it shows that knowledge on the relationship between service innovation and performance is limited and that this area of research deserves further scrutiny. We conclude with some avenues for further research, in view of stimulating more research in this promising yet emerging field. / Si bien la literatura centrada en la innovación de servicios ha ido en aumento, la investigación empírica centrada en su impacto, sobre todo en el ámbito empresarial, sigue siendo escasa. Desde la perspectiva de que la capacidad para controlar el proceso de innovación en servicios y la evaluación del impacto son requisitos para su correcta gestión realizamos un análisis de la literatura sobre estudios empíricos recientes acerca de la medida de la innovación en servicios para comprobar nuestros conocimientos actuales. Restringimos este análisis al período entre 2006 y 2014, pues Adams, Bessant y Phelps (2006) ya investigaron ampliamente las etapas anteriores, y nos concentramos en las publicaciones académicas empíricas que examinen de una manera clara la “innovación en servicios” y su impacto en el rendimiento. Conforme a varios criterios de inclusión y exclusión, se seleccionaron trece artículos, los cuales se examinan en este escrito. A pesar de que este estudio no pretende ser exhaustivo, revela que los conocimientos de la relación entre la innovación en servicios y el rendimiento son limitados y que este ámbito merece ser estudiado más a fondo. Concluimos con posibles vías de investigación con el fin de poder estimular más el trabajo sobre este ámbito tan prometedor y emergente.
O39|Eye in the Sky: Contextualizing Development with Online Privacy Concern in Western Balkan Countries|The online privacy issue has received a great deal of scholarly attention in the past decade. Studies for Western developed societies have shown that privacy concern and risk awareness are higher in more developed countries; however, the relevance of online privacy concern in the context of economic development remains unexplored. In a digital society, online privacy concern could have significant impact on the real economy; therefore it is not to be underestimated. If indeed development is influenced by the penetration of new technologies, the connection between online privacy concern and development could have a major role in post-transition economies. In this paper we try to determine the level of online privacy concern in a set of post-transition, Western Balkan countries and its repercussions on the future development of these countries. Past research for the Western Balkan region has shown significant structural differences in general privacy concern and here we introduce a new approach which focuses on online privacy concern. We contextualize online privacy with the implementation of reforms which are crucial for the Western Balkan region as well as for other less developed and post-transition economies. The differences in the level of online privacy concern among post-transition Western Balkan countries are discussed in the context of their economic, technological and institutional development, and policy implications are suggested.
O39|Preventing and Detecting Fraud through Data Analytics in auto insurance field|Currently, in the autoinsurance field, fraud has become a real phenomenon, and insurance companies are making efforts to identify and implement effective means of fraud prevention and detection. This article aims to present the data analysis and related tools, as a possible alternative to fraud, in the context of the current information society (I-society).In the literature, data analysis processes are presented as a highly effective means for the prevention and detection of fraud, but their implementation at both inter and intra-company levels is a difficult process, because it involves organizational transformations in which the decision should be based on knowledge.Although in Romania the institutional framework for fraud detection in the auto insurance field is created, the information processes that take advantage of the potential of intangible assets (data, information, knowledge, relationships, etc.) are not systematically exploited and are not integrated into decision-making (whether strategic or operational).
O39|PATSTAT revisited|This study provides a comprehensive summary of and guidance for using the EPO Worldwide Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT), one of the most widely used patent databases for researchers. We highlight the three most important issues that PATSTAT users must consider when performing patent data analyses and suggest ways to deal with those issues. Although PATSTAT is chosen in this study, the issues that we discuss are also applicable to other patent databases.
O39|Innovation and underground entrepreneurship|This paper examines the impact of innovation on the underground economy, focusing on differences between informal entrepreneurship and the overall shadow economy. Using cross-national data and measuring innovative activity alternately by patent grants and patent applications, results show that increases in innovative activity spur informal entrepreneurship. The effects of innovation on the overall shadow economy are insignificant. Further, general improvements in government effectiveness seem more effective in checking the underground sector than specific initiatives related to minimum wages or taxes. Transition countries, ceteris paribus, have lower informal entrepreneurship, but higher overall underground economy. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
O39|Key Trends In Co-Publication Activities Of Ukrainian And The Eu Scientists In 2003-2013|The Ukrainian research community needs more active involvement into processes of international production of knowledge, and co-publication analysis opens the way for quantitative assessment of the level of internationalization. The aim of the article is to analyze level and dynamics of joint publication activity of Ukrainian scientists and scholars from the EU countries in 2003-2013. The method of this article is based on analysis of the key international databases of scientific publications and corresponding Ukrainian national data. The main result is the identification of the key sectors and dynamics of scientific co-operation in joint publications between the EU and Ukraine. Thus, the reasons for the decline in number of publications of Ukrainian scientists at the international level in the first two decades of independence are considered. We analyzed the disciplinary aspects of joint publications, trends and prospects of further cooperation between scientists of Ukraine and the EU in this area. The paper is prepared within EU-sponsored project of the FP7 Programme ‘Enhancing the Bilateral S&T Partnership with Ukraine*Advanced Innovative Approach’.
O39|Innovators’ Vs. Non- Innovators’ Perceptions On Business Barriers In Southeastern Europe|The aim of this paper is to analyse whether perceptions regarding obstacles for doing business differ between innovative and non-innovative firms in posttransition period. To that end, we use the latest EBRD Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS round V) and perform the analysis for 9 countries in the Southeastern Europe: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, FYR Macedonia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Romania and Serbia. These countries have been chosen, since similar analysis is not available in the literature. We classify enterprises into 3 groups, according to their innovative performance: innovators (that have innovation output), R&D firms (that have innovation input) and non-innovators. The analysis reveals that in most countries and for most types of firms, tax rates and informal sector are perceived as the most important obstacles for business activity.
O39|Proposals for Implementing Data Analysis Solutions for Fraud Detection|In the current informational context (I-society) it is necessary to introduce proactive analytical guidelines, in order to prevent and detect fraud in the economic, financial and fiscal fields. Practical ways through which can be prevented and identified frauds are extremely diverse, but those with a higher rate of success are the ones through which is achieved an objective analysis, by exploitation of databases. Although in Romania the institutional framework for detecting fraud is created, the information processes that capitalize the potential of intangible assets (data, information, knowledge) are not exploited in a systematic way and are not integrated into the decision-making act (whether strategic or operational). Designing a fraud-detection system will take into account a number of issues relating to: identify areas with high risk of fraud, access to historical events that have been laid down as indications of fraud (historical data), environmental features in which the company operates etc.

O39|Service innovation and internationalization in SMEs: Implications for growth and performance|We investigate the relationship between the management of innovations and internationalization among small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The literature has yielded mixed results on how innovation impacts internationalization and performance of SMEs, while simultaneously neglecting the role of service innovations (SI), in particular. Thus, using a sample of 104 Finnish SMEs, we examine how engaging in SI impacts their growth, international performance and international expansion. We find that engaging in SI has a positive relationship with international performance, but not with the growth or degree of internationalization (DOI) among the companies. We then discuss the implications on innovation management and corporate strategy.

O39|Software Architecture Model for Mattu Gulla Cultivators|Service Oriented Architecture aids in building IT systems that empower the existing resources and allows for easy modifications that may be required later. This paper proposes a Service Based Software Architecture Model that may provide a solution to the problems of Mattu Gulla growers of Mattu. This papers provides an outline of the architecture and further research can help in the implementation and improvement of the model. Mattu is a village in the Udupi district of Karnataka state in India, also known by name of Matti. This village is famous for a particular variety of brinjal (eggplant) that is grown only in this village famously known as Mattu Gulla. It is grown in an area of about 60 acres. ?Mattu Gulla? is also a produce with a GI (geographical indication) tag. The cultivators of Mattu gulla face problems many like price fluctuations, insect attacks, soil related diseases, untimely rain, limited marketing,lack of labour and poor transportation facilities. This paper proposes a Service Based Software Architecture Model that aims to take care of the grievances of the Mattu gulla cultivators.
O39|Implementing Bioremediation Technologies to Degrade Chemical Warfare Agents and Explosives from War Affected Regions in Sri Lanka|Chemical agents used during the Sri Lankan civil war continue to threaten human andenvironmental health as affected areas are re-settled. Bioremediation is a cost-effective and eco-friendly approach to degrading chemical agents, and has greater public acceptance than chemical degradation. Baseline data on contaminant distribution, environmental parameters, and indigenous microbes are required before bioremediation can commence. The culture and isolate of suitable microbes and enzymes should be followed by laboratory trials, before field application and long-term monitoring of contaminant concentration, soil parameters, microbial ecology, and public health to monitor environmental and public health. As local people are not aware of the persistence of warfare chemicals and do not understand the potential impacts on human health, community awareness programs are required. Active community participation, and collaboration with international and local agencies, would contribute to the success of bioremediation and the effective removal of chemical agents in war affected areas of Sri Lanka.
O39|The Relationship of Learner Characteristics of Gaming with Math Engagement|The main purpose of the study was to examine the effects of student?s gaming behaviors and perceptions of games on the engagement in the mathematics classrooms. For the study, the research team recruited 299 sixth grade students from two schools located in rural areas of Virginia in the United States and collected data. For the analytical tool, we employed Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to examine the relationship of gaming behaviors with the engagement mediated by perceptions of instructional games. We found that student?s mathematics engagement was associated with student?s perceptions of games and gaming behaviors. The game hours drew a significant path to student?s perceptions of game learning while the game frequencies had a significant path to student?s perceptions of game utility. The student?s perceptions made significant paths to mathematics engagement. This study provided empirical information on student?s mathematics engagement connecting student?s perceptions of game learning and games utility.
O39|Homework Completion: Perceptions and Comparisons of 6th-12th Grade Students Using Traditional and Digital Submission|As technology becomes more prevalent throughout society, schools must adapt to effectively utilize technology in support of classroom instruction and assessment. This study focused on a comparison of three forms of technology that may be used in public middle and high schools for digital submission of student work. Student usage of Moodle, Gaggle, and Google Drive at one middle school and one high school in central Illinois was monitored. Researchers sought to answer how the rate of homework completion was affected by use of digital versus traditional submission of assignments as well as gain insight to teacher and student perceptions of the technology. In the course of this study, researchers identified a significant decrease in student return rates of homework when digital submission was utilized instead of traditional submission. This decrease was observed across all grade levels. Teacher and student perceptions of the technology were mixed, indicating a divide in both use and preference for or against digital submission.
O39|Micro, Small And Medium Enterprises And Social Networks In Tourism Industry In Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico|Nowadays, the use of social media has become an important tool to introduce new products and services in the world. However, in some countries social networks are very important to show what the company is and what they are doing with their businesses, it means that they sharing everything with their customers, like products, services, goals, some cases they try to educate their public about the use of the product or service, among other things.When people started using social networks on the internet, these were conceived as a mean to communicate with relatives or friends. However, with time, the social networks have evolved to a point that they now allow people to use them to generate sales and increase the competitiveness of enterprises.The purpose of this research is to demonstrate the lack of training and knowledge about the use of social networks by local businesses and the barriers they face when they decide to use them as sales platforms, and to demonstrate the impact it could have on their businesses. Four SMEs located in Colima State in Mexico were studied, selected to be sufficiently successful and representative in terms of industry and size, for theoretical generalization purposes. These tourism SMEs stem from various sectors, such as: travel agencies, tour operator, hotel and restaurant. Data were collected through semi-structured tape-recorded interviews, ranging approximately one hour and a half each, with the owner-manager or the manager responsible for social media. Interview transcripts were then coded and analyzed following Miles and Huberman?s (1994) prescriptions with the assistance of the Atlas.ti application.The results allow us to conclude that the investigated companies believe that the use of social networks is extremely important to be able to compete in the market. However, due to a lack of training, they were not able to implement properly the utilization of social networks in their companies.
O39|Barriers to cross-region research and development collaborations in Europe: evidence from the fifth European Framework Programme|The focus of this paper is on cross-region R&D collaboration funded by the fifth EU Framework Programme (FP5). The objective is to measure distance, institutional, language and technological barrier effects that may hamper collaborative activities between European regions. Particular emphasis is laid on measuring discrepancies between two types of collaborative R&D activities, those generating output in terms of scientific publications and those that do not. The study area is composed of 255 NUTS-2 regions that cover the pre-2007 member states of the European Union (excluding Malta and Cyprus) as well as Norway and Switzerland. We employ a negative binomial spatial interaction model specification to address the research question, along with an eigenvector spatial filtering technique suggested by Fischer and Griffith (2008) to account for the presence of network autocorrelation in the origin–destination cooperation data. The study provides evidence that the role of geographical distance as collaborative deterrent is significantly lower if collaborations generate scientific output. Institutional barriers do not play a significant role for collaborations with scientific output. Language and technological barriers are smaller but the estimates indicate no significant discrepancies between the two types of collaborative R&D activities that are in focus of this study.

O39|Evolutionary convergence of the patterns of international research collaborations across scientific fields|Frame and Carpenter 1979 analysed the pattern of international research collaboration among scientific fields in 1970s. Starting from this pioneering work, this paper investigates international collaborations over 1997-2012 and compares the critical results with earlier studies to detect the evolution of collaboration patterns in different scientific fields. Empirical analysis supports two vital findings, given by a a relatively stable structure of international research collaborations over time across different scientific fields; b a convergent process of collaboration patterns between theoretical and applied research fields. One important deter-minant of the latter result might be due to the increasing interdisciplinary nature of research fields that supports the convergence between basic and applied sciences.
O39|Living Innovation:Competing in the 21st Century Access Economy|Living Innovation: Competing in the 21st Century Access Economy explores how the digital revolution has empowered customers, and how organizations have to innovate to gain a deeper understanding of user needs. Stepping away from the traditional mindset of products being the foremost concern of an organization, this book elaborates on how service value and the management of customer relationships are some of the new goals of an experience-driven economy. The ten chapters of this book provide insights and different perspectives into this new economy, including the consequences of the shift away from a product-based mindset, the role of the physical space as a stimulator of innovation and the keys to making service innovation a success.
O39|Cloud Robotics Platforms|Cloud robotics is a rapidly evolving field that allows robots to offload computation-intensive and storage-intensive jobs into the cloud. Robots are limited in terms of computational capacity, memory and storage. Cloud provides unlimited computation power, memory, storage and especially collaboration opportunity. Cloud-enabled robots are divided into two categories as standalone and networked robots. This article surveys cloud robotic platforms, standalone and networked robotic works such as grasping, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and monitoring.
O39|Moving towards Cloud Security|Cloud computing hosts and delivers many different services via Internet. There are a lot of reasons why people opt for using cloud resources. Cloud development is increasing fast while a lot of related services drop behind, for example the mass awareness of cloud security. However the new generation upload videos and pictures without reason to a cloud storage, but only few know about data privacy, data management and the proprietary of stored data in the cloud. In an enterprise environment the users have to know the rule of cloud usage, however they have little knowledge about traditional IT security. It is important to measure the level of their knowledge, and evolve the training system to develop the security awareness. The article proves the importance of suggesting new metrics and algorithms for measuring security awareness of corporate users and employees to include the requirements of emerging cloud security.
O39|Evolutions and Opportunities of Business Education in the Context of Educational Reform from the Digital Age|Education and training research for business environment has become an important subject to debate in nowadays, because it allows the design of scenarios that contribute to economic and social development. In this paper, we propose to analyse the evolution of business educational models, in terms of new forms of learning: e-learning and MOOC. It will also be analysed the impact of educational methods in the virtual environment in the classic educational system. Last but not least there will be outlined the perspectives and opportunities of business education in the context of educational reform at European and global level. In this regard, it will be drawn the direction and position of Romania towards the reorganization of business education model.
O39|The contribution of R&D to production efficiency in OECD countries: econometric analysis of industry-level panel data|While research and development expenditures are considered a key to productivity growth and development, the question remains whether their contribution could depend on the particular countries’ and industries’ actual development levels and positions in global value chains. In this paper we analyse the relative contribution of R&D to the efficiency (productivity) on the industry and sector level in OECD countries using industry-level panel data and the stochastic frontier production function approach. The results indicate that R&D capital productivity enhancing effect increases with the level of technology; physical capital shows the opposite effect. The distribution of efficiency across industries shows remarkably different variances, reflecting different degrees of competition and the structure of value chains. Among different external factors, the share of labour with tertiary education at the national level showed a strong positive correlation with efficiency, while for other external factors the effect varied across the industries. The findings imply that in the design of R&D policy measures the structure of the industries needs to be considered.
O39|ICT and R&D as inputs or efficiency determinants? Analysing Italian manufacturing firms (2007–2009)|Abstract Are Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Research & Development (R&D) productive inputs or efficiency determinants? This is the topic of this paper, which analyses a sample of 2691 Italian manufacturing firms over the period 2007–2009. Data are from a merged EFIGE–AIDA dataset. The empirical setting is based on a production function estimated through the stochastic frontier approach. ICT and R&D are used once as inputs, once as efficiency determinants. The results show that the elasticities of production with respect to ICT and R&D investments are quite high (0.08 for ICT and 0.04 for R&D) when they enter into the model only as inputs. We also documented that ICT and R&D contribute positively to explain the efficiency scores.
O39|Knowledge generating features of intelligent textiles industry|The intelligent textiles industry uses the results of a wide range of scientific research fields which are multidisciplinary and cover the so called „key enabling technologies”. For the moment there are only a few countries generating and using this knowledge with impact on competitiveness, national development and creating high level paid jobs. The cultural differences among countries regarding the business approach and the ability to use certain knowledge bring more or less advantages for those countries. This paper covers two case studies, one about Elmarco from Liberec, Czech Republic, producing nanofiber and the other one about GreenYarn from Boston, Massachusetts, producing advanced materials. Both examples are using nanotechnology, one of the key enabling technologies.
O39|The Collaborative Poles Network And The Development Of An Efficient Entrepreneurial Ecosystem|The experience of the past decades has shown that the key features that foster innovation and entrepreneurship are: a dense concentration of human talent, a competitive spirit, easy access to capital, and a supportive environment. It also notes that, to some extent, these can be replicated in and adapted to a wide variety of contexts, even in countries and regions with economies, politics and cultures sharply divergent from the Silicon Valley California generic model. In all these cases, innovative business accelerators are functional and located in areas with critical masses of talent and competitive spirit. In this theoretical paper we show that a network accelerator could be a solution for fostering innovation and entrepreneurship in less developed regions and for attracting further venture-capital investors. This work has been supported by SNF and UEFISCDI within the Romanian-Swiss Joint Research Project IZERZ0 142306 / 1.

O39|Innovación social abierta en el diseño de una política y estrategia de formalización sostenible: un caso colombiano de gobierno colaborativo|Resumen Se presenta este caso de estudio sobre el proyecto de investigación-acción que buscó aportar en la construcción de vías para la solución a la problemática de la informalidad empresarial y laboral en Colombia (2011-2013). Este proyecto utilizó como objeto de estudio la observación y reflexión en el propósito de comprender los determinantes para el éxito o fracaso de un esfuerzo colaborativo, cuando se persiguen objetivos sociales retadores (innovaciones sociales) desde un ámbito mixto (gobierno y sector privado). El proyecto fue desarrollado por el Grupo de Investigación en Economía Evolucionista e Institucional de la Universidad Nacional de Colombia, financiado por Colciencias en alianza con la Cámara de Comercio de Bucaramanga. Se encontró que la capacidad de un equipo interinstitucional para producir resultados que tengan un impacto importante en la sociedad (lograr innovaciones sociales) se construye a partir de la fortaleza de redes interinstitucionales que permiten inferir la emergencia de una nueva metainstitución con la legitimidad, recursos, conocimiento y alineamiento estratégico suficiente para una apropiada armonización de esfuerzos dentro de cada institución.
O39|Consideraciones sobre la valoración tecnológica en la base de la pirámide|"Resumen El concepto de ""Base de la Pirámide"" se refiere a gran parte de la población mundial de más escasos recursos y a las opciones para atender sus necesidades. Este artículo de reflexión tiene el objetivo de analizar un aspecto de la gestión tecnológica en la base de la pirámide: la valoración tecnológica orientada a los productores locales, en su mayoría pequeñas y medianas empresas - Pymes. Tomando en cuenta las características de las tecnologías que prevalecen en estas empresas, así como las escasas capacidades de innovación, como resultado de este artículo se plantean algunas consideraciones sobre la denominada valoración tecnológica ampliada, que no se limita a determinar el valor económico de un activo tecnológico, sino que toma en cuenta aspectos intangibles como las capacidades tecnológicas, los procesos de aprendizaje y la acumulación tecnológica que pueden seguir dichas empresas para lograr innovaciones y mayor desarrollo en tecnología, en aras de disminuir las brechas frente a los países industrializados."
O39|Índice de desempeño innovador en los subsectores industriales colombianos entre 1996 y 2005|Resumen En diferentes países se han calculado índices a partir de encuestas de innovación bajo especificaciones planteadas desde el Manual de Oslo de la OCDE. No obstante, las características de la información existente en las realizadas en Colombia en los años 1996 y 2005 no permiten la comparabilidad directa de las variables. Esto llevó a proponer un nuevo índice de desempeño innovador de la industria basado en la metodología del índice de valor de importancia relativizado, utilizado en otros ámbitos como las clasificaciones etnobotánicas. Esta metodología, permite visualizar el fenómeno en los dos momentos de las encuestas realizadas en Colombia y se revela como una herramienta para relacionarlas. Se encontró que el desempeño innovador industrial en el año 1996 fue caracterizado principalmente por la innovación de mercado y organizacional, mientras que en 2005, su principal característica fue la innovación potencial.
O39|Emprendedorismo tecnológico y género en la Argentina: factores determinantes en la percepción de auto-eficacia emprendedora|Resumen Este artículo es continuación de la línea de trabajo desarrollada por las autoras acerca de la existencia de diferencias de género en la relación entre tres variables centrales del emprendedorismo: auto-eficacia emprendedora, inteligencia emocional y satisfacción vital. El objetivo del presente trabajo es establecer si las variables psico-sociales (inteligencia emocional y satisfacción vital) influyen en las dimensiones que conforman la auto-eficacia emprendedora de los hombres y las mujeres argentinos en el sector de las TIC. Se realizó una investigación exploratorio-descriptiva y transversal, con una muestra de 329 emprendedores, utilizando encuestas on-line. Los datos obtenidos fueron procesados y sometidos a análisis de regresión, surgiendo notables diferencias entre hombres y mujeres, especialmente en la variable satisfacción vital. Particularmente, en el caso de los hombres se observa que la inteligencia emocional es determinante para desarrollar nuevos productos y oportunidades de mercado, mientras que la inteligencia emocional y la satisfacción vital influyen en el resto de las dimensiones (gestión de recursos humanos, nuevas relaciones con inversores, creación de entornos innovadores y trabajo bajo estrés). Estos hallazgos difieren en el caso de las mujeres, donde se aprecia que sólo la inteligencia emocional influye en la totalidad de las dimensiones que conforman la auto-eficacia emprendedora.
O39|Sistema para la evaluación de capacidades de innovación en pymes de países en desarrollo: caso Panamá|Resumen El objetivo de la investigación ha sido generar un sistema de evaluación de capacidades de innovación aplicable a pequeñas y medianas empresas (PYMES), de tal manera que se pueda conocer a fondo las capacidades de innovación en una organización permitiendo identificar falencias y requerimientos fundamentales para su éxito. La literatura converge hacia una doble dimensión al estudiar la innovación: como sistema y como proceso; donde las consideraciones contextuales son fundamentales. Para generar el sistema se investigaron enfoques, modelos, herramientas y pautas metodológicas de innovación. Se analizaron las características de procesos desde el punto de vista los países en desarrollo (PED), se compararon funciones de gestión de innovación y se establecieron interrelaciones entre funciones y variables del sistema. Como resultado se determinaron cinco capacidades endógenas requeridas para innovar y sus correspondientes categorías de análisis, así como dos nuevos elementos diferenciadores de procesos de innovación en PED: los focos de procesos de aprendizaje (FPA) y los focos de innovaciones incrementales (FII). Los resultados han sido aplicados en cuatro casos de PYMES en Panamá, concluyendo que la evaluación de capacidades permite situar a las organizaciones en diferentes niveles, compararlas e identificar falencias y posibles hojas de ruta para impulsar procesos de innovación.
O39|Estimating the changes in the distribution of energy efficiency in the U.S. automobile assembly industry|This paper describes the EPA's voluntary ENERGY STAR program and the results of the automobile manufacturing industry's efforts to advance energy management as measured by the updated ENERGY STAR Energy Performance Indicator (EPI). A stochastic single-factor input frontier estimation using the gamma error distribution is applied to separately estimate the distribution of the electricity and fossil fuel efficiency of assembly plants using data from 2003 to 2005 and then compared to model results from a prior analysis conducted for the 1997–2000 time period. This comparison provides an assessment of how the industry has changed over time. The frontier analysis shows a modest improvement (reduction) in “best practice” for electricity use and a larger one for fossil fuels. This is accompanied by a large reduction in the variance of fossil fuel efficiency distribution. The results provide evidence of a shift in the frontier, in addition to some “catching up” of poor performing plants over time.
O39|Spill or leak? Carbon leakage with international technology spillovers: A CGE analysis|This paper studies the effect of endogenous technical change and international technology spillovers on carbon leakage. It is well known that a unilateral CO2 abatement policy in one region may cause CO2 emissions to increase in non-abating regions because of the relocation of CO2-intensive firms and because of energy market effects. If, however, the CO2 mitigation policy induces energy-saving technological innovation in the home region and this innovation can freely spill-over to energy users abroad, carbon leakage may be offset by induced efficiency gains in foreign firms. In this paper we develop a simple mathematical model of carbon leakage and technological spillovers and perform numerical simulations with an adjusted CGE model to illustrate the potential importance of international technology spillovers. We show that carbon leakage can become negative at moderate levels of technology spillover.
O39|Light Duty Vehicle Battery Costs|Comparing the costs of batteries can be confusing and/or problematic. This article aims to clarify some of the issues that have led to confusion when discussing both the present and the future cost of batteries. The specification of a ‘break-through price’ of batteries in terms of dollars per kilowatt-hour (kWh) will need to allow for a variety of factors. This includes the type of vehicle that is envisioned to compete with traditional combustion passenger vehicles and the battery capacity of the battery pack that matches the dollar per kilowatt-hour price. As the IEA has provided an average approximation of the ‘Internal Combustion Engine Parity Target’ for both PHEV and EDV batteries, it is difficult to compare this target to the estimates discussed within this article and within Longden (2014).
O39|SWINNO: A Database of Swedish Innovations, 1970-2007|This paper introduces a new database of Swedish innovations, SWINNO, in manufacturing and some services such as software. Innovation data are collected with the Literature Based Innovation Output method (LBIO) by use of trade journals and technical magazines and cover the period 1970-2007. Each innovation is described by more than fifty parameters making possible a detailed analysis from several aspects. The innovations captured in SWINNO are significant innovations, not minor or incremental, and the total number over the so far covered period is above 4000. The highest number of Swedish innovations were commercialized around 1980. The paper discusses the representativity and validity of SWINNO and assesses the LBIO method in comparison with other indicators of innovation. Some LBIO databases have previously been constructed but comparable with SWINNO is presently only the Finnish database SFINNO.
O39|Quality Management As Essential Tool For Competitiveness Of Metal Mechanical Branch State Southeast Coahuila La Gestion De Calidad Como Herramienta Esencial Para La Competitividad De Las Empresas De La Rama Metal Mecanica Del Sureste Del Estado De Coahuila|MSMEs provide a number of advantages that make them important to the economy of MÃ©xico, but also suffer from internal and external factors that limit their competitiveness. One of these internal factor, which is controllable by the company, is quality management. The objective of this research is to identify and analyze factors that influence the quality management of enterprises mechanical metal, one of the main economic activities for the automotive cluster, from the southeast region of the State of Coahuila, MÃ©xico. To achieve this, we designed a measuring instrument with Likert scaling, semantic differential and dichotomic questions. The instrument considers variables of corporate governance or strategic behavior, competitiveness, technology, innovation and quality. The survey was applied to 30 managers or owners of micro and small enterprises. The research is exploratory, descriptive, nonexperimental and the temporality of the collection of the study data is transactional or transversal. The main hypothesis raised is that innovation, quality and enterprise management, limit metalmechanic MSMEs for providing of large companies in the automaker cluster in Coahuila. Some results show that in terms of product quality as a success factor, 55% of entrepreneurs said it is essential, 39% said extremely important and 6% reported regulating importance. One of the main discoveries of the study is that only 23% are certified in quality processes, 29% said they are not certified, but being in the process and 48% reported not having quality certification, or being in the process. Regarding innovation in the process, 72% said carry out and 28% did not. In product innovation 80% said practice and 20% did not, while in management innovation respondents reported 58% exercise. Employers believe that quality management is essential and unavoidable to achieve competitiveness. So there is an excellent opportunity to promote models of quality assurance and innovation for enterprise management.
O39|Analysis Of Regional Innovation Capacity: Baja California Case, Analisis De La Capacidad De Innovacion Regional: Caso Baja California|Scientific development and innovation are factors that provide competitiveness to countries and regions. This study defines the region of Baja California as a peripheral region based on the characterization and analysis of their innovation capabilities as variables. We consider patent applications, foreign direct investment, university and research centers, the companies involved in research and development activities, gross domestic product and employment. To assess the importance of the variables, a correlational study is performed using data from the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (IMPI), the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), and the Secretariat of Economy (SE). The empirical results indicate the state is a region where innovation is more than a process of learning and adaptation of new technologies in production processes.
O39|Value added trade and structure of high-technology exports in China|This study focuses on the technological intensity of China's exports. It first introduces the method of decomposing gross exports by using the Asian international input–output tables. The empirical results indicate that the technological intensity of Chinese exports has been significantly overestimated due to its high dependency on import content, especially in high-technology exports, an area highly dominated by the electronic and electrical equipment sector. Furthermore, a significant portion of value added embodied in China's high-technology exports comes from services and high-technology manufacturers in neighboring economies, such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.
O39|Linguistic justice in IP policies: evaluating the fairness of the language regime of the European Patent Office|Alternative intellectual property laws relating to the use of languages in IP organisations can result in an asymmetric distribution of costs of patenting between innovators. We present a framework for the characterisation and evaluation of the fairness of the language regime of the European Patent Office (EPO), which is currently based on three official languages: English, French and German. We estimate that the costs of access to patenting procedures borne by English-, French- or German-speaking applicants are at least 30 % lower than those borne by European applicants whose first language is not one of the current official languages of the EPO. In order to correct language-related cost asymmetries, we explore two possible alternative language regimes. In both cases, we introduce a centralised system of financial compensation that covers translation costs borne by European applicants whose first language is not one of the official languages of the EPO. In the first alternative, financial compensation is covered by savings on current translation costs at the granting stage. In the second alternative, the number of official languages is increased to five and financial compensation is funded by an increase in filing fee and by partial savings on translation costs at the granting stage. We show that both alternatives could substantially reduce language-related costs asymmetries among European applicants. In addition, we show that the five-language alternative would reduce the global costs of access to patenting procedures borne by all European applicants. Thus, more multilingualism can be cheaper than less multilingualism, provided that “implicit costs” are taken into account. We conclude discussing under which conditions the alternative language regimes proposed could have a positive impact on the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of the EPO language regime.

O39|Directed technological change, skill complementarities and sectoral productivity growth: evidence from industrialized countries during the new economy|Recent growth accounting exercises attribute strong productivity growth to increased investments in information and communication technologies (ICT) over the last decades, but abstain from potential complementarity effects with other inputs. Based on three different sets of industrialized countries, this study shows that sectoral productivity growth originated from ICT-skill complementarities and skill-biased technological change (SBTC) during the New Economy. In particular, Scandinavian goods-producing sectors and Anglo–Saxon market services reveal strong SBTC effects that originated from ICT-skill complementarities, while such effects were totally missing in Continental market services during the same periods. Further drivers of productivity growth were intermediate and non-ICT capital deepening. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
O39|‘A jack of all trades’: the role of PIs in the establishment and management of collaborative networks in scientific knowledge commercialisation|The commercialisation of scientific knowledge has become a primary objective for universities worldwide. Collaborative research projects are viewed as the key to achieving this objective, however, the role of Principal Investigators (PIs) within these complex multi-stakeholder research projects remains under researched. This paper explores how networks in the scientific knowledge collaboration process are initiated and maintained from a multi-stakeholder perspective. It is based on case study evidence from 82 stakeholders in 17 research collaboration projects in Irish and German universities, which provides for a holistic view of the process, as opposed to prior research which has tended to report findings based on the analysis of one or two stakeholders. It finds that PIs play a lead role in establishing and managing stakeholder networks. This finding is unanimous for all stakeholders, irrespective of research centre size, type and geographical location. Not unlike the entrepreneur, the PI has to be ‘a jack of all trades’, taking on the roles of project manager, negotiator, resource acquirer as well as, the traditional academic role of Ph.D. supervision and mentoring. The findings suggest that PIs are better placed than Technology Transfer Office managers to act as boundary spanners in bridging the gap between science and industry.

O39|The Significance of Research and Development for Economic Growth: The Case of Pakistan|This paper concentrates on the significance of Research and Development (R&D) for economic growth in the developing economy of Pakistan. The paper also questioned the major macro determinants of R&D in Pakistan. The study used time series data for the period 1971- 2008. The results obtained from the Ordinary Squares method showed that R&D significantly affects the Real GDP per capita in Pakistan. Health, labour force , and Physical capital are among the other determinants of Real GDP per capita. The results further show that real GDP per capita and quality of educational institutions are the significant factors which affect R&D. The Johansen Cointegration test confirmed the existence of long run relationship between R&D and economic growth. Similarly, R&D and its determinants were also found in long run relationship.It is therefore recommended to increase investment in R&D to achieve sustained economic growth. It is also recommended to collect and record quality R&D data for effective policy making in the field of science and technology, and social sectors in Pakistan.
O39|ICT and R&D as inputs or efficiency determinants? Analysing the manufacturing Italian firms over the 2007-2009|Are Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Research & Development (R&D) inputs or efficiency determinants? This is the topic of the paper which is developed by analysing a sample of 2691 Italian manufacturing firms over the period 2007-2009. The empirical setting is based on a production function estimated through the Stochastic Frontier (SF) approach. ICT and R&D are used once as inputs, once as efficiency determinants (Coelli et al., 1999). Results show that the rates of return of ICT and R&D investments are high (0.08 for ICT and 0.04 for R&D) when they enter into the model only as inputs. We also documented that ICT and R&D contribute positively to explain the efficiency scores.
O39|ICT Standardization and use of ICT standards: a firm level analysis|Standards perform some fundamental economic functions and their relevance for ICT is acknowledged by firms, researchers and policy-makers. This paper investigates the driving forces of formal ICT standards setting (i.e. standardization). Previous quantitative studies have neglected that ICT standards use and engagement in ICT standardization are related activities. Leveraging upon a unique module of the ICT usage survey 2013 for Luxembourg, the analysis explicitly takes into account the use of formal ICT standards on a large representative sample of firm. While previous analyses find that larger firms are more likely to participate in standardization, the results of the analysis suggest that size has a complex pattern. Small firms for whom ICT standards are particularly relevant could overcome the barriers that prevent other firms to benefit from standardization. Additionally, the paper investigates the relationship between the professional use of social network and ICT standards and standardization. The use of social networks is positively correlated with the adoption of ICT standards but not with the participation.
O39|Project-based Funding and Novelty in University Research – Findings from Finland and the UK|Abstract While societal expectations for university research have grown, university research has become more and more dependent on external funding sources. External funding has substantially increased at Finnish – and also UK – universities, and currently in practice a major share of university research is conducted with external funding. This report relates the main findings of a study that analysed the use of project-based research funding instruments at universities, most of which are external. The main focus in the study is on the aspects of novelty and creativity in research and the question of the extent to which different research funding instruments promote these aspects of research. This report draws on different data sources, but mostly on the UNI project (Universities, funding systems, and the renewal of the industrial knowledge base), funded by Tekes innovation research instrument. The major findings include an observation that Finnish research funding system lacks a funder that would strongly encourage risk-taking and novel approaches. Discontinuity and instability of research funding appears as a major challenge for research. There seems to be an overall increase of thematically predefined funding vis-à-vis free researcher-driven funding and close attention should be paid to this balance. Differences between Finland and the UK in terms of novelty generation turned out to be smaller than originally expected.
O39|Universities, Funding Systems, and the Renewal of the Industrial Knowledge Base – UNI Project Findings|Abstract An important prerequisite for the renewal of Finland’s industrial and economic base is the ability of the universities to promote the renewal of the knowledge base. The UNI project studied ways in which changes in external funding mechanisms and recent governance changes in Finnish universities have changed the framework conditions influencing innovativeness and innovation in university research. Innovation here refers to novel approaches and potentially, breakthrough research, requiring risk-taking. The UK provided a comparative perspective for the study. This report reprints four separate policy briefs and reports that the UNI project has produced and provides an overall concluding chapter for them. A major conclusion of the study is that, so far, there has not been much impact from the recent policy changes on intellectual innovation in research in Finland. University governance influences research content very indirectly and is mediated by multiple other factors, meaning that policy changes are not, at least in the short run, translated into changed research content. As far as research funding organisations are concerned, Finland has not had a funding organisation that encourages risk-taking and intellectual innovation in research. Recent policy changes have not fundamentally altered this situation. In the UK, the established practice of performance measurement of universities seems to narrow notions of appropriate research content and standards of performance and is becoming an ominous factor in reducing variety and risk-taking in university research. This phenomenon is further developed in the UK, but Finland seems now to be ‘catching up’. In industry-university collaboration short-term commissions and most of Tekes’ industrial collaboration support draw on existing knowledge and know-how and are not intended to promote highly innovative and high-risk activities. More flexible and longer-term contracts can in principle promote such research activities provided that the knowledge they produce will be in the public arena since scientific breakthroughs, to bear fruit, require a great deal of further development and wide adoption of the novel concepts, methods etc. by the scientific community.
O39|Satisfaction With The Selection Of An Erp System. Experts Opinions For Sme|In the big global markets, the business requirements for small and medium-sized companies (SME) are changing rapidly. With the fast international growth of even very small companies, their need for a professional IT and ERP system support is higher than ever. A study of the Center for Enterprise Research of the University of Potsdam analysed 1300 SME companies and stated that about 70% of the companies are planning to invest in an ERP System implementation or are in the middle of implementation. A trend towards a decline of the significance of an ERP System specifically for SME is not noticeable (cf. Gronau, 2012). There are significant trends where SME companies and ERP providers will have to work on the next 5-10 years. Firstly, due to the high internationalization specifically of German SME companies, the ERP provider needs to invest in very specific industry solutions which can be integrated. In addition, the core functionality and processes have to improve even more. Secondly, technology and IT architecture are gaining importance. Finally, ERP has to provide mobile solutions in the years to come. The study claims that the current need is under 50% but increasing. Similar to cloud computing where currently the companies are still hesitant on the one hand, but dependent on the technological details, more and more companies are interested in new solutions (cf. Gronau, 2013).On the bases of the experience with business Case Studies, a Questionnaire has been developed and executed with over 60 business experts. All experts had years of experience in the field of ERP selection and implementation in the German and Austrian market. The main hypothesis that there is a relation between the satisfaction with an ERP system and the execution of the selection process could be confirmed along a set of criteria like budget constraints and time pressure. In summary; there is hardly a structured selection process and satisfaction with the ERP system is not measured but all involved people have an opinion based on ?gut feel?.
O39|Micro, Small And Medium Enterprises And Social Networks In Tourism Industry In Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico|Nowadays, the use of social media has become an important tool to introduce new products and services in the world. However, in some countries social networks are very important to show what the company is and what they are doing with their businesses, it means that they sharing everything with their customers, like products, services, goals, some cases they try to educate their public about the use of the product or service, among other things.When people started using social networks on the internet, these were conceived as a mean to communicate with relatives or friends. However, with time, the social networks have evolved to a point that they now allow people to use them to generate sales and increase the competitiveness of enterprises.The purpose of this research is to demonstrate the lack of training and knowledge about the use of social networks by local businesses and the barriers they face when they decide to use them as sales platforms, and to demonstrate the impact it could have on their businesses. Four SMEs located in Colima State in Mexico were studied, selected to be sufficiently successful and representative in terms of industry and size, for theoretical generalization purposes. These tourism SMEs stem from various sectors, such as: travel agencies, tour operator, hotel and restaurant. Data were collected through semi-structured tape-recorded interviews, ranging approximately one hour and a half each, with the owner-manager or the manager responsible for social media. Interview transcripts were then coded and analyzed following Miles and Huberman?s (1994) prescriptions with the assistance of the Atlas.ti application.The results allow us to conclude that the investigated companies believe that the use of social networks is extremely important to be able to compete in the market. However, due to a lack of training, they were not able to implement properly the utilization of social networks in their companies.
O39|A Model of Social Interactivity through Internet-based Technologies: Implications for Marketing Communications|The emergence and the rapid adoption of social media in recent years have led to the political, economic and social changes. The recent political upheavals in several countries from the Middle East, Eastern Europe to Southeast Asia have sparked an interest for the participants to use internet-based technologies for instantaneous communications among themselves. News, rumors and various messages can spread swiftly without frontiers and obstruction from the opponents. The new communications technologies themselves cannot be censored or limited any longer. Facebook, twitters, instagrams, you tube, blogs etc. have been effective tools to link the messages among the participants. This up-to-date information can be beneficial to understand what happens in social interactivity using social media. Moreover, in an anonymous environment of the Internet, participants speak out more loudly than ever before. Instead of focusing on the interactions between the company and its customers, this study intends to explore significant factors in the society which leads to social interactivity in the Internet-based technologies. The model will help us learn more about the processes of how the Internet-based technologies function in the society and will be applied for the marketing activities using the social media. The implications for integrated marketing communications would help us understand more deeply how the social interactivity can be applied for the brand building and relationships among communications participants.
O39|Agent-Based E-Commerce and its Contribution to Economy|Today the importance of e-commerce increases in line with the rise in the number of internet users. The complexity and the excess of information in internet make the use of semantic web in e-commerce mandatory. In practice, semantic web uses agents for economic income. Agents are integrated into e-commerce systems such as B2C (Business to Consumer) and B2B (Business to Business). So, agents enable the exchange between customers and sellers and allow shopping transaction. Multi-agent systems are generally used in agent-based e-commerce systems. Negotiation and auction gained importance in these multi-agent systems. There are some differences between B2B and B2C agent systems. These differences can be exemplified by some systems such as MIT?s KASBAH or E-bay?s AuctionBot. With these systems, buyers can purchase with the minimum prices and sellers can reach more costumers without advertisement. In this paper, the benefits and challenges of agent based e-commerce is investigated and the contribution of the use of agents in B2B (Business to Business) e-commerce systems to the economy is examined.

O39|Productivity Spillovers from FDI in the People's Republic of China: A Nuanced View|Using panel data from the Chinese Industrial Surveys of Medium-sized and Large Firms for 2000–2006, we show that the presence and the magnitude of technological spillovers from FDI in the People's Republic of China are affected by the source of FDI, by the ownership type of a firm in consideration, as well as by industrial and provincial characteristics. Private firms are more likely to benefit from horizontal spillovers than other domestic firms, but are less likely to benefit from vertical ones. Presence of state-owned firms in the industry impedes technological spillovers in a way that is consistent with diversion of linkages from private to state-owned firms. Finally, horizontal spillovers are larger in industries that are more technologically sophisticated. © 2013 Asian Development Bank and Asian Development Bank Institute.
O39|The Role of Conferences on the Pathway to Academic Impact: Evidence from a Natural Experiment|This paper provides evidence for the role of conferences in generating visibility for academic work, using a 'natural experiment': the last-minute cancellation - due to 'Hurricane Isaac' - of the 2012 American Political Science Association (APSA) Annual Meeting. We assembled a dataset containing outcomes of 15,624 articles scheduled to be presented between 2009 and 2012 at the APSA meetings or at a comparator annual conference (that of the Midwest Political Science Association). Our estimates are quantified in difference-in-differences analyses: First using the comparator meetings as a control, then exploiting heterogeneity in a measure of session attendance, within the APSA meetings. We observe significant 'conference effects': on average, articles gain 17-26 downloads in the 15 months after being presented in a conference. The effects are larger for papers authored by scholars affiliated to lower tier universities and scholars in the early stages of their career. Our findings are robust to several tests.

O39|Leadership-driven innovation & evolution of societies|The fundamental problem in the field of the economics of innovation is which economic subjects are the sources of radical innovations and high technological performances. The study here confronts this problem by developing a theoretical framework underpinned in the concept of purposeful system having a purpose of global leadership, which endeavours to analyse the sources of General-Purpose Technologies GPTs in a Schumpeterian world of innovation-based competition. Through an inductive study based on some societies that in the history have generated technological and economic change Roman and Britain Empire, and current USA, the analysis shows vital characteristics that can be the sources of changes in the techno-economic paradigm. In particular, purposeful country-systems with high economic military potential, supported by a strategy of high RD expenditures, and the objective of global leadership, winning international conflicts against other great powers a very strong competition for the hegemony, tend to generate several inventions and radical innovations that are spread, in the long run, across wide geo-economic areas. It seems that the initial sources of GPTs e.g. aqueduct, steam engine, jet aircraft, computer, etc. are, de facto, associated with the global posture of great powers to achieve/sustain global leadership in intensive effective and/or potential international competitions, rather than warfare per se. This study refers to this nexus as leadership-driven innovation. International conflict is the context that spurs the GPTs, which are driven by global leadership of critical societies, whereas initial military RD, demand and procurement are important mechanisms underlying the process that induces emerging path-breaking technologies. The vital linkages between observed facts can support a general socio-economic framework of the sources of path-breaking innovations based on a leadership of main economic subjects that support innovative activity mainly in communications and energy systems parallel to transportation technology and the evolution and development of human societies.

O39|L’innovazione a livello regionale. Tecnologia, istituzioni ed imprenditorialità nel cluster svedese delle life sciences|L’idea centrale di questo articolo verte sul fatto che anche se viviamo in un mondo fortemente globalizzato, la dimensione geografica locale ricopre un ruolo preponderante. Sono le attività legate all’innovazione, in modo particolare, a dimostrare una tendenza all’agglomerazione geografica. Il fatto di essere localizzate nella stessa area geografica, infatti, consente alle aziende di beneficiare di numerosi vantaggi, favorendo la nascita di sinergie tali da garantire loro grandi vantaggi competitivi rispetto alla concorrenza. L’intero ecosistema che fa da sfondo alle singole aziende ricopre un ruolo fondamentale. La crescita economica delle aziende è strettamente legata alla presenza di istituzioni che si adoperano in modo attivo e concreto nello sviluppo di un ambiente che faciliti l’innovazione e la cooperazione tra le parti. Il presente articolo, pertanto, va ad analizzare le istituzioni svedesi che garantiscono alle aziende del cluster delle life sciences di Stoccolma-Uppsala la possibilità di investire in nuove tecnologie, innovare, e mantenere una posizione dominante nel settore.
O39|Medicine of the Future: Opportunities for Breakthrough through the Prism of Technology Foresight|Many countries consider healthcare a priority area of development. Its future milestones lie in two key dimensions: social — combating common and complex diseases, and economic — establishing S&T basis that will provide leadership, or at least a decent niche in the global markets. The paper provides the results of a study conducted by the HSE in cooperation with the member organizations of technology platform “Medicine of the Future”. It supposes and empirically tests the feasibility of matching challenges and responses aimed at selecting the priorities of S&T development. The study identified underlying trends and S&T areas that will shape the medium and long term prospects of medicine, as well as backlogs allowing gaining strong global market positions. The possible technology responses for the most significant healthcare challenges for Russia are identified, and a priority research agenda is proposed. The authors conclude that Russia lacks breakthrough S&T capacities in the majority of promising medical areas. Meanwhile, domestic advances in some fields still offer the chance for a breakthrough and gaining solid positions on global markets as well as for integration in the value chain. Time to catch up with these opportunities however is running out: most of them are estimated to be available only for the next 5-7 years, so urgent actions are required. These results have been widely discussed in the framework of a range of communication platforms, including that of expert groups preparing the draft state-run programme «Development of Science and Technology for the period up to 2020», and working committees of the technology platform «Medicine of the Future», which are presented at Russian and international conferences.

O39|Innovation Development Programmes for the State-owned Companies: First Results|Enhancing innovation performance in the industrial sector of the Russian economy is a long overdue. Since 2010 the government has conducted a kind of «incumbent» policy approach, encouraging mainly the largest state-owned companies. The latter are obliged to elaborate and implement innovation development programmes (IDPs) in order to accelerate modernization of the Russian economy and increase demand for innovation. This paper analyzes the results of the monitoring of STI activities undertaken by the state-owned companies in relation to implementation of innovative development programmes. It evaluates the interim results of government initiatives to foster innovation in the related business segment, notes the negative effects of excessive «compulsion» to innovate and provides recommendations for improving policy. Monitoring shows that the actual priority for most companies is modernization of fixed assets through acquisition of modern machinery and equipment. Technology adoption, along with R&D investments, significantly surpasses other possible mechanisms encouraging innovative development (including support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), education and training in innovation, co-operation with other actors in the framework of technology platforms, venture funding). The innovation outputs of the surveyed group of companies are in fact comparable to the Russian average although monitoring does not allow the assessment of corporate patent strategies or the novelty of innovative products that are produced and exported. The author argues that the fundamental policy effect through organizational changes and investments may manifest itself in the next decade. However, the quality of the corporate management, employee loyalty to structural change and organisational culture that supports innovation, would likely be more important in enhancing overall performance. Policy recommendations include: differentiation of government incentives according to the companies’ specificities, development of their external linkages with SMEs and universities, linking innovation strategies to corporate policies, and integration of IDPs into the roadmaps of technological development of Russian regions and markets.

O39|X-Events as Determinants of the Sixth Kondratieff Wave|Many experts believe that our civilization is on the verge of shifting to a new long-term economic cycle — the sixth Kondratieff wave. Increasing diffusion and convergence of ICT, bio- and nanotechnologies, movements favoring «green» technologies and business models and holistic health, among others, are typically viewed as drivers of the new wave. The majority of futurists tend to look favorably upon these supposed trends, ways of resolving major challenges facing mankind. Others, including the author of this paper, argue that there are risks related to the development of new technologies, as well as factors of natural and social origin, which may impede the implementation of rosy scenarios. Implied is a reference to so-called «extreme events» (X-events) — hardly predictable, often unexpected short-term phenomena, whose intervention reverses the current trend in an opposite direction and may cause huge destructive effects. Their occurrence is pre-determined by a set of matured contextual prerequisites (primarily the complexity gap between governing system and addressed challenges, as well as changing social mood) and the random factor playing a role of a catalyst. Using the complexity theory, the author evaluates the ability of a number of extreme factors to disrupt the abovementioned megatrends driving the sixth Kondratieff wave. Events and processes, such as global climate change, epidemics, famine, collapse of the Internet, and enslavement of human artificial intelligence, may produce scenarios that are totally different from those projected by most experts. However, as shown in the paper, the ability to predict and diligently consider the possible X-events followed by adoption of appropriate measures may allow the prevention or at least diminution of the devastating impact of such events.

O39|Energy Singularity: From Scarcity to Abundance|The ability to extract and use energy played a decisive role in the development of human civilization. Energy consumption is growing exponentially, thus the only way to avoid future energy crisis is to explore renewable, more abundant sources. It is known that some technology fields, particularly information and communication technologies, develop according to the “accelerating acceleration” principle. This paper analyzes the applicability of this pattern to energy production and consumption. It assumes that the development of advanced storage technologies and “smart” power distribution will lead to the creation of “global energy network” (Enernet). With the Enernet, energy and power will become abundant and basically free, just like information and bandwidth are today thanks to the Internet. This creates the prerequisites for coming “energy singularity” (“energularity”), which could happen in the next century – in result the humanity will gain full control over all energy available on the planet, and will reach a new level of development (type I according to the Kardashev scale). “Energularity” is similar in some ways to the concepts of the “technological singularity” (intelligence explosion) and “methuselarity” (annual longevity extension for more than one year). Achieving “energularity” seems fundamental to improving the global quality of life and to exploring the universe. Note: Downloadable document is in Russian.
O39|Future of Russia: Macroeconomic Scenarios in the Global Context|The recent global crisis has “devalued” many pre-crisis forecasts and strategies, including those in Russia. This fostered the redesigning of science, technology and innovation (STI) policy frameworks to adjust the scope and priorities of STI funding and to elaborate a new set of long-term strategic planning documents, in particular, to revise the Russian Long-Term S&T Foresight. Since S&T and broader socio-economic processes are closely interrelated, the new macroeconomic forecasting is a key building block for updating Russian Long-Term S&T Foresight; it is carried out by the Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting (CMASF). The article presents interim results, namely, a set of possible scenarios of global development and their projections for Russia. The scenarios at the global level are determined by the pace and nature of the economic recovery worldwide, as well as by the opportunities and consequences of technological breakthroughs in the energy sector, which is expected to have the largest impact on development of the world economy. The energy sector transformation is encouraged by new technological solutions, and these can translate into large-scale market transformation with huge economic effect. The content of scenarios at the national level depends on the adaptation of the economy to the changing context of the world markets. Adaptation, in turn, determines the patterns of managing resource rents and foreign investment, as well as positioning in growing markets. The “inflation technological breakthrough” scenario presupposes the availability of abundant savings worldwide, whose targeted investment could result in the next technological breakthrough. It will help integrate Russia into global production chains. If the “boom” on financial markets does result in technological breakthrough, however, the world will be subjected to high inflation, and the high oil prices will spark the development of non-traditional hydrocarbon fuels (“energy inflation” scenario). There are two options for Russia in this case, each of which has its pros and cons. The first presumes recapitalizing traditional assets. The second relies on building competitive advantage through the development of public-private partnerships, attracting direct portfolio investment, updating scale production and reforming institutions. Finally, if a recovery from the global crisis is protracted, the best “recipe” is “creative destruction” — eliminating the outdated and inefficient industries while creating opportunities for the development of more advantageous companies that will provide a qualitatively new basis for growth.

The extent to which managers succeed to reduce the resistance to change from the part of the affected employees contributes greatly to the achievement of the targeted objectives that follow a change process. This paper aims to present a number of forces located both inside and outside the organization, forces that through their manner of expression may exert a direct influence on the increase or decrease of the oppositionâ€(tm)s intensity of those affected by the change. The identification and analysis of these forces give to the involved managers in coordinating changes the possibility to reduce efficiently and effectively employees resistance to change.
O39|The influence of science and technology park characteristics on firms' innovation results|The effectiveness of Science and Technology Parks (STPs) as instruments of innovation policy has generated thriving debate among academics, practitioners and policy makers. A gap in the existing literature on STPs is that research mostly does not consider STPs' heterogeneity. The present paper aims at filling this gap, analysing the influence of different STP characteristics on their tenants' performance. Using data on 849 firms and 25 STPs from the 2009 Community Innovation Survey for Spain and a survey of STP managers respectively and after controlling for a wide set of firms characteristics, we find that: (i) firms located in very new or longer established STPs show better innovative performance; (ii) the size of the STP and its management company positively affects the innovative performance of tenants while services provision has no effect on firms' achieving better results; and (iii) firms in less technologically developed regions benefit more from location in an STP. Theoretical, policy and managerial contributions of our research are discussed in the paper. La eficacia de los Parques Científicos y Tecnológicos (PCyT) como instrumentos políticos de innovación ha generado un debate floreciente entre académicos, profesionales y responsables políticos. Un vacío en la literatura existente sobre los PCyT es que la mayoría de las investigaciones no consideran la heterogeneidad de los PCyT. El objetivo del presente artículo es llenar este vacío, mediante el análisis de la influencia de las diferentes características de los PCyT en el rendimiento de sus inquilinos. Mediante el uso de datos de 849 empresas y 25 PCyT de la Encuesta de la Comunidad sobre la Innovación de 2009 para España y una encuesta a los gerentes de PCyT, respectivamente, y después de controlar un amplio conjunto de características de las empresas, se encontró que: (i) las empresas ubicadas en PCyT muy nuevos o bastante establecidos muestran un mejor rendimiento en innovación; (ii) el tamaño del PCyT y la compañía que lo gestiona afecta positivamente al rendimiento en innovación de los inquilinos, mientras que la provisión de servicios no tiene ningún efecto en que las empresas logren mejores resultados; y (iii) las empresas en regiones menos desarrolladas tecnológicamente se benefician más de la ubicación en un PCyT. En el documento se discuten las contribuciones teóricas, políticas y de gestión de nuestra investigación. イノベーション政策の実行手段としてのサイエンス&テクノロジーパーク(Science and Technology Park:STP)の有効性については、研究者、政策実行者、政策立案者の間で盛んに議論がなされてきた。STPに関する既存研究の欠点は、STPの異質性がほとんど考慮されていないことである。本稿では、STPの様々な特性がテナント企業の実績に及ぼす影響を分析して、この欠点を補うことを目指す。2009年のスペインのコミュニティ・イノベーション調査(Community Innovation Survey)から得られた849社の企業データとSTPの経営者の調査から得られた25のSTPに関するデータを使用して分析を行い、広範な企業の特性で補正すると以下のことが分かる。1)設立から間もないSPT、または長く成功しているSPT内に立地する企業は、イノベーション・パフォーマンスがより優れている。2)SPTの規模とそのSPTの経営会社はテナント企業のイノベーション・パフォーマンスに正の影響を及ぼすが、サービスの提供は企業がより優れた実績を収めることには何の影響も与えていない。3)技術的発展が遅れている地域の企業は、STP内に立地することからより多くの恩恵を受ける。理論的、政策的、経営的な面での本研究の貢献について考察する。
O39|Creative Destruction with On-the-Job Search|This paper studies the consequences of creative destruction on unemployment in a frictional labor market with on-the-job search. For a benchmark calibration, a 1% increase in growth raises the unemployment rate by 1.72 percentage points in the economy without on-the-job search and by only 0.07 percentage points with on-the-job search. Rather than contributing to unemployment through more frequent job separations, in the presence of on-the-job search, creative destruction induces a direct reallocation of workers from low to high productivity jobs.

O39|Knowledge Transfer and the ‘Academic Enterprise’ in the Algarve: Contributions from Social Studies of Science and Technology to the Understanding of University-Firm Relations|University’s everyday life is today transformed in an encompassing domain where diferente types of actors are connected and interrelated. Nevertheless, academic science often feels threatened by the new emerging paradigm characterized by knowledge transfer and the economic exploitation of public research results. This paradigm relates to what can be defined as the ‘academic enterprise’, the creation of spin-offs, applied research contracts and licensing of industrial property rights of the university. This article explores university-firm relations and tensions, discussing the increased relevance of knowledge transfer. The ideas of Ludwik Fleck, intellectual precursor of Social Studies of Science and Technology, contribute to the understanding of the difficulties of communication between different collectives, their styles of thought and the relevance of ‘marginal individuals’ in connecting diferente institutional spheres. Based on a qualitative approach to the case study of the University of Algarve (Portugal) and its attempts to create bridges with the business world, the texto illustrates differences between collectives of thought in the ‘academic science’ and the firm, the recent institutionalization of commercialization of research, and findings for policymaking and management of knowledge transfer activities.
O39|In-house R&D and External Knowledge Acquisition What Makes Chinese Firms Productive?|This paper analyses the influence of in-house R&D and external knowledge acquisition on the total factor productivity (TFP) of listed Chinese firms for the time period 2001-2010. We find a quantitatively important positive effect of in-house R&D. The achieved level of technological sophistication of Chinese firms is sufficient to benefit from R&D collaboration with domestic partners. We do not find a significant effect for employing inventors with access to international knowledge or for collaborating with international partners. International knowledge acquisition is only effective if conducted via joint ventures, i.e. if it is supported by a deep organizational relationship.
O39|Exploration of the Future - a Key to Sustainable Development|Throughout the history people were fascinated and curious about the future. The future was, and still is seen as a key for prosperous development in all aspects of the society. As such, new discipline is developed - future studies. This paper discusses the discipline of future studies and its role in the society and science. Future studies are analyzed in the context of sustainable development. It is argued that future studies and sustainable development are complementary in nature. Based on analysis of most developed countries in the world, that spend the greatest portion of their budget on research, development and science in comparison to the rest of the world, there is a conclusive link between investments in research, development and science, and the recognition of the importance of thinking about the future. Those countries started to formalize their future orientation in many respected research centres and universities through their educational programs and research. That situation poses the need for other, less well off countries, to follow up.

We are integratinga dynamic interaction between each component of this model which had been tried by usingICT and a new crucial component in the model which is informational innovation.
O39|Management And Analysis Of European Project Proposals In The Framework Programme 7|From the good practices of European project proposers comes the necessity to approach project writing for The Framework Programme. The common errors made by consortia that submitted project proposals within the FP7-2008-ENV-1 call are analysed in this paper. The analysis was made on more than 400 Evaluation Summary Reports, for every evaluation criterion, according to both the participant’s and evaluator’s guide. The result of the current analysis was used to draft the pre-screening tool intended for the National Contact Points (NCP), in order to support coordinators that submitted project proposals in subsequent calls approached on theme 6 – Environment, including climate change, of the Framework Programme 7.

O39|Aproximación no tradicional a los flujos internacionales de conocimiento colombiano|En este estudio se pretende establecer si, dadas las condiciones de investigación y apropiación de conocimiento en Colombia, el país presenta dinámicas de captura (atracción, retención, importación) o de fuga (expulsión, exportación) de conocimiento, mediante el análisis de dos variables: colaboración internacional en artículos académicos indexados en Scopus (1940-mayo de 2011), y el país de origen de las revistas que difunden los trabajos colombianos indexados en Scopus (2000-mayo de 2011). Se corrobora la hipótesis de que a pesar de las deficientes condiciones de creación de nuevo conocimiento y de la baja apropiación de la ciencia, Colombia no es un importador neto (captura) de conocimiento y en algunos casos presenta exportaciones netas (expulsión, fuga), asociadas con la limitada capacidad de retención de conocimiento en el territorio.
O39|Inter-technology knowledge spillovers for energy technologies|Both anecdotal evidence and the innovation literature indicate that important advances in energy technology have made use of knowledge originating in other technological areas. This study uses the set of U.S. patents granted from 1976 to 2006 to assess the role of knowledge acquired from outside each energy patent's technological classification. It identifies the effect of external knowledge on the forward citation frequency of energy patents. The results support the claim above. Regression coefficients on citations to external prior art are positive and significant. Further, the effect of external citations is significantly larger than that of other types of citations. Conversely, citations to prior art that is technologically near have a negative effect on forward citation frequency. These results are robust across several alternative specifications and definitions of whether each flow of knowledge is external. Important energy patents have drawn heavily from external prior art categorized as chemical, electronics, and electrical; they cite very little prior art from computers, communications, and medical inventions.
O39|Scope and patterns of innovation cooperation in Spanish service enterprises|Examining 2148 innovating service firms from the Spanish Technological Innovation Panel 2004, this paper utilizes Latent Class Analysis to appraise the scope of innovation cooperation in services in the Spanish economy, in accordance with the growing weight of external information flows throughout innovation processes. The empirical evidence indicates that the nature of the service activity affects both the partner chosen and the cooperation intensity. The results lead to the creation of a typology of cooperation composed of three broad profiles: service firms intensive in techno-scientific cooperation, intensive in interactions with clients and a profile with low intensity in cooperation, called lonely innovators. The probability that a firm belongs to the latter profile is 59%, which makes it reasonable to affirm that innovation cooperation is not a common practice in Spanish innovating service enterprises. Innovation output variables have been included in order to examine the relationship between patterns of cooperation and innovation performance. The findings also underline the co-existence of different cooperation patterns within the same industry.
O39|Introducción: Variedad de temas y de tratamientos sobre la Innovación| [ES] Este artículo de introducción al número especial sobre innovación de la revista Cuadernos de Gestión consta de dos apartados bien diferenciados. En el primero, se recogen algunas ideas que pueden ser útiles para los lectores que se aproximan al tema de la innovación y observan una gran variedad conceptual. En concreto, se ha tratado de explicar de una manera más o menos exhaustiva el concepto de Open Innovation (OI). La OI surge del reconocimiento de que la empresa no puede innovar de manera aislada, y, por lo tanto, necesita siempre adquirir las ideas y los recursos del entorno exterior.
O39|Innovación y Política Tecnológica: el caso del Sector Transformador y el Sector Servicios a Empresas| [ES] Este trabajo analiza algunos de los determinantes de la innovación de producto en el caso de los emprendedores del sector transformador y del sector servicios a empresas. Entre estos factores se encuentran el capital humano, la tecnología, el grado de competencia del mercado, las expectativas y el grado de internacionalización de las iniciativas emprendedoras de estos dos sectores. Asimismo, se analiza cómo las medidas de política tecnológica pueden o no ser eficientes.
O39|Mapping Futures Studies|In recent decades Foresight and other forward-looking activities (FLA) gained ground as a tool of science, technology and innovation (STI) policy. The number of FLA studies is globally rising. To some extent, foresight is governed by context-depended issues; however there are also common features in the objectives, methodology, and recommendations made. Mapping allows codifying and analyzing a bulk of FLA experiences gained worldwide. This in turn will contribute to enhancing performance of such activities and therefore of STI policy as a whole. The paper provides rationales for Futures Studies mapping, considers related opportunities and challenges, reviews lessons learned from early mapping efforts. It focuses on the large-scale EU-funded mapping project “European Foresight Platform” (EFP). Using this project as illustration, the paper describes mapping routines, the selected indicators of mapped Foresight initiatives, including their objectives, participants, target groups, methodologies, outcomes and recommendations. It discusses the potential and the limitations of particular mapping tools as well as possible applications of gained knowledge. Basing on mapping results, policy-makers, for example, are able to identify gaps to be addressed with relevant policy tools. Mapping also allows Foresight practitioners to develop strategies for further research and shape expert networks for their implementation. Note: Downloadable document is in Russian.
O39|The Influence of Leadership on Academic Scientists' Propensity to Commercialize Research Findings|Previous studies of organizations have highlighted that leadership and organizational performance have a strong and long-term impact on employee behavior in private firms. In this study, we analyze whether similar effects can also be observed in academia by examining the commercialization behavior of academic scientists. The empirical analysis is based on panel data of commercialization for the period of 1980 - 2004 within the Max Planck Society, a leading research organization in Europe. The results suggest that director engagement in disclosure activity and the amount of royalties received lead to a significant increase in invention disclosure the following year. However, we do not find the same results when modeling longer time lags. Thus, academic scientists mimic successful behavior, while leadership behavior does not have long-lasting effects on commercialization behavior within the institute. We conclude that existing organizational theories need to be modified for academic organizations.
O39|Conjoint analysis of R&D contract agreements for industry-funded university research|Since the late nineteenth century, universities have been regarded as useful sources of technological development to stimulate economic activity. Therefore, many governments have encouraged research collaborations between universities and industries. A consequence of such collaboration in Korea, however, is that university researchers have difficulty claiming ownership of their technological developments. Typical contracts used in academia in Korea have biased benefits for industries. Research and development contract agreements that decrease negotiation efforts between the sectors of academia and industry are essential to increase the efficiency of industry-academia collaborations. In order to determine an optimal contract design, we use conjoint analysis of four attributes, including policies of ownership and compensation, indemnity responsibility, patent application and maintenance fees, and publication restrictions. The resulting preferences take into account the perspectives of both industry and academia. We expect our approach to contribute to increasingly healthy collaborations between industry and academia, which in turn will benefit industrial competition as well as the Korean economy.

O39|Technologies for Freedom: Una visión de la tecnología para el desarrollo humano /Technologies for Freedom: A Technological Approach to Human Development|La tecnología, pese a ser una valiosa herramienta para el desarrollo, no es el único factor que asegura el éxito de una intervención. En este trabajo se presenta una visión de los proyectos tecnológicos que tiene en cuenta los principios del Desarrollo Humano y se centra en ampliar las opciones de los individuos: el enfoque Technologies for Freedom. Tras testar el enfoque en 4 proyectos de cooperación en Perú y analizar los resultados, se concluye que los proyectos tecnológicos son un medio para ampliar las opciones de las personas, pero también para reforzar su habilidad para provocar cambios que valoran. Technology, despite being very important, is not the only factor that ensures the success of an intervention. This paper presents a technological approach that takes into account the principles of human development and focus on expanding the real choices that people enjoy: the Technologies for Freedom approach. After testing the approach in 4 cooperation projects in Peru and analyzing the results, we conclude that technology projects are a means to expand people's choices, but also to enhance their ability to make changes happens.
O39|Adaptation and Innovation: An Analysis of Crop Biotechnology Patent Data|Innovation in technologies that promote mitigation and adaptation will be critical for tackling climate change. It can decrease the costs of policy measures and provide new opportunities for the private sector. However, most discussions of innovation have focused on mitigation, while little attention has been paid to innovation for adaptation. This paper uses agricultural crop biotechnology as a case study of innovative activity. The agricultural sector is considered to be particularly vulnerable to climate change, in addition to facing the pressures of meeting the demands of a rising world population. Innovation in plant breeding to develop crop varieties that are more resilient to climate change impacts is one of several possible adaptation options for agriculture. This paper neither advocates nor discourages the use of biotechnology, but focuses on providing estimates of the level and trends of innovation in this field.
O39|The Intellectual Capital Statement in Knowledge-based Organizations: The practitioners’ and Academics’ Answer for Reporting the IC|Currently, one cannot dissociate the idea of economic entity of its capital. Whatever form it takes, this constituent element of wealth is seen as the basis of business, whether in the form of financial capital (equity and debt), economic capital (capital employed) or intellectual capital (knowledge, skills, relationships, intellectual property, social attitude). The increasingly ample orientation of the companies towards the intellectual capital is based on the rediscovery of this resource with (almost) unlimited potential, generating economic benefits for a company. Given its importance, the information needs of stakeholders on this line have increased. Thus, in this context, it was put the issue of reporting information related to intellectual capital and the transparency of information published by companies, given that its reporting is not currently regulated
O39|Learning-by-Doing and Its Implications for Economic Growth and International Trade|This paper extends the learning-by-doing model of Alwyn Young (1991), which assumes bounded learning-by-doing in each industry and knowledge spillovers, from two perspectives. First, it introduces physical capital as another factor of production in addition to labor. Second, it takes into account capital accumulation and population growth. This extended model is then used to study the dynamic effects of learning-by-doing in both autarky and two-country free trade situations. The main findings are: 1. Learning-by-doing is the source of sustainable growth in the long-run; 2. In both autarky and free trade situations, an increase in population growth rate or saving rate expedites both the growth rate of Real GDP per capita and technical progress in the long-run; 3. Compared with the autarky situation, under free trade the LDC experiences slower growth rate of per-capita output and slower technical progress, while the situation in DC is just the opposite. In addition, the effects of free trade on intertemporal welfare as well as the implications of a change in population growth rate or saving rate are also discussed based on the conclusions in Young (1991).
O39|Dulling the Cutting Edge: How Patent-Related Policies and Practices Hamper Innovation in China|This study’s statistical analysis shows that patent quality and innovation in China deserve improvement, and an in-depth legal, management science, and economic analysis in the study shows that various patent-related policies and practices actually hamper patent quality and innovation in China. Over 50 recommendations for reform are provided. The study is divided into four chapters, summaries of which are as follows: Chapter 1: Although China became the world leader in quantity of domestically filed patent applications in 2011, the quality of these patents needs improvement. Also, while certain innovation in China is rising, the country’s actual innovation appears overhyped by some sources. Chapter 2: There appears to be an overly heavy focus on government-set quantitative patent targets in China, which can hamper patent quality and innovation. This overemphasis involves over 10 national-level and over 150 municipal/provincial quantitative patent targets, mostly to be met by 2015, which are also linked to performance evaluations for SoEs, Party officials and government ministries, universities and research institutes, and other entities. Chapter 3: China has a wide-range of other policies, many of which are at least partially meant to encourage patents, that can actually discourage quality patents, and highest-quality patents in particular, and innovation. Examples of these policies include a variety of measures with requirements for “indigenous intellectual property rights” that are linked to financial incentives (many of which are unrelated to government procurement); a range of other government-provided financial incentives for patent development (e.g. certain patent filing subsidies); inappropriate inventor remuneration rules; discriminatory standardisation approaches; and a wide range of others. Chapter 4: There are a host of concerns surrounding rules and procedures for patent application review and those for enforcement of patent disputes that can hamper building of quality patents and innovation in China. These include concerns about abuse of patent rights, difficulties invalidating utility models, and a wide range of other issues.
O39|A statistical analysis of China's patent quality situation and larger innovation ecosystem|While patent filings in China have been exploding in recent years, analysis based on a variety of metrics shows that this increase has not necessarily translated into a ‘proportionate’ rise in patent quality. Further, based on projections quantifying “highest quality” patents in China, there is reason for concern that in the near future the country’s patent ecosystem may be less composed of highest-quality patents than some policymakers envisaged. In terms of its innovation capacity at large, metrics suggest that China indeed has a growingly impressive innovation potential, although its actual innovation output at present appears overhyped by some sources.
O39|A Panel Causality Analysis of the Relationship among Research and Development, Innovation, and Economic Growth in High-Income OECD Countries|This study examines possible causal relations among research and development (R&D) expenditures, innovation and economic growth in high income OECD countries. We test for both pairwise and multivariate causal relations by estimating a trivariate panel vector autoregressive (VAR) model through the GMM and panel fixed effects methods. Our bivariate panel causality test results suggest that R&D expenditures Granger cause innovation measured as the number of triadic patents; while technological innovations Granger cause economic growth, as presumed by endogenous growth theory. A reverse causality relation does also exist between economic growth and innovation, that is, the rate of growth of output accelerates the rate of technological change. Our multivariate causality tests further reveal that the market size and the rate of innovation together Granger cause R&D activity; while an increase in national output and R&D intensity jointly Granger-cause technological change. These findings suggest that both the “technology-push” and “demand-pull” models of innovation equally make sense. Copyright Eurasia Business and Economics Society 2012
O39|OUTSOURCING OF R&D AND INNOVATION ACTIVITIES IN SMEs: EVIDENCE FROM SLOVENIA|This paper examines the outsourcing of research and development and of innovation activities in small and medium-sized companies (SMEs). As the results of these activities enable companies to achieve and sustain competitive advantage, it is crucial to manage them properly. As SMEs generally lack internal resources to perform R&D and innovation activities internally, is the outsourcing of these activities a viable solution for them? This paper examines the basic characteristics of outsourcing R&D and innovation activities in SMEs, based on a survey among Slovenian companies in the manufacturing and service industries. We tested five hypotheses. Empirical results show that one third of SMEs outsource R&D and innovation activities in different forms, and that small companies outsource these activities more often. The biggest share of SMEs partially outsources R&D and innovation activities, followed by SMEs that outsource all those activities, and by SMEs that perform R&D and innovate in co-operation with other firms. When comparing the type of R&D and innovation activities that are outsourced, the results show that SMEs mainly outsource experimental development, followed by basic research and applied research. However, they mostly outsource R&D and innovation activities to universities and independent research organisations and only occasionally to private organisations from industry and individual researchers.
O39|The interaction between the multiplier effect and the acceleration principle: An approximation for Colombia|This paper describes the use of the multiplier and the acceleration principle in the theories of economic growth and income determination. Estimates are obtained for the two approaches to show their applicability and predictive power. The different estimates for Colombia suggest that their applicability is more robust in the prediction of the rate of economic growth than in models of income determination.
O39|What determines the embeddedness of European regions in EU funded R&D networks? Evidence using graph theoretic approaches and spatial panel modeling techniques|In the recent past, regional, national and supranational Science, Innovation and Technology (STI) policies have emphasized supporting interactions and networks between organisations of the innovation system. The policy instrument of the EU in this context are the European Framework Programmes (FPs) that support pre-competitive R&D projects, creating a pan-European network of actors performing joint R&D. In this study, we focus on the embeddedness of European regions in this network. By embeddedness we refer to the notion of centrality in the sense of the Social Network Analysis (SNA) literature. In network theory, vertices that have a more prominent and central network position will more likely benefit from network advantages than actors that have a more distant, peripheral position in the network. A higher network embeddedness of a region, i.e. of organisations located in that region, may increase information and knowledge access in the network, and, thus, create a competitive advantage when it comes to the formation of new collaborations and alliances. The objective of the study is to explain why some regions are able to obtain a better network embeddedness in the European network of R&D cooperation than other regions. For this reason we aim to identify determinants that influence a regionÂ´s embededdness, involving region-internal factors, such as regional characteristics on their innovation capability, their economic structure and technological specialisation, as well as region-external factors considering the influence of these variables in the neighbourhood of a specific region, referred to as spatial spillovers. To address this question we employ spatial panel modelling techniques, explicitly taking into account the time dimension in our data and the influence of spillovers by specifying a panel spatial durbin error model (SDEM). The dependent variable is the regionsâ€™ centrality in the FP network for the years 1998-2006, using a sample of 241 NUTS-regions of the EU-25 member states. We aggregate individual FP cooperations to the regional level leading to a network where the nodes are represented by regions and the edges by cross-region collaboration intensities. Using these matrices we calculate a regionâ€™s centrality relying on two different centrality concepts, namely betweeness- and eigenvector centrality. The independent variables involve regional characteristics related to a regionâ€™s knowledge production capacity and a regionâ€™s general economic structure. The results will significantly enrich our understanding of the relationship between a regions network embededdness and its internal and external characteristics.

O39|Bridging Firmâ€™s Innovation, Productivity and Export: An Analysis using Swedish CIS data|This paper analyses the effect of innovation on the well-established productivity-export association in the literature. Here, we argue that actively innovative firms have a higher productivity, which make them more likely to become exporters. Moreover, exporting firms learn from their trading experiences and accumulate the necessary knowledge in order to innovate further, which may facilitate future productivity. We use the micro-data from two waves of Swedish Community Innovation Survey (CIS) to provide empirical evidences to test our argument concerning this interrelation between innovation, productivity, and export. The main finding is that firms which become innovative are more likely to also become an exporter, especially when they do not have prior export experiences.

O39|The Optimal Duration of Equity Joint Ventures|Whilst joint ventures offer a potentially attractive form of corporate and industrial organisation, they also experience high rate of break-up within ten years from their initial formation. In this paper, we model this process not as an uncertain random event, but rather as the predictable outcome of underlying economic variables, with break-up within a finite time resulting even under conditions of complete certainty. Given the prevalence of joint venture break-ups, it is in the interests of both partners in an equity joint venture to be fully aware of their own optimal durations of the joint venture in their initial negotiations for the formation of the equity joint venture. Where the underlying economic parameters imply differences in their individual optimal durations of the joint venture, there is therefore scope for mutually beneficial agreements on a binding date for the break-up of the joint venture, and for side payments to enable this binding agreement to be reached, either as cash payments or in terms of their relative shareholdings in the jointly-owned separate company that will manage the equity joint venture. In addition, there is scope for a differential corporate tax rate on the joint venture, compared to that on the go-it-alone businesses of the two partners, in order bring the two partners’ privately optimal durations into line with the socially optimal duration of the joint venture.
O39|Wissensbasis und regionale Agglomeration: Zwei Pharmacluster im Vergleich|Industrielle Cluster können sich entsprechend ihrer Einbettung in das regionale Innovationssystem unterschiedlich entwickeln – selbst wenn sie zur gleichen Branche gehören. Die pharmazeutische Industrie in Deutschland zeigt zum einen eine starke geografische Konzentration. Zum anderen war zuletzt eine gegenläufige regionale Entwicklung zu beobachten. Dies wird am Beispiel der Pharmacluster in Südhessen und Oberbayern gezeigt. Die Unterschiede resultieren unter anderem aus der regionenspezifischen Industriestruktur, in der die Pharmaunternehmen eingebettet sind. Außerdem weisen die beiden Bundesländer insgesamt Unterschiede in ihrer Wissensbasis auf. Dies muss bei industriepolitischen Maßnahmen beachtet werden.
O39|Patent and Licensing Strategies in Management of Industrial Companies|The nature and significance of corporate strategies are elucidated, where the patents for inventions are the main tools to meet the targets – growth, stabilization, corporate consolidation and survival. The patent and license strategies of the industries are classified according to various criteria. Charts are presented of two types of market situations of specialized markets (of technologies and production), involving patents and know-how.
O39|How do organisations manage to develop collaborative innovation? The case of the tactical strike and reconnaissance aircraft (TSR-2)|This article addresses the underlying capacities attached to collaborative approaches to innovation. Adopting a qualitative methodology from a historical case study, it examines how the first computerised Tactical Strike and Reconnaissance aircraft (TSR-2) had been developed in the early sixties by the British military industry. The study contributes to theory by indicating that the development of the TSR-2 aircraft required four dimensions to be managed and aligned, each reflecting a particular capacity (design, interaction, governance and culture) the organisation should hold so as to reap the full benefits of adopting collaborative approaches to innovation.

Así mismo, se muestran algunos de los desarrollos recientes en torno a la teoría del crecimiento económico que están orientados a solucionar el problema de inestabilidad derivado de la tasa de crecimiento garantizada. Por último, se deduce que el modelo de crecimiento de Harrod soporta la nueva teoría del crecimiento endógeno como lo muestran Hussein y Thirlwall (2000).

Se presenta una evaluación del impacto de los MDL, así como posibles obstáculos que impedirían las transferencias de tecnología.
O39|Time-Varying Occupational Contents: An Additional Link between Occupational Task Profiles and Individual Wages|By analyzing occupational task profiles, an occupational change can be split up into two components (1) transferability of task portfolios between occupations and (2) change in the value of the occupation-employee match. Extending the task-based approach of Gathmann and SchÃ¶nberg (2009) by relaxing their assumption of time-invariant occupational contents, I estimate the association of dynamic aspects of occupational task portfolios with individual wages for medium-skilled German workers in 1991 and 1998. Estimated wage returns to the components of an occupational change generally differ in short and long run, as well as in East and West Germany. Wage returns to the changes of task porfolios for the occupational stayers are estimated to be positive.
O39|Empowering Patients through ICT, Organisational Impact on Healthcare Systems in England and Scotland|This paper reports on the efforts carried out by England and Scotland to promote the widespread use of telehealthcare within Personal Health Systems (PHS) for patients with chronic conditions. In each setting, it explains the political drive, the trends in empowering patients, the needs for healthcare systems to treat chronic patients at home, the search for evidence supporting the case for telehealthcare, the reorganisation of services around these technologies and the need to coordinate and/or integrate different tiers of care in order to address the needs of patients suffering from chronic conditions. It details the achievements to-date and building on recent policy developments, it provides an overview on the likelihood of these services becoming a routine form of care. Following the two different approaches on telehealthcare in England and Scotland, it puts into perspective the need for adequate systemic governance and institutional reforms required to address the challenges associated to ICT implementations at organisational level and how the industry may be able to deliver solutions supporting them.

Over the past few years, Web 2.0 technologies have made a significant impact on internal and external information flow in banking organizations, changing their analogue nature into digital, through blogs, wikis, multimedia sharing and social networking sites.Key words: financial institutions, banking sector, Web 2.0, blogs, wikis, multimedia sharing, social networking, Web 2.0 applications/services.
O39|Opportunity To Reduce Resistance To Change In A Process Of Organizational Change|This paper aims to present the research results conducted on several models of organizational change regarding the identification of the appropriate moment in which the managers interest should turn towards the reduction of the employees resistance to change. More specifically, we intend to identify when is the best moment to reduce the resistance to change, depending on the change we want to achieve. After more research of organizational change models, we have reached the following conclusions: - not all models of organizational change present reducing resistance to change as a necessary stage; - the place of this phase in the models of organizational change is not considered to be the same; - some models of organizational change recommend indirectly reducing employee resistance to change by indicating the use of some methods, techniques, processes that would lead to this result. Here we include mainly: communication, training, positive motivation of employees; - we recommended that the place of this stage should vary depending on the desired change to achieve; - in strategic changes, which are extremely important for an organization and which affect a large number of employees, we recommend that the reduction of the employee resistance to change be achieved before passing to the implementation of the plan developed to implement the change; - in imposed changes, in conditions of crisis when we have no time available to plan the change, immediately after it had been implemented it is necessary to conduct effective actions meant to ensure, even if the change has been made, the reduction of the resistance to change of the affected employees - to achieve time savings in the process of organizational change, we recommend that after having obtained a certain attachment of some employees to change, the implementation of the methods, of the techniques that would increase their commitment to continue to be developed in parallel with the implementation of the change.
O39|Does a Rising Tide Lift All Boats? Welfare Consequences of Asymmetric Growth|A common presumption is that increased growth in the aggregate enhances the welfare of both the rich and the poor. I show that instead, as the rich get richer, the welfare of the poor may decline if the underlying growth is asymmetric. There are two distinct and complementary explanations: First, sector-biased, skill-biased technological change, and second, efficiency improvements in the government sector. In the first case, skill-biased technological change in sectors consumed by the skilled rich increases their income beyond the increase in economic wealth, causing a decline in the consumption and welfare of the low-skilled poor. This result stands in contrast to the standard model of skill-biased technological change. In the second case, growth takes the form of improved efficiency in a government sector that is financed by rich taxpayers. The welfare of the low-skilled poor will decline whenever the consumption bundle of the skilled rich embodies more skill intensity than does the production of government services. This analysis demonstrates that a rising tide need not lift all boats and that the exact nature of consumption patterns is important not only for growth and inequality, as has been emphasized in earlier literature, but also for welfare.
O39|Implementation of technological breakthroughs at sector level and the technology-bias|Different goods are produced by different sectors in an economy. The fact that sectors use different production technologies is named technology-bias. The technology-bias is well documented and has important theoretical implications for economic growth and unemployment. We provide a theoretical model that explains the technology-bias and predicts its development. We provide empirical evidence on the development of the technology-bias and explain this development by using our model-results. Last not least, we discuss the implications of our findings for the existing growth literature and structural change literature.
O39|Multiple futures for higher education in a multi-level structure|‘Futures’ (images of the future) are often devised at the level of a single university or at a national level for the overall higher education system. However, the bulk of trends and driving forces shaping universities’ future are international in their nature and universities operate in broader socio-economic and S&T systems. Hence, futures devised in a multi-level structure would better assist decision-makers and stakeholders. This approach is a demanding one in several respects, but offers significant advantages: (i) the potential changes in the social, economic and S&T systems, in which universities are embedded, as well as their impacts on higher education can be considered systematically; (ii) the substantial diversity of higher education systems and individual universities can be taken into account; and (iii) the likely impacts of various policy options can also be analysed.
O39|The sources of Iran's Business Cycles|A business cycle is, in fact, fluctuations of macroeconomic variables and gross domestic product. These fluctuations play a substantial role in any country. Prosperity and depression have been the most impressive problem in Iranian economy during the last decades so government and politicians have always sought a remedy for alleviating its negative effects like inflation and unemployment. This study analyses the underlying causes of Iranian business cycles using structural auto regression (SVAR) in the period between 1965-2009. The findings of this research show that business cycle in oil exporting countries is affected by changes in oil revenues. To identifying how oil shocks spread through different variables we use Bernanke and Sims (1997) technique, imposing a set of long-run economic restrictions that are added to purely statistical restrictions of VAR. In the end, the hypothesis of the thesis verifies that the effect of fiscal policy in generating business cycles is much more than monetary policy and technological shock. But, bear in mind that the effect of technology shock in Iranian economy, in general, could not be ignored.
O39|Broadband ranking of regions and its methodological basis|Access networks plays an essential role in some sectors of the economy. Its speed basically defines the utility of the system. In Hungary, in 2009 the average guaranteed download speed was just 1 Mbit/s, and a little more than the tenth part of subscribers had 4 Mbit/s or more data rate. For satisfaction the claims of today and immediate future needs broadband – capacity of at least 50 Mbit/s – infrastructure. To build of such infrastructure in those regions, which less attractive commercially for service providers, state intervention is necessary. The country and EU provide financial sources but is not enough to the necessary developments. Many ICT infrastructure developments has happened on many settlements in Hungary, but not always on the most suitable places. My aim is to rank regions based on the ICT development of them, because it is worthy to focus time and resources, where these will be return as quickly as possible. In my opinion the target of the developments would be worthy to select on the basis of usefulness. Complex regional indicator is necessary to this objective which can be applied on settlements level and on the basis of it these can be ranked. It is important to have regard to such social-economic factors which really correlate with existence of broadband networks. In this article I present the Hungarian regions situation in broadband network respect, and the methodological basis of to construction of a regional network indicator. I sketch scope of possible earmarkable elements – which are accessible statistical indicators in connection with broadband networks – and applicable model for it.
O39|L’Apprentissage des Collectifs de Travail Structuré par les TIC dans le Domaine des Services Informatiques|L’apprentissage collectif revêt un caractère stratégique dans un contexte où les TIC (technologies de l'information et de la communication) s'imposent et nous sont imposées. Leurs usages sont représentatifs de moments clefs dans le processus de diffusion des apprentissages, mais on leur reproche d'être impersonnels et de se limiter à des situations d'apprentissage individuel. Le nécessaire développement de l'action collective au sein des entreprises avec l'absence d'effets apparents de l'utilisation des TIC sur la performance de la firme vient renforcer cette impression. L’objectif de notre travail est d’essayer de comprendre les impacts des ressources (humaines et technologiques) en système d'information sur la performance organisationnelle ; en examinant le processus qui explicite comment ces ressources sont actionnées dans le management organisationnel. L'étude des résolutions collectives de problèmes professionnels cherche à comparer l'action collective dans des situations similaires et des situations différentes. Ces configurations productives replacent l'importance du relationnel dans l'organisationnel, signe du passage de la focalisation de leur management sur les tâches à une focalisation sur les personnes.
O39|The Role Of An Integrated E-Learning Platform In Increasing The Processmanagement Efficiency|This paper aims to present the steps taken and solutions implemented at the Cisco Networking Academy of the University of Bucharest in order to increase the process-management efficiency and the student satisfaction degree, mainly via the implementation of an own e-learning learning platform.The results are a significant improvement of work relationships, due to the fact that everyone's responsibilities are clearly defined together with the expectations for each employee. Furthermore, productivity tools enable us and our instructors to concentrate on increasing the quality of our students' learning experience in order to obtain even higher degrees of student satisfaction, retention, and promovability as a direct measure of teaching/learning success.
O39|Contemporary Appearance of Business Locations in Logistics System|Economic map of Europe radically changes its parameters and imposes new postulates in the development of national economies, which are integral part of the common European market. Bulgaria's ambition to attract traffic of material flows in areas outside the geographical scope of the union should stand on a serious basis, which includes the construction of the areas highlighted economic use, such as logistics, industrial, office and retail space. The purpose of this study is to make a theoretical overview of current economic use of land as a factor in achieving the objective of logistics system, and based on analysis of their status in Bulgaria to derive prospects for their development. In this context, core areas of logistics, industrial, commercial and office uses are defined in theoretical aspect. Analysis of their status in Bulgaria is conducted on the basis of empirical data and the opportunities for their development within the country are revealed.
O39|Protestants and Catholics: Similar Work Ethic, Different Social Ethic| This article develops two hypotheses about economically-relevant values of Christian believers, according to which Protestants should work more and more effectively, as in the 'work ethic' argument of Max Weber, or display a stronger 'social ethic' that would lead them to monitor each other's conduct, support political and legal institutions and hold more homogeneous values. Tests using current survey data confirm substantial partial correlations and possible different 'effects' in mutual social control, institutional performance and homogeneity of values but no difference in work ethics. Protestantism therefore seems conducive to capitalist economic development, not by the direct psychological route of the Weberian work ethic but rather by promoting an alternative social ethic that facilitates impersonal trade.

O39|Research cycles|This paper studies the dynamics of fundamental research. We develop a simple model where researchers allocate their effort between improving existing fields and inventing new ones. A key assumption is that scientists derive utility from recognition from other scientists. We show that the economy can be either in a regime where new fields are constantly invented, and then converges to a steady state, or in a cyclical regime where periods of innovation alternate with periods of exploitation. Our analysis provides a rigorous foundation to the Kuhnian theory of scientific evolution. We show that scientists' care for reputation has a strong impact on research dynamics and tends to favor innovation. Especially, innovation fads may emerge. We also study welfare and find that the academic reputational reward system can help align scientists' short-term incentives with society's long-term interests.

O39|Technological Capability Building in Informal Firms in the Agricultural Subsistence Sector In Tanzania: Assessing the Role of Gatsby Clubs|We use a case study approach to examine whether new knowledge and technological capabilities can be acquired by a set of informal firm operating in the agricultural subsistence sector in Tanzania as a result of interaction with the College of Engineering and Technology at the University of Dar es Salaam. We find that by becoming members of Gatsby Club, firms have been introduced to important new organisations which assisted in the process of new knowledge acquisition. Technological capabilities have mainly been improved but also acquired; mainly at basic level.
O39|State Research Institutions: Outlines of Future Reforms|Àpproximately one half of all Russian state owned institutions are created for implementation of managerial, social, cultural and other non-commercial functions. The most significant legal novelties for them are connected with the adoption of an amended Budgetary Code (2007) and singling out three types of state institutions – autonomous (2006), state and new type of budget-funded (2010). These new legal opportunities have broadened prospects for reforming state scientific institutions which comprise almost one third of the overall population of R&D units in Russia. Anti and post-crisis policies of the Russian government are focused on efficient use of budgetary allocations, restructuring and shrinking the network of budgetary-supported institutions, as well as on boosted economic modernization and transition to innovation-based economic growth. It makes the reform of state scientific institutions urgent. An article provides detailed analysis of resources and productivity of state R&D institutions in Russia and describes potential directions of their restructuring.

O39|The Knowledge Economy – a Chance for a Lasting Economical Growth After the Crisis|The financial and economic global system was changed due to the world economic financial crisis that affected most of the countries. Crisis is a process of transformation where the old system can no longer be maintained. Therefore, the cause of a crisis is the need for change. A solution for the actual financial crisis can be the knowledge economy. But knowledge has no resilience. If we fear for the security of the supply chains for food and energy, how much more should we be nervous about our knowledge? Not only is it floating free of any relationship with the real world, it is also stored on highly transient media. The research- development-innovation activity could bring a solution for the ending of the crisis and developing the knowledge economy that will save the economy.
O39|Effective Policies for Research Infrastructure: The role of foresight|The article discusses five policy challenges which call for a radical overhaul of the hitherto decision-making practices towards research infrastructures (RIs). It argues that foresight is a relevant policy tool to support these changes, by presenting major features of foresight. Then several policy issues concerning establishing and upgrading research infrastructures are discussed, which can be tackled by foresight, such as policy-co-ordination; use of existing RIs; future needs vs. existing RIs; human resources to operate RIs and exploit RI services. Finally, practical policy recommendations – stemming from the ForeIntegra project, on which this article draws on – are presented, addressing EU-level and national STI policy-makers.

O39|Intergenerational Partnership in Research and Development Activity|The emergence, spreading and dissemination of scientific knowledge currently surpasses the capacity of assimilation and processing by one individual, requiring multidisciplinary and multigenerational team research. The need of interaction and networking uptakes more and more in the management of research-development and innovation (RDI) due, on the one hand, to the growth of its complexity in the knowledge-based economy and, on the other hand, to the urgent need of researchers to come up with solutions for the pressing socio-economic issues. International experience proves that high individual professional quality is not enough for a successful research team. It requires collaboration, including an efficient intergenerational partnership acting in a working environment based on responsibilities, merit acknowledgement, risk-taking, kindness, support, good standards, conflict-avoidance (except for conflicts of ideas) as well as on the scientific identity of every researcher, irrespective of their age. Recognition of scientific and managerial complementarities of the research team members and reciprocal respect for personal values ensures the most efficient valorization of researchers potential within the team. The appreciation and recognition given to the collaborative work are important factors for creativity and success, given the positive relationship between these factors and the quality and quantity of the research output. The research and development (R&D) activity performance is greater when decisions, objectives and priorities are collectively established, since research activity is no more an individual effort, but a consequence of team work contribution. The paper presents the research results regarding the way in which the above mentioned aspects are reflected in R&D intergenerational partnership in Romania, revealing its typology and characteristics, the age structure trends of research teams, as well as the factors that stimulate or hinder cooperation between young researchers and the more experienced ones.
O39|Falling Kidnapping Rates and the Expansion of Mobile Phones in Colombia|This paper tries to explain why kidnapping has fallen so dramatically in Colombia during the period 2000-2008. The widely held belief is that the falling kidnapping rates can basically be explained as a consequence of the success of President Alvaro Uribe´s democratic security policy. Without providing conclusive alternative explanations, some academic papers have expressed doubts about Uribe´s security policy being the main cause of this phenomenon. While we consider the democratic security policy as constituting a necessary condition behind Colombia´s falling kidnapping rates, we argue in this paper that a complementary condition underlying this phenomenon has been the significant increase during this period in the speed and quality of communications between potential victims and public security forces. In this sense, the expansion of the mobile phone industry in Colombia implies that there has been a substantial reduction in information asymmetries between kidnappers and targeted citizens. This has led to a higher level of deterrence as well as to higher costs for perpetrating this type of crime. This has resulted in a virtuous circle: improved security allows higher investments in telecommunications around the country, which in turn lead to faster communications between citizens and security forces, which consequently leads to greater security. We introduce a Becker-Ehrlich type supply and demand model for kidnappings. Using regional and departmental data on kidnapping, the police and mobile phones, we show that mobile phone network expansion has expanded the effective coverage of public protection; this, in turn, has led to a spectacular reduction in kidnapping rates.
O39|Research governance in academia: are there alternatives to academic rankings?|Peer reviews and rankings today are the backbone of research governance, but recently came under scrutiny. They take explicitly or implicitly agency theory as a theoretical basis. The emerging psychological economics opens a new perspective. As scholarly research is a mainly curiosity driven endeavor, we include intrinsic motivation and supportive feedback by the peers as important determinants of scholarly behavior. We discuss whether a stronger emphasis on selection and socialization offers an alternative to the present regime of academic rankings.
O39|Methodological Issues and Models in 'History Friendly' Simulations|Simulation techniques have proliferated a lot in the last years. In economics the industrial dynamics approach makes use of simulation techniques to understand the complexity of the industrial process of continuous change. Among these models, a new branch of studies called “History-friendly” models aims at establishing a close link between formal theory, developing stand-alone theoretical simulation models, and empirical evidence, as it stems from a rigorous study of the economic environment under exam. The paper aims to give a methodological contribution to the “History-friendly” methodology. We discuss the flexibility of simulation techniques in representing complex environments. We analyse the relationship between empirical evidence and the implementation of the simulation model. We study “History-friendly” analyses and counterfactuals. A contribution to define the role of “History-friendly” models in the debate about empirical validation of simulations is given. Finally, some examples of “History-friendly” models are examined.
O39|Implementation of Funding for the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP): A Personal Recollection|"The SOEP success story was not conceivable at its inception. SOEP's institutionalization is therefore a lesson demonstrating that it is not always possible to say - as is so often required of research proposals today - how a project will develop before it has even begun, and what significance it may one day have. Or, even worse, to show ""how a research project will pay off""."
O39|Open Access Models and their Implications for the Players on the Scientific Publishing Market|Open Access (OA) as a new form of distributing scientific literature is broadly accepted by scholars; but in most disciplines the realization of the paradigm is progressing rather slowly. The reason for this lies; on the one hand; in a lack of incentives for individual authors. On the other hand; there are many different approaches to OA and their effects on market participants are complex. In this article we regard the implications of different OA models for scholars; publishers; libraries and funding organizations and try to explain the motivations behind the actions currently taking place on the scientific publishing market.
O39|On the Relation Between the Endogenous Growth Rate of the Economy and the Dynamics of Renewable Resources|"In this paper we study a simple endogenous growth model in which the two engines of growth are the exogenous technical progress in dematerialization and the accumulation of a renewable natural resource. The model is also labeled as been ""endogenous"" as the rate of growth of natural capital is endogenously determined and should lie between zero and the rate of technical progress. In this context, it is possible to combine permanent economic growth with permanent growth of the environmental asset. the endogenous rate of growth of the stock of natural resources is a positive function of the physical rate of regeneration (which will occur if consumption would be zero) and of the rate of technical progress. However, in order to assure sustainability, the former growth rate should be larger than zero but smaller than the later. Second, the output growth rate (which in our model is equal to the rate of consumption) should lie between the rate of technical progress and the sum of the rate of technical progress and the natural rate of regeneration. Therefore, even in the case in which the physical rate of renewal is mall, this will allow for unbounded growth. Third, in our simple model, there is no transitional dynamics."

O39|Is it possible to define a universal technology management discipline?|Considering the diversity of needs and concerns in developed and developing countries, the evolution of technology management (TM) discipline would be expected to follow different paths to include different national experiences and unique needs of these countries. Whether this diversity is reflected in the mainstream TM research agenda is an important issue. Thus, the aim of this study is in two folds; first, to examine how the general research agenda of TM discipline has evolved in the academic research in a developing country context, namely Turkey, and next, whether this research agenda has converged or diverged with the patterns of mainstream TM research in international journals, by analyzing the Turkish academics’s TM publications both in the national and international scientific journals. The findings reveal that the TM discipline in Turkey indicates both divergent and convergent characteristics when compared with the results of recent studies about developed and developing countries.
O39|Assessing the influence of R&D institutions by mapping international scientific networks: the case of INESC Porto|Although scientometric and bibliometric studies embrace a much wider perspective of the linkages/networks of R&D institutions than standard economic studies, to the best of our knowledge, these studies have not yet made use of scientometric tools to analyse the influence and impact of R&D institutions. Moreover, the international perspective has so far been neglected both in standard and bibliometric studies. Based on networks of 1239 foreign co-authorships and 13035 foreign citation linkages, we demonstrate that INESC Porto international influence has considerably expanded since 2003, a year that coincided with the implementation of an internal policy of granting monetary prizes to publications in scientific international journals. In terms of co-authorship, the network of INESC Porto more than duplicated (13 countries in the initial period to 27 in 2004-07). In terms of citations, INESC Porto’s network encompassed almost 40 countries during the whole period (1996-2007). Its more prolific units (optoelectronics, energy and multimedia) presented a rather distinct pattern both in terms of size and evolution of the corresponding network boundaries. The network size of foreign co-authorships was not much different between the three units by the beginning of the 2000s (around 10 countries) but it evolved quite distinctly. The most remarkable pattern was registered by the multimedia (UTM) unit, whose network size rose exponentially to 21 countries in 2004-07. This contrasted with the decline (down to 8 countries) of the energy (USE) unit. The citation network of the optoelectronic unit (UOSE) was by far the largest, until 2003, involving 34 distinct countries, which contrasted with the size of USE (12 countries) and UTM (1 country). But again, after 2003, the size of the citation network of USE and UTM converged spectacularly to that of UOSE’s, reaching in the last period 21 and 16, respectively. The influence of INESC Porto reaches all five continents, especially when we consider citation networks. Indeed, excluding the citations from authors affiliated in Portuguese institutions, those that most cite INESC Porto’s (and UOSE’s) works are affiliated in institutions located in China, the UK and the US. The scientific works produced by USE influences mostly authors affiliated in institutions located in India, China and Spain, whereas for UTM the corresponding countries are the US, Germany and Italy. We infer from the evidence analysed that not only did the boundaries of INESC Porto’s scientific network substantially enlarge in the period of analysis (1996-2007) but its ‘quality’ also evidenced a positive evolution, with authors affiliated in institutions located in the scientific frontier countries citing works of INESC Porto (and its units).

O39|Determinants of the international influence of a R&D organisation: a bibliometric approach|Traditionally, studies on the influence and impact of knowledge-producing organisations have been addressed by means of strict economic analysis, stressing their economic impact to a local, regional or national extent. In the present study, an alternative methodology is put forward in order to evaluate the international scientific impact and influence of a knowledge-producing and -diffusing institution. We introduce a new methodology, based on scientometric and bibliometric tools, which complement traditional assessments by considering the influence of a R&D institution when looking at the scientific production undertaken and the recognition of its relevance by its international peer community. Focusing on the most prolific scientific areas of INESC Porto, and resorting to published scientific work recorded in the Science Citation Index (SCI), we show that INESC Porto has enlarged its international scientific network. The logit estimations demonstrate that the wide geographical influence of INESC Porto scientific research is a result not of its international positioning in terms of co-authorships, but rather a result of the quality of its scientific output.

(Revised Version of ""The Impact of Healthcare Expenditures on Longevity in Japan: Evidence from Longitudinal, Prefectural-Level Data"" [No. 13])"|Considering health status as the output of health care, health care expenditures can extend life expectancy. We examine the impact of health care expenditures per capita on life expectancy using Japanese prefectural datasets over the past 30 years. We clarify that (1) decreasing medical resources indeed reduce health care expenditures and (2) inpatient health care expenditures have a significant positive impact on longevity. Decreasing health care expenditures could also decrease the health performance in Japan.

To incorporate new business models into existing company structure is not easy. The paper deals with principles of e-commerce preparation and introduction in a company. Due to crosscutting impacts of e-commerce deployment a careful analysis based also on value chains leading to business application patterns is recommended. From the actual architecture point of view, an e-commerce portal as general interface between company ERP system and external environment seems to be the best solution. Proposed architecture is illustrated by an example of e-commerce portal connection to Microsoft Dynamics NAV system in a real company.
O39|E-business Environment in the Global Information Society|In today´s digital 21st century, almost all businesses face intense competition from competitors all around the globe. There are no borders and business area for the all companies is almost unlimited. As the main supports of mentioned fact are globalization and ICT´s development. Influences such as globalization, increased popularity of outsourcing and offshoring have recently combined to produce an environment where ICT graduates need to have up-to-date and industry-relevant knowledge and skills, so that they can be successful in this highly competitive environment. Development of e-business and e-commerce make possible the companies to enter to the global markets. Fundamental prerequisite of the successful company in the global market is well-made corporate strategy and correct source information. Of high account condition of an entry to global markets is an adjustment of the information system to global information and business system management standards. The statistics gained from the Czech market shows, that in spite of enormous Internet proliferation the ratio of e-sales is lower than the ratio of e-purchases. Some possible reasons for these phenomena are discussed at the end of this paper.
O39|Identifikace, měření a analýza poruch E-Commerce systémů<BR>[Identification, Measurement and Analysis of the E-Commerce System Disturbances]|Contemporary economic development in following global markets advancement evokes needs to look for new methods supporting all processes enabling domestic and foreign business activities. Internet and e-commerce systems exploitation is considered to be a standard here. Various modeling techniques can be used to increase effectiveness of e-commerce systems. E-commerce systems can be modeled in a number of ways. Primary model describes an e-commerce system as a web server linked by company information system. Theoretical conclusions and especially practical experiences show that each component of an e-commerce system can be influenced by quite a number of disturbances affecting its functionality, efficiency and stability. There are many processes on Internet, on web servers, in ERP and company running an e-commerce system which can be influenced by disturbances mentioned above. In order to minimize their impact it is necessary to identify and collect all disturbances, to determine their evaluation metric and to propose necessary remedies. Modifications proposed should be tested by means of modeling taking internal and external environment needs into consideration. Necessary information can be captured using the e-commerce system components monitoring. Particular system environment properties like company structure, system architecture, hardware, software, methods of connection with the supplier´s e-commerce system, customer communication interface are to be taken into account. Important social indicators like legislative and economic development, development of the global information society and others should also be considered. Disturbance and failure models can be designed using various methods like e.g. multi-agents modeling, simulations, fuzzy methods modeling etc. Generic e-commerce system model using control circuit as a fundamental notion can be used as a base for modeling.
