F30|Linkages and spillover effects of South African foreign direct investment in Botswana and Kenya|In recent decades, the impact of South African foreign direct investment in Africa has been captured by research and policy. This paper investigates linkages and spillover effects of South African foreign direct investment in Botswana and Kenya. The study uses primary data to investigate qualitative implications. The findings reveal that South African firms operate in sectors including retail, food-processing, and information and communication technology. Linkages forged in these sectors include supply, employee, joint venture, service, and institutional nexuses. Supply and service linkages create observable spillovers which point to the fact that younger local firms tend to benefit from South African firms in terms of technology transfer and training opportunities. Host country policymakers are therefore encouraged to provide favourable incentives for foreign direct investment to promote entrepreneurship. Other policy implications are also discussed.
F30|Foreign direct investment,information technology and economic growth dynamics in Sub-Saharan Africa|The research assesses how information and communication technology (ICT) modulates the effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) on economic growth dynamics in 25 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa for the period 1980-2014. The employed economic growth dynamics areGross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, real GDP and GDP per capita while ICT is measured by mobile phone penetration and internet penetration. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalised Method of Moments. The study finds that both internet penetration and mobile phone penetration overwhelmingly modulate FDI to induce overall positive net effects on all three economic growth dynamics. Moreover, the positive net effects are consistently more apparent in internet-centric regressions compared to ?mobile phone?-oriented specifications. In the light of negative interactive effects, net effects are decomposed to provide thresholds at which ICT policy variables should be complemented with other policy initiatives in order to engender favorable outcomes on economic growth dynamics. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.

F30|Financial Access and Productivity Dynamics in Sub-Saharan Africa|The purpose of this study is to investigate whether enhancing financial access influences productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa. The research focuses on 25 countries in the region with data for the period 1980-2014. The adopted empirical strategy is the Generalised Method of Moments. The credit channel of financial access is considered and proxied by private domestic credit while four main total factor productivity (TFP) dynamics are adopted for the study, namely: TFP, real TFP, welfare TFP and real welfare TFP. It is apparent from the findings that enhancing financial access positively affects welfare TFP whereas the effect is not significant on TFP, real TFP and welfare TFP. Policy implications are discussed. The study complements the extant literature by engaging hitherto unemployed dynamics of TFP in Sub-Saharan Africa.
F30|The Role of ICT and Financial Development on CO2 Emissions and Economic Growth|This study explores the role of the information and communication Technology (ICT) and financial development (FD) on both carbon emissions and economic growth for the G7 countries for the period 1990-2014. Using PMG, we found that ICT has a long run positive effect on emissions, while FD is a weak determinant. The interactive term between the ICT and FD produces negative coefficients. Also, both variables are found to impact negatively on economic growth. However, their interactions show they have mixed effects on economic growth (i.e., positive in the short-run and negative in the long-run). Policy implications were designed based on these results.
F30|The Interplay between Oil and Food Commodity Prices: Has It Changed over Time?|Using time-varying BVARs, we find that oil price increases caused by oil supply shocks did not affect food commodity prices before the start of the millennium, but had positive spillover effects in more recent periods. Likewise, shortfalls in global food commodity supply—resulting from bad harvests—have positive effects on crude oil prices since the early 2000s, in contrast to the preceding era. Remarkably, we also document greater spillover effects of both supply shocks on metals and minerals commodity prices in recent periods, as well as a stronger impact on the own price compared to earlier decades. This (simultaneous) time variation of commodity price dynamics cannot be explained by the biofuels revolution and is more likely the consequence of heightened informational frictions and information discovery in more globalized and financialized commodity markets.
F30|Trade and credit: revisiting the evidence|This paper explores the effects of bank lending shocks on export behavior of Spanish firms. For that purpose, we combine Balance of Payments data on exports at the firmproduct-destination level with a matched bank-firm dataset incorporating information on the universe of corporate loans from 2002 to 2013. Armed with this dataset, we identify bankyear specific credit supply shocks following Amiti and Weinstein (2018) and estimate their impact on firms’ exports at the product-destination level. According to our estimates, credit supply shocks have sizable effects on both the intensive margin (amount exported) and the extensive margin of trade (decision to export).
F30|Does trust among banks matter for bilateral trade? Evidence from shocks in the interbank market|Do financial crises have an impact on trade flows via a shock to corporate risk or to bank risk? Focusing on Italy’s exports during a period characterized by both the global financial crisis and by the sovereign debt crisis, we exploit the prediction of standard trade models according to which financial shocks should be magnified by the time needed to ship a good to the importer’s country and by sector-level financial vulnerability. We also use bank-pair data on Italian banks’ assets and liabilities vis-à-vis their foreign bank counterparts in a specific country to construct proxies for the availability of trade finance in a given market. We find evidence of a negative impact of financial shocks on exports, especially to more distant countries and in more financially vulnerable sectors. The main channels seem to be mainly related to an increase in corporate risk (reflecting shocks to bank finance and to buyer-supplier trade credit), while the ‘contagion effect’ of shocks stemming from bank risk seems to be much less significant.
F30|On the Global Impact of Risk-off Shocks and Policy-put Frameworks|Global risk-off shocks can be highly destabilizing for financial markets and, absent an adequate policy response, may trigger severe recessions. Policy responses were more complex for developed economies with very low interest rates after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). We document, however, that the unconventional policies adopted by the main central banks were effective in containing asset price declines. These policies impacted long rates and inspired confidence in a policy-put framework that reduced the persistence of risk-off shocks. We also show that domestic macroeconomic and financial conditions play a key role in benefiting from the spillovers of these policies during risk-off episodes. Countries like Japan, which already had very low long rates, benefited less. However, Japan still benefitted from the reduced persistence of risk-off shocks. In contrast, since one of the main channels through which emerging markets are historically affected by global risk-off shocks is through a sharp rise in long rates, the unconventional monetary policy phase has been relatively benign to emerging markets during these episodes, especially for those economies with solid macroeconomic fundamentals and deep domestic financial markets. We also show that unconventional monetary policy in the US had strong effects on long interest rates in most economies in the Asia-Pacific region (which helps during risk-off events but may be destabilizing otherwise—we do not take a stand on this tradeoff).
F30|Tracking foreign capital: the effect of capital inflows on bank lending in the UK|This paper examines how UK banks channel capital inflows to the individual sectors of the domestic economy and to overseas residents. Information on the source country of foreign capital deposited with UK banks allows us to construct a novel Bartik instrument for capital inflows. Our results suggest that foreign funds boost bank lending to the domestic economy. This result is due to the positive effect of capital inflows on bank lending to non-financial firms and to other domestic financial institutions. Banks do not channel capital inflows directly to households or the public sector. Much of the foreign capital is also channelled back abroad, reflecting the role of the UK as a global financial centre.
F30|Government credit and trade war|By merging transaction-level trade data from China Customs and loan data from the China Development Bank (CDB), we analyze the effects of government credit on trade activities. We find that CDB credit mainly flows to SOEs in strategic industries at the top of the supply chain. These up-stream loans lead to the lower price and higher amount of export goods of private firms in down-stream industries, which leads to decreases in employment and performance of the US firms in the same industry. In contrast, the US firms in downstream industries use cheaper intermediate goods imported from China and perform better subsequently.
F30|Securisation special purpose entities, bank sponsors and derivatives|This paper documents the use of derivatives by securitisation special purpose entities (SPEs), also known as financial vehicle corporations (FVCs), domiciled in Ireland using transaction-level data established by the European Market Infrastructure Regulation. We show that these entities primarily engaged in interest rate derivatives over the period of 2015-2017. We find that larger entities that already engage in international capital markets are more likely to have derivative exposures. We also show that entities sponsored by banks and non-bank financial institutions are relatively more likely to engage in derivative markets. The characteristics of these bank sponsors are important in determining SPEs' engagement in derivative markets. SPEs' heavy reliance on debt finance coupled with their strong interconnectedness with bank sponsors underscores the importance of continuous monitoring and macroprudential surveillance of their derivative activities.

F30|Private bank deposits and macro/fiscal risk in the euro-area|We examine the relationship between private bank deposits and macro/fiscal risk in the euro area. We test three hypotheses: First, private bank deposits relative to Germany are determined by macro/fiscal risk factors. Second, this relationship is time-varying. Third, time-variation is driven by the level of macro/fiscal risk. Our findings validate all three tested hypotheses. They also reveal persistent fragmentation between EMU core and periphery banking systems caused by a deficit of trust in periphery banking systems, unmitigated by the introduction of OMT and European Banking Union. Our findings have implications for the introduction of the European Deposits Insurance Scheme (EDIS), for which they offer tentative support.
F30|Sovereign Bonds since Waterloo|This paper studies external sovereign bonds as an asset class. We compile a new database of 220,000 monthly prices of foreign-currency government bonds traded in London and New York between 1815 (the Battle of Waterloo) and 2016, covering 91 countries. Our main insight is that, as in equity markets, the returns on external sovereign bonds have been sufficiently high to compensate for risk. Real ex-post returns averaged 7% annually across two centuries, including default episodes, major wars, and global crises. This represents an excess return of around 4% above US or UK government bonds, which is comparable to stocks and outperforms corporate bonds. The observed returns are hard to reconcile with canonical theoretical models and with the degree of credit risk in this market, as measured by historical default and recovery rates. Based on our archive of more than 300 sovereign debt restructurings since 1815, we show that full repudiation is rare; the median haircut is below 50%.

F30|Trade Blocs and Trade Wars during the Interwar Period|What precisely were the causes and consequences of the trade wars in the 1930s? Were there perhaps deeper forces at work in reorienting global trade prior to the outbreak of World War II? And what lessons may this particular historical episode provide for the present day? To answer these questions, we distinguish between long-run secular trends in the period from 1920 to 1939 related to the formation of trade blocs (in particular, the British Commonwealth) and short-run disruptions associated with the trade wars of the 1930s (in particular, large and widespread declines in bilateral trade, the narrowing of trade imbalances, and sharp drops in average traded distances). We argue that the trade wars mainly served to intensify pre-existing efforts towards the formation of trade blocs which dated from at least 1920. More speculatively, we argue that the trade wars of the present day may serve a similar purpose as those in the 1930s, that is, the intensification of China- and US-centric trade bloc.

F30|Gravity, Counterparties, and Foreign Investment|Gravity models excel at explaining international trade and investment flows; their success poses a continuing puzzle. In a comprehensive dataset of global commercial real-estate investments, we find that the role of distance in the gravity model is well-explained by preferential matching between counterparties of the same nationality. This tendency for same-country matching is widespread, robust, and increases in poorly-governed locations. We structurally estimate an equilibrium matching model with a friction affecting different-nationality transactions. The model explains the persistent success of gravity using a combination of this friction and the spatial distribution of same-nationality counterparties, which is well-predicted by current and historical linguistic, cultural, and trade links between countries.
F30|The Global Macroeconomics of a Trade War: The EAGLE model on the US-China trade conflict|We study the global macroeconomic effects of tariffs using a multiregional, general equilibrium model, EAGLE, that we extend by introducing US tariffs against Chinese imports into the US, and subsequently Chinese tariffs against US imports into China, consistent with recent trade policies by the US and the Chinese governments. We abstract from tariffs on goods exported from the euro area, focusing on a US-China trade war. A unilateral tariff from the US against China dampens US exports in line with the Lerner Symmetry theorem but global output contracts. Global output contracts even further after China retaliates. The euro area benefits from this trade war. These European trade diversion benefits are caused by cheaper imports from China and improved competitiveness in the US. As price stickiness in the export sector in each region increases, the negative effects of tariffs in the US and China are mitigated, but the positive effects in the euro area are then also dampened.
F30|Distance(s) and the Volatility of International Trade(s)|Does distance matter for the volatility of international real and financial transactions? We show that it does, in addition to its well-established relevance for the level of trade. A simple model of trade with endogenous markups shows that demand shocks have a larger impact on trade between more distant countries. We test this implication in two steps, relying on a broad range of real and financial transactions measures, as well as several different metrics of distance (physical, linguistic, and internet). We first show that during the Great Trade Collapse of 2007-09 international transactions fell more between countries that are more distant along the various metrics, and find that the different distance measures magnify each other’s respective impacts. We then focus on a longer panel analysis of trade in goods and show that trade is more volatile between more distant countries, with again a magnification pattern across metrics of distance.
F30|Small Firms and Domestic Bank Dependence in Europe’s Great Recession|The paper studies the role of small businesses (SME) in the transmission of the Eurozone crisis to member countries and whether regions or countries with many SMEs were less able to share risk. Our analysis draws attention to domestic bank dependence—defined as the share of domestic private credit originated by domestic banks—as a key variable modulated the impact of shocks on bankdependent SMEs and thus on the real economy. We argue that Eurozone banking integration in the years after the creation of the single currency was lopsided in the sense that, until 2008, cross-border lending between banks increased markedly while foreign banks’ lending to the real sector stayed relatively flat. Hence, SMEs remained very dependent on domestic banks for credit, in spite of high levels of banking sector integration between Eurozone countries. Our results suggest that domestic bank dependence made countries, regions, and sectors with many SMEs more vulnerable to global banking sector shocks and, at the same time, provided little risk sharing.
F30|Exportweltmeister: The Low Returns on Germany's Capital Exports|"Germany is world champion in exporting capital (\Exportweltmeister""). No other country invests larger amounts of savings outside its borders. However, Germany plays in the third division when it comes to investment performance, as we show in this paper. We study the returns on German foreign investments from 1950 to 2017 and find that: (1) Germany's annual returns on foreign assets were 2 to 5 percentage points lower than those of comparable countries. Germany ranks last among the G7 countries, also in the last decade; (2) Domestic returns on German assets have outperformed foreign returns abroad by about 3 percentage points per year; (3) Germany's external wealth provides very little consumption insurance as foreign returns are highly correlated with domestic activity; (4) The capital exports do little to diversify demographic risks as Germany mainly invests in countries with similar demographics. Taken together, these facts raise substantial doubts whether German households, firms, and banks allocate their savings in a beneficial way."
F30|Taming the Global Financial Cycle: Central Banks and the Sterilization of Capital Flows in the First Era of Globalization (1891-1913)|"Are central banks able to isolate their domestic economy by offsetting the effects of foreign capital flows? We provide an answer for the First Age of Globalisation based on an exceptionally detailed and standardized database of monthly balance sheets of all central banks in the world (i.e. 21) over 1891-1913. Investigating the impact of a global interest rate shock on the exchange-rate, the interest rate and the central bank balance sheet, we find that not a single country played by the ""rules of the game."" Core countries fully sterilized capital flows, while peripheral countries also relied on convertibility restrictions to avoid reserve losses. In line with the predictions of the trilemma, the exchange rate absorbed the shock fully in countries off the gold standard (floating exchange rate): the central bank's balance sheet and interest rate were not affected. In contrast, in the United States, a gold standard country without a central bank, the reaction of the money market rate was three times stronger than that of interest rates in countries with a central bank. Central banks' balance sheets stood as a buffer between domestic economy and global financial markets."

F30|Globalisation And Governance: Thresholds For The Impacts Of The Main Determinants Of Capital Inflows?|This paper investigates whether the impacts of the main push (global financial conditions, GFC) and pull (growth) factors on capital inflows are invariant to endogenously estimated threshold levels for structural domestic conditions (SDC) represented by governance/institutional quality, trade openness, de facto international financial integration and de jure financial openness in emerging market and developing economies. Our results strongly suggest that, for all the components of capital inflows, the impact of the domestic pull factor is substantially much higher for the episodes of better governance, higher trade and de jure financial openness and de facto international financial integration. The sensitivity of non-FDI and aggregate inflows to GFC is highly significant and tends to be considerably higher for countries with better SDC. FDI inflows are found to be basically determined by the domestic pull factor across all these regimes. The impact of GFC on FDI inflows appears not to considerably change across the SDC.

F30|Adoption of CSR and Sustainability Reporting Standards: Economic Analysis and Review|This study provides an economic analysis of the determinants and consequences of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability reporting. To frame our analysis, we consider a widespread mandatory adoption of CSR reporting standards in the United States. The study focuses on the economic effects of standards for disclosure and reporting, not on the effects of CSR activities and policies themselves. It draws on an extensive review of the relevant academic (CSR and non-CSR) literatures in accounting, economics, finance, and management. Based on a discussion of the fundamental economic forces at play and the key features and determinants of (voluntary) CSR reporting, we derive and evaluate possible economic consequences, including capital-market effects for select stakeholders as well as potential firm responses and real effects in firm behavior. We also highlight issues related to the implementation and enforcement of CSR reporting standards. Our analysis yields a number of insights that are relevant to the current debate on CSR and sustainability reporting and provides scholars with avenues for future research.
F30|Does international reserve accumulation crowd out domestic private investment?|Foreign exchange reserve accumulation is one of the preferred strategies to protect against susceptibility to financial crises. At the same time, maintaining a healthy international reserve position has the potential to promote domestic investment by reducing the cost of foreign borrowing through improving international creditworthiness. However, contractionary monetary policy in the form of sterilization operations implemented as part of reserve accumulation strategy could crowd out financing for domestic investment. This study examines the relationship between foreign reserve accumulation and domestic private investment by undertaking a dynamic panel data econometric analysis covering 58 countries over the period 2000–2014. The findings suggest that reserve accumulation is positively associated with domestic private investment in the long run.
F30|Is Gold a Safe Haven? International Evidence revisited|The literature has not settled down on safe haven property of gold in emerging and developing countries. Therefore, in this study, we revisit the international evidence on hedging and safe haven role of gold for 34 emerging and developing countries with a span of daily data covering January 2000 – November 2018. We employ GARCH-copula approach to estimate lower-tail extreme dependencies of the joint distribution of gold and equity returns. We also introduce a new definition for strong safe haven property of an asset. Our findings indicate that while gold serves as a hedge instrument for all countries in our sample, we got evidence of weak safe haven property for gold, for domestic investors, only in 18 countries, and a strong safe haven asset only in six countries.

F30|Superkurtosis|Very little is known on how traditional risk metrics behave in ultra high frequency trading (UHFT). We fi�ll this void �firstly by examining the existence of the intraday returns moments, and secondly by assessing the impact of their (non)existence in a risk management framework. We show that in the case of UHFT, the returns' third and fourth moments do not exist, which entails that traditional risk metrics are unable to judge capital adequacy adequately. Hence, the use of risk management techniques, such as VaR, by market participants who engage with UHFT impose serious threats to the stability of fi�nancial markets, given that capital ratios may be severely underestimated.
F30|Beyond Home Bias: Portfolio Holdings and Information Heterogeneity|We investigate whether information frictions are important determinants of banks’ sovereign debt portfolios. Going beyond the classic home versus foreign distinction in holdings, we study the heterogeneity within the foreign sovereign portfolio. First, we propose a modified version of the Van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp (2009) model with a two-tiered information structure that links portfolio holdings and information acquisition. Second, we find strong support for the key predictions of the model in the data: if a bank makes a forecast for a given country, it is more likely to hold debt of that country. Moreover, more optimistic and more precise forecasts predict larger portfolio holdings.
F30|Bursting the Bitcoin Bubble: Assessing the Fundamental Value and Social Costs of Bitcoin|This paper develops a microeconomic model of bitcoin production to analyze the economic effects of the Bitcoin protocol. I view the bitcoin as a tradable commodity that is produced by miners and whose supply is managed by the protocol. The findings show that bitcoin’s volatile price path and inefficiency are related, and that both are a consequence of the protocol’s system of supply management. I characterize the fundamental value of a bitcoin and demonstrate that the return on bitcoin appreciates proportionally to the rate of increase in the level of difficulty. In the model, where the price of a bitcoin is based on marginal production costs, successive positive demand shocks result in a rapidly increasing price path that may be mistaken for a bubble. The generalized supremum augmented Dickey-Fuller (GSADF) test is used to demonstrate that the model is able to account for the explosive behavior in the bitcoin price path, providing strong evidence that bitcoin is not a bubble. I also show that the difficulty adjustment mechanism results in social welfare losses from 17 March 2014 to 13 January 2019 of $323.8 million, which is about 9.3% of the miners’ total electricity costs during this time period.
F30|Sovereign Spread Volatility and Banking Sector|Using structural vector autoregression augmented with stochastic volatility (SVAR-SV), we document that in late 2000s there were large spikes in volatility of spreads on peripheral eurozone government bonds. This increased volatility entailed a significant decline in bank credit to nonfinancial sector and real economic activity. We rationalize these results in a New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with financial intermediation. In our framework, a rise in spread volatility erodes banks’ net worth and constrains their balance sheets. The banks respond by slashing their lending to real sector, dampening the economy as a whole. Results from the model match our empirical findings.
F30|Use of credit default swaps by UCITS funds: evidence from EU regulatory data|Using a sample of more than 18,000 Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities,or UCITS, this paper aims to provide a first overview of the use of credit default swaps by EU UCITSfunds. We show that UCITS funds only account for a small share of the overall EU credit derivativesmarket. The CDS market is highly concentrated, with thirteen large dealers acting as counterparty to thevast majority of CDS transactions that involve UCITS funds. The use of CDS by UCITS is mainlyconcentrated in fixed-income funds and funds that rely on so-called alternative strategies. Funds that useCDS tend to be much larger on average. The analysis also reveals three salient features in the UCITSfunds’ use of CDS. Firstly, funds with directional strategies, such as fixed-income and allocation funds (ormixed funds), are on aggregate net sellers of CDS. Secondly, a large majority of CDS underlyings areindices, from which funds can gain exposure to multiple entities at once within one sector or region.Lastly, most sovereign single-name CDS are written on emerging market issuers, highlighting the rolethat these instruments can play in facilitating access to less liquid markets.

F30|Securitisation special purpose entities, bank sponsors and derivatives|This paper documents the use of derivatives by securitisation special purpose entities (SPEs), also known as financial vehicle corporations (FVCs), domiciled in Ireland using transaction-level data established by the European Market Infrastructure Regulation. We show that these entities primarily engaged in interest rate derivatives over the period of 2015–2017. We find that larger entities that already engage in international capital markets are more likely to have derivative exposures. We also show that entities sponsored by banks and non-bank financial institutions are relatively more likely to engage in derivative markets. The characteristics of these bank sponsors are important in determining SPEs’ engagement in derivative markets. SPEs’ heavy reliance on debt finance coupled with their strong interconnectedness with bank sponsors underscores the importance of continuous monitoring and macroprudential surveillance of their derivative activities.
F30|Global Liquidity and the Impairment of Local Monetary Policy Transmission|We show that global liquidity limits the transmission of local monetary policy on credit markets. For identification, we exploit global liquidity shocks in conjunction with monetary policy changes and exhaustive loan-level data (the credit and international interbank market registers) from a large emerging market, Turkey. We show that softer global liquidity conditions —proxied by lower VIX or expansionary US monetary policy— attenuate the pass-through of local monetary policy tightening on loan rates, especially for banks that borrow ex-ante more from international wholesale markets. Effects are also important for other credit margins and for bank risk-taking —especially for risky borrowers in FX loans. The mechanism at work is via a bank carry trade from international markets when local monetary conditions tighten.
F30|The Law of One Food Price|Are food prices more or less equalised across countries? In view of obvious barriers to trade (both naturally occurring and of a man-made nature) and currency gyrations, the answer would seem to be an unambiguous “No”, but we show this question is worthy of further investigation. In order for the law of one price (LOP) to hold, domestic prices must respond one-for-one to changes in world prices and exchange rates, but this is usually prevented by variations in mark-ups and/or trade barriers. We use data on consumer prices from the International Comparison Program and producer prices from the Food and Agriculture Organization to test for the LOP for food. While not completely conclusive, these tests show the various market wedges appear to be insufficiently important to prevent food prices to equalise over the longer term.
F30|Foreign Direct Investment, Information Technology and Economic Growth Dynamics in Sub-Saharan Africa|The research assesses how information and communication technology (ICT) modulates the effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) on economic growth dynamics in 25 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa for the period 1980-2014. The employed economic growth dynamics areGross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, real GDP and GDP per capita while ICT is measured by mobile phone penetration and internet penetration. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalised Method of Moments. The study finds that both internet penetration and mobile phone penetration overwhelmingly modulate FDI to induce overall positive net effects on all three economic growth dynamics. Moreover, the positive net effects are consistently more apparent in internet-centric regressions compared to â€œmobile phoneâ€ -oriented specifications. In the light of negative interactive effects, net effects are decomposed to provide thresholds at which ICT policy variables should be complemented with other policy initiatives in order to engender favorable outcomes on economic growth dynamics. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.
F30|What is the Impact of Monetary Policy on Wealth Inequality?|We construct a global panel data set to examine the relationship between monetary policy and wealth inequality. Dynamic panel estimates suggest that both overall and inherited wealth inequality increase with growth in the base money supply. These results hold for countries with at least one billionaire and for OECD countries. Interest rates have an insigni cant distributional impact overall, but this relationship becomes signi cant in a sample of OECD countries.
F30|Einflüsse auf die KMU Finanzierung: Ein Vergleich ausgewählter Euroländer|Diese Studie untersucht die Einflüsse auf die Finanzierung von kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen (KMU) in neun ausgewählten europäischen Ländern. Dabei wurden neben der Nutzung von externen Finanzierungsinstrumenten auch Zugangsrestriktionen berücksichtigt. Die Relevanz - also die tatsächliche oder potenzielle Nutzung - von Finanzierungsinstrumenten wird vor allem von unternehmensseitigen Faktoren, wie Größe, Alter und den Innovationsaktivitäten der KMU sowie seinen Eigentums- und Führungsstrukturen beeinflusst. Während die finanzwirtschaftlichen Rahmenbedingungen des jeweiligen Landes noch einen erheblichen Einfluss auf die Nutzung haben, werden Restriktionen nahezu ausschließlich von unternehmensbezogenen Faktoren beeinflusst. Der Zugang zu Finanzierungsinstrumenten ist im europäischen Vergleich allerdings unterschiedlich ausgeprägt, wobei deutsche KMU weit unterdurchschnittlich davon betroffen sind. Länderübergreifend sind insbesondere Kleinstunternehmen und innovative KMU von Finanzierungsrestriktionen betroffen.
F30|Investigating Fiscal and Monetary Policies Coordination and Public Debt in Kenya: Evidence from regime-switching and self-exciting threshold autoregressive models|This study explored the nature of fiscal and monetary policy coordination and its impact on long-run sustainability in Kenya. The study employed annual time series data from 1963 to 2014. Two objectives were investigated. (i) The determinants of monetary and fiscal policy rules under different policy regimes. (ii) The nature of fiscal and monetary policy regimes coordination in Kenya. Markov switching models were used to determine fiscal and monetary policy regimes endogenously. Fiscal policy regime was regarded as passive if the coefficient of debt in the MS model was significant and negative. This fiscal policy regime is regarded as unsustainable since the rise in debt is associated with a deterioration of the fiscal balance. On the other hand, the active monetary policy is synonymous with contractionary monetary policy since real in interest rate reacts positively to an increase in inflation. Robust analysis conducted using self-exciting threshold models confirms that monetary and fiscal policy reaction functions are nonlinear. The study findings show that passive or unsustainable fiscal regime was more dominant over the study period. There is evidence to support coordination between fiscal and monetary policy. There is a tendency for monetary policy to actively and prudently respond to unsustainable fiscal policy. Secondly, monetary policy sequentially responds to fiscal policy. The study recommended the adoption of systematic monetary response to a periodic deviation of fiscal policy from a long-run sustainability path. JEL Codes: E62; F30; H61
F30|Distance(s) and the volatility of international trade(s)|Does distance matter for the volatility of international real and financial transactions? We show that it does, in addition to its well-established relevance for the level of trade. A simple model of trade with endogenous markups shows that demand shocks have a larger impact on trade between more distant countries. We test this implication in two steps, relying on a broad range of real and financial transactions measures, as well as several different metrics of distance (physical, linguistic, and internet). We first show that during the Great Trade Collapse of 2007-09 international transactions fell more between countries that are more distant along the various metrics, and find that the different distance measures magnify each other’s respective impacts. We then focus on a longer panel analysis of trade in goods and show that trade is more volatile between more distant countries, with again a magnification pattern across metrics of distance.

F30|Exportweltmeister: The low returns on Germany's capital exports|"Germany is world champion in exporting capital (""Exportweltmeister""). No other country invests larger amounts of savings outside its borders. However, Germany plays in the third division when it comes to investment performance, as we show in this paper. We study the returns on German foreign investments from 1950 to 2017 and find that: (1) Germany's annual returns on foreign assets were 2 to 5 percentage points lower than those of comparable countries. Germany ranks last among the G7 countries, also in the last decade; (2) Domestic returns on German assets have outperformed foreign returns abroad by about 3 percentage points per year; (3) Germany's external wealth provides very little consumption insurance as foreign returns are highly correlated with domestic activity; (4) The capital exports do little to diversify demographic risks as Germany mainly invests in countries with similar demographics. Taken together, these facts raise substantial doubts whether German households, firms, and banks allocate their savings in a beneficial way."
F30|Tracking foreign capital: the effect of capital inflows on bank lending in the UK|This paper examines how UK banks channel capital inflows to the individual sectors of the domestic economy and to overseas residents. Information on the source country of foreign capital deposited with UK banks allows us to construct a novel Bartik instrument for capital inflows. Our results suggest that foreign funds boost bank lending to the domestic economy. This result is due to the positive effect of capital inflows on bank lending to non-financial firms and to other domestic financial institutions. Banks do not channel capital inflows directly to households or the public sector. Much of the foreign capital is also channeled back abroad, reflecting the role of the UK as a global financial center.
F30|Financial Access and Productivity Dynamics in Sub-Saharan Africa|The purpose of this study is to investigate whether enhancing financial access influences productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa. The research focuses on 25 countries in the region with data for the period 1980-2014. The adopted empirical strategy is the Generalised Method of Moments. The credit channel of financial access is considered and proxied by private domestic credit while four main total factor productivity (TFP) dynamics are adopted for the study, namely: TFP, real TFP, welfare TFP and real welfare TFP. It is apparent from the findings that enhancing financial access positively affects welfare TFP whereas the effect is not significant on TFP, real TFP and welfare TFP. Policy implications are discussed. The study complements the extant literature by engaging hitherto unemployed dynamics of TFP in Sub-Saharan Africa.
F30|The Role of ICT and Financial Development on CO2 Emissions and Economic Growth|This study explores the role of the information and communication Technology (ICT) and financial development (FD) on both carbon emissions and economic growth for the G7 countries for the period 1990-2014. Using PMG, we found that ICT has a long run positive effect on emissions, while FD is a weak determinant. The interactive term between the ICT and FD produces negative coefficients. Also, both variables are found to impact negatively on economic growth. However, their interactions show they have mixed effects on economic growth (i.e., positive in the short-run and negative in the long-run). Policy implications were designed based on these results.
F30|The Seniority Structure of Sovereign Debt|Sovereign governments owe debt to many foreign creditors and can choose which creditors to favor when making payments. This paper documents the de facto seniority structure of sovereign debt using new data on defaults (missed payments or arrears) and creditor losses in debt restructuring (haircuts). We overturn conventional wisdom by showing that official bilateral (government-to-government) debt is junior, or at least not senior, to private sovereign debt such as bank loans and bonds. Private creditors are typically paid first and lose less than bilateral official creditors. We confirm that multilateral institutions like the IMF and World Bank are senior creditors.
F30|Distance(s) and the Volatility of International Trade(s)|Does distance matter for the volatility of international real and financial transactions? We show that it does, in addition to its well-established relevance for the level of trade. A simple model of trade with endogenous markups shows that demand shocks have a larger impact on trade between more distant countries. We test this implication in two steps, relying on a broad range of real and financial transactions measures, as well as several different metrics of distance (physical, linguistic, and internet).

F30|Boom - Bust Capital Flow Cycles|This paper examines the new trends in research on capital flows fueled by the 2007-2009 Global Crisis. Previous studies on capital flows focused on current-account imbalances and net capital flows. The Global Crisis changed that. The onset of this crisis was preceded by a dramatic increase in gross financial flows while net capital flows remained mostly subdued. The attention in academia zoomed in on gross inflows and outflows with special attention to cross border banking flows before the crisis erupted and the shift towards corporate bond issuance in its aftermath. The boom and bust in capital flows around the Global Crisis also stimulated a new area of research: capturing the â€œglobal factor.â€ This research adopts two different approaches. The traditional literature on the push-pull factors, which before the crisis was mostly focused on monetary policy in the financial center as the â€œpush factor,â€ started to explore what other factors contribute to the comovement of capital flows as well as to amplify the role of monetary policy in the financial center on capital flows to the periphery. This new research focuses on global banksâ€™ leverage, risk appetite, and global uncertainty. Since the â€œglobal factorâ€ is not known, a second branch of the literature has captured this factor indirectly using dynamic common factors extracted from actual capital flows or movements in asset prices.

F30|International Coordination of Economic Policies in the Global Financial Crisis: Successes, Failures, and Consequences|The global financial crisis dominated the international financial landscape during the first 20 years of the 21st century. This paper assesses the contribution of the international coordination of economic policies to contain the crisis. The paper evaluates international efforts to diagnose the crisis and decide on appropriate responses, the treatments that were agreed and adopted, and the successes and failures as the crisis unfolded. International economic policy coordination eventually contributed importantly to containing the crisis, but the authorities failed to agree on a diagnosis and the consequent need for joint action until the case was obvious. The policy actions that were adopted were powerful and effective, but they may have undermined prospects for coordinated responses to crises in the future.
F30|Sovereign Ratings and Finance Ministers’ Characteristics|This paper empirically assesses the effect of a newly-compiled set of finance ministers´ characteristics on the setting by rating agencies of the long-term sovereign rating notations. Using a sample of 26 EU countries between 1980-2012, we find that the existence of more focused delegation-oriented fiscal framework, the Minister of Finance being a woman, and the Minister of Finance having a degree in the areas of finance or “hard sciences” seems to contribute to a better sovereign rating notation, and the opposite in the case of a Law background.
F30|Development of U.S.-East Asia financial input-output table|Flow of Funds Accounts (FFAs) are the official statistics describing how funds are transferred and where assets/liabilities exist, both inside and outside a country. At the international level, global FFAs depict the cross-border transfer of funds and the consequent claim/obligation relations among countries. The main purpose of this paper is to comprehend and organize the FFAs of various countries of the world from a financial point of view. We construct a global financial input–output table that shows both international and domestic transactions by each domestic institutional sector for the U.S., Japan, Korea, and China.
F30|An Overview of Islamic Banking and Finance in Asia|The Islamic finance industry has grown substantially in Asia over the last 2 decades. The Muslim populations in different Asian countries, especially in Southeast Asia, are increasing. Rapid Muslim population growth and improving living standards may enhance the popularity of Islamic finance as a keen alternative to conventional financing mechanisms. In addition, investors from the Middle East and Asia are increasingly seeking to invest in products that are in line with their religious beliefs. The governments and financial authorities in several Asian countries have played active roles in promoting the development of Islamic financial markets in line with the efforts to boost investments and achieve sustainable funding to enhance economic growth by tapping the huge liquidity from oil- and commodity-producing countries. The ethical character and financial stability of Islamic financial products may increase their attraction. Islamic financial products have an ethical focus (notably excluding investment in alcohol and gambling) with a risk profile that appeals to wider ethically conscious investors. Given that in Islamic banking returns on investments are based on underlying economic activities and/or assets that structure the contractual relationship between transacting parties, it is possible to use the asset-based nature and risk-sharing aspects of Islamic finance for greater integration with the real economy and to improve the overall economic balance between the real and the finance sector.
F30|The pricing of FX forward contracts: Micro evidence from banks' dollar hedging|Using transaction-level data on foreign exchange (FX) forward contracts, we document large demand-driven heterogeneity in banks' dollar hedging costs. For identification, we exploit regulatory end-of-quarter reporting that penalizes banks' currency exposure with capital surcharges. Contracts that reduce quarter-end currency exposure trade at higher prices, specifically for banks with high dollar funding gaps and high leverage, while access to internal dollar capital markets and bargaining power reduces prices. Spreads between similar contracts with and without initial margin widen with leverage. Our results suggest that banks' shadow costs of capital are important for the international propagation of shocks through FX derivatives markets.
F30|The Macroeconomic Effects of Trade Policy|We study the short-run macroeconomic effects of trade policies that are equivalent in a friction-less economy, namely a uniform increase in import tariffs and export subsidies (IX), an increase in value-added taxes accompanied by a payroll tax reduction (VP), and a border adjustment of corporate pro.t taxes (BAT). Using a dynamic New Keynesian open-economy framework, we summarize conditions for exact neutrality and equivalence of these policies. Neutrality requires the real exchange rate to appreciate enough to fully offset the effects of the policies on net exports. We argue that a combination of higher import tariffs and export subsidies is likely to trigger only a partial exchange rate offset and thus boosts net exports and output (with the output stimulus largely due to the subsidies). Under full pass-through of taxes, IX and BAT are equivalent but VP is not. We show that a temporary VP can increase intertemporal prices enough to depress aggregate demand and output, even when wages are sticky. These contractionary effects are especially pronounced under fixed exchange rates.
F30|Financial development and the occurrence of banking crises|We perform an in-depth analysis of the effect of different dimensions of financial development on the occurrence of banking crises. Horse-race estimations carried out on a large dataset of 113 banking crises in 112 countries reveal that the growth of M3/GDP and the level of banks’ Credits/Deposits increase the occurrence of banking crises, while the growth and sometimes the volatility of the ratio of banks’ assets to the sum of banks’ and the Central Bank's assets decrease it. In addition, we do not find a significant effect of banks’ Credits/GDP. Finally, we unveil heterogeneities related to nonlinearities in the effect of financial development, the time span for the pre-crisis dynamics of financial development, and the level of economic development. Our results suggest that only some dimensions of financial development are significantly associated with the occurrence of banking crises.
F30|Dynamic network of implied volatility transmission among US equities, strategic commodities, and BRICS equities|We contribute to the growing literature on information flow among US equities, strategic commodities (oil and gold) and Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa equities. Unlike prior literature, however, we apply a graph theory approach that incorporates a dynamic conditional correlation model to disclose the dynamics of information integration and investigate the impact of political, war, macroeconomic and financial events on the changes in information flow among implied volatility indices. Our findings indicate that the integration structure of an information transmission network is unstable and changes over time. The impact patterns of events are dissimilar—some events have an impact on the local market only, whereas others have a global impact. The key point is that the impact of events on the integration structure among market volatilities is limited, although events can affect the degree of co-movement among markets. Our findings can provide important implications for dynamic global portfolios.
F30|On the rewards to international investing: a safe haven currency perspective|Abstract The safe haven property of the Swiss franc presents a specific challenge for internationally minded Swiss-based investors. The central issue is whether the traditional under-performance of Swiss assets is made up by the secular appreciation of the Swiss franc combined with the propensity of the safe haven to strengthen in times of market stress. In this paper, we review the evidence on the terms of this challenge. We conclude that a Swiss bias in asset allocation can lead to considerable return shortfalls over the long run and that systematic currency hedging would not have been historically justified and is unlikely to be in the future. Assuming a fair amount of currency risk thus appears inevitable for long-run Swiss-based investors.
F30|Oil Prices and GCC Stock Markets: New Evidence from Smooth Transition Models|Our paper examines the effect of oil price changes on Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) stock markets using nonlinear smooth transition regression (STR) models. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our empirical results reveal that GCC stock markets do not have similar sensitivities to oil price changes. We document the presence of stock market returns’ asymmetric reactions in some GCC countries, but not for others. In Kuwait’s case, negative oil price changes exert larger impacts on stock returns than positive oil price changes. When considering the asymmetry with respect to the magnitude of oil price variation, we find that Oman’s and Qatar’s stock markets are more sensitive to large oil price changes than to small ones. Our results highlight the importance of economic stabilization and reform policies that can potentially reduce the sensitivity of stock returns to oil price changes, especially with regard to the existence of asymmetric behavior.
F30|Portfolio Composition and Valuation Effects in Emerging Market Economies| The increase in cross-border assets and liabilities of nations with globalization, implies small asset price and currency movements create large wealth changes. The national net external position is increasingly driven by valuation effects, which the current account does not capture. We analyze valuation effects for a group of seven emerging economies, namely Brazil, Colombia, India, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Peru and Turkey for the time period 2005:Q1-2015:Q4 by scrutinizing their external asset portfolio while controlling for country fundamentals. Both asset and liability categories of Direct Investment equity are found to positively impact valuation. Equity liabilities and debt assets of Portfolio Investment positively influence valuation. Debt liabilities of all kinds of investment negatively impact valuation. Countries with stronger currency tend to gain through valuation effects. An appreciated real effective exchange rate is associated with higher valuation gains. We also found non-linear effects of the composition of external debt portfolio by interacting external portfolio and country characteristics. The external portfolio selection of emerging economies (with more in Direct Investment equity liabilities and Portfolio Investment debt assets) in the period has shielded them from global volatility, and enabled valuation gains.
F30|International financial input-output table for Asia-Pacific region|Flow of Funds Accounts (FFA) refer to the statistics describing how funds are transferred and where assets and liabilities exist in or outside a country. This paper tries to produce preliminary global FFA focusing on Asia-Pacific region, which is a type of global FFA, and to identify its uses. We discuss the method of converting countries’ FFA into Financial Input-output (FIO) and putting those FIOs, CPIS, CDIS and other international statistics into the framework of global FIO. Then, it discusses the use of global FIO table by applying the methods of input-output analysis.
F30|Gross Capital Inflows And Outflows: Twins Or Distant Cousins?|We investigate the long-run relations and equilibrium correction mechanisms between gross capital inflows, outflows and global financial conditions for advanced and emerging market economies. According to our results, the findings of the recent empirical literature, suggesting that twin behaviour of capital inflows and outflows resulting from domestic and foreign investors to behave as distant cousins tend to be the case for the long-run. The short-run relations, however, often appear to be consistent with the conventional theory suggesting that the behaviours of residents and non-residents do not systematically diverge from each other. Consistent with the flight to safety concerns, capital outflows from EME and capital inflows to AE tend to increase in the long-run in response to worsening global financial conditions. We find that, these results essentially hold also for the main components of capital flows.
F30|Exchange Rate Regimes As Thresholds: The Main Determinants Of Capital Inflows In Emerging Market Economies|This study investigates whether the impacts of the main common push (global financial conditions, GFC) and country-specific pull (growth) factors on capital inflows are invariant to the prevailing exchange rate regimes (ERRs) in emerging market economies. Our results suggest that endogenously estimated ERR thresholds do matter especially for the impact of GFC. The impact of GFC is substantially high under more flexible ERRs for all capital inflow types except FDI. FDI inflows are basically determined by the pull factor across all ERRs. Portfolio inflows are mainly determined by GFC. The sensitivity of aggregate and other investment inflows to the pull factor seems to be much higher under more rigid ERRs. Our results are broadly in line with the literature suggesting that credible managed ERRs encourage capital inflows by allowing countries to import monetary policy credibility of the center country and to provide exchange rate guarantee.
F30|The international transmission of monetary policy|This paper presents the novel results from an internationally coordinated project by the International Banking Research Network (IBRN) on the cross-border transmission of conventional and unconventional monetary policy through banks. Teams from seventeen countries use confidential micro-banking data for the years 2000 through 2015 to explore the international transmission of monetary policies of the United States, euro area, Japan, and United Kingdom. Two other studies use international data with different degrees of granularity. International spillovers into lending to the private sector do occur, especially for US policies, and bank-specific heterogeneity influences the magnitudes of transmission. The effects are supportive of the international bank lending channel and the portfolio channel of monetary policy transmission. They also show that the frictions that banks face matter; in particular, foreign currency funding and hedging considerations can be a key source of heterogeneity. The forms of bank balance sheet heterogeneity that differentiate spillovers across banks are not uniform across countries. International spillovers into lending can be large for some banks, even while the average international spillovers of policies into nonbank lending generally are not large.
F30|US Monetary Policy, Global Risk Aversion, and New Zealand Funding Conditions|Instrumenting US monetary shocks with fed funds future contracts and extracting global risk sentiment from VIX, this paper uses a structural vector autoregression framework to estimate the causal impact of US monetary policy on New Zealand financial and real sectors. The paper finds that 20 basis points increase in US one-year rate leads to about 14 and 59 percent increase in domestic and external funding spreads of New Zealand banks, respectively. The paper also finds that credit default swap spread rises contemporaneously following a US monetary tightening shock. Similar patterns are documented in Australia, Canada, Sweden and United Kingdom. These results suggest the existence of a global financial cycle underpinned by US monetary policy, and prompt the reassessment of the relevance of Mundellian trilemma in an increasingly globalised economic system.
F30|State-Owned Enterprises and the Low-Carbon Transition|This paper explores the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the low-carbon transition in OECD and G20 countries. It tracks GHG emissions and energy investments by SOEs and analyses the impact of SOEs on investments in renewable electricity. A descriptive analysis of SOEs’ role in the electricity sector shows the continued importance of SOEs, including prominent investments in both renewables and fossil-fuel-based electricity generation..
F30|The Financial Connectedness between Eurozone Core and Periphery: A Disaggregated View|This paper examines the financial stress interconnectedness among GIIPS economies and Germany. Based on market level financial stress indices, it examines the stress transmission process as well as the causal network relationships in banking sector, bond, money and stock markets. The period under investigation, 2001-2013, allows to test the effects of financial crisis of 2008 as well as the subsequent European sovereign crisis. Using two alternative techniques for connectedness analysis, our evidence suggests that the peripheral economies of Italy and Spain play a highly significant role in the stress transmission in all markets, especially in the cases of banks and equity markets. Moreover, we visualize our results using network analysis. Contrary to common wisdom, Portugal, Ireland, and mainly Greece, do not seem to have an important role in amplifying stress levels.
F30|Financial and Product Market Integration under Increasing Returns to Scale|The impact of financial integration and product market integration is studied in a general equilibrium model with increasing returns in both the manufacturing sector and the financial sector. Firms engage in oligopolistic competition. An increase of the degree of competition in the financial sector resulting from financial integration may not change the degree of competition in the product market. With product market integration, the level of technology, the wage rate, and the interest rate paid to depositors increase. Joint integration increases the level of technology, the wage rate, and the interest rate paid to depositors. The impact of separate financial integration or separate product market integration will not be reversed under joint integration. Social welfare increases under all integration regimes.
F30|Contagion and information frictions in emerging markets: the role of joint signals|We show that information frictions can explain financial contagion without correlated fundamentals and explain why emerging markets are more susceptible to contagion. Costly information may cause investors to group country signals, because such imprecise signals are cheaper. These joint signals then cause asset prices to comove, which can be observed as contagion. Due to lower demand for country-specific information and lower risk weighted returns, it is likelier that investors group signals of emerging markets, thereby making them more prone to contagion. We find empirical evidence for our predictions using a novel data set on the number of joint news articles and exploit exogenous variation in news due to terrorism.
F30|The Effect of the Macroeconomic Determinants on Sovereign Credit Rating of Turkey|The effects of the main macroeconomic determinants on the sovereign credit rating of Turkey assigned by Standard & Poor’s are analyzed in this paper. As the main macroeconomic determinants, inflation rate, economic growth rate, foreign direct investment, external debt, current account debt and savings are taken into account in this study. The data related to Turkey in this study covers between 1992-2016. In this study, the Granger causality test and the OLS regression model are used for that correlations of the variables. Outcomes of the analysis show that just two in six macroeconomic determinants are effective on the sovereign credit rating. According to the results of the study, external debt and inflation rate have a statistically significant relationship with the sovereign credit rating of Turkey. The outcomes show that external debt and the inflation rate have negative effects on the sovereign credit rating of the country. The coefficient of the external debt and the inflation is negative which means that if the inflation or external debt increases the rating decreases in appropriate with the theory. On the other hand, the effects of the other four macroeconomic variables are not significant. The results of the study indicate that some factors other than the primary macroeconomic determinants are effective on the sovereign credit ratings of Turkey. The results also unveil the door for the criticism that the decisions of the credit rating agencies are biased.
F30|Türkiye'de Faizsiz Bankacılık Prensiplerine Uygun Teverruk Pazarı: Ürün İhtisas Borsası<BR>[Tawarruq Market in Turkey in accordance with the Principles of Interest-free Banking: Product Specialization Exchange]|Participation banks in Turkey use the “tawarruq” method to restructure their uncollectible receivables and the “commodity murabahah” method, which is a kind of tawarruq, to manage their liquidity. All participation banks to perform these operations use the London Metal Exchange (LME). The realization of tawarruq transactions through a commodity or metal exchange to be established in Turkey has been discussed in recent years. This article is about whether the product specialization stock exchange planned to be established in 2018 can contribute to Turkish participation banking and how it should work with a model if it is used in tawarruq and commodity murabahah transactions.
F30|Evidence of Investor Sentiment Contagion across Asset Markets|This study explores investor sentiment contagion across asset markets and relates specific asset market sentiments to other asset markets. The analysis reveals four main findings. First, investor sentiment highly correlates between equity markets. Second, investor sentiment in one asset market can affect those in other markets; for example, sentiments in the bond markets, particularly the US bond market, significantly Granger cause equity market sentiment, but not vice versa. Investor sentiments in the USD–JPY exchange market can Granger cause those in the Euro–USD, gold, and crude oil markets. Third, investor sentiments in the US asset markets have the largest contagion effects on asset markets given the resultant fluctuations in sentiments across other countries. Fourth, US asset market sentiments, especially bond market sentiment, can explain returns in other asset markets in different countries.
F30|Macroeconomic variables and current account balance in Namibia|This paper investigates macroeconomic determinants of the current account balance in Namibia. The results show that there is evidence of twin deficit hypothesis in Namibia. Evidence of twin deficit hypothesis suggest that it is important for Namibia to have fiscal discipline in order to improve its current account. Increase in capital flows, real GDP or per capita, results in a deterioration of the current account. Increase in interest rate, commodity prices and population cause the current account balance to improve. This suggest that contractionary monetary policy contributed to reduction of unproductive imports and improved the current account balance.
F30|The Impact of Imperfect Financial Integration and Trade on Macroeconomic Volatility and Welfare in Emerging Markets|This study examines how international integration impacts macroeconomic volatility and welfare in emerging market economies (EMEs), employing a two-country real business cycle model with constrained cross-border borrowing and imperfect access to international financial market. Parameter calibration employs 2000-2013 trade and external debt data from EMEs. The simulation shows that higher foreign debt raises output volatility, slightly reduces consumption volatility of entrepreneurs who can borrow abroad, and brings about welfare loss due to higher debt interest payments and less consumption. Households who can only save in domestic markets are largely unaffected. Restricted financial integration does not have much adverse impact when people face no other frictions domestically, suggesting the importance of domestic financial development. Higher international trade tends to be favorable for output variability, consumption smoothing, and welfare, but does not play a significant role on how cross-border borrowing affects macroeconomic volatility. The results suggest that the impacts of financial and trade integration are generally independent. It might be difficult for EMEs to achieve evident gains from greater financial integration even with high trade intensity when market imperfection exists. Increasing only trade or both types of integration together can be Pareto improving that lowers aggregate fluctuation, whereas increasing only private external debt is not.
F30|Exchange Rate Exposure and Firm Dynamics|This paper develops a firm-dynamics model with endogenous currency debt composition to study financing and investment decisions in developing economies. In our model, foreign currency borrowing arises from a trade-off between exposure to currency risk and growth. There is cross-sectional hetero- geneity in these decisions in two dimensions. First, there is selection into foreign currency borrowing, as only productive firms employ it. Second, there is heterogeneity in firmsâ€™ share of foreign currency loans, driven by their potential growth. We assess econometrically the pattern of foreign currency borrowing using firm-level census data on Hungary, calibrate the model and quantify its aggregate impact.
F30|Foreign and Domestic Investment in Global Bond Markets|Gauging foreign (domestic) biases as the deviation of foreign (domestic) investors’ actual portfolio allocation of a bond market from the same bond market’s weight in global bond market, we investigate the determinants of foreign and domestic investment biases in 41 global bond markets. We find that foreign investors significantly overweigh markets that offer better risk–return profiles. In addition, greater market openness and sound macroeconomic outlook attract foreign investment. Such return driven behavior of foreign investors is especially pronounced in emerging bond markets. Meanwhile, home bias is higher in smaller bond markets. Our evidence sheds some light on the role of regional financial integration on broadening investor base and improving investor profile in emerging markets.
F30|International Commodity Prices and Domestic Bank Lending in Developing Countries|We study the role of the bank-lending channel in propagating fluctuations in commodity prices to credit aggregates and economic activity in developing countries. We use data on more than 1,600 banks from 78 developing countries to analyze the transmission of changes in international commodity prices to domestic bank lending. Identification relies on a bankspecific time-varying measure of bank sensitivity to changes in commodity prices, based on daily data on bank stock prices. We find that a fall in commodity prices reduces bank lending, although this effect is confined to low-income countries and driven by commodity price busts. Banks with relatively lower deposits and poor asset quality transmit commodity price changes to lending more aggressively, supporting the hypothesis that the overall credit response to commodity prices works also through the credit supply channel. Our results also show that there is no significant difference in the behavior of foreign and domestic banks in the transmission process, reflecting the regional footprint of foreign banks in developing countries.
F30|The costs of trade protectionism: evidence from Spanish firms and non-tariff measures|The rise in non-tariff protectionist measures has been associated to the weakness in global trade over the last few years. We investigate the effect of non-tariff barriers (NTBs) on exports growth over the period 2009-2013 using administrative data at the firm-product-destination level in Spain. According to our findings, non-tariff protectionist measures significantly reduce exports growth at the product-destination level. Moreover, NTBs also hinder exports growth at the firm level and negatively affect other firm outcomes such as productivity growth. In contrast, the impact of liberalizing non-tariff measures is not statistically significant.
F30|Rethinking prices and markets underlying price-competitiveness indicators|A comprehensive analysis of price and cost competitiveness warrants an assessment of a range of alternately deflated nominal effective exchange rates. Here, we focus solely on the price-competitiveness indicator currently published by the Bank of Italy (Felettigh et al., 2015), which is based on the producer prices of domestically-sold manufactures, and we refine its measurement. First, we update the data sources for the producer price index. Revisions mainly refer to non-euro area countries, yet also affect relative prices and therefore the price-competitiveness trends of the four main euro-area economies. These countries have performed better according to the revised indicators, in particular since 2010. Second, we present a novel three-market view of price-competitiveness indicators by splitting destination markets. The overall indicator encompassing competitive pressures on both the import and the export side can indeed be broken down into three components: the domestic market, where local producers are rivalled by foreign competitors with their import penetration; euro-area markets, where all countries compete; and non-euro-area markets, where, similarly, all countries compete. Whereas France and Germany have displayed similar price-competitiveness developments in both the euro and non-euro area markets over the entire period since 1999, Italy and Spain have performed better in the non-euro area than in the euro-area markets. Competitiveness in the domestic market and that in non-euro area markets are the main, equally important, drivers of overall developments since 1999 in Italy and in Germany.
F30|Are credit rating agencies discredited? Measuring market price effects from agency sovereign debt announcements|This paper investigates whether the price response to credit rating agency (CRA) announcements on sovereign bonds has diminished since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). We characterize credit rating events more precisely than previous work, controlling agency announcements for the prior credit state - outlook, watch/review, or stable status as well as the level of the credit rating. Emphasizing the transition from one state to another allows us to distinguish between different types of announcement (rating changes, watch and outlook events) and their price effects. We employ an event study methodology and gauge market response by standardized cumulative abnormal returns (SCAR) and directional change statistics in daily credit default swap (CDS) spreads. We find that rating announcements provide a rich and varied set of information on how credit rating agencies in fluence market perceptions of sovereign default risk. CRA announcements continued to have significant effects on CDS spreads after the GFC, but the magnitude of the responses generally fell. Moreover, we find that accurate measurement of these effects depends on conditioning for the prior credit state of the sovereign bond.
F30|Business models and dollar funding of global banks|"Since the eurozone crisis, there has been a stark divergence between European banks and Japanese banks in their dollar uses and sources. We show that these shifts have implications for the price of dollar funding. We document a ""Japan Repo Premium."" Japanese banks pay a premium for repos with US money market funds (MMFs), despite identical contract and risk characteristics. Using the US MMF reform as a natural experiment, we establish that Japanese banks' long maturity dollar assets generate a relatively inelastic demand for long maturity dollar borrowing. Differences in the demand for dollar funding combined with market and supply side frictions can explain these pricing differences. MMFs mainly provide short term repos and favor longer term clients for long maturity repos. Japanese banks concentrate their repo borrowing, reducing their bargaining power in order to extend their funding maturity. Our results have implications for the formation of global dollar funding networks. We provide evidence for European banksintermediating repos to Japanese banks, with economically significant estimated spreads from maturity transformation."
F30|Unconventional monetary policy and the portfolio choice of international mutual funds|Unconventional monetary policy (UMP) by the US Federal Reserve, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, and European Central Bank affects the geographical portfolio choice of international mutual fund managers. UMP prompts managers of mutual funds to rebalance their portfolios away from the country conducting UMP, and increase their geographical allocation to other developed markets; there is little evidence of rebalancing towards emerging markets. The international spillover effects from UMP announcement surprises are of small economic magnitude, in contrast to the effects of actual UMP operations in the form of large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs). The results imply that while not contributing to QE-induced capital flows to emerging markets, mutual fund managers play a role in the transmission of unconventional monetary policy, in particular LSAPs, across developed markets.
F30|The information in the joint term structures of bond yields|While standard no-arbitrage term structure models are estimated using nominal yields from a single country, a growing literature estimates joint models of yields in multiple countries or nominal and real yields from a single country. However, this paper argues that, in two of the most common applications joint modelling does not bring any material benefits in capturing the dynamics of bond yields. Joint models of US and German nominal yields do not offer economically significant advantages in fitting the cross section of yields or predicting future yields. We obtain similar results for joint models of US nominal and real yields.
F30|The real value of China’s stock market|This paper shows that, counter to common perception, stock prices in China are strongly linked to firm fundamentals. Since the reforms of the early 2000s, stock prices are as informative about future profits as they are in the US. Although the market is segmented from international equity markets, Chinese investors price individual stock characteristics like other global investors: they pay up for size, growth, liquidity, and long shots, while they discount for systematic risk. Price informativeness is significantly correlated with corporate investment e ciency. For international investors, China's stock market offers high average returns and low correlation with other equity markets.

F30|Securitization and crash risk : Evidence from large European banks|The 2008 global financial crisis highlights the importance of securitization and crash risk. Yet there is a dearth of papers exploring the link between securitization and crash risk. We analyze 7,096 securitization deals made by large European listed banks between 2000 and 2017. Our paper provides evidence that bank risk declines in the year of the securitization and increases in the following year. We also show that this effect is driven by low-risk securitization deals. We use a dynamic panel data approach to establish a causal relationship and control the robustness of our results by using different tail risk measures (such as crash risk, value at risk, and expected shortfall). We also show that the risk reduction effect is weaker in crisis periods relative to normal times. Our findings have policy implications as regulators attempt to revive European securitization markets.
F30|Central Bank Reputation and Inflation-Unemployment Performance: Empirical Evidence from an Executive Survey of 62 Countries|Although there is a well-established theoretical literature that links central bank (CB) reputation with inflation performance following Barro and Gordon, there is little empirical work testing the relationship rigorously. This paper empirically tests the impact of reputation on inflation-unemployment performance using a novel set of data on CB reputation--an annual local business manager survey on central bank policy covering 62 countries during 1995-2016. This paper finds that CB reputation is a significant determinant of inflation: the results of an FE panel and Arellano-Bond difference GMM model show that high-reputation CBs have achieved better inflation performances over the past 20 years with lower levels of inflation than others, holding the output gap and unemployment rate constant. This result remains robust to various control variables including money growth, past inflation levels, exchange rates, and financial crisis dummies. This paper also finds that high CB reputation is associated with a tight anchoring of inflation expectations to inflation targets in inflation-targeting countries. The effects of reputation on the volatility of inflation and unemployment rates are found to be not robust. This paper offers evidence of the opposite-direction causality as well that goes from high inflation to decreased CB reputation.
F30|Analysis of Changes in Determinants of Foreigners¡Ç Bond Investment before and after the Global Financial Crisis: The Case of Korea (in Korean)|This study employs regression analysis and variance decomposition based on portfolio selection and interest rate parity theories to examine whether the determinants of foreigners' bond investment for Korea, such as the degrees of arbitrage opportunities as well as global and country risks, have changed after the global financial crisis. Empirical results show that arbitrage opportunities played a more important role in the pre-crisis period (2004-07), while risk factors were more influential in the post-crisis period (2010-17). In addition, the explanatory power of the regression model decreased after the crisis, which implies that the influence of variables other than arbitrage opportunities and risk factors may have increased.
F30|How Nominal Foreign Currency Depreciation Against the U.S. Dollar Affects U.S. Wealth: Working Paper 2018-05|Foreign currency depreciation against the U.S. dollar would affect the wealth holdings of U.S. residents in several ways. Specifically, I analyze the effects of a one-time large depreciation of 20 percent. If foreign currencies depreciated by 20 percent against the U.S. dollar, the value of U.S. holdings of foreign assets would decrease by an estimated $2,451 billion and the value of U.S. liabilities to foreigners by $168 billion (values are based on 2015 holdings and values). On net, the total worth of U.S. households would decrease by $2.3 trillionâ€”a drop of 2.2 percent.
F30|Understanding International Long-Term Interest Rate Comovement|Long-term interest rates of small open economies correlate strongly with the US long-term rate. Can central banks in those countries decouple from the US? An estimated DSGE model for the UK (vis-`a-vis the US) establishes three structural empirical results. (1) Comovement arises due to nominal fluctuations, not through real rates or term premia. (2) The cause of comovement is the central bank of the small open economy accommodating foreign inflation trends, rather than systematically curbing them. (3) Small open economies may find themselves much more affected by changes in US inflation trends than the US itself.
F30|Forward Bias, Uncovered Interest Parity And Related Puzzles|Uncovered interest parity is widely used in open economy macroeconomics. But the evidence rejects UIP and implies forward bias. There are many suggested explanations for the failure of UIP and forward bias, but none are widely accepted, at least partially because none appear to explain the related puzzles discussed below. This paper shows how sterilized “leaning against the wind” and a combination of inflationary and liquidity effects of open market operations can explain forward bias and the failure of UIP even when expectations are rational. They also appear to be able to explain the related puzzles.
F30|Brexit and Uncertainty in Financial Markets|This paper applies long-memory techniques (both parametric and semi-parametric) to examine whether Brexit has led to any significant changes in the degree of persistence of the FTSE (Financial Times Stock Index) 100 Implied Volatility Index (IVI) and of the British pound’s implied volatilities (IVs) vis-à-vis the main currencies traded in the FOREX (foreign exchange market), namely the euro, the US dollar and the Japanese yen. We split the sample to compare the stochastic properties of the series under investigation before and after the Brexit referendum, and find an increase in the degree of persistence in all cases except for the British pound-yen IV, whose persistence has declined after Brexit. These findings highlight the importance of completing swiftly the negotiations with the European Union (EU) to achieve an appropriate Brexit deal.
F30|Oil Prices and GCC Stock Markets: New Evidence from Smooth Transition Models|Our paper examines the effect of oil price changes on Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) stock markets using nonlinear smooth transition regression (STR) models. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our empirical results reveal that GCC stock markets do not have similar sensitivities to oil price changes. We document the presence of stock market returns’ asymmetric reactions in some GCC countries, but not for others. In Kuwait’s case, negative oil price changes exert larger impacts on stock returns than positive oil price changes. When considering the asymmetry with respect to the magnitude of oil price variation, we find that Oman’s and Qatar’s stock markets are more sensitive to large oil price changes than to small ones. Our results highlight the importance of economic stabilization and reform policies that can potentially reduce the sensitivity of stock returns to oil price changes, especially with regard to the existence of asymmetric behavior.
F30|Is Liquidity Risk Priced in Partially Segmented Markets?|We develop an asset pricing model to analyze the joint impact of liquidity costs and market segmentation. The freely traded securities command a premium for liquidity level and global market and liquidity risk premiums whereas securities that can only be held by a subset of investors additionally command a local market and liquidity risk premiums. Based on a new methodology, we find that the liquidity level premium dominates the liquidity risk premiums for our sample of 24 emerging markets. Whereas the local liquidity risk premium is empirically small, the global market liquidity risk premium dramatically increases during crises and market corrections.
F30|Currency misalignments and economic growth: the foreign currency-denominated debt channel|"The literature on the growth effects of currency misalignments, although prolific, revolves around two main axes: one the one hand, the export-oriented growth literature which attributes positive effects to undervaluations (competitiveness gains) and, on the other hand, the Washington Consensus view according to which any deviations from equilibrium hamper economic growth. In this paper, we show that there is no ""one size fits all"" relationship in this regard. Indeed, relying on a panel of 72 developing and emerging countries, we evidence the existence of a foreign currency-denominated debt channel through which misalignments impact growth. Compared to the ""traditional"" competitiveness channel, this channel works in the opposite direction. The paper therefore reconciles the two strands of the literature: undervaluations may have indeed a positive growth effect, but it is crucial to take into account the possible costs related to this undervaluation to have a clearer picture of the net total effect."

F30|Cross-border banking in the EU since the crisis: What is driving the great retrenchment?|Abstract This paper examines the drivers of the retrenchment in cross-border banking in the European Union (EU) since the global financial crisis, which stands out in international comparison as banks located in the euro area and in the rest of the EU reduced their cross-border claims by around 25%. Particularly striking is the sharp and sustained reduction in intra-EU claims, especially in the form of deleveraging from cross-border interbank loans. Examining a wide range of possible determinants, we identify high non-performing loans as an important impediment to cross-border lending after the crisis, highlighting the spillovers from national banking sector conditions across the EU. We also find evidence that prudential policies can entail spillovers via cross-border banking in the EU, albeit with heterogeneity across instruments in terms of direction, magnitude and significance. Our results do not point to a major role of newly introduced bank levies in explaining cross-border banking developments.
F30|Domestic and external sectoral portfolios: Network structure and balance-sheet contagion|This paper uses a unique comprehensive database on French security assets and liabilities to study the dynamics of domestic and external sectoral portfolios, their network structure, and their role in the propagation of shocks. We first show how the sharp deterioration of the net external portfolio position of France between 2008 and 2014 was driven by sectoral patterns such as the banking sector retrenchment and the increase in foreign liabilities of the public and corporate sectors, but was mitigated by the expansion of domestic and foreign asset portfolios of insurance companies. We also provide a network representation of the links between domestic sectors and the rest of the world, and document their evolution between 2008 and 2014. Second, we put forward and estimate a model of balance-sheet contagion through inter-sectoral security linkages. The estimation of the model through GMM shows that the financial sectors of the economy (banking, mutual fund, and insurance sector) are affected by balance-sheet contagion.
F30|International spillovers of monetary policy: Evidence from France and Italy|In this paper we provide empirical evidence on the impact of US and UK monetary policy changes on credit supply of banks operating in Italy and France over the period 2000–2015, exploring the existence of an international bank lending channel. Exploiting bank balance sheet heterogeneity, we find that monetary policy tightening abroad leads to a reduction of credit supply at home, in particular for US monetary policy changes. Our results show that USD funding plays an important role in the transmission mechanism, especially for French banks which rely to a larger extent on USD funding. We also show that banks adjust their euro and foreign currency lending differently, thus implying that funding sources in different currencies are not perfect substitutes. This is especially the case when tensions in currency swap markets are high, thus resulting in costly cross-currency funding.
F30|Gambling traps|I propose a dynamic general equilibrium model in which strategic interactions between banks and depositors may lead to endogenous bank fragility and slow recovery from crises. When banks’ investment decisions are not contractible, depositors form expectations about bank risk-taking and demand a return on deposits according to their risk. This creates strategic complementarities and possibly multiple equilibria: in response to an increase in funding costs, banks may optimally choose to pursue risky portfolios that undermine their solvency prospects. In a bad equilibrium, high funding costs hinder the accumulation of bank net worth and lead to a “gambling trap” with a persistent drop in investment and output. I bring the model to bear on the European sovereign debt crisis, in the course of which under-capitalized banks in default-risky countries experienced an increase in funding costs and raised their holdings of domestic government debt. The model is quantied using Portuguese data and accounts for macroeconomic dynamics in Portugal in 2010-2016. Policy interventions face a trade-off between alleviating banks’ funding conditions and strengthening risk-taking incentives. Liquidity provision to banks may perpetuate gambling traps when not targeted. Targeted interventions have the capacity to eliminate adverse equilibria.

F30|Measuring financial interdependence in asset returns with an application to euro zone equities|A general procedure is proposed to identify changes in asset return interdependence over time using entropy theory. The approach provides a decomposition of interdependence in terms of comoments including coskewness, cokurtosis and covolatility as well as more traditional measures based on second order moments such as correlations. A new diagnostic test of independence is also developed which incorporates these higher order comoments. The properties of the entropy interdependence measure are demonstrated using a number of simulation experiments, as well as applying the methodology to euro zone equity markets over the period 1990 to 2017.
F30|Speculative Activity and Returns to Volatility of Chinese Major Agricultural Commodity Futures|Chinese futures markets for agricultural commodities are among the fastest growing futures markets in the world and trading behaviour in those markets is perceived as highly speculative. Therefore, we empirically investigate whether speculative activity in Chinese futures markets for agricultural commodities destabilizes futures returns. To capture speculative activity a speculation and a hedging ratio are used. Applying GARCH models we first analyse the influence of both ratios on the conditional volatility of eight heavily traded Chinese futures contracts. Additionally, VAR models in conjunction with Granger causality tests, impulse-response analyses and variance decompositions are used to obtain insight into the lead-lag relationship between speculative activity and returns volatility. For most of the commodities, we find a positive influence of the speculation ratio on conditional volatility. The results relying on the hedging ratio are inconclusive.
F30|Green Bond Experience in the Nordic Countries|The global green bond market has grown rapidly in recent years, increasing from $3 billion in 2012 to over $100 billion in 2017. Given the broad acceptance and strong demand from investors, green bonds have emerged as an important financing solution, raising finance for climate change mitigation and adaptation investments, particularly in developing countries, where the need for such investments is significant. The Nordic region has pioneered the issuance of green bonds. The World Bank and Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, a leading Nordic financial services group, developed the green bond concept in 2008 in response to investors’ demand for climate-related investments. Since then, Nordic issuers have played a leading role in green bond issuance, particularly for local green finance. We summarize the Nordic experience with green bonds with a focus on local financing structures and highlight key points that may be of value for developing countries, particularly those in Asia and the Pacific, in exploring green bonds as a means to raise finance for climate change mitigation and adaptation investments.
F30|Dismissal Laws, Innovation, and Economic Growth|We show theoretically and empirically that dismissal laws—laws that impose hurdles on firing of employees—spur innovation and thereby economic growth. Theoretically, dismissal laws make it costly for firms to arbitrarily discharge employees. This enables firms to commit to not punish short-run failures of employees. Because innovation is inherently risky and employment contracts are incomplete, dismissal laws enable such commitment. Specifically, absent such laws, firms cannot contractually commit so ex ante. The commitment provided by dismissal laws encourages employees to exert greater effort in risky, but path-breaking, projects thereby fostering firm-level innovation. We provide empirical evidence supporting this thesis using the discontinuity provided by the passage of the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. Using the fact that this Act only applied to firms with 100 or more employees, I undertake difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity tests to provide this evidence. Building on endogenous growth theory, which posits that economic growth stems from innovation, I also show that dismissal laws correlate positively with economic growth. However, other forms of labor laws correlate negatively with economic growth and swamp the positive effect of dismissal laws.
F30|An Overview of Islamic Banking and Finance in Asia|The Islamic finance industry has grown substantially in Asia over the last 2 decades. The Muslim populations in different Asian countries, especially in Southeast Asia, are increasing. Rapid Muslim population growth and improving living standards may enhance the popularity of Islamic finance as a keen alternative to conventional financing mechanisms. In addition, investors from the Middle East and Asia are increasingly seeking to invest in products that are in line with their religious beliefs.
F30|Nonlinear and Asymmetric Exchange Rate Pass-Through to Consumer Prices In Nigeria: Evidence from a Smooth Transition Autoregressive Model|This paper examines the nonlinearities and asymmetries in the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) to consumer prices in Nigeria using quarterly time series data from 1986 to 2013 and the nonlinear smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) method. The standard literature assumes linearity and symmetry in the ERPT to consumer prices in a developing country, despite the importance and presence of potential asymmetries and nonlinearities which are generated by the presence of various factors such as menu costs, capacity constraints, market share objectives and production switching. This study develops a partial equilibrium microeconomic mark-up model to investigate asymmetric and nonlinear behaviour in the ERPT. The study confirms the presence of nonlinear ERPTs due to different inflation levels. The results also show asymmetric ERPTs in the appreciation and depreciation of exchange rates. The magnitude of the ERPT also depends on the size of the exchange rate change. The ERPT is higher during depreciation than during the appreciation episodes of the Naira; nonlinearity is more prevalent during the high inflationary period of the 1990s than in other periods. The policy implication of the results is that the government, despite temptations to do so, should avoid the devaluation of the Naira during high inflation periods in order to reduce the impact on consumer prices and the associated costs.
F30|Exchange Rate Pass-through to Consumer prices: Nigerian experience from 1986-2013|This paper examines the level and speed of exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) to consumer prices in Nigeria using a partial equilibrium microeconomic mark-up model with quarterly time series data from 1986 to 2013 applying the vector error correction model (VECM) incorporating structural breaks in exchange rates. It assesses the level of long-run ERPT, the speed of adjustments to the long-run equilibrium and the level of short-run ERPT. The results show high and statistically significant ERPT in the long-run in Nigeria. However, the short-run results show slow and insignificant adjustments of prices to its long-run equilibrium trend. The impulse response analyses also support the cointegration results showing the near zero response of consumer prices to exchange rate shocks. The variance decomposition results demonstrate the contribution of external shocks whereby the exchange rate shocks made some modest contribution to the domestic prices. The strong policy implication of these empirical results is that exchange rate stability plays a crucial role in controlling domestic consumer price inflation in Nigeria and comprable economies.
F30|The growing impact of US monetary policy on emerging financial markets: Evidence from India|Much research has been devoted to studying the international spillover effects of US monetary policy. However, a lot of the focus has been on the recent unconventional monetary policies undertaken by the Federal Reserve. Combining high frequency financial market data with a time-varying parameter approach we show that US monetary policy decisions have had significant effects on the Indian stock markets well before the use of unconventional policy tools and that these effects have gotten stronger over time. In addition to the conventional channel of surprise changes in the policy rate, we find that US monetary shocks are also transmitted through an uncertainty channel, which is especially important for announcements about large scale asset purchases (quantitative easing). Using firm level stock prices, we also show that the higher sensitivity of the aggregate response is uniform across the stock market and is not driven by the increased exposure of any specific industry to US monetary policy. Instead, our results suggest that it is driven by the portfolio decisions of foreign institutional investors and the exchange rate becoming more sensitive to US monetary policy.
F30|Sovereign risk and bank risk-taking|In European countries recently hit by a sovereign debt crisis, the share of domestic sovereign debt held by the national banking system has sharply increased, raising issues in their economic and financial resilience, as well as in policy design. This paper examines these issues by analyzing the banking equilibrium in a model with optimizing banks and depositors. To the extent that sovereign default causes bank losses also independently of their holding of domestic government bonds, under-capitalized banks have an incentive to gamble on these bonds. The optimal reaction by depositors to insolvency risk imposes discipline, but also leaves the economy susceptible to self-fulfilling shifts in sentiments, where sovereign default also causes a banking crisis. Policy interventions face a trade-off between alleviating funding constraints and strengthening incentives to gamble. Liquidity provision to banks may eliminate the good equilibrium when not targeted. Targeted interventions have the capacity to eliminate adverse equilibria.

F30|Implications of Brexit for developing countries’ agri-food trade|Brexit (the UK’s exit from the European Union) will have important repercussions for the agri-food trade of developing countries because of the UK’s size (it is the sixth largest economy in the world) and its important role as an importer of agri-food products (it accounts for 12% of the EU’s imports from developing countries). These effects will occur through a variety of different channels: the consequences of higher trade costs on UK-EU27 trade; possible changes in future UK tariff and trade policy after Brexit; possible changes in UK and EU27 agricultural policy; impacts on UK agricultural production capacity; and macroeconomic channels such as changes in future UK economic growth and the value of sterling. This paper reviews the potential significance of these changes, and makes recommendations as to how developing countries might respond to these changes
F30|The CAPM, National Stock Market Betas, and Macroeconomic Covariates: A Global Analysis|Using global data on aggregate stock market prices, this paper finds that the standard capital asset pricing model (CAPM) fares much better than suggested in the literature. At shorter time horizons, our results also show that the positive risk-reward relation can collapse during times of high volatility. Compared to advanced and emerging markets, we retrieve evidence of lower systematic risks across frontier stock market portfolios. We find that countries characterized by higher levels of financial and trade openness, exchange rate volatility, and larger economic size are exposed to higher systematic covariances with the world stock market. Conversely, we obtain evidence of an inverse link between international reserves and systematic risks in national equity.
F30|Flight to Safety from European Stock Markets|This paper investigates flight-to-safety from stocks to bonds in seven European markets. We use quantile regressions to identify flight-to-safety episodes. The simple risk-return trade-off on the stock markets is negative which is caused by flight-to-safety episodes: During normal periods, the risk-return trade-off is positive and during flight-to-safety episodes it is negative. The effects of flight-to-safety episodes on the risk-return trade-off are qualitatively similar for own country flight-to-safety episodes, for flight from own country stock market to the US bond market, and for US flight-to-safety. The strength of the trade-off is strongest for own country flight-to-safety episodes. The risk-return trade-off is not significantly influenced by recession periods or the recent sovereign debt crisis. The main results hold for flight to gold instead of to bonds.
F30|Openness and productivity of the Swiss economy|Abstract This paper analyzes the connection between openness and economic performance in Switzerland. Considering different dimensions of openness, we show that the Swiss economy is classified as relatively open. Nevertheless, there still is potential to further increase international integration, particularly through deregulation in the services sector. We also show that for some branches in the Swiss manufacturing sector, increases in international trade are associated with higher productivity in the long run. With regard to financial openness, we show that in the aftermath of the financial crisis, Switzerland mainly suffered from capital retrenchment. Foreign capital inflows were of minor importance. Short-run costs due to high volatility of capital flows might therefore be lower than widely perceived.
F30|Momentum and contrarian effects on the cryptocurrency market|We report the results of investigation of the momentum and contrarian effects on cryptocurrency markets. The investigated investment strategies involve 100 (amongst over 1200 present as of date Nov 2017) cryptocurrencies with the largest market cap and average 14-day daily volume exceeding a given threshold value. Investment portfolios are constructed using different assumptions regarding the portfolio reallocation period, width of the ranking window, the number of cryptocurrencies in the portfolio, and the percent transaction costs. The performance is benchmarked against: (1) equally weighted and (2) market-cap weighted investments in all of the ranked assets, as well as against the buy and hold strategies based on (3) S&P500 index, and (4) Bitcoin price. Our results show a clear and significant dominance of the short-term contrarian effect over both momentum effect and the benchmark portfolios. The information ratio coefficient for the contrarian strategies often exceeds two-digit values depending on the assumed reallocation period and the width of the ranking window. Additionally, we observe a significant diversification potential for all cryptocurrency portfolios with relation to the S&P500 index.
F30|Why you should not invest in mining endeavour? The efficiency of BTC mining under current market conditions|The main aim of this paper is to analyse the efficiency of BTC mining under current market conditions. After thorough analysis of initial assumptions concerning the (1) price of mining machine and its effective amortization period, (2) difficulty and hash rate of BTC network, (3) BTC transaction fees and (4) energy costs, we have found that currently BTC mining is not profitable, except for some rare cases. The main reason of this phenomenon is the fast and unpredictable increase of difficulty of BTC network over time which results in decreasing participation of our mining machines in BTC network hash rate. The research is augmented with detailed sensitivity analysis of mining efficiency to initial parameters assumptions, which allows to observe that the conditions for BTC mining to be efficient and profitable are very challenging to meet.

We estimate several versions of financial cycles for credit, housing, bond and equity markets as well as aggregate financial cycles for each country in the sample. To this end we use stationary and non-stationary dynamic factor models and state-space techniques to extract financial cycles as a common factor from a large number of variables conveying price, quantity and risk characteristics of financial markets.

F30|The pricing of FX forward contracts: micro evidence from banks’ dollar hedging|We use transaction-level data on foreign exchange (FX) forward contracts for the period 2014 through 2016 in conjunction with supervisory balance sheet information to study the drivers of banks’ dollar hedging costs. Comparing contracts of the same maturity that are initiated during the same hour of the same day, we find large heterogeneity in banks’ hedging costs. We show that these costs (i) are higher for banks with a larger FX funding gap, (ii) depend on banks’ FX funding composition in terms of the source (interbank versus retail) and rollover structure (long-term versus short-term), (iii) are lower for banks with deeper internal dollar capital markets, and (iv) increase with banks’ shadow cost of capital. Our results are important for understanding how shocks are transmitted internationally through the FX hedging market.
F30|The new global agenda and the future of the multilateral development bank system|The authors assess the role of the multilateral development system and the reforms needed to support the new global agenda. There is an urgency to the reforms. The coming decades will see the largest urban expansion in history. More infrastructure needs to be built in the next 15 years than the existing stock of infrastructure in the world. Multilateral development banks (MDBs) are uniquely placed to support policy and institutional reforms and build institutional capacity, enhance the quality of projects and programs, and scale up for transformative change. They are the best mechanism today for leveraging public resources. By our calculations, each dollar of paid-in capital could reasonably translate into $50 of public investments if properly allocated. Despite these inherent strengths, MDBs are constrained by their financial and institutional capacities, effectiveness of instruments, and unclear mandates and governance shortcomings. The authors suggest MDBs do more in three client groups: (i) fragile states; (ii) high-debt countries; and (iii) upper middle-income countries, adjusting strategies and use of instruments in each case. With so many issues on the table, they believe that the greatest risk to the system lies in active inertia, a tendency to make changes on the margin that fall short of a collective response that is scaled to the task at hand. Individual MDBs each perform well, according to evaluation results, but their impact could be enhanced if they cooperated more as a system and developed scalable platform approaches. Major expansion is not feasible under current business and financial models. Shareholders need to reach consensus on capital and governance to unlock the financial potential and effectiveness of the MDB system.
F30|Regime-switching determinants of emerging markets sovereign credit risk swaps spread|"Using the Markov regime switching approach, the authors investigate the dependency of short term sovereign credit default swap (SCDS) spread changes on a nation's country-specific fundamental factors, local, regional and macroeconomic global factors. They find that the significance of the determinants of SCDS spread changes differ across the two states of our regime-switching model. Specifically, in the ""good"" state the weekly SCDS spread changes are mainly determined by local, regional and fundamental factors; whereas global variables have stronger influence in the ""bad"" regime. In particular, US market returns play a dominant role in influencing the SCDS spread change in the ""bad"" state suggesting loss aversion and flight to quality behavior of investors. The authors then examine the cross-sectional differences of the above regime switching effect based on country-specific characters and find that the regime switching effect is associated with a nation's country-specific characters such as openness, economic size, etc."
F30|Did the Swiss exchange rate shock shock the market?|The Swiss National Bank abolished the exchange rate floor versus the Euro in January 2015. Based on a synthetic matching framework, we analyse the impact of this unexpected (and therefore exogenous) shock on the stock market. The results reveal a significant level shift (decline) in asset prices in Switzerland following the discontinuation of the minimum exchange rate. While adjustments in stock market returns were most pronounced directly after the news announcement, the variance was elevated for some weeks, indicating signs of increased uncertainty and potentially negative consequences for the real economy.
F30|Contagion and Information Frictions in Emerging Markets: The Role of Joint Signals|We show that information frictions can explain financial contagion without correlated fundamentals and explain why emerging markets are more susceptible to contagion. Costly information may cause investors to group country signals, because such imprecise signals are cheaper. These joint signals then cause asset prices to comove, which can be observed as contagion. Due to lower demand for country-specific information and lower risk weighted returns, it is likelier that investors group signals of emerging markets, thereby making them more prone to contagion. We find empirical evidence for our predictions using a novel data set on the number of joint news articles and exploit exogenous variation in news due to terrorism.
F30|Bank loan supply during crises: the importance of geographic diversification|We classify a large sample of banks according to the geographic diversification of their international syndicated loan portfolio. Our results show that diversified banks maintain higher loan supply during banking crises in borrower countries. The positive loan supply effects lead to higher investment and employment growth for firms. Diversified banks are stabilizing due to their ability to raise additional funding during times of distress, which also shields connected markets from spillovers. Further distinguishing banks by nationality reveals a pecking order: diversified domestic banks are the most stable source of funding, while foreign banks with little diversification are the most fickle. Our findings suggest that the decline in financial integration since the recent crisis increases countries’ vulnerability to local shocks.
F30|Una subasta doble de divisas para la determinación del tipo de cambio en Bolivia|Este estudio presenta un mecanismo competitivo de subasta doble para el mercado de divisas boliviano que permitiría al Banco Central de Bolivia (BCB), en su calidad de “martillero” dentro del mecanismo, conocer con mayor exactitud las condiciones que atraviesa dicho mercado y las expectativas de los principales actores en dicho mercado. Con esta valiosa información, y en el marco de los objetivos generales de preservar la estabilidad macroeconómica y fortalecer la producción local, consolidando el proceso de des-dolarización de la economía, la autoridad cambiaria contará con mayores recursos que le permitan aplicar una política cambiaria más activa y eficaz
F30|Corporate financialisation in South Africa: From investment strike to housing bubble|This article reveals the processes of financialisation in the South African economy by tracing the sources and destinations of NFCs' liquidity. The paper argues that rather than the volume of NFCs' financial investment, the composition of financial assets is crucial to assess corporate financialisation in the country. Non-financial businesses in South Africa fundamentally transformed their investment behaviour during the 1990s, shifting from more productive uses such as trade credit towards highly liquid and potentially innovative (and therefore risky) financial investment. Following the direction of financial flows the article shows that – fuelled by foreign capital inflows – companies' financial operations contributed to the price inflation in South African property markets.
F30|Diversification and Specialization of U.S. States|This paper documents the evolution of the international relationships of individual U.S. states along three dimensions: trade, migration, and finance. We examine how specialized or diversified state economies differ in terms of the products they export and with whom they trade, the origins of the immigrants who live in the state, and the origins of the foreign banks operating in the state. We show that states that are diversified along one of these dimensions are often quite specialized along others. New York is-perhaps, not surprisingly-the most diversified state in terms of global linkages.
F30|An Empirical Analysis of Nigeriaâ€™s Current Account Sustainability|This study reexamines the sustainability of the current account in Nigeria over four decades using time-series analysis on annual data from 1981 to 2013. We focus on two analytical distinctions to the inter-temporal budget constraint (IBC) hypothesis in relation to previous studies. First, we extend the standard bivariate approach to a multivariate framework that accounts for the roles of oil price variations and financial deepening, which have important implications for resource allocation. Second is the use of the Todaâ€“Yamamoto modified Wald (MWALD)-based causality test that is also carried out to arbitrage between the results with and without a structural break. It employs both the conventional unit root test (augmented Dickeyâ€“Fuller [ADF] and Phillipsâ€“Perron [PP]) and the unit root test with a structural break (Perron, 2006; Zivot & Andrews, 1992). It also carries out the conventional residual-based cointegration test (Engle & Granger, 1987) and the residual-based cointegration test with a structural break (Gregory & Hansen, 1995). Findings suggest that there is current account sustainability in Nigeria and structural changes were not very potent during the period under consideration. This implies that the Nigerian economy complied with the IBC hypothesis, suggesting that exports could actually finance imports. JEL Classification: F30, F32
F30|Domestic Factors and Episodes of Gross Capital Inflows| This paper extends the literature on gross capital flows by looking into domestic factors that covary significantly with cross-country differences in the transitional likelihoods of moving between episodes of capital inflows. Applying a state-transition framework, we view states of gross capital inflows as “normal”, “surge”, and “stop”. Abstracting from time-varying common cyclical components by using fixed-transitional likelihoods and average values of domestic factors, the findings show that cross-country variation in transitional likelihoods are strongly related to the duration and occurrence of previous episodes and less on idiosyncratic domestic factors. This implies limited scope in backing the trend on global financial cyclical flows.
F30|Does Non-intermediation Activity Tell us more in the Finance-Growth Nexus?|This paper provides new evidences on traditional finance-growth nexus via dividing financial services into intermediation and non-intermediation services and examines their relationships with economic growth. Applying time series cointegration techniques and Granger causality tests for eight OECD countries, several results are obtained. First, there exists a long-run equilibrium relationship among economic growth, intermediation activities, and non-intermediation activities in Austria, France, and Korea. Second, we find that financial intermediation services promote long-run economic growth in France and Korea, whereas non-intermediation services impede Austria?s long-term economic growth. Finally, the development of non-intermediation activities leads the development of intermediation activities in France and the Netherlands in the short-term. This paper emphasizes the importance of non-intermediation activities in the growth process and in the development of intermediation services as well.
F30|The Effect of International Trade on emerging economies: The case of India|"Past and current studies indicate that, India is one of the fastest growing and most attractive economies in the world and has emerged as a desirable destination for Foreign Investment. Since 1991 India has been operating under strict policies which restricted the economy from an International trade, this drove more protectionism than open market trade. Indian government since 1991 introduced economic reform measures, to stimulate the economy. These reform measures in fiscal, reduction on the level of tariffs based on a large number of imports, exchange rate, the use of the exchange rate as the instrument for export promotion and trade policies. However, the reforms that were implemented in the Indian were not very different from the reforms undertaken by developing countries, the only alteration would be the swiftness with which they are implemented. India has one of the advantages which is the stability of its political climate. The current government and party that is in power have held the political landscape in place under control and this is providing the investor-friendly environment. India has gained influence within the global economy, this is demonstrated by India position in the international institutions like (G-8, G-20) and the free trade arrears with ASEAN, EU. This is also reflected by the by India's willingness to adopt international best practices in the production of the range of goods and services. India has attracted U$195bn in FDI over the past 5 years. ?India?s GDP for 2013, valued at US$ 1.9 trillion at current prices is the 10th largest in the world"". The Indian government has a target of 8 per cent during the current Five Year Plan (2012-2017), for their economic growth, this is based on the demonstrated ability to sustain national economic growth.?This paper will elaborate more on the rationale to explore trade in India. Economic theory and empirical evidence have clearly established the links between Trade, Productivity, and Economic growth. Countries that have large internal markets have also benefited by integrating themselves into the world economy, and thus opening up their economies like South Africa and India as one of the BRICS countries. India is projected to be the fastest-growing economy in the world over the next several decades. Trading with different countries respectively has made India what it is regarded as trading hub of today after China in the BRICS Countries."
F30|Portfolio Rebalancing in Times of Stress|This paper investigates time variation in the dynamics of international portfolio equity flows. We extend the empirical model of Hau and Rey (2004) by embedding a two-state Markov regime-switching model into the structural VAR. The model is estimated using monthly data, 1995-2015, on equity returns, exchange rate returns and equity flows between the United States and advanced and emerging economies. We find that the data are consistent with portfolio rebalancing. The estimated states match periods of low and high financial stress. Our main result is that for equity flows between the United States and emerging markets, the rebalancing dynamics differ between episodes of high and low levels of financial stress. A switch from the low to the high-stress regime is associated with capital outflows from emerging markets. Once in the high stress regime, the response of capital flows to exchange rate shocks is smaller than in normal (low stress) periods.
F30|Resolution of international banks: Can smaller countries cope?|The stability of a banking system ultimately depends on the strength and credibility of the fiscal backstop. While large countries can still afford to resolve large global banks on their own, small and mediumâ€ sized countries face a policy choice. This paper investigates the impact of resolution on banking structure. The financial trilemma model suggests that smaller countries can either conduct joint supervision and resolution of their global banks (based on single point of entry resolution) or reduce the size of their global banks and move to separate resolution of these banks' national subsidiaries (based on multiple point of entry resolution). Euroâ€ area countries are heading for joint resolution based on burden sharing, while the United Kingdom and Switzerland have implemented policies to downsize their banks.
F30|Volatility : As a Driving Factor of Stock Market Co-movement|There is a strand of finance literature showing that correlation between markets increases during times of high volatility. This paper revisits this finding by comparing contribution of relative volatility to correlations between S&P 500 Index returns and global equity markets' returns before and after the Global Financial Crisis. Our results show that degree and direction of contribution of volatility to correlation has changed in some countries after the crisis. It has implications in the context of international portfolio diversification to reduce portfolio risks. In addition, introducing an extended version of contagion analysis helps to identify contagion and interdependence effects in more detail.
F30|International Investment Patterns: the Case of German Sectors|Abstract In this paper we exploit the newly augmented Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey data of the IMF to study the cross-border inter-sectoral portfolio asset holdings of Germany. Our analysis reveals a significant degree of heterogeneity in the international asset positions of various German holding entities. The findings of our study also suggest differential relations between portfolio holdings and a set of “gravity-style” factors across holder-issuer pairings of various sectors. We conclude that aggregate-level patterns in international portfolio holdings may not persist in inter-sectoral data.
F30|Cross-Border Banking and Macroeconomic Determinants|This paper studies the bilateral determinants of the international asset positions of banks, and subsequent bilateral adjustment during the global financial crisis and ensuing recovery phase. We find empirical support for traditional gravity-type variables. Exploiting a comprehensive dataset of bilateral bank assets, combined with a cross-country database on capital controls and macroeconomic policies, empirical evidence is provided for the effects of macroeconomic tools on the portfolio reallocation of internationally active banks. Specifically, higher current account balances in recipient countries are associated with higher inflows in debt assets, while restrictions on asset inflows and higher central bank reserves are related to lower cross-border flows of bank investment during the crisis and post-crisis periods, with heterogeneous effects across asset type. Finally, stronger institutions in recipient countries are positively associated with the international investment of banks, with inflows to debt assets being the most sensitive asset category across the financial cycle.
F30|EMU Stability: Direct and Indirect Risk Sharing|Abstract Our paper aims to analyze the effectiveness of different risk-sharing mechanisms in providing stability to a monetary union. We select two stylized tools with extreme and opposite features. The first is an expansionary but conventional monetary policy that is used to help EMU’s most fragile member states manage their public debts; the second is a centralized fiscal policy that allows for the transfer of a portion of these public debts from EMU’s most fragile member states to those considered EMU’s “core”. By a stylized periphery-core model of a monetary union, we compare the strengths and weaknesses of these two tools in order to reach some welfare implications in terms of union stability.
F30|Takeovers and (excess) CEO compensation|We study if a CEO’s equity-based compensation affects the expected value generation in takeovers. When the objectives of management and shareholders are more aligned, as proxied by the use of equity-based compensation, more value-maximizing acquisitions are expected. Whereas in widely-held firms the decision power is with the management, in firms with concentrated ownership the decision power may be with major blockholders. This may entail that ownership concentration and equity-based pay are substitutes. We find a strongly positive relation between equity-based compensation and cumulative abnormal announcement returns at takeovers, but this relation is eroded when dominant share blocks are held by corporations, which confirms the substitution effect. Powerful CEOs in companies with weak boards and without actively monitoring shareholders may set their own pay which could lead to excesses. We relate excess pay to how takeover decisions are received by the market, and demonstrate that excess compensation negatively affects the acquirer’s stock valuation at a takeover announcement. The market is thus able to identify firms with agency problems and is cautious in its expectations about potential value creation by means of acquisitions.
F30|Resolving International Macro Puzzles with Imperfect Risk Sharing and Global Solution Methods|Do gross international asset positions matter for macroeconomic outcomes? In this paper, we argue that they do. In particular, we demonstrate that asset market incompleteness which features a meaningful portfolio choice can resolve the Backus-Smith puzzle: that relative consumptions and real exchange rates are negatively correlated. Because income and nominal exchange rates are positively correlated, countries choose a portfolio that features home bias in bond holdings, which is common in the data. We compare our findings to the predictions of alternative asset market structures frequently used in the literature - such as complete markets or restricting assets to a single bond - and show that they cannot solve the Backus-Smith puzzle without further frictions. We also show that local perturbation methods that use endogenous discount factors to stabilize the model are inaccurate, even when they correctly characterize the average portfolio holdings. Instead, we use a novel global solution method to accurately solve the portfolio problem when asset markets are incomplete, using an approach that generalizes Maliar and Maliar (2015) to solve a wide class of models.
F30|International financial integration, crises and monetary policy: evidence from the Euro area interbank crises|We analyze how international financial integration is affected by the recent financial and sovereign crises, exploiting euro-area proprietary interbank data, crisis and monetary shocks, and loan terms to the same borrower during the same day by domestic versus foreign lenders. Crisis shocks reduce the supply of cross-border liquidity, with stronger volume than pricing effects, thereby impairing international financial integration. On the extensive margin, the cross-border credit crunch is independently of quality. On the intensive margin, however, GIPSheadquartered debtor banks suffer in the Lehman crisis, but effects are stronger in the sovereign-debt crisis, especially for riskier banks. Consistent with asymmetric information being the key driver, the cross-border liquidity crunch is stronger for longer-term loans, and weaker for foreign lender banks that are located in the same country than the borrower. Nonstandard monetary policy improves interbank liquidity, but without fostering strong cross-border financial reintegration.
F30|The Effects of Data Transparency Policy Reforms on Emerging Market Sovereign Bond Spreads|We find that data transparency policy reforms, reflected in subscriptions to the IMF’s Data Standards Initiatives (SDDS and GDDS), reduce the spreads of emerging market sovereign bonds. To overcome endogeneity issues regarding a country’s decision to adopt such reforms, we first show that the reform decision is largely independent of its macroeconomic development. By using an event study, we find that subscriptions to the SDDS or GDDS leads to a 15 percent reduction in the spreads one year following such reforms. This finding is robust to various sensitivity tests, including careful consideration of the interdependence among the structural reforms.
F30|The Impact of US Financial Uncertainty Shocks on Emerging Market Economies: An International Credit Channel|Abstract I document that US financial uncertainty shocks, measured by an increase in VIX, have a substantial impact on the output of emerging market economies (EMEs) without a material impact on US output during the last two decades. To understand this puzzling phenomenon, I propose a credit channel as a propagation mechanism of US financial uncertainty shocks to EMEs. I augment a boom-bust cycle model of EMEs by Schneider and Tornell (Rev Econ Stud 71(3):883–913 2004) with a portfolio choice model of constrained international investors. As international investors pull their money from EMEs—to satisfy their Value-at-Risk constraints—in response to financial uncertainty shocks, borrowing costs increase and domestic credit contracts. Higher borrowing costs and a decline in domestic credit, in turn, lead to a fall in investment in the non-tradable sector that causes a real depreciation via currency mismatch prevalent in EMEs and a decline in total output through sectoral linkages. The empirical regularity obtained by estimating structural VARs of 18 EMEs is consistent with the prediction of the model.
F30|Macroprudential policy and intra-group dynamics: The effects of reserve requirements in Brazil|This paper examines whether intra-group dynamics matter for the transmission of macroprudential policy. Using novel bank-level data on the Brazilian banking system, we investigate the effect of reserve requirements targeting headquarter banks' deposit share on credit supply by their municipal bank branches. For identification purposes, we exploit that reserve requirements are adjusted following global economic cycles. Our results reveal a lending channel of reserve requirements for branches whose parent banks are more exposed to targeted deposits. Branch ownership and exposure to internal liquidity are central in explaining the results. Our findings reveal limitations in current macroprudential policy frameworks.
F30|Delay determinants of European Banking Union implementation|Most countries in the European Union (EU) delay the transposition of European Commission (EC) directives, which aim at reforming banking supervision, resolution, and deposit insurance. We compile a systematic overview of these delays to investigate if they result from strategic considerations of governments conditional on the state of their financial, regulatory, and political systems. Transposition delays pertaining to the three Banking Union directives differ considerably across the 28 EU members. Bivariate regression analyses suggest that existing national bank regulation and supervision drive delays the most. Political factors are less relevant. These results are qualitatively insensitive to alternative estimation methods and lag structures. Multivariate analyses highlight that well-stocked deposit insurance schemes speed-up the implementation of capital requirements, banking systems with many banks are slower in implementing new bank rescue and resolution rules, and countries with a more intensive sovereign-bank nexus delay the harmonization of EU deposit insurance more.
F30|Does trade openness contribute to driving financing flows for development?|Trade has been recognized in the 2030 development Agenda as well as in the Addis Ababa Agenda for Action as an important means for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper questions whether trade openness could be an important driver of financing for development flows, notably development aid (ODA), Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows, and government public revenue, the latter being the ultimate financing source for development for any country. The paper also takes advantage of the framework of analysis to investigate the interplay between these three types of financial flows. Relying on an unbalanced panel dataset comprising 125 countries, of which 37 are Least Developed Countries (LDCs), the empirical analysis uses the three stage least squares econometric approach and provides two important pieces of evidence: first, international trade openness is an important tool for driving financial flows for development, including government public revenue, development aid and FDI. As a result, it could contribute to mobilizing the substantial financial resources needed for development, including for the implementation of the SDGs. Second, there are strong interactions (complementarity and substitutability) between these three types of financing for development flows.
F30|Assessing marginal, threshold, and net effects of financial globalisation on financial development in Africa|This paper contributes to the extant literature by simultaneously accounting for variations in financial development and financial globalisation in the assessment of hypothetical initial financial development conditions for the rewards of financial globalisation. For this purpose, we examine marginal, threshold and net effects of financial globalisation on financial development throughout the conditional distributions of financial development. The empirical evidence is based on contemporary and non-contemporary quantile regressions with data from 53 African countries for the period 1996–2011. Financial globalisation is measured with net foreign direct investment inflows, whereas financial development entails all dimensions identified by the Financial Development and Structure Database of the World Bank. The findings consistently reveal (i) positive marginal effects, (ii) unfeasible financial globalisation positive thresholds and (iii) negative financial globalisation net effects. The second and third findings are fundamentally due to marginal effects of low positive magnitude. Policy implications are discussed.
F30|Does Globalization Promote Good Governance in Africa? An Empirical Study Across 51 countries|This study investigates the effect of globalisation on governance in 51 African countries for the period 1996-2011. Four bundled governance indicators and four globalisation (political, economic, social and general) variables are used. The empirical evidence is based on Instrumental Variable Quantile Regressions. The motivation for the estimation technique is that blanket governance-globalisation policies are not likely to succeed unless they are contingent on initial levels of governance and tailored differently across countries with low, intermediate and high levels of governance. The following findings are established. First, globalisation promotes good governance. Second, for the most part, the effect of globalisation is higher in terms of magnitude in the bottom quantiles of the political, institutional and general governance distributions. Third, the impact of globalisation is overwhelmingly higher in terms of magnitude in the top quantiles of the economic governance distribution.
F30|Globalization and Terror in Africa|This study examines the role of globalization on terrorism in 51 African countries for the period 1996-2011. Four terrorism indicators are used, namely: domestic, transnational, unclear and total terrorism. Political, economic, social and general globalisation variables are employed and the empirical evidence is based on Fixed Effects regressions and Generalised Method of Moments (GMM). Whereas the FE regressions are overwhelmingly not significant, the following findings are established from GMM estimations. Political globalisation increases both domestic and transnational terrorism. Social globalisation and general globalisation increase transnational terrorism. Economic globalisation reduces domestic terrorism. Political globalisation, social globalisation and general globalization positively affect unclear terrorism. Social globalisation has a positive impact on total terrorism. Possible channels and policy implications are discussed.

F30|Strategic Complementarities and Money Market Fund Liquidity Management|Following the financial crisis, there has been increased regulatory focus on the management of liquidity in mutual funds and, specifically, whether funds hold enough liquidity to guard against the potential for investor runs. Using a novel, detailed regulatory dataset on the portfolio holdings of US money market funds, I find that internal prime money market funds—those that manage the liquidity of other funds in the fund family—have lower liquidity than external prime funds. This suggests that money market funds hold more liquidity to reduce the potential for strategic complementarities (i.e., incentives to run) in investor redemptions, because the family funds that invest in these internal funds should be able to coordinate their redemption decisions. Additionally, at quarter ends, when non-US bank dealers reduce their repo funding (Munyan, 2015), I find that prime money market funds reduce their overnight liquidity, which consists primarily of overnight repos. External prime money market funds do not let this decreased cash demand from non-US bank dealers reduce their liquidity as much as internal funds do. This all suggests that these external prime money market funds are more concerned about overnight liquidity, consistent with greater concern about potential investor strategic complementarities.
F30|A quantitative analysis of risk premia in the corporate bond market|We propose an econometric model to decompose corporate bond spreads into compensation required by investors for unpredictable future changes in the credit environment and for expected default losses. We use the model to understand whether the significant reduction in corporate bond spreads observed since the launch of the CSPP (Corporate Sector Purchase Programme) is attributable more to the fact that expansionary monetary policy measures tend to increase the risk appetite of investors and compress risk premia, or to the ability of unconventional measures to reduce expected default losses by improving investors’ expectations about the economic and financial conditions of issuers.
F30|Currency Mismatch in the Banking Sector in Latin America and the Caribbean|Existing literature uses data based on the residence principle to proxy for currency mismatch. Nonetheless, these data are frequently not disaggregated by currency and cannot identify mismatches in the domestic market. This paper circumvents these issues by constructing a new data set on foreign currency assets and liabilities in the banking sector in Latin America and the Caribbean. The new data reveal a reduction in long foreign currency positions, with several countries taking short positions after 2006. Moreover, employing a methodology that accounts for time-varying unobservable characteristics, this reduction is shown to be partially explained by the implementation of prudential policies.

F30|What happened to global banking after the crisis?|Purpose - Large global banks were at the heart of the global financial crisis. In response to the crisis, the Financial Stability Board published an integrated set of policy measures, such as capital surcharges, to address the systemic and moral hazard risks associated with global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). Almost 10 years later, it is time to take stock of the impact of these measures. This paper answers three questions on what happened to the G-SIBs. First, have they shrunk in size? Second, are they better capitalised? Third, have they reduced their global reach? Design/methodology/approach - This paper looks at the individual G-SIBs and compares the situation before the crisis with the current situation. In this methodology, the differences because of changes at individual banks and changes in the ranking within the group (composition effect) are disentangled. Data have been collected on these banks from SNL Financial (banking database) and annual reports. Findings - First, a substantial increase in capital levels is seen, though the distribution is uneven. China and USA are leading the pact with leverage ratios (Tier 1 capital divided by total assets) of around 7 per cent for their large banks, whereas Europe and Japan are trailing behind with ratios between 4 and 5 per cent. Second, a strong composition effect is identified: a shift of business from the global European banks to the more domestic Asian banks, which are gradually increasing their global reach. The US banks keep their strong position. So, the decline in cross-border banking is largely because of a composition effect (i.e. a reshuffle of the global banking champions league) and far less due to a reduced global reach of individual banks. Research limitations/implications - From the results on capital, recommendations are made on capital requirements (see below at social implications). Social implications - It is noted that the euro area, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland trail behind with a leverage ratio between 4 and 5 per cent. It is recommended these countries bring the leverage ratio of their largest banks more in line with international practice. Originality/value - The effects of the reform after the global financial crisis on the large global banks have not been researched in detail. This paper split the results by country of incorporation (home country). This gives interesting differences, which the paper relates to specific policies (or lack of policies) in these countries.
F30|Inflation, Default, and the Currency Composition of Sovereign Debt in Emerging Economies: Working Paper 2017-01|In emerging market economies, governments issue debt denominated both in their own currency and in foreign currencies. I develop a theory of the optimal composition of sovereign debt between local and foreign currencies. In a model with a micro-founded monetary framework a government controls monetary policy and has the ability to borrow from abroad using both local and foreign currency bonds. In this model, local currency bonds differ from foreign currency bonds in two important ways. Unlike foreign currency bonds, local currency bonds function as a contingent claim,
F30|“Whatever it takes” to resolve the European sovereign debt crisis? Bond pricing regime switches and monetary policy effects|This paper investigates the role of unconventional monetary policy as a source of time-variation in the relationship between sovereign bond yield spreads and their fundamental determinants. We use a two-step empirical approach. First, we apply a time-varying parameter panel modelling framework to determine shifts in the pricing regime characterising sovereign bond markets in the euro area over the period January 1999 to July 2016. Second, we estimate the impact of ECB policy interventions on the time-varying risk factor sensitivities of spreads. Our results provide evidence of a new bond-pricing regime following the announcement of the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme in August 2012. This regime is characterised by a weakened link between spreads and fundamentals, but with higher spreads relative to the pre-crisis period and residual redenomination risk. We also find that unconventional monetary policy measures affect the pricing of sovereign risk not only directly, but also indirectly through changes in banking risk. Overall, the actions of the ECB have operated as catalysts for reversing the dynamics of the European sovereign debt crisis.
F30|What slice of the pie? The corporate bond market boom in emerging economies|This paper studies the determinants of shifts in debt composition among emerging market non-financial corporates. We show that the determinants of bond market access in EMs vary with global cyclical conditions and across local and foreign currency markets. We find that the role for institutions and macro fundamentals in creating an enabling environment for markets increased during the post-crisis period for local currency markets. Foreign bank linkages additionally explain why local currency bond markets increasingly substituted for banks in channeling liquidity to EMs. In the case of foreign currency markets, in turn, global cyclical factors accounted for most of the variation. Furthermore, a country’s relative sensitivity to global factors appears to vary with the size of its foreign currency bond market rather than local fundamentals. Our results highlight the risk of capital flow reversal in those EMs that benefited from the upturn in the global financial cycle mostly due to the relative size of their bond markets rather than strong fundamentals.
F30|Expanding Global Liquidity Insurance: Myths and Realities of the IMF’s Precautionary Credit Lines - Working Paper 449|Despite increasing volatility in the global economy, the uptake of the IMF’s two precautionary credit lines, the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) and the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL), has remained limited—currently to just four countries. The two new lending instruments were created in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008 to enable IMF member states to respond quickly and effectively to temporary balance of payment needs resulting from external shocks. Both credit lines offer immediate access to considerable sums—over 10 times a country’s IMF quota in some cases with no (FCL) or very limited (PLL) conditionality. This paper addresses four misconceptions (or ‘myths’) that have likely played a role in the limited utilization of the two precautionary credit lines: 1) too stringent qualification criteria that limit country eligibility; 2) insufficient IMF resources; 3) high costs of precautionary borrowing; and 4) the economic stigma associated with IMF assistance. We show, in fact, that the pool of eligible member states is likely to be seven to eight times larger than the number of current users; that with the 2016 quota reform IMF resources are more than adequate to support a larger precautionary portfolio; that the two IMF credit lines are among the least costly and most advantageous instruments for liquidity support countries have; and that there is no evidence of negative market developments for countries now participating in the precautionary lines.
F30|Gradual Portfolio Adjustment: Implications for Global Equity Portfolios and Returns|Modern open economy macro models assume the continuous adjustment of international portfolio allocation. We introduce gradual portfolio adjustment into a global equity market model. Our approach di ffers from related literature in two key dimensions. First, the time interval between portfolio decisions is stochastic rather than fi xed, leading to a smoother response to shocks. Second, rather than only considering asset returns, we also use data on portfolio shares to confront the model to the data. Conditional on reasonable risk aversion, we fi nd that the data is consistent with infrequent portfolio decisions, with a frequency of at most once in 15 months on average.
F30|Can We Use Volatility to Diagnose Financial Bubbles? Lessons from 40 Historical Bubbles|We inspect the price volatility before, during, and after financial asset bubbles in order to uncover possible commonalities and check empirically whether volatility might be used as an indicator or an early warning signal of an unsustainable price increase and the associated crash. Some researchers and finance practitioners believe that historical and/or implied volatility increase before a crash, but we do not see this as a consistent behavior. We examine forty well-known bubbles and, using creative graphical representations to capture robustly the transient dynamics of the volatility, find that the dynamics of the volatility would not have been a useful predictor of the subsequent crashes. In approximately two-third of the studied bubbles, the crash follows a period of lower volatility, reminiscent of the idiom of a “lull before the storm”. This paradoxical behavior, from the lenses of traditional asset pricing models, further questions the general relationship between risk and return.
F30|Disentangling the relationship between liquidity and returns in Latin America|We dissect the impact of liquidity on returns of firms in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, using a detailed data set of firm characteristics over various market cycles. We find that firm-level liquidity (illiquidity) is positively (negatively) associated with returns, and that global illiquidity and endogenously determined crisis periods are negatively associated with returns. In contrast to the majority of the literature on developed markets, our results indicate that liquidity is a less important risk factor in Latin America. Our findings suggest that improvements in firm-level liquidity will enhance returns and reduce the vulnerability of returns to global illiquidity.
F30|External debt and monetary policy autonomy|During a time of rising world interest rates, the central bank of a small open economy may be motivated to increase its own interest rate to keep from suffering a destabilizing outflow of capital and depreciation in the exchange rate. Empirically, this paper shows that this is especially true for a small open economy with a current account deficit, which relies on foreign capital inflows to finance this deficit. In addition, the method of current account financing has a large effect on whether or not the central bank will opt for exchange rate and capital flow stabilization during a time of rising world interest rates. A current account deficit financed mainly through reserve depletion or the accumulation of private sector debt will cause the central bank to pursue de facto exchange rate stabilization, whereas a current account deficit financed through equity or FDI will not. Quantitatively, reserve depletion of about 7% of GDP will motivate the central bank with a floating currency to adjust its interest rate in line with the foreign interest rate to where it appears that the central bank has an exchange rate peg.

El presente artículo muestra de manera empírica que esto es especialmente cierto para una economía abierta pequeña con un déficit en cuenta corriente, la cual depende de la entrada de capital extranjero para financiar su déficit. Asimismo, el método de financiación de cuenta corriente tiene un efecto importante sobre si el banco central optará o no por la estabilización de la tasa del cambio y flujo de capital durante un periodo de alza de tasa de interés mundial. Un déficit de cuenta corriente financiado fundamentalmente con el agotamiento de la reserva o la acumulación de deuda procedente del sector privado ocasionará que el banco central busque de facto la estabilización de la tasa de cambio, mientras que un déficit de cuenta corriente que se financie mediante la venta de acciones o inversión extranjera directa no lo hará. Desde el punto de vista cuantitativo, un agotamiento de la reserva de un 7% del PIB motivará que el banco central con moneda flotante ajuste su tasa de interés en línea con la tasa de interés extranjera con la que parezca que el banco central tiene fijado un tipo de cambio.
F30|Estructura de varianzas entre el mercado financiero mundial y de Colombia|Este trabajo tiene como objetivo analizar, a través de un análisis econométrico de las series de tiempo de los índices de Morgan Stanley en los últimos 5 años, las variaciones de los precios de los títulos de valor que cotizan en el mercado bursátil de Colombia y su comportamiento con respecto al resto del mundo. Con este propósito, se estimará un modelo DCC GARCH y se realizará una inspección en las cuentas de la balanza de pagos para explicar sus fluctuaciones. Los resultados obtenidos apuntan hacia una baja integración del país al mercado financiero mundial como resultado de la disminución en la entrada de capitales durante el periodo observado.
F30|The World We Live In: Local or Global?|In this paper, we document economically and statistically large differences in the cost of equity by comparing an international CAPM to a domestic CAPM. We consider fifteen countries over a nearly twenty-year period (1996 -2015). While the application of the international version of the CAPM in cases where an international market index is used as a pricing factor would seem justified by increased capital market integration, the empirical evidence on this has been inconclusive to date. We found that the average difference in the cost of equity between the models was equal to 0.77%, which represents about 20% of the historical risk premium. Moreover, for almost 20% of the companies, this difference in cost of equity is also statistically significant. For these companies the difference in cost of equity is equal to 1.49%. We therefore conclude that the ICAPM is increasingly becoming the relevant model for cost of equity calculations.
F30|International Monetary Relations: Taking Finance Seriously|In this essay, we highlight the interactions of the international monetary system with financial conditions, not just with the output, inflation, and balance of payments goals usually discussed. We review how financial conditions and outright financial crises have posed difficulties for each of the main international monetary systems in the last 150 years or so: the gold standard, the interwar period, the Bretton Woods system, and the current system of floating exchange rates. We argue that even as the world economy has evolved and sentiments have shifted among widely different policy regimes, there remain three fundamental challenges for any international monetary and financial system: How should exchange rates between national currencies be determined? How can countries with balance of payments deficits reduce these without sharply contracting their economies and with minimal risk of possible negative spillovers abroad? How can the international system ensure that countries have access to an adequate supply of international liquidity—financial resources generally acceptable to foreigners in all circumstances? In concluding, we evaluate how the current international monetary system answers these questions.
F30|Institutions and Political Party Systems: The Euro Case|This paper argues that institutions and political party systems are simultaneously determined. A large change to the institutional framework, such as the creation of the euro by a group of European countries, will realign – after a transition period – the party system as well. The new political landscape may not be compatible with the institutions that triggered it. To illustrate this point, we study the case of the euro and how the party system has evolved in Southern and Northern European countries in response to it.

F30|Financial Integration and Valuation Effects: Globalisation or Americanization?|"The paper studies the international financial integration of the G20 economies, including the underlying valuation effects. We find that international financial integration is a salient phenomenon across advanced economies, dominated by the US as the historical financial hegemon. Furthermore, we identify positive valuation effects across advanced economies, at times as large as 75% of their cumulative GDP. After the crisis, these effects have been mainly the result of large positive valuations on the US stock of foreign liabilities driven both by structural as well as cyclical factors of the US economy. Our analysis also suggests that the international financial integration may not be as ""global"" as perceived, but a limited number of advanced economies hold the greater amount of external assets and liabilities, and thus, are most exposed to the identified valuation effects in the US. In this context, a balanced policy mix in the US, aimed at lifting productivity and potential growth, could strengthen the contribution of the structural drivers to the US valuation effects, therefore minising the likelihood and potential impact of any cyclical corrections."
F30|Portfolio rebalancing in times of stress|This paper investigates time variation in the dynamics of international portfolio equity ﬂows. We extend the empirical model of Hau and Rey (2004) by embedding a two-state Markov regime-switching model into the structural VAR. The model is estimated using monthly data for the period 1995-2015 on equity returns, exchange rate returns and equity ﬂows between the United States and advanced and emerging economies. We ﬁnd that the data are consistent with portfolio rebalancing. The estimated states match periods of low and high ﬁnancial stress. Our main result is that for equity ﬂows between the United States and emerging markets, the rebalancing dynamics diﬀer between high and low episodes of ﬁnancial stress. A switch from the low to the high stress regime is associated with capital outﬂows from emerging markets. Once in the high stress regime, the response of capital ﬂows to exchange rate shocks is smaller than in normal (low stress) periods.
F30|Risk Taking and Interest Rates; Evidence from Decades in the Global Syndicated Loan Market|We study how low interest rates in the United States affect risk taking in the market of crossborder leveraged corporate loans. To the extent that actions of the Federal Reserve affect U.S. interest rates, our analysis provides evidence of a cross-border spillover effect of monetary policy. We find that before the crisis, lenders made ex-ante riskier loans to non- U.S. borrowers in response to a decline in short-term U.S. interest rates, and, after it, in response to a decline in longer-term U.S. interest rates. Economic uncertainty and risk appetite appear to play a limited role in explaining ex-ante credit risk. Our results highlight the potential policy challenges faced by central banks in affecting credit risk cycles in their own jurisdictions.
F30|Default risk, sectoral reallocation, and persistent recessions|Sovereign debt crises are associated with large and persistent declines in economic activity, disproportionately so for nontradable sectors. This paper documents this pattern using Spanish data and builds a two-sector, dynamic quantitative model of sovereign default with capital accumulation. Recessions are very persistent in the model and more pronounced for nontraded sectors because of default risk. An adverse domestic shock increases the likelihood of default, limits capital inflows, and thus restricts the ability of the economy to exploit investment opportunities. The economy responds by reducing investment and reallocating capital toward the traded sector to support debt service payments. The real exchange rate depreciates, a reflection of the scarcity of traded goods. We find that these mechanisms are quantitatively important for rationalizing the experience of Spain during the recent debt crisis.

F30|Sovereign Risk Contagion|We develop a theory of sovereign risk contagion based on financial links. In our multi-country model, sovereign bond spreads comove because default in one country can trigger default in other countries. Countries are linked because they borrow, default, and renegotiate with common lenders, and the bond price and recovery schedules for each country depend on the choices of other countries. A foreign default increases the lenders’ pricing kernel, which makes home borrowing more expensive and can induce a home default. Countries also default together because by doing so they can renegotiate the debt simultaneously and pay lower recoveries. We apply our model to the 2012 debt crises of Italy and Spain and show that it can replicate the time path of spreads during the crises. In a counterfactual exercise, we find that the debt crisis in Spain (Italy) can account for one-half (one-third) of the increase in the bond spreads of Italy (Spain).
F30|Rebalancing in China: a taxation approach|The rebalancing of the Chinese economy is analyzed through a heterogeneous taxation of various types of firms. Based on a two-country dynamic general equilibrium model, the paper applies tax reforms to raise consumption, reduce some firms' overinvestment and maintain a high level of welfare. To rebalance consumption and investment, taxation may allow reallocating a part of the labor force to firms that are not overinvesting. Moreover, the correction of distortions in production factor costs (capital and labor) is necessary during certain reforms applied in the model; that is, on the one hand, higher credit costs for State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and, on the other hand, a catch-up of foreign firms' wages by domestic firms (public and private). In this model, firms' credit cost is a key channel because it impacts both firms' investment and household consumption (through returns on savings). These consumption and investment reforms bring welfare benefits to households, and the results are close to direct welfare maximization. In this framework, the rebalancing of the domestic demand does not require the readjustment of the external financial position because the aggregate savings rate remains high and the supply of domestic assets is reduced. Finally, another theoretical framework proposes a heterogeneous taxation of consumption across home and foreign goods to enhance consumption.
F30|Do bond credit ratings lead to excess comovement?|We investigate whether non-fundamental comovement results from investors using credit ratings to group assets into different “styles”. We find that bonds that join a new rating class start comoving more with the bonds in this class, even when fundamental factors suggest otherwise. We show that this comovement effect varies according to the nature of the bond considered, and the modalities of the rating action. Downgrades have a larger impact than upgrades, and rating reviews matter as much as actual movements. Finally, rating changes between grades BBB and BB, which lead bonds to be reclassified as either “high-yield” or “investment grade” assets, seem to be of particular importance.
F30|Understanding the decision-making process of sovereign wealth funds: The case of Temasek|Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) have been increasingly active over the past decade, with governments raising concern regarding their actual motives and the potential for cross-border interest in national strategic sectors. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the existing literature by improving our understanding of the decisions being taken by this new class of investors. The decision-making process informing such investments is complex in the sense that it involves several levels of decision that may potentially interact. In this study, we investigate the determinants of SWFs' foreign investments, while considering in a single model the sequence of choices involved in their decisions, specifically (i) the decision to invest abroad or not, (ii) the decision to invest in a listed versus unlisted firm, and (iii) the decision to take large versus small stakes. Using a nested logit approach on one of the largest SWFs, the Singaporean fund Temasek, over the period 1990–2010, we provide clear evidence of dependence in the three levels of decision making considered. In addition, we show that the probability of Temasek's cross-border investment increases with the excess of foreign exchange (FX) reserves, that the SWF tends to target unlisted firms when asymmetry of information is low between the target company and its home country, and that its involvement in large stakes depends on a firm's financial characteristics.
F30|The role of international reserves holding in buffering external shocks| An extended literature analyses the accumulation foreign exchange holding observed in many developing and emerging countries since the 2000s. Empirical studies on the self-insurance motive suggest that high-reserves economies are more resilient to financial crises and to international capital inflows volatility. They show also that pre-crisis foreign reserve accumulation explains post-crisis growth. However, some papers suggest that the relationship between international reserves holding and reduced vulnerability is nonlinear, meaning that reserve holding is subject to diminishing returns. This article devotes more attention to the potential nonlinear relationship between the foreign reserves holding and macroeconomic resilience to shocks. For a sample of nine emerging economies, we assess to what extent the accumulation of international reserves allows to mitigate negative impacts of external shocks on the output gap. While a major part of the literature focuses on the global financial crisis, we investigate this question by considering two sub-periods: 1995–2003 and 2004–2013. We implement threshold VAR model in which the structure is allow to change if the threshold variable crosses a certain estimated threshold. We find that the effectiveness of reserve holding to improve the resilience of domestic economies to shocks has increased over time. Hence, the diminishing returns of foreign reserve holding stressed in the previous literature must be qualified.
F30|The Long Memory of Equity Volatility: International Evidence|This paper examines long memory volatility in international stock markets. We show that long memory volatility is widespread in eighty-two countries and that the degree of memory can be related to macroeconomic variables such as inflation, unemployment rates, interest rates or stability of a country measured by jumps. The relationships hold both in the time-series and the cross-sectional dimension. We also find that developed countries possess longer memory in volatility than emerging and frontier countries.
F30|Identification and Estimation issues in Exponential Smooth Transition Autoregressive Models|Exponential smooth transition autoregressive (ESTAR) models are widely used in the international finance literature, particularly for the modelling of real exchange rates. We show that the exponential function is ill-suited as a regime weighting function because of two undesirable properties. Firstly, it can be well approximated by a quadratic function in the threshold variable whenever the transition function parameter , which governs the shape of the function, is ‘small’. This leads to an identification problem with respect to the transition function parameter and the slope vector, as both enter as a product into the conditional mean of the model. Secondly, the exponential regime weighting function can behave like an indicator function (or dummy variable) for very large values of the transition function parameter . This has the effect of ‘spuriously overfitting’ a small number of observations around the location parameter µ. We show that both of these effects lead to estimation problems in ESTAR models. We illustrate this by means of an empirical replication of a widely cited study, as well as a simulation exercise.
F30|Domestic Antidotes to Sudden Stops| Sudden Stops in net capital flows can be prevented when the actions of domestic investors offset a reduction in foreign lending. This paper presents evidence that while sudden stops in gross inflows—i.e., a tightening of the external borrowing constraint—are associated with global conditions and therefore, are largely outside of the control of local policymakers, domestic factors such as low levels of liability dollarization, exchange rate flexibility, inflation targeting regimes, and a solid institutional background are important to prevent these episodes from becoming sudden stops in net capital flows. Under these favorable local conditions, domestic investors may perceive reduced risk in bringing in resources at the time of an external shock, thus insulating the country from this shock.
F30|The End of the Bretton Woods International Monetary System|This paper examines two episodes of international economic policy coordination: the efforts to modify the Bretton Woods international monetary system in the 1960s and early 1970s and to reform the system after the closing of the US official gold window on August 15, 1971. The paper examines the diagnoses of the problem in each episode, the treatments applied, and the results in the short run and longer run. In the short run, both episodes were failures. The international monetary system that emerged in the mid-1970s, while less systemic than some would like, has nevertheless stood the test of time, although proposals for its reform continue to be discussed.
F30|International Banking and Cross-Border Effects of Regulation: Lessons from Germany|We analyze the inward and outward transmission of regulatory changes through German banks’ (international) loan portfolio. Overall, our results provide evidence for international spillovers of prudential instruments. These spillovers are, however, quite heterogeneous between types of banks and can only be observed for some instruments. For instance, domestic affiliates of foreign-owned global banks reduce their loan growth to the German economy in response to a tightening of sector-specific capital buffers, local reserve requirements, and loan-to-value ratios in their home country. Furthermore, from the point of view of foreign countries, tightening reserve requirements is effective in reducing lending inflows from German banks. Finally, we find that business and financial cycles matter for lending decisions.
F30|Capital Controls and the Cost of Debt|Abstract Using a panel data set for international corporate bonds and capital account restrictions in advanced and emerging economies, we show that restrictions on capital inflows produce a substantial and economically meaningful increase in corporate bond spreads, with a one-standard-deviation increase in our capital controls index increasing spreads by up to 35 basis points. The effect of capital controls on inflows differs across firms and across countries; the effect is particularly strong for firms that face more restricted access to alternative sources of external financing. Our findings establish a novel channel through which capital controls affect economic outcomes.
F30|Risk Taking and Interest Rates : Evidence from Decades in the Global Syndicated Loan Market|We study how low interest rates in the United States affect risk taking in the market for cross-border corporate loans. Because banks tend to originate these loans with intent to sell to nonbank investors, we examine risk taking by the broad financial system. To the extent that actions of the Federal Reserve affect U.S. interest rates, our analysis provides evidence of cross-border spillover effects of U.S. monetary policy and highlights the global lending and risk-taking channels. We find that movements in the U.S. interest rates have an important effect on ex-ante credit risk of cross-border corporate loans, though the channels are different in the pre- and post-crisis periods. Before the crisis, banks made ex-ante riskier loans to non-U.S. borrowers in response to a decline in U.S. short-term interest rates, and, after it, banks and nonbanks originated such loans in response to a decline in U.S. longer- term interest rates. Economic uncertainty, risk appetite, and the U.S. dollar exchange rate appear to play a limited role in explaining ex-ante credit risk. Our results highlight the potential policy challenges faced by central banks in affecting credit risk cycles in their own jurisdictions.
F30|The Effects of Data Transparency Policy Reforms on Emerging Market Sovereign Bond Spreads|We find that data transparency policy reforms, reflected in subscriptions to the IMF¡¯s Data Standards Initiatives (SDDS and GDDS), reduce the spreads of emerging market sovereign bonds. To overcome endogeneity issues regarding a country¡¯s decision to adopt such reforms, we first show that the reform decision is largely independent of its macroeconomic development. By using an event study, we find that subscriptions to the SDDS or GDDS leads to a 15 percent reduction in the spreads one year following such reforms. This finding is robust to various sensitivity tests, including careful consideration of the interdependence among the structural reforms.
F30|Financial Crisis, Banking Sector Performance and Economic Growth in the European Union|This paper uses static and dynamic panel estimates in a sample including all 28 European Union countries during the last decade and provides empirical evidence on the important role that well-functioning EU banking institutions can play in promoting economic growth.In order to analyse the possible differences arising after the outbreak of the recent international financial crisis, the estimations consider two panels: one for the time period 1998-2012 and another for the subinterval 2007-2012.Considering only the years after the crisis (2007-2012), the variation of the Net Interest Margin was in line with the GDP while the variations of the Equity to Total Assets Ratio and the Equity to Liabilities Ratio contrast the GDP growth rate. These differences between the two considered time panels reflect the reactions of the European banking institutions to the recent financial crisis, as they, in general, adopted a less risky performance and decided to give particular emphasis to the traditional banking activities: receiving deposits and providing credit to finance the productive investment, in order to promote economic growth. Crisi finanziarie, attività del settore bancario e crescita economica nell’Unione Europea Al fine di illustrare l’importante ruolo che le istituzioni bancarie europee potrebbero svolgere nella promozione della crescita economica se ben gestite, questo studio utilizza un campione che include dati panel sia statici che dinamici relativi a tutti i 28 paesi dell’Unione in riferimento all’ultimo decennio. Al fine di analizzare le possibili differenze sorte dopo l’irrompere delle recenti crisi finanziarie, le stime prendono in considerazione due serie di dati: una relativa al periodo 1998-2012 e un’altra relativa all’intervallo 2007-2012. I risultati ottenuti ci consentono di confermare l’importanza delle variazioni sui capitali finanziari, sulla liquidità e sui profitti in rapporto alla crescita economica.Queste differenze rilevate all’interno dei due periodi considerati riflette le reazioni delle istituzioni bancarie europee alle recenti crisi finanziarie in quanto hanno, in generale, adottato politiche meno rischiose privilegiando le attività più tradizionali: raccolta del risparmio e concessione del credito per finanziare gli investimenti produttivi al fine di promuovere la crescita economica.
F30|Bitcoin Reveals Exchange Rate Manipulation and Detects Capital Controls|Many countries manipulate the value of their currency or use some form of capital control, yet the data usually used to detect these manipulations are low frequency, expensive, lagged, and potentially mismeasured. I demonstrate that the price data of the internationally traded cryptocurrency Bitcoin can approximate unocial exchange rates which, in turn, can be used to detect both the existence and the magnitude of the distortion caused by capital controls and exchange rate manipulations. However, I document that bitcoin exchange rates contain problematic bitcoin-market-speci c elements and must be adjusted before being used for this purpose. As bitcoin exchange rates exist at a daily frequency, they reveal transitory interventions that would otherwise go undetected. This result also serves as veri cation that Bitcoin is used to circumvent capital controls and manipulated exchange rates.
