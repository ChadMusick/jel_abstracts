I11|Discontinuity in Care: Practice Closures among Primary Care Providers and Patient Health|This paper investigates consequences of practice closures among primary care providers on subsequent patient health care utilization and health. Critically, the analysis relies on population-level administrative Danish data that facilitate a unique link between all Danes and their family doctor. We start by characterizing the nature of a practice closure, including the change in provider characteristics that occurs when patients change provider. Practice closure leads patients to choose a systematically younger and less experienced primary care provider. Using a difference-in-differences strategy that compares individuals who experience a practice closing with similar individuals enrolled in similar practices that do not close until later, we next investigate consequences for patient health care utilization and health outcomes. We find that a change in provider due to practice closure increases detection of chronic illness but does not lead to concurrent changes in primary care utilization. We do detect a considerable increase in the use of emergency care, however. A decomposition exercise shows that both physician practice style and the disruption itself plays a role for the total effects but that the direction of their relative influence varies across outcome domains. Importantly, disruption is not always negative from the perspective of the patient.
I11|Battling Antibiotic Resistance: Can Machine Learning Improve Prescribing?|Antibiotic resistance constitutes a major health threat. Predicting bacterial causes of infections is key to reducing antibiotic misuse, a leading cause of antibiotic resistance. We combine administrative and microbiological laboratory data from Denmark to train a machine learning algorithm predicting bacterial causes of urinary tract infections. Based on predictions, we develop policies to improve prescribing in primary care, highlighting the relevance of physician expertise and time-variant patient distributions for policy implementation. The proposed policies delay prescriptions for some patients until test results are known and give them instantly to others. We find that machine learning can reduce antibiotic use by 7.42 percent without reducing the number of treated bacterial infections. As Denmark is one of the most conservative countries in terms of antibiotic use, targeting a 30 percent reduction in prescribing by 2020, this result is likely to be a lower bound of what can be achieved elsewhere.
I11|Factor-Analysis-Based Directional Distance Function: The case of New Zealand hospitals|This paper develops a new factor-analysis-based (FAB) approach for choosing the optimal direction in a directional distance function (DDF) analysis. It has the combined merits of factor analysis and slacks-based measure (SBM) and incorporates the relative ease with which various input-output could be adjusted. This development relieves the dependency of price information that is normally unavailable in the provision of public goods. This new FAB-DDF model has been applied on a dataset containing all public hospitals in New Zealand (NZ) observed during 2011-2017. The empirical results indicate that the average reduction across different labor is in the range of 3-10 percent, and the corresponding figure for capital input is 25.7 percent. The case-adjusted inpatient-discharge and price-adjusted outpatient-visit are used as measures of desirable output, the average efficiencies are 92.7 percent and 99 percent respectively. Hospital readmission within 28 days of discharge is used as a measure for undesirable output, and the average efficiency score is 90 percent. These evidence support the suspicion that perverse incentives might exist under the National Health Targets abolished in 2018, which was a set of six indicators used in the last decade to evaluate the performance of local District Health Boards.
I11|Prices for and Spending on Specialty Drugs in Medicare Part D and Medicaid|In recent years, the prices charged for specialty drugs have become a source of concern for many policymakers. Such drugs typically treat chronic, complex, or rare conditions, frequently have high prices, and may require special handling or patient monitoring. They accounted for a growing share of total net drug spending from 2010 to 2015 in both Medicareâ€™s prescription drug benefit (Part D) and Medicaid. The net prices paid for specialty drugs are much higher in Medicare Part D than in Medicaid, and net spending on such drugs grew much faster in Medicare Part D than in Medicaid.
I11|Key Design Components and Considerations for Establishing a Single-Payer Health Care System|Some Members of Congress have proposed establishing a single-payer health care system in the United States to ensure that virtually everyone has health insurance. In a typical single-payer system, people enroll in a health plan operated by the government, and the receipts and expenditures associated with the plan appear in the governmentâ€™s budget. This report describes the primary features of single-payer systems, and it discusses some of the design considerations and choices that policymakers will face in developing proposals for establishing such a system.
I11|Prices for and Spending on Specialty Drugs in Medicare Part D and Medicaid: An In-Depth Analysis: Working Paper 2019-02|In this working paper, the Congressional Budget Office examines the prices paid for specialty drugs and spending on those drugs in Medicare Part D and Medicaid from 2010 to 2015. Specialty drugs treat chronic, complex, or rare conditions, frequently have high prices, and may require special handling or monitoring of patients. The retail prices paid to pharmacies for brand-name specialty drugs are similar in Medicare Part D and Medicaid, but net prices are much higher in Medicare Part D because rebates from manufacturers are substantially lower than in Medicaid. In 2015, the
I11|How Do Changes in Medical Malpractice Liability Laws Affect Health Care Spending and the Federal Budget? Working Paper 2019-03|Changes to malpractice liability laws intended to decrease the liability of physicians and other medical providers have an ambiguous potential effect on overall health care spending (and the federal budget). Some providers may respond by performing fewer procedures that were undertaken mainly to avoid liability, whereas other providers may pursue more risky procedures and patients. This paper reviews the recent literature on the effect of changes in traditional liability laws on health care spending and presents new analyses of how such changes affect Medicare, Medicaid,
I11|Not Evidence for Baumol’s Cost Disease|In his 2008 Journal of Health Economics paper, Jochen Hartwig claimed that Baumol’s Cost Disease (BCD) theory could explain observed increases in health care expenditures in OECD countries. This paper replicates Hartwig’s results and demonstrates that he tested the wrong hypothesis. When one tests the correct hypothesis, Hartwig’s conclusions are not supported. Rather than providing evidence in favor of BCD, Hartwig’s estimation procedures, when applied correctly, strongly reject BCD as an explanation for health expenditure increases for the OECD data he examined.
I11|Dynamic Hospital Competition Under Rationing by Waiting Times|We develop a dynamic model of hospital competition where (i) waiting times increase if demand exceeds supply; (ii) patients differ in their evaluation of health benefits and choose a hospital based on waiting times; and (iii) there are penalties for providers with long waits. We show that, if penalties are linear in waiting times, a more competitive dynamic environment does not affect waiting times. If penalties are instead non-linear, we find that waiting times are longer under the more competitive environment. The latter result is derived by calibrating the model with waiting times and elasticities observed in the English NHS for a common treatment (cataract surgery), which also shows that the difference between waiting times under the two solution concepts is quantitatively small. Policies that facilitate patient choice, an alternative measure of competition, also lead to higher steady-state waiting times, and tougher penalties exacerbate the negative effect of choice policies.
I11|An Experimental Investigation of Income, Insurance, and Investments in Health over the Life Course|We examine the impacts of age, income and insurance plan on behavior in a virtual environment with cash-motivated subjects, who live multi-period lives in which they earn income and spend on enjoyment, insurance, and investments in health. Health shocks increase simulating aging. The 2x2 experimental has high and low income subjects, and offers employer-based or actuarial insurance. We find: 1) subject behavior approximated optimal responses; 2) in all treatments, subjects under-invested in health early in life and over-invested in health late in life; 3) subjects in the employerbased plan purchased insurance at higher rates; 4) the employer-based plan reduced differences due to income and age; 5) subjects in the actuarial plan engaged in more health-promoting behaviors, but still below optimal levels, and did save at the level required, so did realize the full benefits of the plan. Should these results generalize, they have clear implications for the health insurance policy.
I11|Effects of Market Structure and Patient Choice on Hospital Quality for Planned Patients|We investigate the change in the effect of market structure on planned hospital quality for three high-volume treatments, using a quasi difference-in-differences approach based on the relaxation of patient constraints on hospital choice in England. We employ control functions to allow for time-varying endogeneity from unobserved patient characteristics. We find that the choice reforms reduced quality for hip and knee replacement but not for coronary bypass, This is likely due to hospitals making a larger loss on hip and knee replacements, since robustness checks rule out changes in length of stay, new competitors’ entry and hospital-level mortality as possible confounders.
I11|The effect of government contracting with faith-based health care providers in Malawi|We study the impact of contracting-out of maternal health care by the government of Malawi to providers from the Christian Health Association of Malawi (CHAM) in the form of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Under a SLA, a CHAM facility provides agreed maternal and newborn services free-of-charge to patients, and is reimbursed on a fixed price per service. We merge data on health facilities in Malawi with pregnancy histories from the 2010 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey, and exploit the staggered implementation of SLAs across facilities. Using difference-in-differences, we estimate the differential effects on pregnancy- related health care utilisation to mothers residing near and far from facilities with a SLA over time. Our findings show that SLAs reduced home births and increased skilled deliveries at CHAM hospitals. We observe greater provision of prenatal care services at CHAM health centres but no overall increase in the number of prenatal care visits. We find evidence of a reduction in certain components of prenatal care.
I11|The causal effect of hospital volume on health gains from hip replacement surgery|This study investigates the causal effect of hospital volume on health gains from hip replacement surgery in the English National Health Service. We exploit a unique dataset, which links routine hospital records and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for all public hospitals in England. PROMs assess patientsâ€™ health along key dimensions of pain and mobility shortly before and six months after the surgery. We investigate whether higher hospital volume increases patient health six months post-surgery, conditioning on pre-surgery health and other patient medical and socioeconomic indicators. We address possible reverse-causality bias due to hospital demand being responsive to quality by constructing a measure of predicted hospital volumes based on a patient choice model. The results suggest that the observed volume-outcome effect in hip replacement surgery is clinically small and no longer statistically significant once we account for the endogeneity of volume.
I11|Paying for Kidneys? A Randomized Survey and Choice Experiment|We conducted a randomized survey with 2,666 US residents to study preferences for legalizing payments to kidney donors. We found strong polarization, with many participants supporting or opposing payments regardless of potential transplant gains. However, about 18 percent of respondents would switch to favoring payments for sufficiently large increases in transplants. Preferences for compensation have strong moral foundations; participants especially reject direct payments by patients, which they find would violate principles of fairness. We corroborate the interpretation of our findings with a choice experiment of a costly decision to donate money to a foundation that supports donor compensation.
I11|More Hospital Choices, More C-Sections: Evidence from Chile|In this paper, we study the effect on cesarean rates of a policy change in Chile that decreased the cost of delivery at private hospitals for women with public health insurance. Using a difference-in-differences (DID) approach based on the eligibility conditions for this benefit, we find that in the first three years after the policy took effect, deliveries in private hospitals increased by 8.7 percentage points, while the probability of a C-section being performed increased by 4.6 percentage points, with negative impacts on average newborn weight and size at birth. We show that the probability of an early term birth in hospitals participating in the program is an increasing function of expected hospital demand at the time of the full-term due date. This suggests that in the absence of price incentives, hospitals use C-sections to smooth out demand over time to optimize the use of their resources.
I11|Selection and moral hazard effects in healthcare|In the Netherlands, average healthcare expenditures of persons without a voluntary deductible are twice as high as average healthcare expenditures of persons with a voluntary deductible. When assessing the effects of voluntary cost-sharing in healthcare on healthcare expenditures, it is important to disentangle moral hazard from selection: are healthcare expenditures low because people pay (a bigger share of) their healthcare expenditures out-of-pocket? Or are people with higher cost-sharing levels healthier? In this study, we separate selection from moral hazard for the combined mandatory and voluntary deductible in the Netherlands. We use proprietary claims data from Dutch health insurers and exploit with a panel regression discontinuity design that we can observe healthcare expenditures before and after the deductibles kick in for 18 year olds. Our study shows that selection, not moral hazard, is the main effect explaining the difference in healthcare expenditures between persons with and without a voluntary deductible. Furthermore, we find that 18 year olds who never chose a voluntary deductible reduce their healthcare spending by 26 euros (on average) in response to a 100 euro increase in the (mandatory) deductible. However, for 18 year olds who chose a voluntary deductible (on top of the mandatory) we find that this choice does not result in a further reduction in healthcare spending.
I11|Controlling Sellers Who Provide Advice: Regulation and Competition|A monopoly seller advises buyers about which of two goods best fits their needs but may be tempted to steer buyers towards the higher margin good. For the seller to collect information about a buyer's needs and provide truthful advice, the profits from selling both goods must lie within an implementability cone. In the optimal regulation, pricing distortions and information-collection incentives are controlled separately by price regulation and fixed rewards respectively. This no longer holds when the seller has private information about costs as both problems interact. We study the extent to which competition and the threat by buyers to switch sellers can substitute for regulation.
I11|Information shocks and provider responsiveness: evidence from interventional cardiology|"We examine physician responses to global information shocks and the impact on patient outcomes. We exploit an international ""firestorm"" over the safety of an innovation in healthcare, drug-eluting stents. We use rich micro-data on interventional cardiologists' use of stents to de- fine and measure responsiveness to news shocks. We find substantial heterogeneity in responsiveness to both good and bad news and an association between speed of response to news and patient outcomes. Patients treated by cardiologists who respond slowly to news shocks have fewer adverse outcomes. These results cannot be attributed to financial incentives, patient-physician sorting or heterogeneity in skill."
I11|The Impact of CEOs in the Public Sector: Evidence from the English NHS|We investigate whether top managers affect the performance of large and complex public sector organizations, using as a case study CEOs of English public hospitals (large, complex organizations with multi-million turnover). We study the extent to which CEOs are differentiated in terms of their pay, as well as a wide range of hospital production measures including inputs, intermediate operational outcomes and clinical outcomes. Pay differentials suggest that the market perceives CEOs to be differentiated. However, we find little evidence of CEOs’ impact on hospital production. These results question the effectiveness of leadership changes to improve performance in the public sector.
I11|Entry decisions and asymmetric competition between non-profit and for-profit homes in the long-term care market|The demand for long-term care (LTC) services is growing strongly, mostly due to population aging. Historically, the German LTC market was dominated by non-profit nursing homes, but the recent entry wave was tilted towards for-profit competitors. Using a rich administrative dataset on all LTC facilities in Germany, we examine strategic interaction between these two ownership types in a static entry model. The estimates of competitive effects imply that non-profit and for-profit homes are substitutes, but competition is much stronger within-type, suggesting that they provide differentiated products. For-profit homes in particular act as if they operate in a different market segment, but over time their entry behavior has converged to that of the more established non-profits. Counterfactual simulations of proposed changes in government policy suggest that even small changes favoring either type could have a large impact on the fraction of markets that remain unserved or only served by a single type.
I11|Dominance and the pre-emption of competition following the Servier and Paroxetine GSK judgments|This paper discusses, from economic and enforcement perspectives, unilateral conduct aimed at foreclosing the entry of generics. We assume, in line with empirical evidence, that before the entry of generics, competition takes place among originators mostly through non price instruments and in particular, promotion. The entry of generics for one molecule introduces head to head price competition for that molecule and changes competitive interactions among the originators that remain patent protected. First, we develop a model in which competition takes place through price and promotion and analyse the consequence of unilateral conduct preventing the entry of generics, thus prolonging the status quo. We find that that the extent to which this conduct reduces consumer welfare (if at all) depends on whether promotion enhances the utility of users and whether promotion also involves business stealing. In order to provide some guidance for enforcement, we characterise the competitive outcome that prevails before entry in terms of consumer welfare. We find that unlike what happens with price competition, common indicators of performance such as the number of firms, the level of concentration (for a given number of firms) and the intensity of rivalry might be negatively associated with consumer welfare. As a consequence, the foreclosure of entrants might lead to welfare losses even when the status quo involves intense non-price competition and low concentration. Finally, we consider how unilateral conduct towards generic entry can be dealt with in the current enforcement framework. In the Servier and Paroxetine cases, the foreclosure of generics has been framed as an abuse of a dominant position held by the originator before entry, in spite of evidence of non-price competition. We show that it would be preferable to frame the conduct as an abuse of the dominant position that the originator holds in the molecule market as a consequence of its patent. In such a framework, the dominant position is instrumental in making exclusion feasible.
I11|Battling antibiotic resistance: can machine learning improve prescribing?|Antibiotic resistance constitutes a major health threat. Predicting bacterial causes of infections is key to reducing antibiotic misuse, a leading driver of antibiotic resistance. We train a machine learning algorithm on administrative and microbiological laboratory data from Denmark to predict diagnostic test outcomes for urinary tract infections. Based on predictions, we develop policies to improve prescribing in primary care, highlighting the relevance of physician expertise and policy implementation when patient distributions vary over time. The proposed policies delay antibiotic prescriptions for some patients until test results are known and give them instantly to others. We find that machine learning can reduce antibiotic use by 7.42 percent without reducing the number of treated bacterial infections. As Denmark is one of the most conservative countries in terms of antibiotic use, this result is likely to be a lower bound of what can be achieved elsewhere.
I11|The dynamics of health care and growth: A model with physician in dual practice|We present a growth model with micro-foundations of a mixed health care system and physician dual-practice, to analyze for welfare-optimal government financing strategy for a mixed health system in developing countries. Calibrating the model for Indonesia, we find that a government subsidy to private health care is both growth- and welfare-enhancing, whereas it is more effective for the government to invest in health infrastructure instead of a public-sector “rewarding” policy in raising government physicians’ wage if its goal is to improve physician effort in public practice. Indeed, for the “rewarding” policy, a dynamic trade-off in growth is found, which is not previously documented in the literature. We also find the model to produce two regimes with different welfare-optimal health financing (a “normal” regime and a low public-sector congestion regime). In the former, welfare-optimal health financing strategy appears to be promoting private health subsidy at the expense of public-sector physician wages. In the latter, the opposite is welfare-optimal.
I11|Paying for efficiency: incentivising same-day discharges in the English NHS|We study a pay-for-efficiency scheme that encourages hospitals to admit and discharge patients on the same calendar day when clinically appropriate. Since 2010, hospitals in the English NHS are incentivised by a higher price for patients treated as same-day discharge than for overnight stays, despite the former being less costly. We analyse administrative data for patients treated during 2006–2014 for 191 conditions for which same-day discharge is clinically appropriate – of which 32 are incentivised. Using difference-in-difference and synthetic control methods, we find that the policy had generally a positive impact with a statistically significant effect in 14 out of the 32 conditions. The median elasticity is 0.24 for planned and 0.01 for emergency conditions. Condition-specific design features explain some, but not all, of the differential responses.
I11|Improving Estimation of Labor Market Disequilibrium Using Shortage Indicators, with an Application to the Market for Anesthesiologists|While economic studies often assume that labor markets are in equilibrium, there may be specialized labor markets that are likely in disequilibrium. We develop a new methodology to improve the estimation of a reduced form disequilibrium model from the existing models by incorporating survey-based shortage indicators into the model and estimation. Our shortage-indicator informed disequilibrium model includes as a special case the foundational model of Maddala and Nelson (1974). We demonstrate the gains in information provided by our methodology. We show how the model can be implemented by applying it to the market for anesthesiologists, a profession susceptible to disequilibrium. In this application, we find that our new disequilibrium model informed by a shortage indicator fits the data better than the Maddala-Nelson model, and has better out-of-sample predictive power.
I11|Promoting Breast Cancer Screening Take-Ups with Zero Cost: Evidence from an Experiment on Formatting Invitation Letters in Italy|We ran a randomized field experiment to ascertain whether a costless manipulation of the informational content (restricted or enhanced information) and the framing (gain or loss framing) of the invitation letter to the breast cancer screening program in Messina, Italy, affects the take-up rate. We show that giving enhanced loss-framed information about the risks of not having a mammography increases the take-up. This manipulation is especially effective among subjects with lower baseline take-ups – those living farther away from the screening site, residing in municipalities with low education, or with no recent screening experience – contributing to reduce socio-economic inequalities in screening. When we investigate the mechanisms behind our findings, we show that subjects exposed to our proposed manipulation are also less likely to postpone the appointment, signaling enhanced awareness about the risks related with delayed participation.
I11|More hospital choices, more C-sections: Evidence from Chile|In this paper, we study the effect on cesarean rates of a policy change in Chile that decreased the cost of delivery at private hospitals for women with public health insurance. Using a difference-indifferences (DID) approach based on the eligibility conditions for this benefit, we find that in the first three years after the policy took effect, deliveries in private hospitals increased by 8.7 percentage points, while the probability of a C-section being performed increased by 4.6 percentage points, with negative impacts on average newborn weight and size at birth. We show that the probability of an early term birth in hospitals participating in the program is an increasing function of expected hospital demand at the time of the full-term due date. This suggests that in the absence of price incentives, hospitals use C-sections to smooth out demand over time to optimize the use of their resources.
I11|Impact of Increased Long-Term Care Insurance Payments on Employment and Wages in Formal Long-Term Care|This paper examines the effect of raising Long-term Care Insurance (LTCI) payments on employment and wages of workers in the long-term care (LTC) industry. Specifically, I use the change in the regional premium in 2012 as an exogenous shock to the insurance fee schedule: the change in the unit price of LTCI service ranges from a decrease of 2.8% to an increase of 4.2%. I find no increase in the number of employees in the establishments, registered under the LTCI scheme, in municipalities where the regional premium increased. The earnings and working hours of LTC workers did not increase, either.
I11|Losing Insurance and Behavioral Health Hospitalizations: Evidence from a Large-scale Medicaid Disenrollment|We study the effects of losing insurance on behavioral health – mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) – community hospitalizations. We leverage variation in public insurance eligibility offered by a large-scale Medicaid disenrollment. Losing insurance decreased SUD-related hospitalizations but mental illness hospitalizations were unchanged. Use of Medicaid to pay for behavioral health hospitalizations declined post-disenrollment. Mental illness hospitalization financing shifted to private insurance, Medicare, and patients, while SUD treatment financing shifted entirely to patients. We investigate implications of reliance on data that is not representative at the level of the treatment variable and propose a possible solution.
I11|Multiple Births, Birth Quality and Maternal Labor Supply: Analysis of IVF Reform in Sweden|In this study we examine the passage of a reform to in-vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures in Sweden in 2003. Following publication of medical evidence showing that pregnancy success rates could be maintained using single rather than multiple embryo transfers, the single embryo transfer (SET) was mandated as the default IVF procedure. Using linked registry data for the period 1998-2007, we find that the SET reform was associated with a precipitous drop in the share of multiple births of 63%. This narrowed differences in health between IVF and non-IVF births by 53%, and differences in the labor market outcomes of mothers three years after birth by 85%. For first time mothers, it also narrowed the gap in maternal health between IVF and non-IVF births by 36%. Our findings imply that more widespread adoption of SET could lead to massive gains, reducing hospitalization costs and the foregone income of mothers and improving the long-run socioeconomic outcomes of children. This is important given that the share of IVF facilitated births exceeds 3% in several industrialized countries and is on the rise.
I11|Holding Hospitals Accountable? Evidence on the Effectiveness of Minimum Charity Care Provision Laws| What can governments do to encourage nonprofit hospitals to provide greater benefits to their communities? Recent efforts by the federal and state governments seek to hold hospitals accountable for community health, in part by incentivizing charity care provision. Laws that set benchmarks for charity care spending are increasingly used, but their efficacy is uncertain. In this study, we examine the extent to which Illinois’ minimum charity care provision (MCCP) law increases nonprofit hospital charity care. Importantly, we differentiate between responses for hospitals required to provide minimal charitable spending (nonprofits) and those that are not (for-profit and public). We use detailed panel (2009-2015) data from Illinois' Annual Hospital Questionnaire and county-level data from the American Community Survey. We exploit a discrete change in charitable care requirements for nonprofit hospitals to identify the effect of the MCCP law on charity care, controlling for hospital characteristics, county demographics, and year and county (or hospital) fixed effects. Employing a differences-in-differences model, we find no evidence that the MCCP law increases charity care on average. Instead, we find some evidence that the law’s effects vary by how much charity care hospitals provided previously – charity care increases for those providing lower levels at baseline, narrowing the gap in charity care provision with those that provide high levels at baseline. The results suggest that setting low benchmarks does not create sufficient incentives for nonprofit hospitals to provide greater charity care on average, but instead may narrow the gap between high and low charity care hospitals.
I11|Urgent Care Centers and the Demand for Non-Emergent Emergency Department Visits|Urgent care centers (UCCs) are a cost-efficient substitute to the emergency department (ED) for non-emergent conditions, but no study has identified their impact on ED demand. We address this gap using a novel strategy that exploits daily UCC operating times in a differencing framework. After UCCs close each day, local non-emergent ED visits increase by 1.43 percent (over the adjusted mean rate of 70.58 percent) in areas with multiple UCCs. This effect occurs only among the privately insured population, the target customers of UCCs. Our results suggest that UCCs are successfully substituting for EDs in the treatment of non-emergent conditions.
I11|Optimal Managed Competition Subsidies|When markets fail to provide socially optimal outcomes, governments often intervene through ‘managed competition’ where firms compete for per-consumer subsidies. Subsidies are generally set across geographies according to estimates of the cost of government provision, a method which may not be welfare-maximizing. We introduce a framework for determining the optimal subsidy schedule that features heterogeneity in consumer preferences and inertia, and firms with heterogeneous costs that can set prices and product characteristics in response to changes in the subsidy. We apply it to the Medicare Advantage program, which offers Medicare recipients private insurance that replaces Traditional Medicare. We calculate counterfactual equilibria as a function of the subsidies by estimating policy functions for product characteristics from the data and solving for Nash equilibria in prices. The optimal schedule increases consumer surplus by 30% over the current policy and is well-approximated with a linear rule using market-level observables.
I11|The Impact of CEOs in the Public Sector: Evidence from the English NHS|We investigate whether top managers affect the performance of large and complex public sector organizations, using as a case study CEOs of English public hospitals (large, complex organizations with multi-million turnover). We study the extent to which CEOs are differentiated in terms of their pay, as well as a wide range of hospital production measures including inputs, intermediate operational outcomes and clinical outcomes. Pay differentials suggest that the market perceives CEOs to be differentiated. However, we find little evidence of CEOs' impact on hospital production. These results question the effectiveness of leadership changes to improve performance in the public sector.
I11|The Effects of Multispecialty Group Practice on Health Care Spending and Use|U.S. physicians are increasingly joining multispecialty group practices. In this paper, we analyze how a primary care physician’s practice type – single (SSP) versus multispecialty practice (MSP) – affects health care spending and use. Focusing on Medicare beneficiaries who change their primary care physician due to a geographic move, we compare changes in practice patterns before and after the move between patients who switch practice types and those who do not. We use instrumental variables to address potential selection by patients into practice types after the move. We find that changing from a single to a multi-specialty primary care group practice decreases annual Medicare-financed per capita expenditures by about $1,600 - a 28% reduction. The effect is driven primarily by changes in hospital expenditures and is concentrated among patients with two or more chronic conditions, suggesting that MSP improves care delivery by reducing hospitalizations among relatively sick patients. The results imply that, while research has shown the potential for physician consolidation to increase prices in some settings, large multispecialty groups also have the potential to lower costs.
I11|Losing Insurance and Behavioral Health Hospitalizations: Evidence from a Large-Scale Medicaid Disenrollment|We study the effects of losing insurance on behavioral health – mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) – community hospitalizations. We leverage variation in public insurance eligibility offered by a large-scale Medicaid disenrollment. Losing insurance decreased SUD-related hospitalizations but mental illness hospitalizations were unchanged. Use of Medicaid to pay for behavioral health hospitalizations declined post-disenrollment. Mental illness hospitalization financing shifted to private insurance, Medicare, and patients, while SUD treatment financing shifted entirely to patients. We investigate implications of reliance on data that is not representative at the level of the treatment variable and propose a possible solution.
I11|Do Report Cards Predict Future Quality? The Case of Skilled Nursing Facilities|Report cards on provider performance are intended to improve consumer decision-making and address information gaps in the market for quality. However, inadequate risk adjustment of report-card measures often biases comparisons across providers. We test whether going to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) with a higher star rating affects outcomes for a patient. We exploit variation over time in the distance from a patient’s residential ZIP code to SNFs with different ratings to estimate the causal effect of admission to a higher-rated SNF on health care outcomes, including mortality. We found that patients who go to higher-rated SNFs experience lower mortality, fewer days in the nursing home, and fewer hospital readmissions.
I11|Place-Based Drivers of Mortality: Evidence from Migration|We estimate the effect of current location on elderly mortality by analyzing outcomes of movers in the Medicare population. We control for movers' origin locations as well as a rich vector of pre-move health measures. We also develop a novel strategy to adjust for remaining unobservables, based on the assumption that the relative importance of observables and unobservables correlated with movers' destinations is the same as the relative importance of those correlated with movers' origins. We estimate substantial effects of current location. Moving from a 10th to a 90th percentile location would increase life expectancy at age 65 by 1.1 years, and equalizing location effects would reduce cross-sectional variation in life expectancy by 15 percent. Places with favorable life expectancy effects tend to have higher quality and quantity of health care, less extreme climates, lower crime rates, and higher socioeconomic status
I11|The Health Impacts of Hospital Delivery Practices|Hospital treatment practices vary widely, often with little connection to the medical needs of patients. We assess the impact of these differences in the context of childbirth. We focus on low-risk first births, where c-section rates vary enormously across hospitals, and where policymakers have focused much of their attention in calls for reducing unnecessary c-sections. We find that proximity to hospitals with high c-section rates leads to more cesarean deliveries, fewer vaginal births after prolonged labor, and higher average Apgar scores. Infants born in these hospitals are less likely to be readmitted in the year after birth, but more likely to visit the emergency department for a respiratory-related problem. They also have lower mortality rates, driven by a reduction in the joint probability of prolonged labor and subsequent death. A stylized cost benefit analysis suggests that re-allocating births to high c-section hospitals could lead to net social benefits.
I11|Is Great Information Good Enough? Evidence from Physicians as Patients|Stemming from the belief that the key barrier to achieving high-quality and low-cost health care is the deficiency of information and medical knowledge among patients, an enormous number of health policies are focused on patient education. In this paper, we attempt to place an upper bound on the improvements to health care quality that may emanate from such information campaigns. To do so, we compare the care received by a group of patients that should have the best possible information on health care service efficacy—i.e., physicians as patients—with a comparable group of non-physician patients, taking various steps to account for unobservable differences between the two groups. Our results suggest that physicians do only slightly better in adhering to both low- and high-value care guidelines than non-physicians – but not by much and not always.
I11|Does the Healthcare Educational Market Respond to Short-Run Local Demand?|The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) increased demand for healthcare across the U.S., but it is unclear if or how the supply side has responded to meet this demand. In this paper, we take advantage of plausibly exogenous geographical heterogeneity in the ACA to examine the healthcare education sector’s response to increased demand for healthcare services. We look across educational fields, types of degrees, and types of institutions, paying particular attention to settings where our conceptual model predicts heightened responses. We find no statistically significant evidence of increases in graduates and can rule out fairly modest effects. This implies that healthcare production may have adjusted to increased demand from insurance expansion in other ways rather than primarily through new graduates of local healthcare educational markets.
I11|Do Local Governments Represent Voter Preferences? Evidence from Hospital Financing under the Affordable Care Act|A mainstream motivation for decentralized government is to enable public service investments to better align with political preferences that may differ by geographical region. This paper examines how political preferences determine local government provision of hospital services. We find that local governments in areas more supportive of public insurance expansion responded to such state action by increasing expenditures on hospitals, whereas those in areas that voted against such expansions used the savings to reduce property taxes. This finding suggests that local government financial responses indeed align with political preferences.
I11|The Effects of Primary Care Chronic-Disease Management in Rural China|Health systems globally face increasing morbidity and mortality from chronic disease, yet many—especially in low- and middle-income countries—lack strong primary care. We analyze China’s efforts to promote primary care management for insured rural Chinese with chronic disease, analyzing unique panel data for over 70,000 rural Chinese 2011-2015. Our study design uses variation in management intensity generated by administrative and geographic boundaries—regression analyses based on 14 pairs of villages within two kilometers of each other but managed by different townships. Utilizing this plausibly exogenous variation, we find that patients residing in a village within a township with more intensive primary care management, compared to neighbors with less intensive management, had more primary care visits, fewer specialist visits, fewer hospital admissions, and lower inpatient spending. No such effects are evident in a placebo treatment year. Exploring the mechanism, we find that patients with more intensive primary care management exhibited better drug adherence as measured by filled prescriptions. A back-of-the-envelope estimate of welfare suggests that the resource savings from avoided inpatient admissions substantially outweigh the costs of the program.
I11|The Price to Consumers of Generic Pharmaceuticals: Beyond the Headlines|"Generic drug prices have been the focus of much attention in recent years, with Congressional committees, executive agencies and private organizations all conducting investigations into the pricing patterns for generic drugs. Price spikes for selected old, off-patent drugs have also been widely reported in the media. To place these generic price increases into context, we construct two chained Laspeyres consumer price indexes (CPIs), using the 2007-2016 IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Research Database. The first (""direct out-of-pocket CPI"") measures consumers' direct out-of-pocket payments to the dispensing pharmacy, while the second (""total CPI"") represents the total revenues received by the dispensing pharmacy – the consumers' direct out-of-pocket payments plus the amount paid to the pharmacy by the insurer on behalf of the consumer. We find the chained direct-out-of-pocket CPI for generic prescription drugs declines by about 50% between 2007 and 2016, while the total CPI falls by nearly 80% over the same time period. The smaller decline in the direct out-of-pocket CPI than in the total CPI is due in part to consumers' increasingly moving away from fixed copayment benefit plans to pure coinsurance or a mixed package of coinsurance and copayments. While consumers are experiencing more cost sharing that in fact shifts more of the drug cost burden on to them, on balance in the US consumers have experienced substantial price declines for generic drugs."
I11|The Role of Behavioral Frictions in Health Insurance Marketplace Enrollment and Risk: Evidence from a Field Experiment|We experimentally varied information mailed to 87,000 households in California's health insurance marketplace to study the role of frictions in insurance take-up. Reminders about the enrollment deadline raised enrollment by 1.3 pp (16 percent), in this typically low take-up population. Heterogeneous effects of personalized subsidy information indicate systematic misperceptions about program benefits. Consistent with an adverse selection model with frictional enrollment costs, the intervention lowered average spending risk by 5.1 percent, implying that marginal respondents were 37 percent less costly than inframarginal consumers. We observe the largest positive selection among low income consumers, who exhibit the largest frictions in enrollment. Finally, the intervention raised average consumer WTP for insurance by $25 to $54 per month. These results suggest that frictions may partially explain low measured WTP for marketplace insurance, and that interventions reducing them can improve enrollment and market risk in exchanges.
I11|Screening and Selection: The Case of Mammograms|Debates over whether and when to recommend screening for a potential disease focus on the causal impact of screening for a typical individual covered by the recommendation, who may differ from the typical individual who responds to the recommendation. We explore this distinction in the context of recommendations that breast cancer screening start at age 40. The raw data suggest that responders to the age 40 recommendation have less cancer than do women who self-select into screening at earlier ages. Combining these patterns with a clinical oncology model allows us to infer that responders to the age 40 recommendation also have less cancer than women who never screen, suggesting that the benefits of recommending early screening are smaller than if responders were representative of covered individuals. For example, we estimate that shifting the recommendation from age 40 to age 45 results in over three times as many deaths if responders were randomly drawn from the population than under the estimated patterns of selection. These results highlight the importance of considering the characteristics of responders when making and designing recommendations.
I11|Impact of Rural and Urban Hospital Closures on Inpatient Mortality|This paper examines the impact of California's hospital closures occurring from 1995-2011 on adjusted inpatient mortality for time-sensitive conditions: sepsis, stroke, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Using a difference- in-difference approach on California's Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) data, the impact of hospital closures on inpatient mortality is estimated. Outcomes of admissions in hospital service areas (HSAs) with and without closure(s) are compared before and after the closure year. The paper aims to fill gaps in prior work by using a reconciled list of California's hospital closures and by studying differential impacts of rural and urban hospital closures. To our best knowledge, this is also the first paper explicitly studying patient outcomes of California's rural closures. Results suggest that when treatment groups are not differentiated by hospital rurality, closures appear to have no measurable impact. However, estimating differential impacts of rural and urban closures shows that rural closures increase inpatient mortality by 0.46% points (an increase of 5.9%), whereas urban closures have no impact. Results differ across diagnostic conditions; the general effect of closures is to increase mortality for stroke patients by 3.1% and for AMI patients by 4.5%, and decrease mortality for asthma/COPD patients by 8.8%.
I11|New Evidence on the Effects of Mandatory Waiting Periods for Abortion|Beyond a handful of studies examining early-adopting states in the early 1990s, little is known about the causal effects of mandatory waiting periods for abortion. In this study we evaluate the effects of a Tennessee law enacted in 2015 that requires women to make an additional trip to abortion providers for state-directed counseling at least 48 hours before they can obtain an abortion. Based on our difference-in-differences approach, estimates indicate that the introduction of the mandatory waiting period caused a 62-percent increase in the share of abortions obtained during the second trimester, completely closing the pre-existing gap between Tennessee and the comparison states. Our analysis examining overall abortion rates are suggestive of reductions caused by the waiting period but these estimates are imprecise. To put these estimates into context, our back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that Tennessee's MWP increased the monetary costs of obtaining an abortion by as much as $929 for some women.
I11|Primary Care Physician Practice Styles and Patient Care: Evidence from Physician Exits in Medicare|"Primary care physicians (PCPs) provide frontline health care to patients in the U.S.; however, it is unclear how their practice styles affect patient care. In this paper, we estimate the long-lasting effects of PCP practice styles on patient health care utilization by focusing on Medicare patients affected by PCP relocations or retirements, which we refer to as ""exits."" Observing where patients receive care after these exits, we estimate event studies to compare patients who switch to PCPs with different practice style intensities. We find that PCPs have large effects on a range of aggregate utilization measures, including physician and outpatient spending and the number of diagnosed conditions. Moreover, we find that PCPs have large effects on the quality of care that patients receive, and that all of these effects persist for several years. Our results suggest that switching to higher-quality PCPs could significantly affect patients' longer-run health outcomes."
I11|Optimal dynamic volume-based price regulation|We consider a model of optimal price regulation in markets where demand is sluggish and asymmetric providers compete on quality. Using a spatial model, which is suitable to investigate the health care and education sector, we investigate within a dynamic set-up the scope for price premiums or penalties on volume. We show that the socially optimal time path of quality provision o¤ the steady state can be replicated by a simple dynamic pricing rule where the dynamic part of the rule is ex-ante non-discriminatory in the sense that the price premium or penalty on volume is common across providers, despite their differing production costs. Whether the price schedule involves a penalty or a premium on volume relates to two concerns regarding production costs and consumer bene ts, which go in opposite directions. Price adjustments over time occur only through the price penalty or premium, not time directly, which highlights the simplicity and thus applicability of this regulation scheme.
I11|Private Hospitals in Health Insurance Network in India: A Reflection for Implementation of Ayushman Bharat|Private hospitals are expected to play a key role in the implementation of govern-ment sponsored health insurance schemes (GSHIS) in India. This paper examines the availability and spread of private hospitals in the country to provide insights on the po-tential access to insured health services in GSHIS schemes. It uses three sets of infor-mation to analyse the issue: private hospitals empanelled by insurance companies, the 6th Economic Census, and private hospitals empanelled in GSHIS schemes in four States. The analysis suggests that, in low-income States of the country, empanelment of private hos-pitals by insurance companies is low and concentrated in a few pockets. This pattern closely corresponds to the pattern of availability of private hospitals indicated in the 6th Economic Census. In Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, the four States which have some of the largest GSHIS schemes in the country, there is a strong correspondence between private hospitals empanelled by insurance companies and pri-vate hospitals empanelled in GSHIS schemes. In these States, the extent of empanelment of private hospitals in GSHIS schemes is also substantially smaller than the empanelment of private hospitals by insurance companies. This may indicate differences in entry con-ditions or low willingness of private hospitals to participate in GSHIS schemes.
I11|The impact of technological advancements on health spending: A literature review|The measurement of the impact of technology as a driver of health care expenditure is complex since technological effects are closely interlinked with other determinants such as income and the composition and health status of a population. Furthermore, the impact of the supply of advances in technology on health expenditure cannot be considered in isolation from demand and the policy context and the broader institutional context governing the adoption of new technologies. Hence, it is the interaction of supply and demand factors and the context that determine the ultimate level of technology use.There are also important quality changes that come with technological progress that also have monetary costs and benefits attached. Modelling quality improvements, both in terms of benefits within the health system and outside (e.g. its impact on life expectancy, ageing populations, productivity and GDP), is a challenging task, and no macroeconomic models to date have tried to capture them.This paper presents a comprehensive literature review of the impact of technological advances on health expenditure growth, the ‘cost’ side of the equation.
I11|Credence Goods Markets with Heterogeneous Experts|In this paper, we analyze a credence goods model adjusted to the health care market with regulated prices and heterogeneous experts. Experts are physicians and are assumed to differ in their cost of treating a small problem. We investigate the effects of this heterogeneity on the physicians’ level of fraud and on the patients’ search for second opinions. We find that introducing a fraction of more efficient low-cost physicians always increases social welfare, but in some cases only because of the raised physicians’ surplus. When the low-cost physicians’ cost advantage is small, imposing a share of low-cost physicians does not change the equilibrium fraud level. When the cost advantage is large, however, different changes in the fraud level occur depending on the share of generated low-cost physicians, the search rate and the initial level of fraud.
I11|Credence Goods Markets with Fair and Opportunistic Experts|We analyze a credence goods market adapted to a health care market with regulated prices, where physicians are heterogeneous regarding their fairness concerns. The opportunistic physicians only consider monetary incentives while the fair physicians, in addition to a monetary payoff, gain an non-monetary utility from being honest towards patients. We investigate how this heterogeneity affects the physicians’ equilibrium level of overcharging and the patients’ search for second opinions (which determines overall welfare). The impact of the heterogeneity on the fraud level is ambiguous and depends on several factors such as the size of the fairness utility, the share of fair physicians, the search level and the initial fraud level. Introducing heterogeneity does not affect the fraud or the search level when the share of fair physicians is small. However, when social welfare is not at its maximum, social welfare always increases if we introduce a sufficiently large share of fair physicians.
I11|Quality Regulation and Competition: Evidence from Pharmaceutical Markets|Quality regulation attempts to ensure quality and to foster price competition by reducing vertical di?erentiation, but may also have unintended consequences through its e?ects on market structure. We study these e?ects in the context of pharmaceutical bioequivalence, which is the primary quality standard for generic drugs. Exploiting the staggered phase-in of bioequivalence requirements in Chile, we show that stronger quality regulation decreased the number of drugs in the market by 25%, increased average paid prices by 10%, decreased total sales by 20%, and did not have a significant e?ect on observed outcomes related to drug quality. These adverse e?ects were concentrated among small markets. Our results suggest that the intended e?ects of quality regulation on price competition through increased (perceived) quality of generics were overturned by adverse competitive e?ects arising from the costs of complying with the regulation.
I11|Readmission treatment price and product quality in the hospital sector: A note|In this paper, we study the effect of readmission treatment payment in a dynamic framework characterised by competition among hospitals and sluggish beliefs of patients concerning the service quality. We find that the effect of readmission treatment payment depends on the interplay between the effect of quality in lowering readmissions and its effect on future demand. When the readmission occurrence strongly depends on the service quality, the higher the readmission treatment payment for hospitals, the lower the incentive to provide quality. Instead, when readmission depends barely on quality, the readmission payment acts as the treatment price for first admissions, and thus it reinforces the incentive to provide quality. We also show that the detrimental effect of readmission payments on quality are fed by a high degree of demand sluggishness, that is, by situation where current quality has modest effect on future demand changes. Our findings are robust to different equilibrium concepts of the differential game (i.e., open-loop and state-feedback). The results suggest that a discounted regulated price for readmission can be an effective (and cost-free) policy tool to improve healthcare quality, especially when the market is characterised by sluggish beliefs about quality.
I11|Drinking Water Quality Impacts on Health Care Expenditures in the United States|This paper explores the relationship between episodes of contaminated drinking water and health care expenditures in the United States. The analysis relies on panel data from the 48 contiguous states from 2000 to 2011. We use the population served by public water systems that violate health-based standards of the Safe Drinking Water Act as a proxy for contaminated drinking water. We estimate spatial and non-spatial models and control for factors that may affect per capita health care expenditures including variables that reflect air quality violations along with ability to pay plus demand for and supply of health care services. The results from a Spatial Durbin Model indicate that a 1% decrease in the percentage of population exposed to drinking water quality violations is associated with reductions in in-state and regional effects equal to 0.005% ($0.32) and 0.035% ($2.26) of per capita health care expenditures, respectively. Drinking water violations have a larger impact on expenditures than air quality violations (whose effects are not statistically different from zero). However, compared to other factors, such as Medicare enrollment and income, the impact of these violations on health care expenditures is relatively small. We find that regional health care expenditure impacts from drinking water violations are substantially greater than in-state impacts. Thus, a regional approach is recommended to addressing drinking water quality improvements.
I11|The strange case of appropriate C-sections:DRG-tariff regulation, hospital ownership, and market concentration|The aim of this paper is to discuss how different types of hospitals respond to large financial incentives for vaginal deliveries and to financial disincentives for C-sections. We focus on a public health care system based on the quasiâ€“market model. We theoretically and empirically evaluate a government policy equalizing the tariff for C-section and vaginal deliveries at a level such that hospitals face monetary disincentives for C-section and monetary incentives for vaginal deliveries. We first theoretically show that hospital ownership matters insofar different types of hospitals are characterized by different ethical preferences; but ownership interacts with market concentration. We then consider the case-study of Lombardy in Italy. We exploit spatial variation in the presence of for-profit, not-for-profit and public hospitals and in the market concentration at the local level to evaluate the relationship between ownership and the probability of C-section. Our empirical results strongly suggest that competitive pressures from alternative providers tend to homogenize behaviors. However, in local monopolies, we do observe less C-section from private for-profit hospitals than from public and private non-profit hospitals especially when they are medically appropriate.
I11|Does higher Institutional Quality improve the Appropriateness of Healthcare Provision?|We study the effect of institutional quality on the appropriateness of healthcare provision in Italian hospitals. We focus on cesarean section rates for first-time mothers, which is a common indicator of appropriateness in healthcare and is vulnerable to providers’ opportunistic behaviors. To identify the causal effect of institutional quality we rely on an IV strategy based on historical instruments, exploiting the idea that current differences in institutional quality across regions have been shaped by different cultural and political histories. We find that a standard deviation increase in our indicator of institutional quality leads to a decrease of about 10 percentage points in cesarean section rates, implying an annual saving of about € 50 million. Our results are robust to different measures of institutional quality and samples.
I11|Reference pricing and parallel imports: Evidence from Germany|I study the effect of reference pricing on competition by parallel imports, in particular the market share of parallel imports and the number of parallel traders. First, I analyze the effect of reference pricing on competition by parallel imports in a vertical differentiation model with a locally sourced version and a parallel import offered by n identical parallel traders. Second, I explore the effect of reference pricing on competition by parallel imports using a dataset with prescription drugs with competition from parallel imports. Both model and estimation results suggest that the introduction of reference pricing inreases the market share of the parallel import and the number of parallel traders, while a decrease in the reference price decreases the market share of the parallel import and the number of parallel traders.
I11|Parallel imports and manufacturer rebates: Evidence from Germany|In this paper, I study the effect of a change in the mandatory manufacturer rebate on wholesale prices for pharmaceuticals on competition by parallel imports. First, I analyze the effect of a manufacturer rebate on competition by parallel imports in a two-country model. An increase in the manufacturer rebate increases the market share of parallel imports. Second, I exploit a policy reform in Germany in 2010 that increased the manufacturer rebate by 10 percentage points. Using a data set with prescription drugs with competition from parallel imports, I estimate the effect of the change in the manufacturer rebate on competition by parallel imports. Estimation results suggest that an increase in the manufacturer rebate has increased the market share of parallel imports.
I11|Extra costs of integrity: Pharmacy markups and generic substitution in Finland|I evaluate how the probability of substitution of a prescribed drug in a pharmacy depends on the pharmacists' profits and patients' out of pocket costs. I use Finnish population-wide data covering all prescriptions of three popular antidepressants. I find that one euro increase in the total markup difference between the prescribed drug and its cheapest available substitute is associated with 1.7 percentage points decrease in the probability of substitution. This result is driven by brand-name drugs. An increase in the patients' out of pocket cost differential yields a 0.6 percentage points increase in the probability of accepting the substitution. My findings offer novel evidence that pharmacists' incentives are instrumental for prescription drug cost savings and overall cost effectiveness of the health care system.
I11|Übernahmen durch Private Equity im deutschen Gesundheitssektor: Eine Zwischenbilanz für die Jahre 2013 bis 2018|Der Beitrag untersucht die Übernahmen von Unternehmen im deutschen Gesund-heitssektor durch Private Equity-Gesellschaften. Hierzu wurden Transaktionsdaten aus verschiedenen Datenquellen für die Jahre 2013 bis zum ersten Halbjahr 2018 aus-gewertet. Für diesen Zeitraum konnten rund 130 Übernahmen von Unternehmen mit einer medizinischen und pflegerischen Versorgung von Patienten ermittelt werden. Dabei hat das Tempo der Übernahmen im ersten Halbjahr 2018 stark zugenommen. Die größten Transaktionen wurden in dem Bereich Pflegeheime/-dienste getätigt, die meisten Übernahmen fanden in verschiedenen medizinischen Facharzt-Bereichen statt (u.a. Zahnmedizin, Augenheilkunde, Radiologie). In beiden Segmenten findet ein Aufbau neuer Unternehmensketten statt, bei denen zentrale Funktionen, z.B. Rech-nungswesen, Einkauf und Qualifizierung, aufgebaut und den dezentralen Betriebs-standorten bereit gestellt werden. Überwiegend sind kapitalkräftige, fonds-basierte Private Equity-Gesellschaften aus den europäischen Nachbarländern und aus den Ver-einigten Staaten aktiv. Der Beitrag beleuchtet auf der Basis von leitfadengestützten In-terviews auch Hintergründe und exploriert Konsequenzen der genannten Entwicklun-gen. Vor allem die veränderte Regulierung des Gesundheitsmarktes, das starke Kapi-talangebot der Private Equity-Gesellschaften und die Attraktivität des Gesundheitssek-tors als Anlageobjekt haben zu einer Zunahme an Übernahmen im Gesundheitssektor geführt. Der Beitrag zeigt zudem auf, in welchen Feldern (v.a. neue Investitionsstrate-gien, Beschäftigung, Arbeit und Mitbestimmung, patientenorientierte Versorgung) sich weiterführende Forschungs- und Gestaltungsfragen abzeichnen.
I11|Product patents and access to innovative medicines in a post-trips-era|This WTO working paper studies availability and affordability of new and innovative pharmaceuticals in a post-TRIPS era. The WTO's TRIPS Agreement (TRIPS) makes it obligatory for WTO members − except least-developed country members (LDCs) - to provide pharmaceutical product patents with a 20-year protection term. Developing country members, other than LDCs, were meant to be compliant with this provision of TRIPS by 2005. This study investigates two questions in this context: (1) How does the introduction of product patents in pharmaceuticals affect the likelihood of pharmaceutical firms to launch new and innovative medicines in those markets? (2) For launched new and innovative medicines, how much do patent owners or generic pharmaceutical firms adjust their prices to local income levels? Using launch data from 1980 to 2017 covering 70 markets, the study finds that introduction of product patent for pharmaceuticals in the patent law has a positive effect on launch likelihood, especially for innovative pharmaceuticals. However, this effect is quite limited in low-income markets. Also, innovative pharmaceuticals are launched sooner than non-innovative ones, irrespective of the patent regime in the local market. Using a panel data set of originator and generic prices from 2007 to 2017, the study finds evidence of differential pricing for both originator and generic products. Overall, originators differentiate by about 11% and generics by about 26%. Differential pricing is larger for pharmaceuticals to treat infectious diseases, particularly for HIV/AIDs medicines, than for non-communicable diseases. However, pharmaceutical prices are far from being fully adjusted to local income levels in either case. However, competition, especially that within a particular medicine market, can effectively drive down prices in both originator and generic markets.
I11|Competition and Health-Care Spending: Theory and Application to Certificate of Need Laws|Hospitals and other health-care providers in 34 states must obtain a Certificate of Need (CON) from a state board before opening or expanding, leading to reduced competition. We develop a theoretical model of how market concentration affects health-care spending. Our theoretical model shows that increases in concentration, such as those brought about by CON, can either increase or decrease spending. Our model predicts that CON is more likely to increase spending in markets in which costs are low and patients are sicker. We test our model using spending data from the Household Component of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).
I11|Non-Tariff Barriers and Bargaining in Generic Pharmaceuticals|Pharmaceutical prices are widely dispersed across countries with comparable quality standards. We study two elements of this dispersion; non-tariff barriers and buyer bargaining power. Under monopoly, generic drug prices are 3-4 times higher in the United States. With 6 or more competitors, generic drug prices are similar across countries. Motivated by this, we use a bargaining model to examine two policy solutions to reduce drug prices. First, we remove non-tariff barriers to increase the number of competitors through a reciprocal approval arrangement and market entry. Second, we explore the US government's unexploited purchasing power to negotiate drug prices. Regarding Medicaid, the first measure can reduce total expenditures by 8% and the second by 18%. There is very little additional savings from doing both procedures in tandem.
I11|Multiple Births, Birth Quality and Maternal Labor Supply: Analysis of IVF Reform in Sweden|In this study we examine the passage of a reform to in-vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures in Sweden in 2003. Following publication of medical evidence showing that pregnancy success rates could be maintained using single rather than multiple embryo transfers, the single embryo transfer (SET) was mandated as the default IVF procedure. Using linked registry data for the period 1998-2007, we find that the SET reform was associated with a precipitous drop in the share of multiple births of 63%. This narrowed differences in health between IVF and non- IVF births by 53%, and differences in the labor market outcomes of mothers three years after birth by 85%. For first time mothers it also narrowed the gap in maternal health between IVF and non-IVF births by 36%. Our findings imply that more widespread adoption of SET could lead to massive gains, reducing hospitalization costs and the foregone income of mothers and improving the long-run socioeconomic outcomes of children. This is important given that the share of IVF facilitated births exceeds 3% in several industrialized countries and is on the rise.
I11|Are patient-regarding preferences stable? Evidence from a laboratory experiment with physicians and medical students from different countries|We quantify patient-regarding preferences by fitting a bounded rationality model to data from incentivized laboratory experiments, where Chinese medical doctors, German medical students and Chinese medical students participate. We find a remarkable stability in patient-regarding preferences when comparing subject pools and we cannot reject the hypothesis of equal patient regarding preferences in the three groups. The results suggest that health economic experiments can provide knowledge that reach beyond the student subject pool, and that knowledge on preferences of decision-makers in one cultural context can be of relevance for very different cultural contexts.
I11|Do physicians care about patients' utility? Evidence from an experimental study of treatment choices under demand-side cost sharing|We ask whether the physician's treatment choices are affected by demand-side cost sharing. In order to identify and quantify preferences under demand-side cost sharing, we design and conduct an incentivized laboratory experiment where only medical students are recruited to participate. In our experiment we achieve saliency of all three attributes of treatment alternatives, profit, health benefit and patient consumption: The choices in the laboratory experiment determine the amount of medical treatment and the future consumption level of a real patient admitted to the nearest hospital. In our experiment we vary demand-side cost sharing while preferences and bargaining power of the patient is fixed. We estimate decision-makers' preference parameters in a variety of random utility models. We find strong evidence suggesting that the amount of demand-side cost sharing affects medical decisions.
I11|A new approach to estimating state dependence in consumers’ brand choices applied to 762 pharmaceutical markets|This article shows how state dependence effects can be estimated for many markets and with few assumptions by using data on how the shares buying specific products differ between those who bought the same product on their latest purchase occasion and other consumers. Using as instrument information regarding which product was cheapest when consumers made their last purchase, I estimate that state dependence increases the probability that consumers will buy the product they bought the last time by 8 percentage points. This effect is larger for women and the elderly than for men and younger consumers. The state dependence effect is also larger for brand-names than for generic products, but not significantly related to number of previous purchases.
I11|Free for Children? Patient Cost-sharing and Healthcare Utilization|"We examine how children's healthcare utilization responds to prices by exploiting over 10,000 variations in the levels and forms of patient cost-sharing across Japanese municipalities over time. Free care significantly increases outpatient spending, with price elasticities considerably smaller for children than adults. Small copayments alongside free care reduce utilization of healthier—rather than sicker—children, suggesting that moral hazard can be reduced without increasing financial and health risks. We find that cost-sharing is a ""blunt tool,"" affecting utilization regardless of service type. Increased outpatient spending from free care neither improves short- and medium-term health outcomes nor reduces future healthcare spending"
I11|Accessibilité aux soins et attractivité territoriale : proposition d’une typologie des territoires de vie français|Cet article présente la méthodologie et les résultats d’une typologie socio-sanitaire des espaces français à l’échelle des territoires de vie. Cette typologie ambitionne d’offrir un cadre d’étude à l’analyse des soins de premiers recours en France et à l’évaluation d’un certain nombre de dispositifs pour améliorer la répartition de l’offre de soins. A partir de la littérature, nous identifions les dimensions et indicateurs pertinents pour répondre à ces enjeux. Nous réalisons ensuite une Analyse en composante principale (ACP) des 32 variables retenues puis une Classification ascendante hiérarchique (CAH). Nous obtenons de la sorte six groupes de territoires de vie dont la répartition spatiale est parfois fortement contiguë (littoraux, « diagonale du vide », départements homogènes), plus hétérogène avec des départements ayant tous les types de territoires de vie ou encore une répartition illustrant des oppositions entre centres et périphéries.
I11|Impact de l'expérimentation de coopération entre médecin généraliste et infirmière Asalée sur l'activité des médecins|Dans de nombreux pays, les politiques et réformes ont explicitement encouragé l'intégration des organisations de soins primaires et la coopération pluri-professionnelle afin d'améliorer l'efficience productive et allocative de l’offre de soins et lutter contre l'inégale répartition géographique des médecins. En France, la Direction de la Sécurité sociale et une association dénommée Asalée (« Action de santé libérale en équipe », depuis 2004) ont mis en place une expérimentation destinée à favoriser l'intégration verticale et le travail en équipe entre médecins généralistes et infirmières par la mise en place de nouveaux modes de rémunération et la formation d’infirmières sélectionnées. Cet article évalue l'extension de cette expérimentation sur la période 2010-2016 en étudiant l'influence de cette coopération, mais aussi de l’organisation et des incitations financières à l’œuvre, sur l’activité des médecins généralistes appréhendée à partir de trois indicateurs : le nombre de jours travaillés, de patients rencontrés (en file active et, parmi eux, ceux inscrits médecin traitant) et d’actes (consultations au cabinet et visites à domicile). Nous contrôlons autant que possible des biais d’endogénéité et de sélection en recourant à un design cas-témoins, selon une méthode d'appariement exact, et des méthodes d'estimation en différence de différences sur données de panel. Dans ce cadre, nous montrons un effet positif du dispositif mais relativement modeste sur le nombre de jours travaillés (+1,2 %) par les médecins et un effet plus marqué sur le nombre de patients rencontrés (+7,55 %) et inscrits médecin traitant (+6,87 %). En revanche, aucun effet significatif n’est mis en évidence sur le nombre de consultations et visites.
I11|Hospital Competition in the Netherlands : An Empirical Investigation|The Dutch government introduced managed competition to the health care sec- tor in 2006. In this regulatory framework insurers compete for enrollees and providers compete for contracts with insurers. The resulting contracts are de- termined by bargaining, which outcome depends on the relative position of the provider. In this paper, we compare how commonly used market power indi- cators predict bargaining outcomes. We combine 2013 transaction data with bilateral contract data. Our empirical models explain the relative dierences in hospitals' revenues while controlling for dierences in the complexity of patients. Four indicators are used: the logit competition index (LOCI), willingness-to-pay (WTP), Elzinga-Hogarty market share and a rule-of-thumb market share. We nd that WTP and LOCI perform best empirically.

I11|The Economic Impact of public private partnerships (PPPs) in Infrastructure, Health and Education: A Review|This paper summarizes what is known about the impact of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure (energy, transport, water and sanitation, and telecommunications), education, and health. It reviews evaluations of the effectiveness of PPPs and, whenever possible, the implications for coverage and affordability. For infrastructure, there is some evidence of PPPs leading to gains in labor productivity, as most transitions to private participation have entailed significant labor downsizing, but only mixed support for improvements in total factor productivity or quality, coverage, and affordability. Selection issues plague most available studies, calling for caution when considering the conclusions. For education, micro-level studies shows that PPPs have the potential to increase enrollment and respond to a growing demand for education, but that their impact on educational outcomes appears to depend greatly on the institutional details and the scale of the programs considered. Finally, PPPs appear to be likely to increase socio-economic and ethnic segregation in education systems. Finally, there is inconclusive evidence of an impact of PPPs on health service utilization, the quality of services, patient satisfaction and health-related outcomes. The review points to the need to identify the reasons for service under-utilization, such as lack of information on the side of users, poor quality of services, before implementing interventions, and to combine demand- and supply-side policies if needed. Overall, more work appears to be due to rigorously evaluate the impact of PPPs, especially regarding infrastructure and health.
I11|Who Cares When You Close Down? The Effects of Primary Care Practice Closures on Patients|This paper investigates the consequences that patients face when their regular primary care provider closes down her practice, typically due to retirement. We estimate the causal impact of closures on patients’ utilization patterns, medical expenditures, hospitalizations, and health plan choice. Employing a difference-in-difference framework, we find that patients who experience a discontinuity of care persistently adjust their utilization pattern by shifting visits away from ambulatory primary care providers (-12%) towards specialist care (+10%), and hospital outpatient facilities (+5%). The magnitude of these effects depends considerably on the local availability of primary care. We also observe that patients with chronic conditions shift their utilization more strongly towards other providers. Our results have potential implications for health policy in at least two dimensions: practice closures may lead to an inefficient use of healthcare services and deteriorate access to primary care, particularly in regions where the supply of primary care doctors is low.
I11|Birth Weight, Neonatal Care, and Infant Mortality: Evidence from Macrosomic Babies|This study demonstrates that rule-of-thumb health treatment decision-making exists when assigning medical care to macrosomic newborns with an extremely high birth weight and estimates the short-run health return to neonatal care for infants at the high end of the birth weight distribution. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that infants born with a birth weight above 5000 grams have a 2 percentage-point higher probability of admission to a neonatal intensive care unit and a 1 percentage-point higher probability of antibiotics receipt, compared to infants with a birth weight below 5000 grams. We also find that being born above the 5000-gram cutoff has a mortality-reducing effect: infants with a birth weight larger than 5000 grams face a 0.2 percentage points lower risk of mortality in the first month, compared to their counterparts with a birth weight below 5000 grams. We do not find any evidence of changes in health treatments and mortality at macrosomic cutoffs lower than 5000 grams, which is consistent with the idea that such treatment decisions are guided by the higher expected morbidity and mortality risk associated with infants weighing more than 5000 grams.
I11|The Economics Behind the Epidemic: Afghan Opium Price and Prescription Opioids in the US|We investigate the effect of variations in the price of opium in Afghanistan on per capita dispensation of prescription opioids in the US. Quarterly county-level data for 2003-2016 indicate that reductions in opium prices significantly increase the quantity of opioids prescribed, and that the magnitude of the effect increases with the county's ex-ante demand for opioids. Most of the increase involves natural and semi-synthetic but not fully synthetic opioids. We further find that both opioid-related deaths and drug-related crimes increase following a decline in the opium price. Finally, firm-level analysis reveals that the stock prices and profits of opioid producers react significantly to opium price shocks. Overall, the findings suggest that supply-side economic incentives have played an important role in the opioid epidemic.
I11|Spending the night?. Provider incentives, capacity constraints and patient outcomes|Healthcare providers’ response to payment incentives may have consequences for both fiscal spending and patient health. This paper studies the effects of a change in the payment scheme for hospitals in Norway. In 2010, payments for patients discharged on the day of admission were substantially decreased, while payments for stays lasting longer than one day were increased. This gave hospitals incentives to shift patients from one-day stays to two-day stays, or to decrease the admission of one-day stays. I study hospital responses by exploiting the variable size of price changes across diagnoses in a difference-in-differences framework. I find no evidence that hospitals respond to price changes, and capacity constraints do not appear to explain this finding. Results imply that the current payment policy yields little scope for policymakers to affect the healthcare spending and treatment choices.
I11|Regional variation in healthcare utilization and mortality|Geographic variation in healthcare utilization has raised concerns of possible inefficiencies in healthcare supply, as differences are often not reflected in health outcomes. Using comprehensive Norwegian microdata, we exploit cross-region migration to analyze regional variation in healthcare utilization. Our results indicate that hospital region factors account for half of the total variation, while the rest reflect variation in patient demand. We find no statistically significant association between the estimated hospital region effects and overall mortality rates. However, we document a negative association with relative utilization-intensive causes of death such as cancer, suggesting high-supply regions may achieve modestly improved health outcomes.
I11|Does price competition damage healthcare quality?|One of the reasons why regulators are hesitant about permitting price competition in healthcare markets is that it may damage quality when information is poor. Evidence on whether this fear is well-founded is scarce. We provide evidence using a reform that permitted Dutch health insurers and hospitals to freely negotiate prices for elective procedures. Unlike previous research that has relied on indicators of the quality of urgent treatments, we take advantage of the plausible absence of selection bias in our setting to identify the effect on quality of non-acute hip replacements. Using administrative data on all admissions to Dutch hospitals, we find no evidence that increased exposure to price competition reduces quality measured by readmission rates, despite the lack of publicly available information on this outcome. In fact, there is evidence of a temporary, positive impact on quality. Our estimated null effect over the full post-liberalization period is robust.
I11|On the Effect of Parallel Trade on Manufacturers’ and Retailers’ Profits in the Pharmaceutical Sector|Differences in regulated pharmaceutical prices within the European Economic Area create arbitrage opportunities that pharmacy retailers can use through parallel imports. For prescription drugs under patent, such provision decisions affect the sharing of profits among an innovating pharmaceutical company, retailers, and parallel traders. We develop a structural model of demand and supply in which retailers can choose the set of goods to sell to consumers, thus foreclosing the consumers’ access to some less-profitable drugs, which allows retailers to bargain and obtain lower wholesale prices with the manufacturer and parallel trader. With detailed transaction data, we identify a demand model with unobserved choice sets using supply-side conditions for optimal assortment decisions of pharmacies. Estimating our model, we find that retailer incentives play a significant role in fostering parallel trade penetration. Our counterfactual simulations show that parallel imports of drugs allows retailers to gain profits at the expense of the manufacturer, whereas parallel traders also gain but earn more modest profits. Finally, a policy preventing pharmacies from foreclosing the manufacturer’s product is demonstrated to partially shift profits from pharmacists to both the parallel trader and the manufacturer, and a reduction in the regulated retail price favors the manufacturer even more.
I11|Physicians’ incentives to adopt personalized medicine: experimental evidence|We study physicians’ incentives to use personalized medicine techniques, replicating the physician’s trade-offs under the option of personalized medicine information. In a laboratory experiment where prospective physicians play a dual-agent real-effort game, we vary both the information structure (free access versus paid access to personalized medicine information) and the payment scheme (pay-for-performance (P4P), capitation (CAP) and fee-for-service (FFS)) by applying a within-subject design. Our results are threefold. i) Compared to FFS and CAP, the P4P payment scheme strongly impacts the decision to adopt personalized medicine. ii) Although expected to dominate the other schemes, P4P is not always efficient in transforming free access to personalized medicine into higher quality patient care. iii) When it has to be paid for, personalized medicine is positively associated with quality, suggesting that subjects tend to make better use of information that comes at a cost. We conclude that this last result can be considered a “commitment device”. However, quantification of our results suggests that the positive impact of the commitment device observed is not strong enough to justify generalizing paid access to personalized medicine.
I11|Can Competition Extend the Golden Age of Antibiotics?|Countries world wide face an imminent global health crisis. As resistant bacteria render the current stock of antibiotics ineffective and the pipeline of back-up drugs runs dry, pharmaceutical companies are abandoning their research in antibiotics. In this paper we ask: Why are pharmaceutical companies closing antibiotic research labs when the stakes are so high? Implementing a simple dynamic framework, we show that the environment for new antibiotics is relatively hostile, compared to other medicines, due to market failures that result in excessive use and acceleration of natural selection. The analysis reveals, however, that increased competition between drugs can actually slow down the rate of resistance without, in some cases, diluting research incentives. This result, which is bolstered by scientific evidence, arises from a fundamental interplay between economic and biological externalities. We propose a patent-antitrust regime for aligning drug research and usage with those of the social planner, which implies an alternative justification of the patent system.
I11|An Apple a Day? Adult Food Stamp Eligibility and Health Care Utilization Among Immigrants|In this study, we document the effect of Food Stamp access on adult health care utilization. While Food Stamps is one of the largest safety net programs in the U.S. today, the universal nature of the program across geographic areas and over time limits the potential for quasi-experimental analysis. To circumvent this, we use variation in documented immigrants' eligibility for Food Stamps across states and over time due to welfare reform in 1996. Our estimates indicate that access to Food Stamps reduced the likelihood of an adult visiting a physician more than twice in one year, but had no significant effect on the likelihood of having any physician visits. This result does not appear to be due to changes in physical or mental health, or due to individuals with common chronic health conditions, leaving open the possibility that changes in nutrition or resources may reduce the need for physician visits. Additionally, we find that for single women, Food Stamps increased the affordability of specialty health care, which may have further reduced the need for physician visits. These findings have important implications for cost-benefit analyses of the Food Stamp program, as reductions in health care utilization due to Food Stamps may offset some of the program's impact on the overall government budget due to the existence of government-provided health insurance programs such as Medicaid.
I11|An Evaluation of the CPI Indexes for Prescription Drugs|The prescription drug component of the Consumer Price Index (CPI measures recent and past drug price changes, and provides the basis for projecting future price trends and health care expenditures. However, there are concerns about the adequacy of the price data because of recent changes in the structure of the market for prescription drugs. We compare the prescription drug data of the CPI with a large alternative data set from the IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science. We analyze the overall consistency if the data from the two sources, and examine the influence of the large shift from brand to generic drug sales and the increased reliance on third party insurance plans that are excluded from the CPI sampling frame.
I11|High-Priced Drugs in Medicare Part D: Diagnosis and Potential Prescription|Drug pricing in the U.S. is a persistently vexing policy problem. While there is agreement among many policy analysts that supra competitive prices are necessary to promote innovation; significant disagreements arise over how much pricing discretion prescription drug manufacturers should be permitted, and what portion of the sum of producer plus consumer surplus in the prescription drug market should be claimed by manufacturers relative to consumers and other payers. This paper focuses on an extremely costly component of the Medicare Part D program the region of coverage that kicks in once a consumer has spent $4,950 on drugs in a calendar year (roughly $8,100 in total drug spending). At that point there are high levels of insurance for the consumer and reinsurance for the prescription drug plan. Consumers pay 5% of costs; plans pay 15% and the government 80%. That design generates serious inefficiencies. The significant subsidies to plans in the reinsurance region combined with the launch of unique high cost prescription drugs could be expected to lead to and has led to substantial departures from cost-effective outcomes in treatments delivered. We investigate two, possibly complementary, strategies for reducing these inefficiencies. The first follows on the MedPac recommendation that the government reduce its share of risk bearing for the Part D reinsurance benefit. The second focuses on curbing price inefficiencies. It has two components: eliminating monopolistic overpricing, and rewarding the quality of drugs brought to market. It is grounded in the economics of two part tariffs, research on innovation prizes, performance-based contracts, and draws on the mechanism design literature.
I11|The Comparative Advantage of Medicare Advantage|We ascertain the degree of service-level selection in Medicare Advantage (MA) using individual level data on the 100 most frequent HCC’s or combination of HCC’s from two national insurers in 2012-2013. We find differences in the distribution of beneficiaries across HCC’s between TM and MA, principally in the smaller share of MA enrollees with no coded HCC, consistent with greater coding intensity in MA. Among those with an HCC code, absolute differences between MA and TM shares of beneficiaries are small, consistent with little service-level selection. Variation in HCC margins does not predict differences between an HCC’s share of MA and TM enrollees, although one cannot a priori sign a relationship between margin and service-level selection. Margins are negatively associated with the importance of post-acute care in the HCC. Margins among common chronic disease classes amenable to medical management and typically managed by primary care physicians are larger than among diseases typically managed by specialists. These margin differences by disease are robust against a test for coding effects and suggest that the average technical efficiency of MA relative to TM may vary by diagnosis. If so, service-level selection on the basis of relative technical efficiency could be welfare enhancing.
I11|Who Pays in Pay for Performance? Evidence from Hospital Pricing|The Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) and the Hospital Value Based Purchasing Program (HVBP), two components of the Affordable Care Act's cost containment measures, introduced potentially sizeable penalties to underperforming hospitals across a variety of metrics. To the extent that penalized hospitals subsequently changed their processes of care, such changes may translate into higher payments from commercial insurance patients. In this paper, we estimate the effects of these pay-for-performance programs on private hospital payments using data on commercial insurance payments from a large, multi-payer database. We find that nearly 70% of the costs of the HRRP and HVBP penalties are borne by private insurance patients in the form of higher private insurance payments to hospitals. Specifically, we show that HRRP and HVBP led to increases in private payments of 1.4%, or approximately $183,700 per hospital based on an average relative penalty of $271,000. We find very limited evidence that these effects are driven by quality improvements, changes in treatment intensity, or changes in service mix.
I11|Team Formation and Performance: Evidence from Healthcare Referral Networks|How does team‐specific capital affect productivity? We examine the teams that primary care physicians (PCPs) assemble when referring patients to specialists. Our theoretical model finds that team‐specific capital is greater when PCPs concentrate their referrals within a smaller set of specialists. Empirically, we find patients of PCPs with concentrated referrals have lower healthcare costs, with no discernable reduction in quality. This effect exists for commercially insured and Medicare populations; is statistically and economically significant; and holds under identification strategies that account for unobserved patient and physician characteristics.
I11|The New Prescription Drug Paradox: Pipeline Pressure and Rising Prices|Economic literature has extensively studied how prices for incumbent pharmaceutical drugs respond to generic competition after entry. However, less attention has been paid to pricing behavior in anticipation of brand-to-brand competition. We contribute to this gap in the literature by both developing a model of pricing strategies for incumbent drug manufacturers under tiered-insurance anticipating branded competition. Our model predicts rising prices for incumbent drugs for a range of elasticities as the likelihood of entry increases from competitors with horizontally-differentiated products. Using the insulin market as a natural experiment, we exploit exogenous variation in a potential entrant's completion of clinical trials to identify the effect of drug pipeline pressure on the prices of incumbent drugs. Results suggest that pipeline pressure significantly increases the prices of incumbent drugs. We expect that similar pricing effects will be prevalent with potential biosimilar entry.
I11|Saving Lives by Tying Hands: The Unexpected Effects of Constraining Health Care Providers|The emergency department (ED) is a complex node of healthcare delivery that is facing market and regulatory pressure across developed economies to reduce wait times. In this paper we study how ED doctors respond to such incentives, by focussing on a landmark policy in England that imposed strong incentives to treat ED patients within four hours. Using bunching techniques, we estimate that the policy reduced affected patients’ wait times by 19 minutes, yet distorted a number of medical decisions. In response to the policy, doctors increased the intensity of ED treatment and admitted more patients for costly inpatient care. We also find a striking 14% reduction in mortality. To determine the mechanism behind these health improvements, we exploit heterogeneity in patient severity and hospital crowding, and find strongly suggestive evidence that it is the reduced wait times, rather than the additional admits, that saves lives. Overall we conclude that, despite distorting medical decisions, constraining ED doctors can induce cost-effective reductions in mortality.
I11|Measuring Ex-Ante Welfare in Insurance Markets|"Revealed-preference measures of willingness to pay (WTP) capture the value of insurance only against the risk that remains when choosing insurance. This paper provides a method to translate observed market WTP and cost curves into an ex-ante value of insurance that can analyze the impact of insurance market policies on ex-ante expected utility. The key additional statistic required is the difference in marginal utilities between insured and uninsured, which generally requires an estimate of risk aversion. Applying the approach to previous literature, I estimate higher values of subsidies and mandates relative to methods based market surplus or ""deadweight loss""."
I11|How the Reformulation of OxyContin Ignited the Heroin Epidemic|Abstract We attribute the recent quadrupling of heroin death rates to the August 2010 reformulation of an oft-abused prescription opioid, OxyContin. The new abuse-deterrent formulation led many consumers to substitute an inexpensive alternative, heroin. Using structural break techniques and variation in substitution risk, we find that opioid consumption stops rising in August 2010, heroin deaths begin climbing the following month, and growth in heroin deaths was greater in areas with greater prereformulation access to heroin and opioids. The reformulation did not generate a reduction in combined heroin and opioid mortality: each prevented opioid death was replaced with a heroin death.
I11|Ambulance Utilization in New York City after the Implementation of the Affordable Care Act|Expanding insurance coverage could, by insulating patients from having to pay full cost, encourage the utilization of arguably unnecessary medical services. It could also eliminate (or at least diminish) the need for emergency services through increasing access to preventive care. Using publicly available data from New York City for the period 2013-2016, we explore the effect of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on the volume and composition of ambulance dispatches. Consistent with the argument that expanding insurance coverage encourages the utilization of unnecessary medical services, we find that, as compared to dispatches for more severe injuries, dispatches for minor injuries rose sharply after the implementation of the ACA. By contrast, dispatches for pre-labor pregnancy complications decreased as compared to dispatches for women in labor.
I11|Multimarket Contact in Health Insurance: Evidence from Medicare Advantage|Many industries, including health insurance, are characterized by a handful of large firms competing against each other in multiple markets. Such overlap across markets, defined as multimarket contact (MMC), may facilitate tacit collusion and thus reduce the intensity of competition. We examine the effects of MMC on health insurance prices and quality using comprehensive data on the Medicare Advantage (MA) market from 2008 through 2015. Our identification strategy exploits two plausibly exogenous changes to MMC: 1) out-of-market consolidations, which affect MMC but are not likely driven by local market heterogeneity; and 2) reimbursement policy changes in a subset of markets, which encourage additional entry and therefore affect MMC even in markets otherwise unaffected by the policy itself. Across a range of estimates and alternative measures of MMC, our results consistently support the mutual forbearance hypothesis, where we find that prices are significantly higher and hiqh-quality plans become less pervasive as MMC increases. These results suggest MMC as one potential channel through which cross-market consolidations and regulatory policies could alter competitiveness in local markets otherwise unaffected by the merger or policy.
I11|The Health Effects of Cesarean Delivery for Low-Risk First Births|Cesarean delivery for low-risk pregnancies is generally associated with worse health outcomes for infants and mothers. The interpretation of this correlation, however, is confounded by potential selectivity in the choice of birth mode. We use birth records from California, merged with hospital and emergency department (ED) visits for infants and mothers in the year after birth, to study the causal health effects of cesarean delivery for low-risk first births. Building on McClellan, McNeil, and Newhouse (1994), we use the relative distance from a mother’s home to hospitals with high and low c-section rates as an instrument for c-section. We show that relative distance is a strong predictor of c-section but is orthogonal to many observed risk factors, including birth weight and indicators of prenatal care. Our IV estimates imply that cesarean delivery causes a relatively large increase in ED visits of the infant, mainly due to acute respiratory conditions. We find no significant effects on mothers’ hospitalizations or ED use after birth, or on subsequent fertility, but we find a ripple effect on second birth outcomes arising from the high likelihood of repeat c-section. Offsetting these morbidity effects, we find that delivery at a high c-section hospital leads to a significant reduction in infant mortality, driven by lower death rates for newborns with high rates of pre-determined risk factors.
I11|Reimbursement Rates for Primary Care Services: Evidence of Spillover Effects to Behavioral Health|We study spillover effects from the largest increase in Medicaid reimbursement rates in the history of the program for primary care services to behavioral health and healthcare outcomes; mental illness, substance use disorders, and tobacco product use. Much of the variation in Medicaid reimbursement rates we leverage is attributable to a large federally mandated increase between 2013 and 2014. We apply differences-in-differences models to survey data specifically designed to measure behavioral health outcomes over the period 2010 to 2016. We find that higher primary care Medicaid reimbursement rates improve behavioral health outcomes among enrollees. We find no evidence that behavioral healthcare service use is altered. Previous economic research shows that the mandated boost increased office visits. Thus our results suggest that primary care providers are efficient in improving behavioral health outcomes among Medicaid enrollees. Given established shortages of behavioral health providers, these findings are important from a healthcare workforce and policy perspective.
I11|Defensive Medicine: Evidence from Military Immunity|We estimate the extent of defensive medicine by physicians, embracing the no-liability counterfactual made possible by the structure of liability rules in the Military Heath System. Active-duty patients seeking treatment from military facilities cannot sue for harms resulting from negligent care, while protections are provided to dependents treated at military facilities and to all patients—active-duty or not—that receive care from civilian facilities. Drawing on this variation and exploiting exogenous shocks to care location choices stemming from base-hospital closures, we find suggestive evidence that liability immunity reduces inpatient spending by 5% with no measurable negative effect on patient outcomes.
I11|Are Health Care Services Shoppable? Evidence from the Consumption of Lower-Limb MRI Scans|We study how privately insured individuals choose lower-limb MRI scan providers. Despite significant out-of-pocket costs and little variation in quality, patients often received care in high-priced locations when lower priced options were available. The choice of provider is such that, on average, patients bypassed 6 lower-priced providers between their homes and treatment locations. We show that referring physicians heavily influence where patients receive care. The influence of referring physicians is dramatically greater than the influence of patient cost-sharing or patients’ home zip code fixed effects. Patients with vertically integrated referring physicians are also more likely to receive costlier hospital-based scans.
I11|The Effect of Disenrollment from Medicaid on Employment, Insurance Coverage, Health and Health Care Utilization|This study examines the effect of a Medicaid disenrollment on employment, sources of health insurance coverage, health, and health care utilization of childless adults using longitudinal data from the 2004 Panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation. From July through September 2005, TennCare, the Tennessee Medicaid program, disenrolled approximately 170,000 adults following a change in eligibility rules. Following this eligibility change, the fraction of adults in Tennessee covered by Medicaid fell by over 5 percentage points while uninsured rates increased by almost 5 percentage points relative to adults in other Southern states. There is no evidence of an increase in employment rates in Tennessee following the disenrollment. Self-reported health and access to medical care worsened as hospitalization rates, doctor visits, and dentist visits all declined while the use of free or public clinics increased. The Tennessee experience suggests that undoing the expansion of Medicaid eligibility to adults that occurred under the Affordable Care Act likely would reduce health insurance coverage, reduce health care access, and worsen health but would not lead to increases in employment.
I11|Mergers and Marginal Costs: New Evidence on Hospital Buyer Power|We estimate the effects of horizontal mergers on marginal cost efficiencies – an ubiquitous merger justification – using data containing supply purchase orders from a large sample of US hospitals 2009-2015. The data provide a level of detail that has been difficult to observe previously, and a variety of product categories that allows us to examine economic mechanisms underlying “buyer power.” We find that merger target hospitals save on average $176 thousand (or 1.5 percent) annually, driven by geographically local efficiencies in price negotiations for high-tech “physician preference items.” We find only mixed evidence on savings by acquirers.
I11|Long-Term Care Hospitals: A Case Study in Waste|There is substantial waste in U.S. healthcare, but little consensus on how to identify or combat it. We identify one specific source of waste: long-term care hospitals (LTCHs). These post-acute care facilities began as a regulatory carve-out for a few dozen specialty hospitals, but have expanded into an industry with over 400 hospitals and $5.4 billion in annual Medicare spending in 2014. We use the entry of LTCHs into local hospital markets and an event study design to estimate LTCHs’ impact. We find that most LTCH patients would have counterfactually received care at Skilled Nursing Facilities – post-acute care facilities that provide medically similar care to LTCHs but are paid significantly less – and that substitution to LTCHs leaves patients unaffected or worse off on all dimensions we can objectively measure. Our results imply that Medicare could save about $4.6 billion per year – with no harm to patients – by not allowing for discharge to LTCHs.
I11|A Test of Supply-side Explanations of Geographic Variation in Health Care Use|Evidence of regional variation in health care utilization has been well-documented over the past 40 years. Yet uncertainty persists about whether this variation is primarily the result of supply-side or demand-side forces, and the difference matters for both theory and policy. In this article, we provide new evidence as to the cause of geographic variation in health care utilization. We do so by examining changes in health care use by the near-elderly as they transition from being uninsured into Medicare. Results provide support for a causal supply-side explanation of regional variation. Estimates indicate that gaining Medicare coverage in above-median spending regions increases the probability of at least one hospital visit by 36% and the probability of having more than five doctor visits by 25% relative to similar individuals in below-median spending regions.
I11|The Impact of Insurance Expansions on the Already Insured: The Affordable Care Act and Medicare|Some states that have not adopted the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansions have stated concerns that the expansions may impair access to care and utilization for those who are already insured. We investigate such negative spillovers using a large panel of Medicare beneficiaries. Across many subgroups and outcomes, we find no evidence that the expansions reduced utilization among Medicare beneficiaries, and can rule out all but very small changes in utilization or spending. These results suggest that the expansions in Medicaid did not impair access to care or utilization for the Medicare population.
I11|Partial Rating Area Offering in the ACA Marketplaces: Facts, Theory and Evidence|"In the health insurance marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), each state is divided into a set number of geographic ``rating areas."" The ACA mandates that an insurer price its health insurance plan uniformly in all counties within the same rating area, conditional on insurees' age and smoking status. However, the ACA does \textit{not} require that an insurer sell its plan in all counties in a rating area. Using the federal marketplace data, we quantify the prevalence of a phenomenon, which we refer to as partial rating area offering, where insurers enter some but not all of the counties in a rating area. To understand why insurers selectively enter a subset of the counties in a rating area, we develop a simple model of insurer competition. The model implies that if common county characteristics, such as the county's risk distribution, market size and provider availability, are the primary drivers for the partial rating area offering phenomenon, then there would be a positive correlation among insurers' entry decisions. In contrast, if the partial rating area offering phenomenon is driven by market segmentation, then there would be a negative correlation. We develop a novel nonparametric correlation test and apply it to the federal marketplace data. We find strong evidence for a positive correlation of insurers' entry decisions, suggesting that common cost factors are the main driver for the partial rating area offering phenomenon. To the extent that it is a concern that many counties now have few insurers, our result suggests that it is important to offer insurers subsidies that are tied to county characteristics."
I11|Does High Cost-Sharing Slow the Long-term Growth Rate of Health Spending? Evidence from the States|Research has shown that higher cost-sharing lowers health care spending levels but less is known about whether cost-sharing also affects spending growth. From 2002 to 2016, private insurance deductibles more than tripled in magnitude. We use data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to estimate whether areas with relatively higher deductibles experienced lower spending growth during this period. We leverage panel variation in private deductibles across states and over time and address the potential endogeneity of deductibles using instrumental variables. We find that spending growth is significantly lower in states with higher average deductibles and observe this relationship with regard to both private insurance benefits and total spending (including Medicare and Medicaid), suggestive of potential spillovers. We hypothesize that the impact on spending growth happens because deductibles affect the diffusion if costly new technology.
I11|Patient vs. Provider Incentives in Long-Term Care|How do patient and provider incentives affect mode and cost of long-term care? Our analysis of 1 million nursing home stays yields three main insights. First, Medicaid-covered residents prolong their stays instead of transitioning to community-based care due to limited cost-sharing. Second, nursing homes shorten Medicaid stays when capacity binds to admit more profitable out-of-pocket payers. Third, providers react more elastically to financial incentives than patients, so moving to episode-based provider reimbursement is more effective in shortening Medicaid stays than increasing resident cost-sharing. Moreover, we do not find evidence for health improvements due to longer stays for marginal Medicaid beneficiaries.
I11|Firm Scope and Spillovers from New Product Innovation: Evidence from Medical Devices|When firms span related product categories, spillovers across categories become central to firm strategy and industrial policy, due to their potential to foreclose competition and affect innovation incentives. We exploit major new product innovations in one medical device category, and detailed sales data across related categories, to develop a causal research design for spillovers at the customer level. We find evidence of spillovers, primarily associated with complementarities in usage. These spillovers imply large benefits to multi- vs. single-category firms, accounting for nearly one quarter of sales in the complimentary category (equivalent to four percent of revenue in the focal category).
I11|How Important Is Price Variation Between Health Insurers?|Prices negotiated between payers and providers affect a health insurance contract's value via enrollees' cost-sharing and self-insured employers' costs. However, price variation across payers is hard to observe. We measure negotiated prices for hospital-payer pairs in Massachusetts and characterize price variation. Between-payer price variation is similar in magnitude to between-hospital price variation. Administrative-services-only contracts, in which insurers do not bear risk, have higher prices. We model negotiation incentives and show that contractual form and demand responsiveness to negotiated prices are important determinants of negotiated prices.
I11|Free for Children? Patient Cost-sharing and Healthcare Utilization|This study exploits over 5,000 variations in subsidy generosity across ages and municipalities in Japan to examine how children respond to healthcare prices. We find that free care significantly increases outpatient spending, with price elasticities considerably smaller than for adults. Price responses are substantially larger when small copayments are introduced, indicating more elastic demand around a zero price. We also find that increased utilization primarily reflects low-value and costly care: increased outpatient spending neither reduces subsequent hospitalization by “avoidable” conditions nor improves short- or medium-term health outcomes. By contrast, inappropriate use of antibiotics and costly after-hours visits increase.
I11|The Effects of Medicare Advantage on Opioid Use|Despite a vast literature on the determinants of prescription opioid use, the role of health insurance plans has received little attention. We study how the form of Medicare beneficiaries’ drug coverage affects the volume of opioids they consume. We find that enrollment in Medicare Advantage, which integrates drug coverage with other medical benefits, significantly reduces beneficiaries’ likelihood of filling an opioid prescription, as compared to enrollment in a stand-alone drug plan. Approximately half of this effect was due to fewer fills from prescribers who write a very large number of opioid prescriptions.
I11|Reinsurance, Repayments, and Risk Adjustment in Individual Health Insurance: Germany, The Netherlands and the U.S. Marketplaces|Reinsurance can complement risk adjustment of health plan payments to improve fit of payments to plan spending at the individual and group level. This paper proposes three improvements in health plan payment systems using reinsurance. First, we base reinsurance payments on spending not accounted for by the risk adjustment system, rather than just high spending. Second, we propose pairing reinsurance for individual-level losses with repayments for individual-level profits. Third, we optimize the weights on the risk adjustors taking account of the presence of reinsurance/repayment. We implement our methodology in data from Germany, The Netherlands and the U.S. Marketplaces, comparing our modified approach to plan payment with risk adjustment as currently practiced in the three settings. The combination of the three improvements yields very substantial improvements in the individual-level fit of payments to plan spending in all three countries.
I11|Competition and equity in health care markets|We provide a model where hospitals compete on quality under fixed prices to investigate how hospital competition affects (i) quality differences between hospitals, and as a result, (ii) health inequalities across hospitals and patient severities. The answer to the first question is ambiguous and depends on factors related to both demand and supply of health care. Whether competition increases or reduces health inequalities depends on the type and measure of inequality. Health inequalities due to the postcode lottery are more likely to decrease if the marginal health gains from quality decrease at a higher rate, whereas health inequalities between high- and low-severity patients decrease if patient composition effects are sufficiently small. We also investigate the effect of competition on health inequalities as measured by the Gini and the Generalised Gini coefficients, and highlight differences compared to the simpler dispersion measures.
I11|How does the type of remuneration affect physician behaviour? Fixed salary versus fee-for-service|We analyse the effects of two different types of physician remuneration - fee-for-service and fixed salary - on the treatment decisions of general practitioners (GPs) and on patients´ health outcomes. Using rich Norwegian register data during the period 2009-2013, we focus on GP locums working in a succession of temporary positions, which allows us to observe the same GPs working under different remuneration schemes within a relatively short period of time. We find that GPs respond strongly and consistently to changes in remuneration type. Compared with fixed salary, GP payment by fee-for-service leads to an increase in the supply of consultations and a higher provision of medical services (along several dimensions) per consultation. This has also signficant implications for patients´ health outcomes. The probability of experiencing an emergency admission to hospital shortly after a GP consultation is close to 20 percent lower if the GP is paid by fee-for-service instead of fixed salary. Overall, our analysis suggests that fixed-salary remuneration leads to underprovision of primary care.
I11|Hospital Competition in the National Health Service: Evidence from a Patient Choice Reform|We study the impact of exposing hospitals in a National Health Service (NHS) to non-price competition by exploiting a patient choice reform in Norway in 2001. The reform facilitates a difference-in-difference research design due to geographical variation in the scope for competition. Using rich administrative data covering the universe of NHS hospital admissions from 1998 to 2005, we find that hospitals in more competitive areas have a sharper reduction in AMI mortality, readmissions, and length of stay than hospitals in less competitive areas. These results indicate that competition improves patient health outcomes and hospital cost efficiency, even in the Norwegian NHS with large distances, low fixed treatment prices, and mainly public hospitals.
I11|France: improving the efficiency of the health-care system|France’s health-care system offers high-quality care. Average health outcomes are good, public satisfaction with the health-care system is high, and average household out-of-pocket expenditures are low. As in other OECD countries, technology is expanding possibilities for life extension and quality, and spending is rising steadily, while an ageing population requires substantially more and different services. The main challenges are to promote prevention and cost-efficient behaviour by care providers, tackle the high spending on pharmaceuticals, strengthen the role of health insurers as purchasing agents and secure cost containment. Good-quality information and appropriate financing schemes would ensure stronger efficiency incentives. Disparities of coverage across social groups and health services suggest paying greater attention to co-ordination between statutory and complementary insurance provision. Ongoing reforms to improve prevention and co-ordination among care providers are steps in the right direction. However, progress in the development of capitation-based payment schemes, which can reduce the incentives to increase the number of medical acts and encourage health professionals to spend more time with their patients, and performance-based payment schemes in primary care need to be stepped up to respond to the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and curb supplier-induced demand and social disparities in access to care.
I11|France: Améliorer l’efficience du système de santé|Le système de santé français offre des soins de haute qualité. Les résultats moyens sur le plan de la santé sont bons, le public est très satisfait du système de santé et les restes à charge sont en moyenne faibles. Comme dans d’autres pays de l’OCDE, le progrès technologique accroît l’espérance et la qualité de vie, alors que la population vieillissante nécessite des services toujours plus nombreux et diversifiés. Les principales difficultés consistent à inciter les professionnels de la santé à adopter un comportement efficient, à enrayer la hausse des dépenses pharmaceutiques, à renforcer le rôle des assureurs en tant qu’agents acheteurs et à assurer la maîtrise des coûts. Une information de bonne qualité et des mécanismes de financement appropriés renforceraient les incitations à l’efficience. Les différences de couverture selon les maladies et les groupes sociaux montrent la nécessité de prêter davantage attention à la coordination entre l’assurance maladie obligatoire et l’assurance complémentaire. Les réformes en cours visant à améliorer la coordination entre les professionnels de santé et à renforcer le rôle de la prévention vont dans le bon sens. Cependant, le développement de mécanismes de rémunération à la capitation qui permettent d’avoir moins d’incitations à multiplier les actes et d’encourager les professionnels de santé à s’occuper plus longtemps des patients, tout comme les paiements en fonction des résultats dans les soins primaires doivent être renforcés afin de faire face à la prévalence croissante des maladies chroniques et de réduire la demande induite par l’offre et les disparités sociales en terme d’accès aux soins.
I11|Improving the Czech health care system|The Czech health care system is doing well in terms of health outcomes compared to other Central East European economies that inherited similar health systems after the transition and has been converging to OECD averages. However, benchmarking the Czech health system to countries with comparable institutional setting points to potential for efficiency gains. This paper assesses the performance and emerging key challenges of the Czech health system, and provides recommendations to adapt the system to remain effective and financially sustainable in the context of an ageing society. Further, the contribution of various disincentives in the system on the supply and the demand side of health care are discussed. This Working Paper relates to the 2018 OECD Economic Survey of Czech Republic. (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-czech-republic.htm).
I11|Price Discrimination in the Italian Medical Device Industry: An Empirical Analysis|In this paper we carry out an empirical analysis to show that the significant price dispersion in the Italian market for medical devices may also be due to price discrimination strategies. We find that ASL (Aziende Sanitarie Locali) incur higher costs than AO (Aziende Ospedaliere) that purchase larger quantities. Centralized purchasing agencies pay lower prices than single purchasers. Therefore second-degree price discrimination seems to be one cause of price differences. Product age has a negative effect on prices due to the impact of innovation on suppliers’ costs. Concerning geographical price discrimination, public procurers located in the south pay significantly higher prices than those located in Northern or Central Italy. However we show that this result may be due to the higher probability that southern public procurers purchase from independent retailers rather than from producers of medical devices, implying a potential double marginalization effect due to the market power of retailers at a local level.
I11|Equilibrium Labor Market Search and Health Insurance Reform, Third Version|We present and empirically implement an equilibrium labor market search model where risk averse workers facing medical expenditure shocks are matched with ï¬ rms making health insurance coverage decisions. Our model delivers a rich set of predictions that can account for a wide variety of phenomenon observed in the data including the correlations among ï¬ rm sizes, wages, employer-sponsored health insurance oï¬€ering rates, turnover rates and workersâ€™ health compositions. We estimate our model by Generalized Method of Moments using a combination of micro datasets including the Survey of Income and Program Participation, the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the Kaiser Family Employer Health Insurance Beneï¬ ts Survey. We use our estimated model to evaluate the equilibrium impact of the 2010 Aï¬€ordable Care Act (ACA) and compare it with other health care reform proposals. We also use the estimates of the early impact of the ACA as a model validation. We ï¬ nd that the full implementation of the ACA would reduce the uninsured rate among the workers in our estimation sample from about 21.3% in the pre-ACA benchmark economy to 6.6%. We also ï¬ nd that income-based premium subsidies for health insurance purchases from the exchange play an important role for the sustainability of the ACA; without the premium subsidies, the uninsured rate would be around 15.8%. In contrast, as long as premium subsidies and health insurance exchanges with community ratings stay intact, ACA without the individual mandate, or without the employer mandate, or without both mandates, could still succeed in reducing the uninsured rates to 11.4%, 7.5% and 12.9% respectively.
I11|Partial Rating Area Offering in the ACA Marketplaces: Facts, Theory and Evidence|In the health insurance marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), each state is divided into a set number of geographic â€œrating areas.â€ The ACA mandates that an insurer price its health insurance plan uniformly in all counties within the same rating area, conditional on insureesâ€™ age and smoking status. However, the ACA does not require that an insurer sell its plan in all counties in a rating area. Using the federal marketplace data, we quantify the prevalence of a phenomenon, which we refer to as partial rating area offering, where insurers enter some but not all of the counties in a rating area. To understand why insurers selectively enter a subset of the counties in a rating area, we develop a simple model of insurer competition. The model implies that if common county characteristics, such as the countyâ€™s risk distribution, market size and provider availability, are the primary drivers for the partial rating area offering phenomenon, then there would be a positive correlation among insurersâ€™ entry decisions. In contrast, if the partial rating area offering phenomenon is driven by market segmentation, then there would be a negative correlation. We develop a novel nonparametric correlation test and apply it to the federal marketplace data. We find strong evidence for a positive correlation of insurersâ€™ entry decisions, suggesting that common cost factors are the main driver for the partial rating area offering phenomenon. To the extent that it is a concern that many counties now have few insurers, our result suggests that it is important to offer insurers subsidies that are tied to county characteristics.
I11|National Drug Policy Face-off: Some Notes Justifying the Regulations and Drug Price Control Regime in India|This is an attempt in examining and carrying out the discussion and debate on regulations and prince control in pharmaceutical industry in the Indian context. Herein the above discussion presented the perspectives of the industry and the welfare of the poor population along with alternative options. Given its critical nature in existence of human race while protecting, maintaining and restoring health of human being, regulations on pharmaceutical industry are needed to ensure safety, quality and effectiveness of drugs they develop and produce. As pharmaceutical industry involved with the phenomenon of Induced-demand and it is one of the industries where the price competition may not be prevailing, hence price controls on certain essential and life-saving drugs are needed especially in the Indian context.
I11|Economics of NHS Cost-Saving and its Morality on the ‘Living Dead’|This article has been championed on account of the experience of (perceived) economic rationalization which seem to be the foremost of patients’ care as opposed to addressing distress to human existing well-being, while in a state of being tormented with agonizing news of prolonged ill health. Several considerations have been proposed as a way of addressing the need to rationalize resources in ensuring the long standing history of the NHS focus on ‘free health care’ is critically covered, but not in a way that destroys confidence on the ability of professionals to manifest ethical prudence in their acts of judgments about whether patients care is to be made immediate or prolonged on a waiting list. There is certainly serious impacts to be comprehended with in situation of economic rationality through services provided by the NHS; it is believed that tangible outcomes about definitive care for patients can be addressed collaboratively.
I11|Arbeitsplätze und Beschäftigungswirkungen im und durch das System der Privaten Krankenversicherung (PKV): Kommentierter Literatur-Review unter besonderer Berücksichtigung von Transformationsmodellen zur Bürgerversicherung<BR>[Jobs and employment impact in and by the private health insurance system: Annotated literature review with special regard to transformation models to a “Bürgerversicherung” (single-payer system)]|This paper offers a systematic literature review about jobs and related employment impacts in and by the system of private health insurance (Private Krankenversicherung, PKV). The available literature shows the varying evaluation of private health insurance’s relevance for labor policy depending on emphasis, perspective, methodology and delineation in use. The estimated employment impact of the private health insurance field as insurance carrier and as financier of health care services are complex. Therefore, the number of affected jobs of numerous transformation scenarios to a single-payer system which are discussed by political stakeholders would be substantial. Employment trade-offs in the private health insurance field as insurance carrier are explicitly regarded as unrealistic in current research literature. Neither the expansion of supplementary insurance business in the private health insurance nor employment creation in the statutory health insurance system seems expectable. Additionally, private health insurance companies might refuse to enter the single-payer system-market because of little prospect for success. That would parallel a “cold start” in an unknown and already fully occupied market. Employment impacts through a loss of funding for health care services could be compensated if the financing share of private patients doesn’t lead to a financial loss for health care service providers. In return, that would result in an increase of contribution rate by 1.5 contribution rate points as pointed out in the literature.
I11|Der Wohlfahrtstaat als Grundbestandteil des modernen demokratischen Staatsgefüges<BR>[The welfare state as a basic component of the modern democratic state structure]|Defining the welfare state is not a simpleminded task. Actually, there are numerous definitions which try to reflect at least some of the basic characteristics of the welfare state or its objectives and its functions. For some, there is primarily an institutional parameter, for others there are functional issues which have to be firstly indicated and for others, the ideological and political factors determine the definition and the attitude towards the welfare state. Apart from all these crucial ascertainments, there are some basic fundamental characteristics and values of the welfare state which render it as a precondition of the existence of the modern state. Unquestionably, it reflects a distinct part of the state but most importantly, it comprises a prerequisite for its existence. This is the exact aim of this paper; to surpass the theoretical diversifications and to find the fundamental common ground which forms the indispensability for the existence of the welfare state.
I11|The Determinants of Public Health Expenditures: Comparing Canada and Spain|The determinants of public health care expenditure are examined in two of the most decentralized countries in the world (Canada and Spain) for two partly overlapping time-spans of data availability: Canada, 1981 to 2013 and Spain, 2002 to 2013. While Canada generally spends more per capita on health care than Spain, over time Spain’s macro level health indicator performance has surpassed Canada’s. Using regression analysis, we find the key determinants of public health care spending include time trend, income, physician numbers and regional fixed effects. Physician numbers are a significant driver of real per capita public health expenditures in Canada but not Spain despite the greater per capita number of physicians in Spain. Differences in the growth and performance of real per capita income explain much of the gap between public health spending between these two countries with some contribution from differences in per capita physician numbers. The differential health indicator outcomes raise the question of what Canada might do to be more efficient.
I11|Health Outcomes and Policy in India|After reviewing health outcomes and policy in India, this chapter concludes that there are at least six sets of issues to be addressed with regard to improving the quantity and quality of health services, and ipso facto improving health outcomes, in India. First, the amount of resources earmarked for health needs to increase. Second, health resources need to be used in a fair and just manner and, in particular, complaints relating to egregious health outcomes need to be addressed. Predominant in this set of issues is oversight and regulation of private sector health provision. The third set of issues relates to the allocation of health resources and, in particular, to the imbalance in the allocation of health resources between towns and villages. A fourth issue is the accessibility of rural areas since it is the most remote areas that have the lowest density of health workers. Another issue is the more efficient use of health workers in order to make them more productive. Finally, Indian health policy is stronger on rhetoric and aspiration than it is on action and implementation. The successful implementation of policy requires the explicit recognition that objectives are often competing (primary versus tertiary care) and the acknowledgement that, with budgetary constraints, one cannot have more of one without having less of the other. The first role of policy is to then choose the optimal mix of objectives with respect to these trade-offs. Secondly, policies come up against vested interests which agitate (often with the support of opposition politicians) and litigate against proposed changes. Lastly, policies in India are made against a background of poor governance with the predatory presence of corruption looming over every policy initiative. In implementing, rather than simply articulating, policy it is important to address these governance issues
I11|The influencing factors of turnover on nurses in private hospitals in Binjai city, Indonesia|In Indonesia, turnover in hospital employees often occurs in private hospitals. Some private hospitals in Binjai city, find some obstacles in human resources because the turnover rate on nurses is quite high. Almost all hospitals have an average turnover rate above 10% every year and it is increasing. Basically, there are no hospitals can avoid the turnover, however, if the high turnover rate is immediately declined, it is feared to be able to interrupt the service to patients, and becomes a problem for the hospital as a whole. The purpose of this study is to determine the influencing factors of turnover on nurses at Private Hospitals in Binjai City, Indonesia. This research is categorized as Correlational Research. The population of this research was the nurses who have made a turnover and are working in private hospitals in Binjai City. There were 60 respondents taken as the sample of research. The data were analyzed using multiple linear regression test. The results showed that there are simultaneously and significant effect on the following variables; job satisfaction; working environment has positive and significant effect; organizational commitment has positive and significant effect on turnover on nurses in private hospital nurses in Binjai city. Based on these results, the most influencing factor on turnover on nurses is job satisfaction.
I11|Measuring the effeciency of medical tourism industry in EU members states|Under the Directive 2011/24/EU, medical tourism and cross-border health are interrelated terms regarding the freedom to move to get the most accessible medical treatment into EU Member State within the defined procedures for reimbursement. Little known empirically regarding the efficiency of the cross-border health/medical tourism industry. This study aims to measure its efficiency in Europe for the years 2010-2014, by using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Data obtained from OECD and the European Core Health Indicators (ECHI), which is collecting the data through Eurostat. Eurostat collects data on health care activities and provides data on hospital discharges, including the hospital discharges of non-residents and these include hospital discharges of in-patients and day care patients. The analysis uses “DEA.P, 2.1 for windows” by Coelli (1996). The results show that the Members States health systems were very efficient in handling non-residents in-patients, however when managing day cases/outpatients the efficiency scores dropped. The findings would have significant associations affecting intentions to revisit clinics and the destination country. In addition, will be useful to those seeking a better understanding of the cross-border health and medical tourism industry efficiency. Extending the findings of the European Commission report (2015c) by examining how well medical tourists are informed about the decision they are making, would be of perceived value. These are important indicators at European level by helping each Member State to measure its medical tourism services.
I11|New Technologies and Costs|Recent improvements in population health have been possible thanks to advances in sanitation and health technology. Several treatments, procedures and diagnostic devices have revolutionized modern epidemiological patterns, turning once deadly diseases into curable or preventable conditions, expanded the existing cures to more patients and diseases, and simplified procedures applied to both medical and organizational practices. From diuretics, beta blockers, vaccines, ultrasounds, tomography, HIV antiretrovirals, organ transplants and implants, laser surgery and angioplasty to human genome project, the health technologies have changed all aspects of healthcare for patients, providers, and states, bearing positive impact on social welfare. The health innovation process has however become an important driver of health expenditure growth across all countries. Not only has the technological progress generated additional financial burden, but it also expanded the volume of services provided. Even with lower unit costs, this expanded volume frequently generates higher total expenditure (Cutler & Huckman 2003; Weisbrod 1991). The future of technology costs and their impact on healthcare spending is always less certain, especially in view of the arrival of utterly new technologies, such as precision medicine and genome sequencing. While the ultimate DNA sequencing may help identifying best fit of therapies for individual genotype, incrementing its effectiveness and reducing drug waste, their characteristics are likely to be associated with high costs, with very narrow potential target population and, inversely high development costs. Also health information technology poses innovative approaches to healthcare, which will certainly revolutionize healthcare delivery. According to Kvedar et al. (2014), mobile health has the potential to widen access to high-quality and cost-efficient health services. In the recent decades business models of pharmaceutical manufacturers have changed, putting an end to blockbuster medicines and welcoming biologic drugs. Also increasingly introduced generic and biosimilar drugs drive up price competition, preventing development of treatments representing only marginal refinements with respect to the already existing therapies. In this respect, the challenge for the policymakers is to discourage over-adoption of ineffective, unnecessary and inappropriate technologies. This task has been long carried out through regulation, which according to standard economic theory is the only response to market failures and socially undesirable outcomes of healthcare markets left on their own. The potential welfare loss must be confronted with the costs of regulatory activities. Overall, so far health technology evolution has delivered important value for patients and societies, nevertheless it will continue to pose important challenges for the already stringent public finances.
I11|Does managed competition constrain hospitalsâ€™ contract prices? Evidence from the Netherlands|In the Dutch health care system health insurers negotiate with hospitals about the pricing of hospital products in a managed competition framework. In this paper, we study these contract prices that became for the first time publicly available in 2016. The data show substantive price variation between hospitals for the same products, and within a hospital for the same product across insurers. About 27% of the contract prices for a hospital product is 20% higher or lower than the average contract price in the market. For about half of the products the highest and lowest contract price across hospitals differ by a factor three or more. Moreover, hospital product prices do not follow a consistent ranking across hospitals, suggesting substantial cross subsidization between hospital products. Potential explanations for the large and seemingly random price variation are: (i) different cost pricing methods used by hospitals, (ii) uncertainty due to frequent changes in the hospital payment system; (iii) price adjustments related to negotiated lumpsum payments, and (iv) differences in hospital and insurer market power. Several policy options are discussed to reduce variation and increase transparency of hospital prices.
I11|Causes of regional variation in Dutch healthcare expenditures: evidence from movers|We assess the relative importance of demand and supply factors as determinants of regional variation in healthcare expenditures in the Netherlands. Our empirical approach follows individuals who migrate between regions. We use individual data on annual healthcare expenditures for the entire Dutch population between the years 2006 and 2013. Regional variation in healthcare expenditures is mostly driven by demand factors, with an estimated share of around 70%. Both demographics and other unobserved demand factors, e.g. patient preferences, are important components of the demand share. The relative importance of different causes varies with the groups of regions being compared.
I11|Competition in health care markets: treatment volume and quality|This paper introduces a workhorse model to analyze the effects of provider and insurer competition in health care markets. The two contracting imperfections we focus on are the following: (i) whether or not a patient should be treated and (ii) treatment quality are both not contractible. We derive conditions under which the market can implement first best quality and volume with the optimal competition intensities. First best competition intensity is strictly positive in both markets. If there is under-investment in quality, provider competition should be increased. Increasing insurer competition tends to increase treatment volume. If the planner cannot make the provider market competitive enough, it is optimal to increase insurer competition beyond its first best level thereby creating over-treatment.
I11|Spatial competition and quality: evidence from the English family doctor market|We examine whether family doctor firms in England respond to local competition by increasing their quality. We measure quality in terms of clinical performance and patient-reported satisfaction to capture its multi-dimensional nature. We use a panel covering 8 years for over 8000 English general practices, allowing us to control for unobserved local area effects. We measure competition by the number of rival doctors within a small distance. We find that increases in local competition are associated with increases in clinical quality and patient satisfaction, particularly for firms with lower quality. However, the magnitude of the effect is small.
I11|Equilibrium Provider Networks: Bargaining and Exclusion in Health Care Markets|"We evaluate the consequences of narrow hospital networks in commercial health care markets. We develop a bargaining solution, ""Nash-in-Nash with Threat of Replacement,"" that captures insurers' incentives to exclude, and combine it with California data and estimates from Ho and Lee (2017) to simulate equilibrium outcomes under social, consumer, and insurer-optimal networks. Private incentives to exclude generally exceed social incentives, as the insurer benefits from substantially lower negotiated hospital rates. Regulation prohibiting exclusion increases prices and premiums and lowers consumer welfare without significantly affecting social surplus. However, regulation may prevent harm to consumers living close to excluded hospitals."
I11|Optimal Healthcare Contracts:Theory and Empirical Evidence from Italy|In this paper we investigate the nature of the contracts between a large health-care purchaser and health service providers in a prospective payment system. We model theoretically the interaction between patients choice and cream-skimming by hospitals. We test the model using a very large and detailed administrative dataset for the largest region in Italy. In line with our theoretical results, we show that the state funded purchaser offers providers a system of incentives such that the most efficient providers both treat more patients and also treat more difficult patients, thus receiving a higher average payment per treatment.
I11|Free health care for the poor: a good way to achieve universal health coverage? Evidence from Morocco|Policies and programs aimed at giving access to health care free of charge for some segments of the population are increasingly being put in place by low- and middle income countries, going against the Washington-consensus era recommendation to impose user fees on public health care to insure a better quality of service. Yet, such policies may not be suited for middle-income countries, where user fees are not necessarily be the biggest barriers to health care. We study a nationwide example of such a policy with the generalization of the Medical Assistance Regime or RAMED in the Kingdom of Morocco, a policy aiming at giving free access to hospital care to the poorest quarter of the population. Using nationally representative panel data collected before, during and after the extension of the policy, we show that the removal of user fees did have a positive impact on access to health care, but that this impact comes mostly from poorer, rural households. We also study the impact on health expenditures, and find that it has not led to a decrease of the financial burden, except for the subset of urban households that have recurring health expenditures. Overall, our result show that in a middle income country , user fees, even modest, seem to significantly deter healthcare usage for the rural part of the population.
I11|Do You Have to Win It to Fix It? A Longitudinal Study of Lottery Winners and Their Health-Care Demand|We exploit lottery wins to investigate the effects of exogenous changes to individuals' income on the utilization of health-care services, and the choice between private and public health care in the United Kingdom. Our empirical strategy focuses on lottery winners in an individual fixed-effects framework and hence the variation of winnings arises from within-individual differences in small versus large winnings. The results indicate that lottery winners with larger wins are more likely to choose private health services than public health services from the National Health Service. The positive effect of wins on the choice of private care is driven largely by winners with medium to large winnings (win category > £ [or US$750]; mean = £1,922.5 [US$2,893.5], median = £1,058.2 [US$1,592.7]). There is some evidence that the effect of winnings vary by whether individuals have private health insurance. We also find weak evidence that large winners are more likely to take up private medical insurance. Large winners are also more likely to drop private insurance coverage between approximately 9 and 10 months earlier than smaller winners, possibly after their winnings have been exhausted. Our estimates for the lottery income elasticities for public health care (relative to no care) are very small and are not statistically distinguishable from zero; those of private health care range from 0 to 0.26 for most of the health services considered, and 0.82 for cervical smear.
I11|An Analysis of Private-Sector Prices for Physiciansâ€™ Services: Working Paper 2018-01|Physiciansâ€™ services account for a substantial portion of health care spending in the United States. Using 2014 claims data from three major insurers, we analyzed the prices paid for 20 common services and compared those prices with the estimated amounts that Medicareâ€™s fee-for-service (FFS) program would pay for the same services. We found that average commercial prices were substantially higher than Medicare FFS prices and were up to three times higher out of network than in network. In contrast, average prices paid by those insurers in their Medicare Advantage plans were
I11|Erratum To “What Drives Health Care Expenditure?—Baumol’s Model of ‘Unbalanced Growth’ Revisited” [J. Health Econ. 27 (2008) 603–623]|In a recent paper, Atanda, Menclova and Reed (2018) use country-level panel data from the OECD and conclude that there is little evidence to support the existence of Baumol’s Cost Disease as an explanation for rising health costs. The result is surprising because Hartwig (2008), using similar data, comes to the opposite conclusion. We show that Hartwig tested an incorrect specification of a key hypothesis. When the correct specification is tested, his result vanishes, invalidating his conclusion. This provides a resolution for the conflict between the two studies.
I11|Sustainable Reimbursements: Towards a Unified Framework for Pricing Drugs with Significant Uncertainties|Recent political events have thrust the bulk negotiation of drug prices by Medicare and Medicaid back into the spotlight. Yet, even if politically feasible, there is no clear framework for negotiating prices of new drugs with uncertain target populations—for example, due to imprecise estimates or off-label use—or uncertain clinical effects—for example, due to heterogeneous patient response. We create such a framework using two-price programs developed in the economics of procurement literature. This framework delivers new payment strategies, and unifying them with theoretical advances in pharmaceutical reimbursement like capitation and value-based pricing. Two-price programs substantially reduce uncertainty for both payers and pharmaceutical companies, while still creating financial incentives for those companies that innovate and create value for patients.
I11|Adolescents on the Road: A Case Study of Determinants of Risky Behaviors|The 2016 report of the European Transport Safety Council claims that EU safety progress has come to a standstill. This study aims at deepening the knowledge of factors that influence adolescents’ risky behavior on the road. Bayesian Networks offer a promising new way to looking at the issue. In the analysis of a dataset collected in Tuscany, Italy, called EDIT, we found evidence that the use of alcohol and illegal substances explain only part of the probability of having an accident, and that other observable variables, like the level of distress or the type of school attended are significantly related to the probability of incurring in a road crash. New and close attention should be given to a systemic approach and to a plethora of environmental and individual variables that may rise the probability of road accidents for very young drivers.
I11|The Effects of the 2010 Affordable Care Act Dependent Care Provision on Family Structure and Public Program Participation among Young Adults|We use difference-in-difference methods and data from the 2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation to test whether the ACA dependent care provision is associated with family structure and public program participation among young adults. Findings indicate that implementation of the provision is associated with 10 and 15 percent reductions in the likelihoods of being married and cohabitating, respectively, and a 6 percent increase in the likelihood of being single. The provision is associated with a 12 percent reduction in being a single parent, as well as reductions in young adults’ participation in SNAP, TANF and WIC.
I11|Patient vs. Provider Incentives in Long Term Care|How do patient and provider incentives affect mode and cost of long-term care? Our analysis of 1 million nursing home stays yields three main insights. First, Medicaid-covered residents prolong their stays instead of transitioning to community-based care due to limited cost-sharing. Second, nursing homes shorten Medicaid stays when capacity binds to admit more profitable out-of-pocket payers. Third, providers react more elastically to financial incentives than patients, so moving to episode-based provider reimbursement is more effective in shortening Medicaid stays than increasing resident cost-sharing. Moreover, we do not find evidence for health improvements due to longer stays for marginal Medicaid beneficiaries.
I11|Spatial competition and quality: Evidence from the English family doctor market|We examine whether family doctor firms in England respond to local competition by increasing their quality. We measure quality in terms of clinical performance and patient-reported satisfaction to capture its multi-dimensional nature. We use a panel covering 8 years for over 8000 English general practices, allowing us to control for unobserved local area effects. We measure competition by the number of rival doctors within a small distance. We find that increases in local competition are associated with increases in clinical quality and patient satisfaction, particularly for firms with lower quality. However, the magnitude of the effect is small.
I11|Paying for Efficiency: Incentivising same-day discharges in the English NHS|We study a pay-for-efficiency scheme that encourages hospitals to admit and discharge patients on the same calendar day where clinically appropriate. Since 2010, hospitals in the English NHS receive a higher price for patients treated as same-day discharge than for overnight stays, despite the former being less costly. We analyse administrative data for patients treated for 191 conditions for which same-day discharge is clinically appropriate â€” of which 32 are incentivised â€” during 2006-2014. Using interrupted time series, differences-in-differences and synthetic control methods, we find that the policy generally had a positive effect on planned conditions with a statistically significant effect in about a third of conditions. The results are more mixed for emergency conditions. The median elasticity (across all 32 conditions) is 0.09 but above one for six conditions. Condition-specific design features explain some, but not all, of the differential responses.
I11|Physicians' Incentives to Adopt Personalized Medicine: Experimental Evidence|"We study physicians' incentives to use personalized medicine techniques, replicating the physician's trade-offs under the option of personalized medicine information. In a laboratory experiment where prospective physicians play a dual-agent real-effort game, we vary both the information structure (free access versus paid access to personalized medicine information) and the payment scheme (pay-for-performance (P4P), capitation (CAP) and fee-for-service (FFS)) by applying a within-subject design. Our results are threefold. i) Compared to FFS and CAP, the P4P payment scheme strongly impacts the decision to adopt personalized medicine. ii) Although expected to dominate the other schemes, P4P is not always efficient in transforming free access to personalized medicine into higher quality patient care. iii) When it has to be paid for, personalized medicine is positively associated with quality, suggesting that subjects tend to make better use of information that comes at a cost. We conclude that this last result can be considered a ""commitment device"". However, quantification of our results suggests that the positive impact of the commitment device observed is not strong enough to justify generalizing paid access to personalized medicine."

Abstract The purpose of this article is to give an overview of medical tourism in Barranquilla, as a base to create a cluster. The study used a mixed methodology, using in depth interviews with relevant actors and working with secondary sources in order to evaluate the extent and quality of medical services. A principal result was the identification of only three accredited health care institutions in the entire city, out of 390 medical facilities. There exists a culture of self—sufficiency and individual service not conducting to group formation. In addition, the level of bilingualism is insufficient for medical tourism needs. Relevant conclusions are that a greater number of accredited medical facilities are needed, as well as a region wide view of tourism that allows for the formation of relevant complementary services. Keyword: medical tourism, cluster, competitiveness, regional development. JEL Codes: I11. 1. INTRODUCCIÓN Las dinámicas de competitividad entre sectores productivos en los mercados globales, caracterizadas por significativas relaciones de interdependencia económica, conllevan diversas necesidades de despliegue estratégico para la generación de valor como factor preponderante del desarrollo empresarial. Investigaciones sobre el desarrollo industrial han aportado evidencia sobre las ventajas potenciales que presentan las aglomeraciones empresariales1 —en términos de su complementariedad operacional y de gestión en diversos niveles— para el crecimiento de las organizaciones y el desarrollo económico regional. Existen, no obstante, diferentes configuraciones de redes empresariales, entre las cuales el clúster tiene como particularidad la disimilitud entre sus actores, que no necesariamente hacen parte de las actividades de la cadena de valor y, sin embargo, se complementan en torno a un eslabón productivo o de conocimiento de la cadena (Barrriga, 2004). Porter (1998) destaca la proximidad geográfica de los actores del clúster —empresas e instituciones conexas— como determinante del incremento de relaciones comunitarias que caracterizan a ese tipo de entramado productivo2. Esas condiciones de ventajas naturales —tales como el clima o la ubicación— constituyen el insumo primario para la aglomeración y articulación de empresas, fenómeno que está empíricamente asociado con el aumento del desempeño innovador y el emprendimiento de regiones y países, el desarrollo técnico, económico y la transferencia tecnológica (Solvell, 2008). Esto ha propiciado el interés de los Gobiernos nacionales y locales en el estudio y la generación de condiciones para la creación de ese tipo de red productiva. Por otra parte, el denominado turismo de salud está principalmente influenciado por diversas barreras de acceso a servicios médicos especializados en algunos contextos que, al prestarse con mayor amplitud en otras latitudes, generan atractivo y valor agregado a una oferta local generalmente caracterizada por un significativo componente turístico. Aunque el turismo de salud no es un concepto nuevo, en las últimas décadas ha tenido un gran impulso económico en el contexto internacional, posicionándose como una categoría muy promisoria de clúster que se ha traducido en el crecimiento de programas en países como India, Tailandia, Singapur y Malasia. En América Latina se destaca el potencial de países como Costa Rica, México y Brasil (Keckley & Underwood, 2008). La oferta de servicios de salud en Colombia cuenta con reconocidas condiciones de calidad profesional, infraestructura hospitalaria, desarrollo investigativo y de innovación en temas de trasplantes a nivel internacional. En ese orden, los lineamientos institucionales que orientan la competitividad y la productividad en el país han incluido la estrategia de clúster de salud3 (Marulanda, Correa & Mejía, 2009). Considerando todo lo anterior y teniendo en cuenta la vocación y el atractivo turístico de la región Caribe colombiana —particularmente las características comerciales, industriales y geográficas que reúne Barranquilla—, se consideró pertinente analizar los principales aspectos y condiciones estratégicas de la ciudad para la eventual conformación de un clúster de turismo médico. Esta aproximación se realizó desde el modelo analítico conocido como el ‘diamante de Porter’, que permite identificar el potencial competitivo a través del estudio de cuatro fuerzas. Para este análisis se entrevistaron expertos de los sectores que por sus características podrían integrar el clúster, con el propósito de conocer sus apreciaciones, experiencias y expectativas al respecto. Así fue posible identificar barreras para su implementación y, con base en ello, se plantearon recomendaciones orientadas a facilitar condiciones de complementariedad entre em 2. ASPECTOS TEÓRICO—CONCEPTUALES Para desarrollar el presente estudio se tomó en cuenta, además del modelo analítico de las cuatro fuerzas de Porter, la estrecha relación entre algunos conceptos clave relacionados con las condiciones estratégicas para la conformación de un clúster. A continuación, se sintetizan dichas relaciones. 2.1. Relación entre los conceptos de desarrollo, competitividad, política territorial y clúster Según Cuervo (2003), las acepciones más recientes del desarrollo mantienen los objetivos de crecimiento económico y la producción de riqueza como ejes para la satisfacción de las necesidades humanas básicas. Además, sostiene que hoy día estos ejes son asumidos bajo la forma predominante del concepto de competitividad, entendida en el marco de las capacidades para atraer inversión externa a los contextos local y regional, como también en la generación y consolidación de capacidades endógenas debidamente articuladas al contexto global. Por su parte, la Organización para la Cooperación y el Desarrollo Económico (OCDE, 2001) define que la política territorial es un campo de intervención que abarca toda acción del Estado orientada a promover el desarrollo de las unidades territoriales de un país, y tiene la capacidad de reducir las disparidades entre ellas, especialmente en cuanto a oportunidades de desarrollo. Así pues, el énfasis en la visión actual de las políticas regionales de desarrollo se ubica en la generación de ventajas competitivas territoriales “mediante el aprovechamiento más eficiente de los recursos endógenos y la creación de entornos locales innovadores, contando para ello con la cooperación estratégica de los actores públicos y privados territoriales” (Aghón, Alburquerque & Cortés, 2001, p. 47). En esos términos, la modernización en los países latinoamericanos se da especialmente en tres grupos de interés que de acuerdo con Aghón et al. (2001), marcan el andamiaje y correcto funcionamiento de una región competitiva. En el primer grupo están ubicadas las empresas y localizaciones que, a través del tiempo, han generado clústeres transformando la estructura económica, logrando mayor competitividad e incrementando la ventaja competitiva regional. En el segundo grupo está la modernización de la administración pública, que contribuye significativamente a la eficiencia y la eficacia de la gestión político—administrativa, mejorando los servicios y posibilitando la interacción con los centros urbanos. En tercer lugar está la modernización de la gestión política, pieza clave en este proceso, debido a su función de generar políticas y normas que agilicen los procesos para importación o exportación de productos o servicios, mejorando la relación del Estado con las empresas privadas y redefiniendo así las condiciones óptimas para cada región. En este escenario, las contribuciones de Porter (1998) establecen que la competitividad industrial está soportada, entre otros factores, por los clústeres, definidos como: […] una concentración geográfica de empresas interconectadas, pertenecientes a un campo concreto, unidas por sus rasgos comunes y complementariedad entre sí, junto a suministradores especializados, proveedores de servicios, empresas de sectores afines e instituciones conexas que compiten y cooperan. Por su dimensión geográfica, el clúster puede ser urbano, regional, nacional e incluso supranacional (citado en Cárdenas & Restrepo, 2013, p. 10). En ese mismo sentido, otros autores, como Ramos (1998), Yoshioka y Restrepo (2008), definen clúster como la aglomeración de empresas en términos de localización con propósitos de reducción de costos e importantes y acumulativas externalidades producidas, en la que incluyen mano de obra especializada y servicios complementarios desarrollando la posibilidad de alcanzar, por medio de la acción conjunta, la eficiencia colectiva. Habiendo expuesto las relaciones entre el desarrollo regional, la competitividad y el concepto de clúster como estrategia para la generación de ventajas competitivas, a continuación se define el tipo especial de clúster en que se enfoca este artículo. 2.2. El concepto de ‘turismo de salud’ De acuerdo con el Plan de Transformación Productiva (PTP), el turismo de salud es un proceso en el cual una persona viaja a un lugar diferente al de residencia para recibir servicios de salud. El sector está compuesto por cuatro categorías que clasifican a los turistas dependiendo de sus objetivos en cuanto a atención médica: • Medicina curativa: corresponde a pacientes que se desplazan para realizarse procedimientos quirúrgicos o tratamientos especializados como trasplantes o cirugías no electivas. • Medicina preventiva: clasifica a los pacientes motivados por chequeos generales y diagnósticos para la prevención de enfermedades. Usualmente se da por motivos de deficiencia en coberturas y altos costos en los países de origen, frente a condiciones de accesibilidad competitivas en el exterior. • Medicina estética: está orientada a pacientes que desean realizarse cirugías estéticas o de reconstrucción con el objetivo de prevenir el envejecimiento y mejorar la apariencia física. • Medicina de bienestar: agrupa pacientes que buscan mejorar su calidad de vida, e incrementar su satisfacción con respecto a su salud física, mental y emocional. Además, tienen interés en conocer ambientes que faciliten el confort y el escape de la rutina. Conforme a lo anterior, en muchos países se aprovecha el abanico de oportunidades de negocio que ofrece el turismo de salud (Smith, Chanda & Tangcharoensathien, 2009; Arias, Caraballo & Muñoz, 2016; Lee & Spisto, 2007; Ramírez de Arellano, 2007; Timmermans, 2004). El impacto de la globalización en los cambios relacionados con los actores del sector salud dio paso al robustecimiento de la oferta, consolidando una mayor circulación de pacientes transfronterizos (Smith, Martínez & Chanda, 2011). 2.3. Marco analítico de la competitividad: el ‘diamante de Porter’ El modelo del diamante de Porter (1991) es un sistema que identifica cuatro fuerzas interrelacionadas que caracterizan la competitividad en diferentes unidades de análisis. Las fuerzas o variables que plantea el modelo son las mismas en las que se fundamentan las empresas para lograr posicionarse en un mercado: condición de los factores, condición de la demanda, empresas relacionadas horizontal y verticalmente, la estructura y rivalidad de las industrias. A su vez, se encuentran unidas o complementadas por dos variables auxiliares: el Gobierno y la casualidad. Esas variables explican las razones intrínsecas por las que un país evidencia mayor competitividad que otro o por qué una industria o sector es más eficiente que otro en el mismo país. Además, permite explicar cómo influye la pertenencia de una industria en la consecución de una posición ventajosa para competir con empresas a nivel internacional. Las cuatro fuerzas pueden ser analizadas separadamente, como también se puede observar que las acciones aplicadas a una de ellas repercuten en las demás. Un breve análisis de estas fuerzas permite afirmar que: • La condición de los factores se refiere a la mano de obra especializada o infraestructura necesaria para competir en un sector específico. • La condición de la demanda se enfoca en los productos y servicios de los diferentes sectores. • Los sectores afines y de apoyo analizan los proveedores y sectores afines que sean internacionalmente competitivos. • La estrategia, estructura y rivalidad de las empresas se refiere a las condiciones de la nación para la creación, organización y gestión de las compañías, así como la rivalidad que puedan tener. • La casualidad son los incidentes que puedan presentarse en una nación y que puedan influir tanto a las empresas como al Gobierno. Por último, el Gobierno que puede influir positiva o negativamente en cualquiera de las variables. En lo referente a este artículo, se tuvo en cuenta la influencia de cada una de estas fuerzas en los sectores más influyentes en el turismo médico. Se identificaron factores, valores y actitudes de los actores que, individualmente y en conjunto, logran afectar positiva o negativamente la actividad. 3. METODOLOGÍA El análisis de los factores de competitividad de los sectores que eventualmente involucraría la implementación de un clúster de turismo médico en la ciudad de Barranquilla implicó analizar información de naturaleza mixta, de acuerdo con el modelo analítico del ‘diamante de Porter’. La técnica empleada para el levantamiento de información primaria (entrevistas semiestructuradas), su procesamiento y análisis permiten asimilar la investigación según un enfoque predominantemente cualitativo, de alcance descriptivo—analítico, diseño no experimental y de corte transversal. La muestra incluyó cinco grupos de interés: Alcaldía Distrital de Barraquilla, Academia, gremio médico, institución acreditadora y clínicas. Las entrevistas estuvieron dirigidas a representantes institucionales en niveles directivos, con amplia trayectoria profesional y/o académica en los correspondientes grupos, con el propósito de conocer su percepción, expectativas, y nivel de conocimiento con respecto a las posibilidades de implementación de un clúster. Desde la perspectiva cuantitativa, se tomó información ProColombia a partir del Programa de Transformación Productiva (PTP), así como de la Asociación Colombiana de Hospitales y Clínicas (ACHC) hasta el 2016, del Registro Especial de Prestadores de Salud (REPS) y de la Cámara de Comercio de Barranquilla (CCB) y el DANE, con lo cual se logró una caracterización a nivel competitivo del sector turismo médico en la ciudad de Barranquilla. 4. ANTECEDENTES INSTITUCIONALES E INDICADORES DEL TURISMO DE SALUD EN COLOMBIA En Colombia, el Gobierno inicia en el año 2004, a través del Departamento Nacional de Planeación (DNP), la construcción de la agenda interna para la competitividad y productividad del país, en la cual se identifica la estrategia de la creación de clústeres de salud con el objetivo de la exportación de servicios médicos (Marulanda, Correa & Mejía, 2009). Asimismo, los lineamientos de la Política Nacional de Competitividad y Productividad (PNC) se formalizaron en el documento del Consejo Nacional de Política Económica y Social, Conpes n.° 3527 de 2008, documento en cual se aprueban tres pilares de política de competitividad —visión 2032— como son: a. Desarrollo de sectores /clúster de clase mundial. b. Salto en la productividad (Porter, 1998). c. Formalización empresarial y laboral. Estos pilares se apoyan en una estrategia transversal de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (CT+I). El documento Conpes contempla que la forma menos controversial de medir la competitividad es a través de la productividad, y considera al sector privado como su mayor responsable. En este sentido, el Estado propende por facilitar al sector privado los esfuerzos productivos en tres niveles: provisión de bienes públicos, promoción de alianzas público—privadas y fomento de la dimensión regional de la competitividad. De igual forma, en el documento Conpes n.° 3678 de 2010 se estructuró el Programa de Transformación Productiva (PTP), realizado por Proexport —actualmente Procolombia— encabezado por el Ministerio de Comercio, Industria y Turismo, con el objetivo de promover el desarrollo de los sectores de clase mundial mediante la formulación y ejecución de planes de negocio sectoriales en alianza público—privada. En ese sentido, el turismo de salud hace parte de los ocho sectores que actualmente integran la propuesta del PTP, y en el cual se han logrado avances significativos como: implementación de programas de bilingüismo, posicionamiento de la acreditación nacional, posicionamiento de cinco instituciones de salud colombianas en escalafones mundiales, aprobación de siete zonas francas de salud —entre ellas, una en el municipio de Puerto Colombia, departamento del Atlántico—, desarrollo de proyectos de ampliación en infraestructura y posicionamiento de Colombia como destino de turismo de salud. Según las cifras del PTP, en su proyecto Desarrollando sectores de clase mundial en Colombia, la exportación de turismo de salud tuvo una tendencia creciente entre 2010—2013 y descendente hasta 2015. Según datos de Migración Colombia y el Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística (DANE), el turismo de salud en Colombia presentó su mayor crecimiento en el año 2013 (ver tabla 1) con ingresos de 210 millones de dólares y 49.300 personas atendidas durante el año. Para el caso del año 2014, se observa una disminución de ingresos y pacientes atendidos (144.9 millones de dólares y 41.100, respectivamente), presentándose así un decrecimiento del sector de 31,20%. Para el año 2015, en el sector sigue la tendencia decreciente de 41,47% con respecto al año anterior, con 31.900 pacientes y 84,9 millones en ingresos. En el caso de Medellín, con el Clúster de Servicios de Medicina y Odontología, inaugurado en 2009, y con la consolidación del proyecto Salud sin Fronteras —conformado por ocho instituciones de salud a través de la marca Medellín Health City— se ha captado reconocimiento internacional como uno de los mejores distritos de salud en Latinoamérica. El apoyo de la Alcaldía, a través de una inversión de 1.500 millones de pesos en el 2010 para fortalecer el sector empresarial y cofinanciar las propuestas estratégicas orientadas al acceso a mercados internacionales, ha dado mayor empuje a las labores que desde años anteriores se vienen realizando en la ciudad. Asimismo, pasos como la creación del primer portafolio internacional unificado, la capacitación del personal en bilingüismo y los acercamientos a aseguradoras y facilitadores de turismo médico han robustecido la calidad de la oferta de servicios médicos para extranjeros (Hernández & Forero, 2013). Por otra parte, en Bogotá se creó la Red Hospitalaria del Distrito Capital, desarrollando estrategias para la consolidación del clúster con la marca Salud Capital, llevando su oferta de servicios a países de la Comunidad Andina, el Caribe, Centroamérica y Estados Unidos. En ambas ciudades, el marcado énfasis en el proceso de acreditación de las instituciones de salud ha generado un desarrollo sostenible de los clústeres. 5. ANÁLISIS DE CONTEXTO La ciudad de Barranquilla constituye un importante foco de desarrollo en la región Caribe de Colombia. Su ubicación estratégica en la cuenca del Caribe y su equidistancia con ciudades como Cartagena y Santa Marta hacen complemento al turismo que no posee la ciudad, que cuenta con ingredientes para ser un referente de competitividad, debido al gran cambio urbano y las múltiples transformaciones que en diferentes niveles han venido sucediendo en la última década. La ciudad muestra una intensa dinámica empresarial, según lo refiere la Cámara de Comercio de Barraquilla (CCB) y Confecámaras. Presenta un incremento de 24% en el número de matrículas nuevas de sociedades y personas naturales. Asimismo, el capital neto invertido refleja un crecimiento de 17,6%. Este resultado es el más alto comparado con otras regiones del país como Bogotá, que aumentó 14,1%; Antioquia 9,1%; Valle del Cauca 17,5%; Cundinamarca 14,7%; y Santander 10%. Otro aspecto de interés es la distribución sectorial de la ciudad (figura 2), que evidencia que los sectores de servicio y comercio en el mercado barranquillero tienen una participación destacada, por encima de los gremios de construcción, industria y otros. Cabe mencionar que el departamento del Atlántico ocupó el noveno lugar en el ranking nacional de competitividad, de 26 regiones estudiadas. 5.1. Sector turismo médico en la ciudad de Barranquilla Durante la última década, en el sector salud en Barranquilla se ha dado paso a la modernización de estructuras, actualización tecnológica y creación de nuevas instituciones, fortaleciendo la oferta de servicios. Ha sido un cambio significativo que ha impulsado en la ciudad el desarrollo económico en diversos sectores —afines o conexos— en las instituciones de salud, y el sector hotelero y gastronómico. En lo referente al sector salud, existen datos consolidados por el Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social y entidades departamentales y distritales de salud, sobre el registro de las Instituciones Prestadoras de Servicios de Salud (IPS) que se encuentran habilitadas, y la oferta de cada una de ellas. La oferta de la ciudad cuenta con un total —entre instituciones públicas y privadas— de 5.159 en 390 IPS. En la tabla 3 se agruparon las IPS con hospitalización ubicadas en el norte de la ciudad, identificadas conforme a la capacidad de hospitalización según número de camas. En la actualidad, de las 390 instituciones del sector salud, habilitadas para prestación de servicios, algunas han obtenido la certificación de algunos procesos administrativos por el Instituto de Normas Técnicas y Certificaciones (Icontec), sin embargo, para posicionarse en el mercado internacional requieren el aval del Sistema Único de Acreditación (SUA) que garantice estándares internacionales. En la actualidad solo el Laboratorio Continental, la Clínica Oftalmológica Carriazo y la Clínica Bonnadona cuentan con esta distinción. A estas entidades se suma la primera zona franca de salud de la Costa Norte colombiana, ubicada en el municipio de Puerto Colombia. Dicha zona genera significativas potencialidades para la creación del clúster de turismo de salud en Barranquilla, debido a la variedad de servicios y especialidades médicas que allí se encuentran agrupadas. Por su calidad de zona franca, obtiene beneficios tributarios y acceso a tecnología de última generación, facilitando el logro de niveles destacados de calidad y la interacción de varias disciplinas médicas. Adicionalmente, la conjugación de servicios médicos presenta una opción de atención holística, con chequeos y diagnóstico, consultas externas, centro de imágenes, centro urológico, laboratorio de sangre y centro de gastroenterología. Se destaca el más completo centro de neurología y cirugía de cabeza y cuello, sumados a enfoques avanzados en cardiología, coloproctología y medicina del dolor. Adicionalmente, los pacientes encuentran en esta zona franca servicios bancarios, farmacéuticos y alimenticios. Todas esas características hacen atractiva la alternativa de solución integral de salud en esta ubicación; sin embargo, las instituciones de salud necesitan un inicio homogéneo en el SUA, para acceder a convenios con aseguradoras internacionales e incursionar en el ranking internacional de clínicas con altos estándares de atención, adecuada gestión de calidad y manejo con excelencia en seguridad para pacientes. 5.2. Características del sector hotelero El sector hotelero en la ciudad de Barranquilla evidencia un visible crecimiento; la incursión de cadenas hoteleras internacionales, la remodelación y construcción de hoteles nacionales vienen dinamizando el sector. Según el boletín del primer trimestre de 2016 de la CCB, se presentó una ocupación hotelera de 56,8% para el mes de marzo. Esto sugiere que la ciudad cuenta actualmente con capacidad para albergar un número considerable de turistas, incluyendo aquellos con propósitos específicos de atención en salud. El sector gastronómico, estrechamente vinculado al hotelero, se caracteriza por la diversificación de la oferta. Históricamente, converge una mezcla de sabores extranjeros por el asentamiento de familias de origen árabe, italiano, chino, japonés y de otras regiones. De igual forma, la construcción de grandes centros comerciales ha dinamizado este sector con la entrada de diferentes firmas, tanto en comidas rápidas como en restaurantes de mantel. Un aspecto de gran importancia, que hace parte del análisis de caracterización de este sector y que deben poseer todos los sectores al involucrarse en un clúster de turismo médico, es el bilingüismo. El manejo de otras lenguas ayuda a incursionar en nuevos mercados y abre puertas a mejores oportunidades. En Colombia, el índice mundial de competitividad del inglés 2016 (English Proficiency Index), elaborado por English First (EF), muestra el bajo nivel que posee el país en el manejo del idioma inglés, ocupando el décimo lugar entre 15 países latinoamericanos; le siguen Panamá, Guatemala, El Salvador y Venezuela. Estos indicadores coinciden con lo expuesto por Arias, Caraballo & Muñoz (2016), quienes consideran imperativo que los empresarios inviertan en la formación bilingüe de sus empleados, debido a la devastadora revelación del nivel bilingüe poco satisfactorio en las entidades de salud. 5.3. Normatividad y acreditación en salud Las estrategias encaminadas a mejorar la seguridad de los pacientes se han demostrado útiles para mejorar la calidad de los cuidados brindados, y aumentan la eficiencia del sistema de salud. En Colombia, el Ministerio de Salud y de la Protección Social estructuró el Sistema Obligatorio de Garantía de Calidad, con cuatro pilares de gestión: Sistema Único de Habilitación (SUH), Auditoría de Mejoramiento de Calidad de Atención en Salud (Pamec), Sistema Único de Acreditación (SUA) y Sistema de Administración de Calidad (SAC). Todos, excepto SUA, son de obligatorio cumplimiento en la normatividad legal vigente (De la Puente, 2015), aunque desde una visión estratégica de competitividad, a nivel internacional, son de imperioso cumplimiento para la constitución de un clúster de turismo médico. En consonancia con estos lineamientos, es elemento clave en plataformas estratégicas la inclusión de gestión de calidad en seguridad de pacientes, adherida a las recomendaciones y/o normativas de organismos internacionales, nacionales y regionales, cuyo objetivo sea el mejoramiento de la seguridad en el proceso de atención. Este proceso solo se logra a través de la instauración y mantenimiento de una cultura de seguridad, que no es más que la capacidad de una organización para identificar, investigar e informar las fallas en la atención, y tomar las medidas correctivas que mejoren el sistema de atención al paciente y reduzcan el riesgo de recurrencia. En el SUA, por ser transversal, convergen al mismo tiempo varios propósitos, como son: humanización de la atención, seguridad del paciente y el Programa de Auditoría para el Mejoramiento de la Calidad en Salud. Además, incentiva el manejo de buenas prácticas, la gestión de riesgos clínicos, administrativos y estratégicos. Asimismo, se considera que una institución acreditada dinamiza el sector, incrementando y afianzando la competitividad entre las entidades prestadoras de servicios de salud. Teniendo en cuenta lo anterior, la acreditación es considerada uno de los pilares sobre el cual se erige un clúster de turismo médico, debido a que, a nivel internacional, es un referente de seguridad y calidad, así como también genera la percepción de entidades en proceso de mejoramiento continuo. La revista América Economía, en el ranking de mejores clínicas y hospitales de América Latina, prioriza 44 instituciones dentro de las cuales se destacan 21 instituciones colombianas: ocho en Medellín, siete en Bogotá, dos en Cali, dos en Bucaramanga y dos en la ciudad de Pasto. Estas cifras muestran por qué Colombia ha entrado a ser parte del mercado mundial en turismo médico. En este aspecto, el sector de salud en Barranquilla se encuentra en desventaja frente a sus pares a nivel nacional. 5.4. Barreras para el turismo de salud en Barranquilla Barranquilla es —por muchos aspectos anteriormente expuestos— una ciudad atractiva para el turismo médico. Sin embargo, del análisis realizado a diferentes actores que potencien un clúster, se concluye la existencia de nueve barreras que producen letargo en su desarrollo y consolidación. La principal barrera, en la cual coinciden los diferentes sectores, es la compleja cultura negociadora por efecto del pensamiento y comportamiento individualista. Al respecto, Chadid (2012) manifiesta que los negociadores latinos son cortoplacistas y negocian bajo perspectivas emocionales propendiendo a pérdida de oportunidades. Consecuentemente, se identificó un enfoque en lo particular y no en lo colectivo, ausencia de cooperación, ausencia de identificación de metas comunes y persistencia de rivalidad entre los sectores. En ese orden de ideas, es destacada la contradicción al principio de competencia, vital para la incursión en mercados internacionales. En consonancia con lo anterior, se detectó falta de articulación de los sectores como segunda barrera. De la Puente (2015) afirma que la zona franca de salud de la ciudad ha encontrado en la falta de cooperación una de las principales barreras; asimismo enfatiza que no existe, entre las instituciones de alta complejidad y los especialistas, cooperación más allá de convenios puntuales, bloqueando así la integración de información que direccione a la unificación entre participantes. La tercera barrera es la escasa información estadística de pacientes extranjeros atendidos. Solo Migración Colombia expide esta información, y es con la que trabaja el PTP. Sin embargo, difícilmente se puede decir que la información es completa, porque no todos los turistas aportan esa información al ingresar al país. En conclusión, no existe información estadística de estos pacientes en las IPS, y si existe, no la comparten. De lo anterior, se deriva la cuarta barrera encontrada: escasez de índices de gestión. Las instituciones en general trabajan de manera individual estas variables, sin embargo, no existe una directriz que homogenice o estandarice índices de gestión y, en el caso particular de las IPS, no tienen estandarizados los protocolos de atención y manejo de pacientes. En general, la falta de fijación de metas o indicadores para medir avances, intervenir en los procesos y ejecutar acciones preventivas o correctivas, en pro del mejoramiento continuo de las instituciones, va en detrimento de generar un perfil de oferta bien direccionado, con propósitos de eficiencia continua y sostenible en los procesos. Los múltiples beneficios de tener indicadores de gestión serían tanto para el Estado como para la población; así como también se verían beneficiadas las mismas instituciones, las cuales, conociendo los costos de salud, dirigirían con una mejor óptica la consecución de máxima calidad en su oferta de servicios de salud exportables; tendrían bases reales para la planeación estratégica, desarrollando y estableciendo protocolos estándar de atención básica y técnicas fundamentales de ejecución en cada uno de sus procesos, principalmente direccionadas al trabajo permanente de brindar atención segura a sus pacientes. La quinta barrera es el escaso número de entidades acreditadas. Solo 3 de 390 habilitadas en la ciudad. Esta barrera genera una debilidad en los mecanismos de atracción de pacientes extranjeros, quienes en su mayoría llegan al país por recomendación o en busca de un médico en específico, que direcciona individualmente sus esfuerzos para atender pacientes. En sexto lugar se observó el bajo nivel de bilingüismo en los sectores. A pesar del creciente número de personas bilingües, en la actualidad se presenta como una gran debilidad en el sector salud, debido a que muchos médicos manejan un segundo idioma, pero esto difícilmente ocurre con el personal asistencial y administrativo. La séptima barrera es la gran debilidad en la oferta turística, debido a que el desarrollo de la ciudad se ha perfilado como destino de negocios. Es por ello que encuentra apoyo sumando los atractivos de las ciudades contiguas: Santa Marta y Cartagena, turísticas por excelencia. Unida a este punto y no menos importante es la octava barrera, la ausencia de espacios para Turismo de Bienestar (TB). Por último, la compleja situación del país genera una percepción de riesgo muy alta y una limitante al potencial de crecimiento del sector. Análisis de las opiniones de los actores Las barreras identificadas emergen de los conceptos emitidos por expertos. A continuación, se exponen algunas de esas percepciones. Desde la perspectiva del representante de la Alcaldía Distrital —Dirección de Gestión de la Calidad—, que en la actualidad lidera el proyecto de la formación de un clúster de salud, se considera que la mayor dificultad del proceso ha sido la asociación y el trabajo conjunto de los actores. Esto se alinea con el pensamiento individualista de los actores, evidenciable en la literatura, quienes esperan resultados en el corto plazo y no en una construcción por etapas que permitan una correcta estructuración e implementación del proyecto. La actitud centrada en sus negocios y no en el beneficio general, hace que se produzca resistencia de diferentes índoles; y afloren sentimientos o pensamientos de incertidumbre y renuencia a entregar o generar información que favorezca el objetivo colectivo. Asimismo, la resistencia a la inversión para mejora de la calidad genera conflictos. Muchos actores no consideran necesaria la acreditación para sus instituciones, al mismo tiempo que tienen poco interés por inversión en capital humano para este tipo de proyectos que requiere de un alto nivel de bilingüismo. Estos factores han bloqueado el avance del proyecto del clúster. Este actor señala que el pensamiento individualista es tan fuerte en la región, que en el proyecto de la Alcaldía se optó por conformar el clúster inicialmente con un grupo de actores limitados, constituyendo una figura jurídica que administrará y se encargará del proceso hasta que quede bien establecido. Y solo hasta cuando entre en funcionamiento se pensará en la apertura para el ingreso de nuevos actores, quienes tendrán que asumir las políticas, costos y requerimientos ya establecidos por los socios iniciales. Quiere decir que el clúster inicialmente no será abierto, como es la filosofía o estructura de un clúster con sus factores centrales que lo caracterizan y distinguen de un conglomerado simple que desarrolla redes de compra y venta. De igual forma, desde la Alcaldía Distrital se considera que en la ciudad de Barranquilla, su entorno y ciudades cercanas no se cuenta con infraestructura de spas y sitios de relajación apropiados para el TB. Desde la perspectiva de la Academia, existe una visión difusa sobre la creación de un clúster, porque se ha hecho seguimiento al proyecto existente concluyendo que no existe una voluntad decidida por parte de los actores. Sin embargo, no se descarta que en el mediano plazo la creación del clúster sea una realidad para la ciudad de Barranquilla. El ojo crítico de la Academia está acorde con los lineamientos de formación de un clúster, en cuanto a que debe ser un proceso participativo y cooperativo por parte de los actores. Se hace énfasis en que los actores del sector salud deberían comenzar con el proceso de acreditación de manera homogénea, lo cual daría visibilidad al inicio del proyecto y al compromiso de los participantes. De igual forma, se manifiesta que aunque el nivel de bilingüismo ha mejorado en la ciudad, este sigue siendo insuficiente. La formación de profesionales en este aspecto presenta mejores avances en instituciones privadas, pero a nivel técnico, tecnológico, administrativo y de servicios complementarios es una gran debilidad. Se cree que a pesar de los esfuerzos permanentes en el sector salud, existen otras debilidades, como la necesidad de mejorar la calidad de todos los servicios desde el ingreso, proceso de admisión de pacientes, manejo de protocolos de atención y seguridad a los pacientes. En la Academia, se considera que la ciudad de Medellín tiene una gran fortaleza en el nivel de servicio, en los programas de salud y en la calidad de la oferta en turismo médico, convirtiéndose en una referencia de alto nivel. Por lo tanto, en la ciudad de Barranquilla se debe hacer un gran esfuerzo para superar las brechas de pensamiento individualista. Es necesario el crecimiento institucional que reedifique la formación y el sucesivo fortalecimiento de redes de cooperación, proclive al desarrollo económico de la ciudad. Se considera también que es indispensable realizar alianzas estratégicas desde la perspectiva de turismo recreativo con ciudades como Cartagena y Santa Marta, dado que Barranquilla se caracteriza por ser una ciudad de negocios y no una ciudad turística por excelencia. Por su parte, desde la institucionalidad en acreditación —teniendo como actor fundamental el Instituto Colombiano de Normas Técnicas y Certificación (Icontec)— se afirma que la acreditación en salud es una necesidad primaria para las empresas que conformen un clúster en salud, por su papel como herramienta de competitividad que les permite a las instituciones ser actores en mercados internacionales. Sobre la acreditación, se considera que dado el tiempo del proceso —estimado en mínimo cuatro años— depende en gran medida del grado de compromiso, esfuerzo y continuidad que las instituciones le den. Esto significa que siendo el proceso de acreditación completamente transversal, en las organizaciones es un proceso robusto en cuanto al manejo y seguimiento de diferentes variables, que deben estar coordinadas de manera eficiente a fin de garantizar la obtención de la acreditación. Para las instituciones de salud, el estudio evalúa diferentes temas, a saber: infraestructura, seguridad del paciente, procesos de apoyo estratégicos y procesos misionales, estos últimos de gran relevancia en el día de hoy. De igual forma, manifiesta que se está presentando una confusión en el mercado, pues tener una certificación en algún proceso no indica que se tenga una acreditación. En este sentido, se señala que el principal obstáculo o barrera que tienen las instituciones de salud son las deficiencias en infraestructura. Debido a que no cumplen con los requerimientos internacionales, constituyendo un problema de mayores costos para corregir, y es uno de los puntos de mayor requerimiento dentro del proceso de acreditación. En Barranquilla se encuentran acreditadas solo tres instituciones: el Laboratorio Clínico Continental, la Clínica Bonnadona y el Centro Oftalmológico Carriazo. Desde Icontec, se opina que falta un poco más de determinación por parte de las instituciones en el proceso de acreditación. Esta debe verse como una inversión que ofrece en el mediano plazo un retorno para la organización, y no verse como un gasto. Este tipo de inversión beneficia ampliamente a las entidades permitiéndoles ser globales, manejando estándares de calidad internacional proclives al incremento de competitividad y generación de ingresos tanto para las entidades como para la ciudad, impactando actores principales y secundarios como lo es, en este caso, un clúster de turismo médico. Se considera indispensable, para un proyecto como es el clúster de salud, contar con la participación del Estado, las instituciones públicas y los empresarios, y que todos hagan los aportes correspondientes en función de inversión económica y de espacios para la estructuración de los proyectos. Desde la perspectiva de las clínicas como actores del proceso —se tuvo en cuenta la Clínica Portoazul, considerada la primera zona franca en salud de la Costa Norte colombiana—, se presenta una visión positiva frente al concepto de clúster para la ciudad de Barranquilla. Se manifiesta que los directivos tienen claro que el proceso de acreditación es una necesidad fundamental para la organización, al igual que el incremento del personal asistencial bilingüe dentro de la institución. Un aspecto importante es que se trata de la única clínica que respondió positivamente al llamado de la Alcaldía referente al programa de capacitación en una segunda lengua, donde la alcaldía asumió parte de la inversión y la institución debe asumir el restante. Sostienen que quieren ir más allá, involucrando al personal, y que este asuma de su cuenta parte de la inversión con el propósito de generar valor, sentido de pertenencia y compromiso en cada uno de sus empleados. Actualmente, la clínica atrae pacientes internacionales a través de convenios para atención de emergencias a compañías petroleras que operan en nuestro país, pero, al referirse al turismo médico, se contempla como una oportunidad que se debe aprovechar mediante planificación a corto plazo. Esta clínica fue diseñada y construida con estándares internacionales, con helipuerto y las posibilidades de ofertar un servicio integral a sus pacientes, valores que aportarían a la obtención de manera más rápida de una acreditación internacional. La Clínica Portoazul tiene una visión positiva respecto a la integración y conformación de un clúster en la ciudad de Barranquilla, fundamentándose en que ellos como organización fueron creados para tal fin, y que con el apoyo de la Alcaldía —que ha invitado a diferentes actores a participar en esta idea— se podrá lograr en el corto plazo. Resalta también, como fortaleza en la región, que se esté practicando trasplante de medula ósea. Finalmente, la opinión emitida por un reconocido miembro del gremio profesional de la salud señala que es difícil integrar a los empresarios debido a su individualismo. Esta situación se genera por falta de educación en temas de cooperación. Se resalta como fortaleza de la ciudad de Barranquilla su ubicación geográfica y su cercanía a hospitales de Miami y ciudad de Panamá. Se tiene una buena percepción de la estructura hotelera de la ciudad, que permite una dinámica amplia en el desarrollo de todo tipo de negociaciones, y en cuanto a la capacidad del turismo de la ciudad se manifiesta que es muy débil, salvo el que atrae el Carnaval de Barranquilla. 6. CONCLUSIONES Y RECOMENDACIONES 6.1. Conclusiones • Una de las barreras más fuertes, identificadas en esta investigación, es la percepción del individualismo presente en la cultura empresarial de la ciudad de Barranquilla. Esta cultura empresarial no permite enfoque de metas a largo plazo, por el contrario refuerza un pensamiento a corto plazo. • Otra de las variables, con relevancia en los resultados de la investigación, es el deficiente nivel de bilingüismo en la ciudad. Este rezago en el manejo de segundas lenguas dificulta la exportación de un servicio de salud con calidad internacional, debido a la deficiente competencia del talento humano en la comunicación con extranjeros no hispanos, la cual debe ser productiva y eficiente al momento de tener contacto con tales pacientes. Como consecuencia, la apertura a mercados internacionales con manejo de segundas lenguas se verá cada vez más lejano. • En el proceso de conformación de un clúster de salud, para promocionar la calidad de los servicios de salud en el exterior, es vital la acreditación que garantice estándares internacionales. • De acuerdo al análisis, no se percibe una integración de los diferentes sectores que facilite el proceso de conformación de un clúster. • La ciudad de Barranquilla se ha consolidado como una ciudad de negocios, mas no turística. • Uno de los aspectos más importantes es el manejo de la información, la cual, según los entrevistados, es insuficiente, en algunos casos inexistente, y en otros casos las instituciones no revelan o comparten la información de interés. 6.2. Recomendaciones Para lograr un cambio en el pensamiento individualista del empresario barranquillero, se debe pensar en dos vías: una desde la formación del individuo en su etapa escolar, y otra enfocada en el empresario actual, con el propósito de concientizar a la ciudadanía de la importancia de adoptar una visión global y de cooperación. Se considera que promover, impulsar y facilitar la capacitación del capital humano, en áreas de investigación, desarrollo e innovación de manera sostenible, permitirá un cambio de pensamiento en el individuo con el fin de lograr la transformación, en el mediano y largo plazo, en el sector y la sociedad. • Se sugiere un mayor esfuerzo a fin de estimular y promover el bilingüismo; para ello, es responsabilidad de instituciones y actores en el proceso contribuir a este propósito, como también desde el Gobierno la apertura de espacios, unida a la generación de rubros que permitan un mayor acceso a la educación en una segunda lengua. Al mismo tiempo, en consonancia con los esfuerzos del Estado, se requiere la inversión de los empresarios en el capital humano, preferiblemente con la generación de alianzas académicas internacionales que conllevarían a lograr en menor tiempo tener una población laboral bilingüe. Cabe anotar que la existencia de alternativas como esta debe ser transversal, tanto por el fortalecimiento del talento humano, como por el fortalecimiento de la industria, lo que conllevará a alinear la oferta y la demanda del turismo médico, asegurando permanencia o sostenibilidad en mercados internacionales. • Generar interés y alto nivel de compromiso debe ser una prioridad a liderar por el Gobierno nacional. La acreditación internacional en salud garantiza la prestación de servicios con una gestión de riesgo óptima, humanización y seguridad para los pacientes extranjeros, quienes buscan estándares de atención iguales a los de sus países de origen. Los esfuerzos en el programa de acreditación Icontec, avalado por ISQua, facilitan el reconocimiento de calidad y eficiencia en salud, lo cual conllevará a un posterior posicionamiento del sector en el exterior. • El logro de coordinación y alineamiento entre actores de los diferentes sectores necesita de un programa de articulación desde las instituciones gubernamentales, mediante la implementación de mecanismos normativos que aseguren la sostenibilidad de la exportación de servicios de salud equilibrada entre sectores. Se debe despertar en las instituciones el sentido cooperativo que permite sumar más actores y el involucramiento activo de los diferentes sectores. Cuando la comunicación es amplia y suficiente se genera expectativa, lo cual incrementa la innovación y el deseo colectivo de sacar adelante las propuestas; el Gobierno debe generar escenarios multiactivos para mantener una dinámica constante en el desarrollo de cada proyecto. Además, deben existir diferentes frentes que apoyen la iniciativa, y no que esta sea responsabilidad de una sola persona. • La realización de convenios con el sector turístico de las ciudades de Santa Marta y Cartagena se hace necesaria para complementar el servicio de salud en pro de generar una oferta de valor. • Uno de los aspectos más importantes es el manejo de la información, la cual, según los entrevistados, es insuficiente, en algunos casos inexistente, y en otros casos las instituciones no revelan o comparten la información de interés. La propuesta es un modelo unificado de sistema de información, de carácter obligatorio para los prestadores de salud, con parámetros y estándares internacionales. Con esta iniciativa la competencia de las instituciones pasa de local a internacional y, en la medida en que hagan conquistas significativas, se obtendrá su mayor desarrollo y crecimiento. Esta herramienta permitirá identificar y recopilar estadísticas claves para el sector, el manejo de un expediente único del paciente —en inglés— y facilitaría la generación de alianzas con instituciones internacionales para el manejo de los pacientes extranjeros. Notas 1 Entre otros aportes, los de Alfred Marshall desde la década de 1980 fueron fundamentales para establecer estas relaciones, así como posteriores avances en el marco de la competitividad desarrollados por Michael Porter. 2 Los procesos de cooperación entre actores individualistas se justifican, desde la teoría de juegos, como una colaboración oportunista entre competidores económicos en busca de un beneficio común que sería de difícil logro por medios individuales. 3 Actualmente el tema se orienta en Colombia, entre otros lineamientos, desde la Política Nacional de Competitividad.presas, Academia, instituciones privadas y públicas, así como actores secundarios de la cadena de valor que se verían beneficiados con una eventual implementación de este tipo de estrategia.

I11|Ambulance Utilization in New York City after the Implementation of the Affordable Care Act|Expanding insurance coverage could, by insulating patients from having to pay full cost, encourage the utilization of arguably unnecessary medical services. It could also eliminate (or at least diminish) the need for emergency services through increasing access to preventive care. Using publicly available data from New York City for the period 2013-2016, we explore the effect of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on the volume and composition of ambulance dispatches. Consistent with the argument that expanding insurance coverage encourages the utilization of unnecessary medical services, we find that, as compared to dispatches for more severe injuries, dispatches for minor injuries rose sharply after the implementation of the ACA. By contrast, dispatches for pre-labor pregnancy complications decreased as compared to dispatches for women in labor.
I11|Moral Nimby-ism? Understanding Societal Support for Monetary Compensation to Plasma Donors in Canada|The growing demand for plasma, especially for the manufacture of therapeutic products, creates an urgent need for a careful discussion on the relative merits of different procurement and allocation systems in a way that addresses the increasing demand while abiding by the prevailing moral values in a society. We conducted a randomized survey experiment with a representative sample of 826 Canadian residents to assess attitudes toward legalizing the compensation to plasma donors, a practice that is illegal in several Canadian provinces. We found no evidence of widespread societal opposition to payments to plasma donors, because over 70% of respondents reported that they would support compensation. The support was higher for paying plasma donors in Australia and the United States than in Canada, but the differences were small, suggesting a weak role for “moral NIMBY-ism” or moral relativism in explaining the findings. Moral concerns were the highest-rated reason that respondents gave for being against payment, together with concerns for the safety of plasma supplied by compensated donors, although most of the plasma in Canada does come from compensated American donors. Among those in favor of legalizing compensation for donors (in Canada as well as in Australia), the highest-rated motive was to guarantee a higher domestic supply. Finally, roughly half of those who declared to be against payments reported that they would reconsider their position if the domestic supply and imports were insufficient to meet domestic demand. Most Canadians, therefore, seem to espouse a consequentialist view to issues related to the procurement of plasma.
I11|Impacts of shifting responsibility for high-cost individuals on Health Insurance Exchange plan premiums and cost-sharing provisions|Insurance companies can respond to increases in expected per-capita healthcare expenditures by adjusting premiums, cost-sharing requirements, and/or plan generosity. We use a Difference-in-Difference model with Plan-level Fixed Effects to estimate the impacts of increases in expected expenditures generated by closure of state-operated High Risk Pools (HRPs). For Silver plans, we find that issuers responded to HRP closures by increasing both premiums and deductibles, and by increasing the ratios of premiums to deductibles. This adjustment to the structure of plan prices is consistent with the hypothesis that issuers will be reluctant to adjust deductibles, because consumers tend to overweight changes in deductibles over changes in premiums. The increase in the ratio of premiums to deductibles indicates that the increase in expected expenditures triggered an increase in the share of total risk-pool healthcare expenditures paid by low healthcare utilizers, and a decrease in the share paid by high utilizers.
I11|Mergers and Birth Outcomes: Evidence from Maternity Ward Closures|Evidence suggests that hospital mergers can reduce costs but less is known about their effects on patient outcomes. We study how a wave of mergers that led to the shutdown of one third of all Swedish maternity wards affected the health of mothers who gave birth and their newborns. Applying a difference-in-differences approach to register data on all births in Sweden over two decades, we show that the closures negatively affected the health of mothers, while effects on infant health were small and insignificant. The adverse effects on mothers are mainly driven by crowding effects at remaining wards rather than by increased distance to the wards. Moreover, the closures reduced the use of C-sections for high-risk births.
I11|Information Provision and Streamlined Medical Service: Evidence from a Mobile Appointment App|We examine the launch of a mobile outpatient appointment app in China to study the effect of information provision and a streamlined appointment process on hospital operations and the alignment of healthcare supply and demand. Using a longitudinal dataset on hospital operations and a difference-in-differences model, we document that the app increases completed hospital consultations by 9.5%, through boosting registrations by 4.8% and reducing appointment cancellations by 3.4%. The app improves queuing efficiency in overcrowded hospitals and draws demand for underutilized ones. Supported by additional evidence from a subset of patients' electronic medical records, we also find that the app directs patients to the hospital and department more suitable to their medical conditions and to less busy days, resulting in a better match between patient demand and hospital service.
I11|Retirement and healthcare utilization|Pension systems and their reforms are often discussed in the context of financial viability. These debates grow in intensity with the aging of the population in industrialized countries. However, an increase in retirement age may create unintended side effects for retirees' health or healthcare costs. This paper empirically analyzes the effect of (early) retirement on individual inpatient and outpatient healthcare expenditure in Austria. We use comprehensive labor market and retirement data from the Austrian Social Security Database combined with detailed information about individual inpatient and outpatient healthcare service utilization for the province of Upper Austria. To account for the endogeneity in retirement decisions, we exploit exogenous variation in the early retirement age induced by two Austrian pension reforms in 2000 and 2003. We find significant negative effects of retirement on healthcare expenditure. For both sexes, retirement decreases subsequent expenditure for outpatient medical attendance and hospitalization. Analyses of disaggregated components of healthcare expenditure confirm a positive health effect caused by physical and emotional relief after retirement. Apart from direct health effects, the results also reveal behavioral changes in the utilization of healthcare services. These changes in health behavior seem in particular relevant for blue collar workers.
I11|Can a bonus overcome moral hazard? Experimental evidence from markets for expert services|Interactions between players with private information and opposed interests are often prone to bad advice and inefficient outcomes, e.g. markets for financial or health care services. In a deception game we investigate experimentally which factors could improve advice quality. Besides advisor competition and identifiability, we add the possibility for clients to make a voluntary payment, a bonus, after observing advice quality. While the combination of competition and reputation concerns achieves the highest rate of truthful advice, we observe a similar effect, when the bonus is combined with one of them. Thus, our results suggest that a voluntary component can act as a substitute for either competition or reputation, decreasing moral hazard.
I11|Is it good to be too light? Birth weight thresholds in hospital reimbursement systems|Birth weight manipulation has been documented in per-case hospital reimbursement systems, in which hospitals receive more money for otherwise equal newborns with birth weight just below compared to just above specific birth weight thresholds. As hospitals receive more money for cases with weight below the thresholds, having a (reported) weight below a threshold could benefit the newborn. Also, these reimbursement thresholds overlap with diagnostic thresholds that have been shown to affect the quantity and quality of care that newborns receive. Based on the universe of hospital births in Germany from the years 2005–2011, we investigate whether weight below reimbursement relevant thresholds triggers different quantity and quality of care. We find that this is not the case, suggesting that hospitals’ financial incentives with respect to birth weight do not directly impact the care that newborns receive.
I11|Health and Pollution in a Vertically Differentiated Duopoly|In this paper, we analyze a vertically differentiated mixed duopoly in medical care services. Pollution is the source of illness. The government has a dual role. It decides how much to invest to reduce the pollution level and it may participate in the health market running a public hospital. We find that the presence of the public provider increases the average quality of the service in the market and it reduces the rate of mortality. Furthermore, when the public hospital offers services with the highest quality, then this has positive spillovers on thequality offered by the private provider. Despite these positive welfare improving features, the mixed duopoly in medical care goes along with a highest level of pollution. In the presence of an increasing concern about the relationship between pollution and health, understanding the role of public intervention appears crucial.
I11|What drives the rise of antidepressant consumption? Evidence from Switzerland|Antidepressant (AD) consumption has been steadily increasing in the last decade in most countries. The explanations suggested by researchers for this increment are still under scrutiny. This study attempts to identify the determinants of AD consumption by exploiting small area variations from Switzerland between 2003 and 2014. We observe that two specific drugs - Citalopram and Escitalopram - within the Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRI) category are mainly responsible for the increasing trend in AD consumption. Socio-economic, demographic, cultural, and geographical characteristics of the area are included in multiple regression models with random and fixed effects of AD consumption per capita. While most of these factors contribute to explain cross-area variations in AD use, they provide little explanation for the temporal trend in overall AD consumption. Conversely, we find that the time trend in AD consumption is explained at least partially by the density of prescribing physicians. More precisely, generic AD turn out to be positively associated with adverse local economic conditions, while branded AD are negatively associated with adverse economic conditions and positively related to the presence of neurologists and psychiatrists in the area. This may suggest that generic AD drugs are more likely prescribed in accordance to need, whereas branded AD are more likely to respond to preferences and financial incentives affecting suppliers.
I11|The Effects of Social Health Insurance Expansion and Increased Choice on Perinatal Health and Health Care Use: Lessons from the Uruguayan Health Care Reform| In 2007 the Uruguayan government launched a reform aimed at expanding social health insurance to family-members of formal workers and to retirees. The policy increased insurance generosity -relative to the safety net alternative- and increased competition by allowing new beneficiaries to choose care from a set of private providers. Exploiting the phased-in implementation and the geographic variation in the intensity of the reform, we find that the expansion of social health insurance had a negligible effect on perinatal health and health care among adolescent mothers and their newborns. Our results do not support prior research showing health care quality improvements in settings with increased choice. We hypothesize that health care rationing by private providers due to rising wages, a smaller primary care infrastructure of private providers in low-income neighborhoods, and cultural and financial barriers may have accounted for the lack of positive effects.
I11|Switching benefits and costs in the Irish health insurance market: an analysis of consumer surveys|Abstract Relatively little analysis has taken place internationally on the consumer-reported benefits and costs to switching insurer in multi-payer health insurance markets. Ideally, consumers should be willing to switch out of consideration for price and quality and switching should be able to take place without incurring significant switching costs. Costs to switching come in many forms and understanding the nature of these costs is necessary if policy interventions to improve market competition are to be successful. This study utilises data from consumer surveys of the Irish health insurance market collected between 2009 and 2013 (N $$=$$ = 1703) to examine consumer-reported benefits and costs to switching insurer. Probit regression models are specified to examine the relationship between consumer characteristics and reported switching costs, and switching behaviour, respectively. Overall evidence suggests that switchers in the Irish market mainly did so out of consideration for price. Transaction cost was the most common switching cost identified, reported by just under 1 in 7 non-switchers. Psychological switching costs may also be impacting behaviour. Moreover, high-risk individuals were more likely to experience switching costs and this was reflected in actual switching behaviour. A recent information campaign launched by the market regulator may prove beneficial in reducing perceived transaction costs in the market, however, a more focused campaign aimed at high-risk consumers may be necessary to reduce inequalities. Policy-makers should also consider the impact insurer behaviour may have on decision-making.
I11|What underlies the observed hospital volume-outcome relationship?|Studies of the hospital volume-outcome relationship have highlighted that a greater volume activity improves patient outcomes. While this finding has been known for years in health services research, most studies to date have failed to delve into what underlies this relationship. This study aimed to shed light on the basis of the hospital volume effect by comparing treatment modalities for epithelial ovarian carcinoma patients. Hospital volume activity was instrumented by the distance from patients’ homes to their hospital, the population density, and the median net income of patient municipalities. We found that higher volume hospitals appear to more often make the right decisions in regard to how to treat patients, which contributes to the positive impact of hospital volume activities on patient outcomes. Based on our parameter estimates, we found that the rate of complete tumor resection would increase by 10% with centralized care, and by 6% if treatment decisions were coordinated by high volume centers compared to the ongoing organization of care. In both scenarios, the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy would increase by 10%. As volume alone is an imperfect correlate of quality, policy makers need to know what volume is a proxy for in order to devise volume-based policies.
I11|Achieving a fair geographical distribution of health-care resources|This paper analyzes the factors determining the physicians’ location decisions when physicians have heterogeneous preferences about the regional amenities in a two-regions health care system. While the first best allocation entails geographic equality in access to and quality of health-care services, we show that free location decisions results in an unfair allocation in health care resources. We first characterize the public policies allowing to decentralize the first best. Then, we show that the optimal policy aiming at equalizing medical densities consists in setting regionally differentiated prices and a single lump-sum transfer. This transfer is a tax (resp. a subsidy) when the value of the difference in regional amenities is low (resp. high).
I11|Nonresponsiveness, Severity Auditing, and Upcoding Deterrence|In many countries, the diagnosis-related group system has been expanded to address patient severity. This paper highlights a fundamental drawback of any price refinement policy under adverse selection. Without auditing, no mechanism such that high-severity patients receive more intensive treatment than low-severity patients can ensure that providers are deterred from upcoding. In contrast, we show that splitting can be implemented if the regulator designs an auditing mechanism when the proportion of low-severity patients is sufficiently high. The optimal level of services increases with severity under conditions depending on the net social benefit function and on the cost function.
I11|Primary care availability affects antibiotic consumption – Evidence using unfilled positions in Hungary|Using administrative data from Hungary, we analyse the effect of general practitioner (GP) care availability on the consumption of antibiotics. We exploit the geographical and time variation in unfilled GP positions as a source of exogenous variation in the availability of primary care. According to our estimates from fixed effects panel regressions, if the single GP position of a village becomes unfilled, the days of therapy (DOT) as well as public expenditures on antibiotics decrease by 3.2-4.1%. The negative effect on antibiotic consumption is stronger in smaller settlements, in settlements where secondary care is less available, and where antibiotics were previously overprescribed. The quality of prescribing behaviour measured by the ratio of narrow-spectrum to broad-spectrum antibiotics deteriorates significantly as a consequence of worse primary care availability. The number of GP consultations decreases by 9.8%, but prescribed antibiotic DOT per GP visit goes up by 7.2%.
I11|Choice and Competition in the Welfare State: Home Care as the Ideal Quasi-market|We study a reform by which a standardized model of choice and competition was introduced in tax-financed home care in a majority of Swedish municipalities. The market for home care is of particular interest since it is close to the ideal quasi-market. For identification, we exploit the different timing of reform implementation across municipalities. We find that the introduction of free choice and free entry in home care increased perceived quality by about one quarter of a standard deviation without affecting costs. Since satisfaction is unrelated to the private market share, the underlying mechanism seems to be new choice opportunities rather than competition or an advantage of private providers.
I11|Telemedicine and the Welfare State: The Swedish Experience|Sweden combines a vibrant market economy with a large public sector. This combination of public and private also characterizes the country’s comprehensive tax-financed welfare services. More than one-third of primary health care is today produced in the private sector. This substantial share has broad implications for how digitalization reshapes those welfare services. In this paper, we focus on how telemedicine is set to transform primary health care in Sweden, where doctors have been available via video calls on smartphone apps since 2016. The novel element in Swedish health care is that the doctors are available as a public welfare service but by private providers. With some exceptions, patients pay a small fee, but most of the cost is borne by the tax-payers. While the benefits of telemedicine are many – such as easier access to doctors and a reduction of non-essential travel – the downside for public finances is that the demand for care, and hence costs, may increase dramatically. As telemedicine becomes more popular, the tensions in regards to financing and regulation are already in evidence and look set to rise further. We outline steps that could better integrate telemedicine into the health care system.
I11|Effects of Pay-For-Performance on Prescription of Hypertension Drugs among Public and Private Primary Care Providers in Sweden|This study exploits policy reforms in Swedish primary care to examine the effect of pay-for-performance (P4P) on compliance with hypertension drug guidelines among public and private health care providers. Providers in regions with P4P are compared to providers in other regions in a difference-in-differences analysis using data from the Swedish Prescription Register for the period 2005-2013. The results indicate that P4P improved guideline compliance regarding prescription of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB). The effect is mainly driven by private providers, suggesting that policy makers should take ownership into account when designing incentives for health care providers.
I11|Cesarean Sections for High-Risk Births: Health, Fertility and Labor Market Outcomes|Despite the fact that Cesarean section (C-section) is the most commonly performed surgery in a number of industrialized countries, little is known about the long-term consequences for the mothers and children involved. In this study, I use a sample of high-risk births—namely, breech births, in which the fetus is presented with its head upward instead of downward—to study the causal effect of C-sections on child health and on the health, fertility and labor market responses for mothers. Because selection into C-section may be endogenous, I exploit an information shock to doctors in 2000, in which new scientific evidence about the benefits of planned C-sections for breech births led to a sharp 23% increase in planned C-sections. Using Swedish registry data, I find that having a C-section improves child health in both the short and long run, indicated by higher Apgar scores at birth and fewer nights hospitalized during ages 1-7. I find little evidence to suggest any significant impact on maternal health, future fertility or maternal labor market outcomes.
I11|Quality Regulation and Competition: Evidence from Pharmaceutical Markets|We study the effects of quality regulation on market outcomes by exploiting the staggered phase-in of bioequivalence requirements for generic drugs in Chile. We estimate that the number of drugs in the market decreased by 25%, average paid prices increased by 10%, and total sales decreased by 20%. These adverse effects were concentrated among small markets. Our results suggest that the intended effects of quality regulation on price competition through increased (perceived) quality of generics—and therefore reduced vertical differentiation—were overturned by adverse competitive effects arising from the costs of complying with the regulation.
I11|Hospital Competition in the National Health Service: Evidence from a Patient Choice Reform|We study the impact of exposing hospitals in a National Health Service (NHS) to non-price competition by exploiting a patient choice reform in Norway in 2001. The reform facilitates a dfference-in-difference research design due to geographical variation in the scope for competition. Using rich administrative data covering the universe of NHS hospital admissions from 1998 to 2005, we find that hospitals in more competitive areas have a sharper reduction in AMI mortality, readmissions, and length of stay than hospitals in less competitive areas. These results indicate that competition improves patient health outcomes and hospital cost efficiency, even in the Norwegian NHS with large distances, low fixed treatment prices, and mainly public hospitals.
I11|The effect of a mystery shopper scheme on prescriptions in primary care|Health care systems in many countries are still characterized by limited availability of provider performance data which can be used to design and implement welfare improving reforms in the health sector. We question whether a simple mystery shopper scheme can be an effective measure to improve primary care quality in such settings. Using a randomized treatment-control design, we conduct a field experiment in primary care clinics in a Chinese city. We investigate whether informing clinics in the treatment group of a forthcoming mystery shopper audit influences the physicians’ prescribing behavior. As expected, we find that antibiotic medications are prescribed to patients in the majority of cases, even though such prescribing is not in accordance with current recommendations or guidelines. While the intervention did not cause significant reduction in antibiotic prescriptions, our results show that a mystery shopper scheme reduces overall unnecessary prescribing.
I11|Dishonesty in healthcare practice: A behavioral experiment on upcoding in neonatology|We introduce a controlled behavioral experiment framed in a neonatal care context to analyze the effect of introducing a random audit and fines on individuals' honesty in a simple reporting task. Our behavioral data provide new evidence on dishonesty and upcoding in health care. We find that introducing audits combined with a fine significantly reduces dishonesty on aggregate. The effect is driven by a significant reduction in upcoding. At the same time, dishonest choices that cannot be detected as fraudulent by an audit (partial dishonesty) increase. We also find evidence that individual characteristics such as gender, medical background, and integrity are related to dishonest behavior.
I11|Public health, healthcare, health and inequality in health in the Nordic countries|All five Nordic countries emphasize equal and easy access to healthcare, assuming that increased access to healthcare leads to increased health. It is the purpose of the present study to explore to which extent the populations of these countries have reached good health and a high degree of socio-economic equality in health. Each of the five countries has established extensive public health programmes, although with somewhat different measures to increase health of the populations. We compare these countries to the UK and Germany by using data from the European Social Survey for 2002 and 2012 in addition to OECD statistics for the same years. Health is measured by self-assessed health in five categories, which is transformed to a cardinal scale using Swedish time trade-off (TTO) weights. As socio-economic measures we use household income and length of education. Socio-economic inequality in health is elicited in two ways. First, we show social gradients by comparing the percentage of respondents in the lower income group reporting good or very good health to the corresponding rates in the upper income group. Second, we show concentration indices of socio-economic related inequality in health. Everything else kept equal, good health and the size of the concentration index are negatively associated by definition. In 2012, mean health, based on Swedish weights applied to all countries, is above 0.93 in all the Nordic countries and the UK, but lower in Germany. Each of the Nordic countries have introduced centrally initiated comprehensive public health programmes to increase health and reduce socio-economic inequalities in health. In general, the Nordic countries have achieved good health for their populations as well as a high degree of socioeconomic equality in health. Improvements in life-style related determinants of health are possible, however.
I11|Risker och kostnader för prissamordningar på den svenska generikamarknaden|Företag som ofta möter varandra på en eller flera marknader kan ibland genom att observera varandras tidigare priser lyckas samordna sina priser. Konkurrensen sätts då ur spel och priserna blir högre än de annars skulle ha varit. I denna rapport visar vi att den svenska generikamarknaden har många egenskaper som underlättar prissamordning, exempelvis att priserna kan ändras varje månad, att företagen lätt kan observera varandras priser, och att konkurrensen främst sker i en variabel, priser. Vi redogör även för empiriska resultat som indikerar att prissamordningar ibland förekommer på marknaden, samt att dessa då orsakar läkemedelsförmånen och konsumenterna betydande merkostnader. Dessa uppskatter vi till i storleksordningen 50 till 200 miljoner kronor per år. Ett sätt att minska risken för prissamordning är att förlänga tiden mellan att företag kan observera konkurrenters priser och att de kan ändra sina egna priser. Det är sedan länge välkänt inom nationalekonomin att denna tid har en avgörande betydelse för risken för prissamordning. Tiden kan förlängas genom att priserna endast tillåts ändras exempelvis kvartalsvis eller halvårsvis och/eller genom att kräva att företagen meddelar sina priser längre tid i förväg innan prisperioderna börjar. En förlängning av prisperioderna till 3-6 månader skulle troligen ha mycket små oönskade effekter samtidigt som det skulle minska möjligheterna för företag att samordna sina priser. Sammantaget skulle därför en sådan förändring troligen minska läkemedelsförmånens och konsumenternas kostnader. Ett annat sätt att minska risken för att företag samordnar sina priser är att sänka marknadsandelen för periodens vara genom att minska kraven att de förskrivna varorna byts ut på apoteken. Detta skulle öka betydelsen av andra faktorer än priset och göra det svårare för företag att över tid dela försäljningen lika, vilket minskar risken för prissamordning. En tidigare studie visar också att detta skulle leda till fler konkurrerande företag på marknaden, vilket även det minskar risken för att företag samordnar sina priser. En lägre marknadsandel för periodens vara skulle dock kunna leda till svagare konkurrens och ökade kostnader för läkemedel på marknader som inte påverkas av prissamordningar. För hela generikamarknaden skulle en liten sänkning av marknadsandelen för periodens vara kunna bli kostnadsneutral, men det är inte säkert att detta resultat håller om prisperioderna förlängs.
I11|Do rural incentives payments affect entries and exits of general practitioners?|Many countries use financial incentive programs to attract physicians to work in rural areas. This paper examines the effectiveness of a policy reform in Australia that made some locations newly eligible for financial incentives and increased incentives for locations already eligible. The analysis uses panel data (2008–2014) on all Australian general practitioners (GPs) aggregated to small areas. We use a difference-in-differences approach to examine if the policy change affected GP entry or exit to the 755 newly eligible locations and the 787 always eligible locations relative to 2249 locations which were never eligible. The policy change increased the entry of newly-qualified GPs to newly eligible locations but had no effect on the entry and exit of other GPs. Our results suggest that location incentives should be targeted at newly qualified GPs.
I11|Hospital Choice in the NHS|We study hospital choice in the publicly funded National Health Service in England, using a two sample strategy to identify a structural model of demand for elective procedures. In the NHS patients are allowed to opt out from the market of free-of-charge public hospitals and choose a private provider; we find that the outside option has an important effect on competition, patient choice and elasticities compared with traditional models ignoring the private sector. Considering endogeneity of waiting-time, proper measures of quality and the existence of private sector, we find substantially different policy conclusions compared to existing hospital demand models.
I11|Financial incentives and physician prescription behavior: Evidence from dispensing regulations|In many health care markets, physicians can respond to changes in reimbursement schemes by changing the volume (volume response) and the composition of services provided (substitution response). We examine the relative importance of these two behavioral responses in the context of physician drug dispensing in Switzerland. We find that dispensing increases drug costs by 52% for general practitioners and 56% for specialists. This increase is mainly due to a volume increase. The substitution response is negative on average, but not significantly different from zero for large parts of the distribution. In addition, our results reveal substantial effect heterogeneity.
I11|The Impact of Paid Maternity Leave on Maternal Health|We examine the impact of the introduction of paid maternity leave in Norway in 1977 on maternal health. Before the policy reform, mothers were eligible for 12 weeks of unpaid leave. Mothers giving birth after July 1, 1977 were entitled to 4 months of paid leave and 12 months of unpaid leave. We combine Norwegian administrative data with survey data on the health of women around age 40 and estimate the medium- and long-term impacts of the reform using regression discontinuity and difference-inregression discontinuity designs. Our results suggest paid maternity leave benefits are protective of maternal health. The reform improved a range of maternal health outcomes, including BMI, blood pressure, pain, and me mntal health, and it increased health-promoting behaviors, such as exercise and not smoking. The effects were larger for first-time and low-resource mothers and women who would have taken little unpaid leave in the absence of the reform. We also study the maternal health effects of subsequent expansions in paid maternity leave and find evidence of diminishing returns to leave length.
I11|Predicting fixed effects in panel probit models|We present a method to estimate and predict fixed effects in a panel probit model when N is large and T is small, and when there is a high proportion of individual units without variation in the binary response. Our approach builds on a bias-reduction method originally developed by Kosmidis and Firth (2009) for cross-section data. In contrast to other estimators, our approach ensures that predicted fixed effects are finite in all cases. Results from a simulation study document favorable properties in terms of bias and mean squared error. The estimator is applied to predict period-specific fixed effects for the extensive margin of health care utilization (any visit to a doctor during the previous three months), using German data for 2000-2014. We find a negative correlation between fixed effects and observed characteristics. Although there is some within-individual variation in fixed effects over sub-periods, the between-variation is four times as large.
I11|Do hospitals respond to decreasing prices by supplying more services?|Regulated prices are common in markets for medical care. We estimate the effect of changes in regulated reimbursement prices on volume of hospital care based on a reform of hospital financing in Germany. Uniquely, this reform changed the overall level of reimbursement â€“ with increasing prices for some hospitals and decreasing prices for others â€“ without affecting the relative prices for different groups of patients or types of treatment. Based on administrative data, we find that hospitals react to decreasing prices by supplying more services. We interpret our findings as evidence for a negative income effect of lower prices on higher volume of care.
I11|Optimal Healthcare Contracts: Theory and Empirical Evidence from Italy|In this paper we investigate the nature of the contracts between a large health-care purchaser and health service providers in a prospective payment system. We model theoretically the interaction between patients choice and cream-skimming by hospitals. We test the model using a very large and detailed administrative dataset for the largest region in Italy. In line with our theoretical results, we show that the state funded purchaser offers providers a system of incentives such that the most efficient providers both treat more patients and also treat more difficult patients, thus receiving a higher average payment per treatment.
I11|And Thou Shalt Honor: children’s caregiving, work and religion|In this paper we take a fresh look at the magnitude of the trade-off between caring informally for a parent and paid work. We adopt a simultaneous approach with a primary focus on how hours of care are influenced by hours of work rather than the other way round. We also investigate the role that filial obligations play in choices of caring versus working. Using the SHARE data (2004 and 2006) we find that the elasticity of informal care hours in response to working hours is around -0.18, small but not negligible. Moreover, we find that a one point decrease out of a seven point index measuring the strength of filial obligations reduces weekly hours of care by about one hour and half.
I11|Do higher hospital reimbursement prices improve quality of care?|Does higher medical spending improve quality of care? We estimate the effect of changes in regulated reimbursement prices for hospitals on multiple dimensions of hospital quality, including mortality outcomes, surgical complications, process quality, and patient satisfaction. We exploit an exogenous variation in reimbursement prices between the years 2006 and 2010 based on a reform of hospital financing in Germany. We find that changes in reimbursement prices do not affect quality of care. This effect is precisely estimated, and we can rule out effect sizes that are large relative to the overall variation in quality indicators across hospitals.
I11|Paying for the view? How nursing home prices affect quality of care|Increasing long-term care demand raises the need of high quality care in nursing homes. This study analyses whether higher prices have a causal effect on quality of care in Swiss nursing homes and assesses the extent of cross-subsidization between different price components. We use administrative data collected by the Swiss Federal Office for Statistics from 2012 to 2016 on all nursing homes in the twelve Swiss cantons with canton-wide fixed reimbursement rates for nursing care. We apply multivariate linear regressions and two-stage least square estimation techniques to estimate the effect of nursing care prices and prices for accommodation and services on care quality, measured by registered staffing levels. Our estimates show a positive impact of all price components on care quality. Although nursing homes are prohibited to use revenues from accommodation and services to cover nursing care, a 10% increase in that price component increases certified staffing levels by 0.7 to 1.7 nurses or four to ten percent (full-time-equivalent) for an average sized nursing home (50 beds). Thus, limiting care prices implicitly sets a limit for care quality and induces care providers to pass on costs to the residents.
I11|Reference pricing systems on the pharmaceutical market|Constantly rising expenditures for pharmaceuticals require government intervention in firms' pricing decisions. To this end, reference pricing systems are a frequently employed regulatory mechanism. This paper considers a duopoly market with vertically differentiated firms under different competition types. Starting from the existing literature it can be confirmed that the introduction of a reference price leads to lower equilibrium prices and induces fiercer competition between firms. Further, it can be shown that reference pricing promotes generic usage and leads to an increased market coverage. Hence, an improved provision of medical supply is achieved due to the lower prices and the stimulated demand for drugs. The paper demonstrates that even under the increased demand consumer and insurance expenditures are reduced. The model isolates the mechanisms of reference pricing and shows the effects on the consumer decisions. Lastly, consumer surplus increases when implementing the regulation.
I11|Health insurance, endogenous medical progress, and health expenditure growth|We study the impact of health insurance expansion in the US on health expenditure, longevity growth and welfare in an overlapping generations economy in which individuals purchase health care to lower mortality. We consider three sectors: final goods production; a health care sector, selling medical services to individuals; and an R&D sector, selling increasingly effective medical technology to the health care sector. We calibrate the model to match the development of the US economy/health care system from 1965 to 2005 and study numerically the impact of the insurance expansion on health expenditures, medical progress and longevity. We find that more extensive health insurance accounts for a large share of the rise in US health spending but also boosts the rate of medical progress. A welfare analysis shows that while the moral hazard associated with subsidized health care creates excessive health care expenditure, the gains in life expectancy brought about by induced medical progress more than compensate for this. By mitigating an intergenerational externality associated with the longevity benefits from current medical innovation the expansion of health insurance constitutes a Pareto improvement.
I11|Reference Pricing Systems on the Pharmaceutical Market|Constantly rising expenditures for pharmaceuticals and uninformed consumers require government intervention in firms’ pricing strategies. To this end, reference pricing systems are frequently employed as regulatory mechanisms. This paper considers a duopoly market with vertically differentiated firms: a brand-name firm and a firm producing a generic version or a branded copy (depending on competition type). It can be proven that the introduction of a reference price leads to lower equilibrium prices for both firms and that it can induce fiercer competition between brand-name and generic/branded copy firms. Additionally, it can be shown that reference pricing promotes generic usage under sequential price competition. When implementing a reference pricing system, an increased market coverage and, hence, an improved provision of medical supply can be achieved due to the lower prices and the stimulated demand for drugs. Even under a higher supply the consumers’ expenditures decrease under reference pricing. Finally, the model proves the superiority of reference prices over price caps and therefore indicates that reference pricing systems should be preferred.
I11|Retirement and healthcare utilization|Pension systems and reforms thereof are often discussed in the context of financial viability. In industrialized countries, these debates grow in intensity with the aging of the population; however, an increase in retirement age may create unintended side effects with regards to retiree health or healthcare costs. This study empirically analyzes the effect of (early) retirement on individual inpatient and outpatient healthcare expenditure in Austria. We use comprehensive labor market and retirement data from the Austrian Social Security Database, together with detailed information about individual inpatient and outpatient healthcare service utilization in the province of Upper Austria. To account for endogeneity in retirement decisions, we exploit exogenous variation in the early retirement age as induced by two Austrian pension reforms (i.e., those in 2000 and 2003). We find there to be significant negative effects of retirement on healthcare expenditure. For both genders, retirement reduces subsequent expenditure for outpatient medical attendance and hospitalization. Analyses of disaggregated components of healthcare expenditure confirm a positive health effect caused by physical and emotional relief following retirement. Apart from direct health effects, the results also reveal behavioral changes in the utilization of healthcare services. These changes in health behavior seem particularly relevant among blue-collar workers.
I11|Parallel Imports and Manufacturer Rebates|This paper studies the effect of a change in the mandatory manufacturer rebate on wholesale prices for pharmaceuticals on competition by parallel imports. First, it analyzes the effect of a manufacturer rebate on competition by parallel imports in a two-country model. An increase in the manufacturer rebate increases the market share of parallel imports. Second, the paper exploits a policy reform in Germany in 2010, which increased the manufacturer rebate by 10 percentage points. Using a data set with prescription drugs with competition from parallel imports, I estimate the e¤ect of the change in the manufacturer rebate on competition by parallel imports. Estimation results suggest that an increase in the manufacturer rebate has increased the market share of parallel imports and the number of importers.
I11|Hospital interdependence in a competitive institutional environment: Evidence from Italy|In this paper we study the impact of competition on hospital adverse health outcomes, using data on patients admitted to hospitals located in the Lombardy region in Italy between 2004 and 2013. We propose an economic framework that incorporates both short and long range forms of competition among hospitals. In a set up where prices are regulated, and under the assumption that hospitals are profit maximisers, hospital managers compete locally in quality to attract more patients. At the same time, managers have an incentive to compete with all other hospitals within the Lombardy region as their relative quality performance will potentially affect their future states. Our empirical model exploits methods from the graphical modelling literature to estimate local rivals, as well as the degree of local and global interdependence among hospitals. Our results show a significant positive degree of short and long range dependence, which suggests the existence of forms of local and global competition among hospitals with relevant implications for the healthcare policy.
I11|Does neighbourâ€™s grass matter? Exploring spatial dependent heterogeneity in technical efficiency of Italian hospitals|With respect to the other dimensions of hospital behaviour, studying the presence of interaction effects on efficiency involves the issue of which approach is most appropriate to incorporate the spatial dependence in the empirical efficiency model. Using a large sample of Italian hospitals, this paper explores the presence of spatial dependence in technical efficiency. To this purpose, we employ a Spatial Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SSFA) that allows us to robustly estimate the efficiency of each hospital while considering the presence of spatial dependence. Furthermore, we employ both standard spatial contiguity matrix and spatial matrixes exploring the idea of institutional contiguity. Overall, the results suggest an insignificant role for spatial dependence in the efficiency of Italian hospitals, regardless of the specific form of spatial dependence implicit in the weights matrix.
I11|Regional Purchasing Groups and Hospital Medicine Prices: Evidence from Group Creations|This paper estimates the impact of group purchasing on medicine prices in French hospitals, taking advantage of the entry of hospitals into regional purchasing groups between 2009 and 2014. This paper uses a new database providing the average annual prices paid for all innovative and costly medicines in public hospitals. Using a fixed effects model that controls for hospitals' medicine-specific bargaining abilities and medicine-specific price trends, I find that group purchasing reduces prices of medicines in oligopoly markets, but has no impact on the prices of medicines with no competitors.
I11|The Good Outcomes of Bad News. A Randomized Field Experiment on Formatting Breast Cancer Screening Invitations|We ran a population-level randomized field experiment to ascertain whether a costless manipulation of the informational content (restricted or enhanced information) and the framing (gain or loss framing) of the invitation letter to the national breast cancer screening program affects the take-up rate. Our experiment involved more than 6,000 women aged 50-69 targeted by the screening program of the Province of Messina in Sicily, randomly assigned to receive different invitation letter formats. Using administrative data from the Local Health Authority archives, we show that giving enhanced loss-framed information about the risks of not having a mammography increases take-up rate by about 25 percent with respect to all other treatments (no information; restricted gain-framed information; restricted loss-framed information; enhanced gain-framed information). Results are stronger for subjects living farther away from the screening site. For them, the manipulation may indicate higher perceived risks of negative outcomes that makes it worthwhile to participate in the screening program, in spite of longer travel time.
I11|Optimal procurement of a credence good under limited liability|This paper analyzes the optimal contract for a consumer to procure a credence good from an expert when (i) the expert might misrepresent his private information about the consumer’s need, (ii) the expert might not choose the requested service since his choice of treatment is non-observable, and (iii) limited liability of the expert precludes imposing penalty payments on him. We characterize payments under the optimal contract and show that, compared with the first–best, these induce inefficient undertreatment. We further analyze the implications of separating diagnosis and treatment for efficiency and consumer surplus.
I11|The effect of private health insurance on self-assessed health status and health satisfaction in Germany|In Germany, private health insurance covers more innovative and costly treatments than public insurance. Moreover, privately insured individuals are treated preferentially by doctors. In this article, I use subjective health data to examine whether these superior features of private insurance actually transfer into better health. I focus on German adolescents who are still in education to control for selection and account for differences in health-conscious behavior between publicly and privately insured individuals. I find that privately and publicly insured individuals do not differ in health, which contrasts with previous research. Hence, doctors appear to be the sole profiteers of the private insurance system and billions of euros could be saved by aligning private and public health insurance.
I11|Ambulatory care at the end of a billing period|The ambulatory physician payment system in the German Social Health Insurance (SHI) offers incentives to reduce practice activity at the end of a billing period. Most services within a period are reimbursed at full cost only up to a certain threshold. Furthermore, capitated payments make follow-up treatments within a billing period less profitable. Using claims data from Germany's largest sickness fund with about nine million members, we find a decrease of all services limited by a threshold at the end of a billing period and an immediate increase at the beginning of the following period. For services that are not limited, we do not find an effect. An increase of ambulatory emergencies at the end of a billing period suggests a negative welfare effect for patients.
I11|Physician behavior under prospective payment schemes: Evidence from artefactual field and lab experiments|Recent experimental studies analyze the behavior of physicians towards patients and find that physicians care for their own profit as well as patient benefit. In this paper, we extend the experimental analysis of the physician decision problem by adding a third party representing the health insurance which finances medical service provision. Our results show that physicians take into account the payoffs of the third party, which can lead to underprovision of medical services. We conduct a laboratory experiment in neutral as well as medical framing using students and medical doctors as subjects. Subjects in the medically framed experiments behave weakly more patient orientated in contrast to neutral framing. A sample of medical doctors exhibits comparable behavior to students with medical framing.
