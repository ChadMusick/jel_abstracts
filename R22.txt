R22|Affordability, Financial Innovation and the Start of the Housing Boom|At their peak in 2005, roughly 60 percent of all purchase mortgage loans originated in the United States contained at least one non-traditional feature. These features, which allowed borrowers easier access to credit through teaser interest rates, interest-only or negative amortization periods, and extended payment terms, have been the subject of much regulatory and popular criticism. In this paper, we construct a novel county-level dataset to analyze the relationship between rising house prices and non-traditional features of mortgage contracts. We apply a break-point methodology and find that in housing markets with breaks in the mid-2000s, a strong rise in the use of non-traditional mortgages preceded the start of the housing boom. Furthermore, their rise was coupled with declining denial rates and a shift from FHA to subprime mortgages. Our findings support the view that a change in mortgage contract availability and a shift toward subprime borrowers helped to fuel the rise of house prices during the last decade.

R22|Application of the economic theory of self-control to model energy conservation behavioral change in households|Smart meters and in-house displays hold a promise of energy conservation for those who invest in such technology. Research has shown that households only have a limited interest in such technology and information is thus often neglected, with rather limited energy savings. Surprisingly few empirical investigations have a theoretical foundation that may explain what is going on from a behavioral perspective. In this study the economic theory of self-control is used to model energy-eﬃcient behavior in middle-income households in Sweden. Our results show that diﬀerent levels of energy-eﬃcient behavior do not really have any impact on the actual consumption levels of electricity. Instead, diﬀerent beliefs exist of being energy-eﬃcient, but the households do not act accordingly. Our results suggest that the payment time period should be changed to stimulate the monitoring of bills and to introduce a gaming strategy to change incentives for energy conservation.
R22|For whom are cities good places to live?|We use survey data to examine whether there are some sociodemographic groups that particularly value the amenities that cities provide. We find that young, single and childless persons and young men with tertiary education are relatively more satisfied with urban areas as place of residence. Being single is more important for women's appraisal of places, while having children matters more for men’s preferences. There is a high degree of agreement between sociodemographic groups on whether a particular amenity represents an urban amenity or an urban disamenity. Higher education, public transportation, culture, leisure activities and shopping opportunities are urban amenities, whereas other public services, safety, living conditions for children and outdoor recreation are urban disamenities.
R22|Trends der Nahversorgung in ländlichen Räumen|Seit Jahrzehnten ist der Lebensmitteleinzelhandel von einem Strukturwandel hin zu weniger und größeren Geschäften gekennzeichnet. Gerade in kleineren Orten ländlicher Räume bestehen daher Probleme, die Versorgung mit Gütern des täglichen Bedarfs in fußläufiger Entfernung, das heißt die Nahversorgung, sicherzustellen. Um die bestehenden Herausforderungen hinreichend zu analysieren und Lösungen zu entwickeln, müssen die aktuellen Trends der Nahversorgung untersucht und mit Blick auf ihre potentiellen Wirkungen auf ländliche Räume eingeschätzt werden. Vor diesem Hintergrund wertet das vorliegende Working Paper aktuelle Studien und die wissenschaftliche Literatur mit besonderem Fokus auf den Lebensmitteleinzelhandel und den Onlinehandel aus. Im Ergebnis zeigt sich die Verfestigung seit langem anhaltender Trends sowie das Aufkeimen neuer Trends, deren Beständigkeit noch abzuwarten ist. Anhaltende Trends sind der sich intensivierende Wettbewerbsdruck, der in den letzten Jahren weniger über den Preis als über Auswahl und Qualität ausgeübt wird, die Marktkonzentration weniger großer Ketten im Lebensmitteleinzelhandel sowie der Ersatz kleinerer Märkte durch größere, um eine hinreichende Auswahl für die sich ausdifferenzierende Nachfrage bereitstellen zu können. Zudem wird das Einkaufen angesichts zunehmender Zeitknappheit eher als Last empfunden, was zu seltenerem Einkauf, mehr Kopplung von Einkäufen und Wegen sowie Rückgängen beim Marktanteil sehr großflächiger und daher unübersichtlicher Formate führt. Damit ist nach wie vor die Konzentration auf das Auto als Verkehrsmittel zumindest in ländlichen Räumen verbunden. Dabei steigt die Automobilität gerade auch bei den Senioren an und die Notwendigkeit einer fußläufigen Erreichbarkeit von Angeboten verringert sich dadurch. Eine neuere Entwicklung ist demgegenüber, dass die Zahl der Lebensmittelgeschäfte zwar noch schrumpft, dass dieser Rückgang aber im Vergleich zur zweiten Hälfte der 2000er Jahre deutlich an Intensität verloren hat. Des Weiteren weisen Verbraucherbefragungen darauf hin, dass sich die für Deutschland typische hohe Preissensibilität etwas reduziert hat und sich die Verbraucher zunehmend an der Warenqualität orientieren. In der Folge gleichen sich Supermärkte und Discounter hinsichtlich Warenangebot und Ladengestaltung zunehmend an, wodurch Potentiale für neue Formate, wie Online-Handel, mobile Versorger und Kleinflächenkonzepte, entstehen könnten. In Bezug auf den Online-Handel mit Lebensmitteln zeigt sich jedoch, dass die Lieferkosten gerade in ländlichen Räumen hoch, aber die Zahlungsbereitschaft der Verbraucher gering ist, sodass sich das starke Wachstum bisher auf die Verdichtungsräume konzentriert und das Potential des Online-Handels beschränkt sein dürfte. Auch neuere Modelle, in denen Bürger die Versorgung auf der letzten Meile im Zuge der sogenannten Mitmachlogistik übernehmen, dürfte vermutlich für bestimmte urbane Milieus interessant sein, insgesamt aber wie zumindest momentan der Online-Handel eher auf eine Nische im Lebensmitteleinzelhandel beschränkt bleiben, sodass keine schnelle Lösung von Nahversorgungsprobleme in ländlichen Räumen absehbar ist.
R22|Urbanization and Food Security: Empirical Evidence from Households in Urban Southwest Nigeria| Abstract Rapid urban growth changes the composition as well as diversification of the food consumed among urban households. Achieving food security in the midst of rapid urbanization require understanding how urban and food consumption intertwined. Thus this paper uses combined measure of food security to determine urban household food security status as influenced by extent of urbanization in Nigeria. Results show that urban effect generated through urbanicity index using principal component analysis revealed that most households were in low urban category. On the average, most urban household had diverse diet. However, combining per capita expenditure and dietary diversity index as measure of household food security revealed different level of food security status. Multinomial logit regression results reveals that gender of household head, employment status, educational status, household income, occupational status and urbanicity index significantly determine the probability of urban household being food secured at different levels of food security status. Relevant policy interventions that aim at securing sustainable food security were identified.

R22|Household fuel use in developing countries: Review of theory and evidence|Owing to recent concerns about the negative externalities of traditional fuel use on the environment and health, the issue of the household fuel transition in developing countries, from dirty fuels towards clean fuels, is receiving growing research attention. This paper provides an up-to-date survey of the economic literature on household fuel use in these countries. We first present the conceptual and theoretical frameworks. Then we discuss the empirical results that show the wide range of factors that drive the household fuel transition and can be understood better by linking them with theory.
R22|Estimating Urban Water Demand Elasticities using Regression Discontinuity: A Case of Tangerang Regency, Indonesia|We estimate the effect of water tariff adjustment in Tangerang city, Indonesia in November 2014 on monthly water consumption. Due to typical water-block pricing strategy, estimating water demand elasticities are likely to be complex. A unique panel monthly water consumption dataset at consumer level in Tangerang regency covering the period of January 2011â€“September 2016 is used. Using regression discontinuity framework, we find a 13% average tariff increase reduces 4% household water consumption on average. Further, our estimates suggest the tariff adjustment provides no effects on high-income households, industrial, and commercial consumers. We also find more elastic response of water consumption in short-run period than in long-run.
R22|Does Indonesiaâ€™s Macroeconomic Work Well Towards the Political Year?|This paper utilizes the timeframe of 2014â€“2018 as the period with some of the global underperformed macroeconomic indicators. This paper found that in late 2016, Indonesiaâ€™s macroeconomic indicators started shown some improvements that keep real and monetary sectorâ€™s equilibrium to be stable. This paper observes the external balance of current account, exchange rate stability, inflation and interest rate as well as consumption patterns, saving-investment gap, fiscal discipline and fiscal sustainability. It analyses the government expenditure multiplier, real and monetary sector stability and institutional coordination between fiscal authority, monetary authority, and financial service authority. Real sector improvements which have been rolling since 2017 has significantly contributed to the recent Indonesiaâ€™s macroeconomic stability. Technically, if all on the track, this will sustain during the upcoming political year of 2019.
R22|Regional differences in willingness to pay for organic vegetables in Vietnam|The concern about vegetable safety, together with a booming population and the rise of the middle class has made Vietnam become a potential market for organic vegetables. This paper investigates the determinants of willingness to pay (WTP) for organic vegetables in Hanoi, Vietnam with a particular attention to regional differences and the effect of risk perception. Using Contingent Valuation Method to analyze the data from a sample of 498 consumers in Hanoi, the paper shows that the perceived use values of organic vegetables, trust in organic labels, and disposable family income increased WTP for organic vegetables in both urban and rural regions. Though risk perception of conventional vegetables was high in both regions, such heightened risk perception just translated into the WTP in the rural region. In addition, the percentage of home-grown vegetables in the total vegetable consumption of the family influenced the WTP in the rural region only. Moreover, being an organic purchaser was positively related to the WTP in the urban region but not in the rural region. The paper also discusses three policy implications for Vietnam to boost the demand for organic food.
R22|Supermarket Shopping and Nutritional Outcomes: A Panel Data Analysis for Urban Kenya|Overweight and obesity are growing health problems in many developing countries. Rising obesity rates are the result of changes in people’s diets and lifestyles. Income growth and urbanization are factors that contribute to these changes. Modernizing food retail environments may also play a certain role. For instance, the rapid spread of supermarkets in many developing countries could affect consumer food choices and thus nutritional outcomes. However, concrete evidence about the effects of supermarkets on consumer diets and nutrition is thin. A few existing studies have analyzed related linkages with cross-sectional survey data. We add to this literature by using panel data from households and individuals in urban Kenya. Employing panel regression models with individual fixed effects and controlling for other factors we show that shopping in supermarkets significantly increases body mass index (BMI). We also analyze impact pathways. Shopping in supermarkets contributes to higher consumption of processed and highly processed foods and lower consumption of unprocessed foods. These results confirm that the retail environment affects people’s food choices and nutrition. However, the effects depend on the types of foods offered. Rather than thwarting modernization in the retail sector, policies that incentivize the sale of more healthy foods—such as fruits and vegetables—in supermarkets may be more promising to promote desirable nutritional outcomes.
R22|Household Demand for Meat in Nigeria| This study was an application of the Linear Approximate Almost Ideal Demand System (LA-AIDS) model on household aggregate meat demand in Nigeria. The data used was obtained from the World Bank’s Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) on households in Nigeria. Previous research had studied demand only at a regional level but this study estimates meat demand at a national level. The results showed that beef was a necessity while goat, chicken and mutton were luxuries. The results further revealed that all the meat products considered were normal goods with own-prices that were negative and consistent with demand theory except mutton. Goat meat and mutton were price elastic and as such, price changes for these products will affect their consumers more than consumers of other meat products that were less elastic.
R22|The determinants of households' flood mitigation decisions in France - on the possibility of feedback effects from past investments|In this paper, we investigate the determinants of private flood mitigation in France. We conducted a survey among 331 inhabitants of two flood-prone areas and collected data on several topics, including individual flood mitigation, risk perception, risk experience, and sociodemographic characteristics. We estimate discrete choice models to explain either the precautionary measures taken by the household, or the intention to undertake such measures in the future. Our results confirm that the Protection Motivation Theory is a relevant framework to describe the mechanisms of private flood mitigation in France, highlighting in particular the importance of threat appraisal and previous experience of floods. Some sociodemographic features also play a significant role in explaining private flood mitigation. We also observed that respondents who had already taken precautionary measures have a lower perception of the risk of flooding than respondents who planned to implement such measures at the time of the survey. This result can be explained by the existence of a feedback effect of having taken precautionary measures on risk perception. If subsequent studies support this assumption, it would imply that intended measures, rather than implemented ones, should be examined to explore further the determinants of private flood mitigation.
R22|Non-separable time preferences, novelty consumption and body weight: Theory and evidence from the East German transition to capitalism|This paper develops a dynamic model to illustrate how diet and body weight change when novel food products become available to consumers. We propose a microfounded test to empirically discriminate between habit and taste formation in intertemporal preferences. Moreover, we show that ‘novelty consumption’ and endogenous preferences can explain the persistent correlation between economic development and obesity. By empirically studying the German reunification, we find that East Germans consumed more novel Western food and gained more weight than West Germans when a larger variety of food products became readily accessible after the fall of the Wall. The observed consumption patterns suggest that food consumption features habit formation.
R22|Selectivity Problem in Demand Analysis: Single Equation Approach|This paper deals with a problem of censored data in the household demand analysis when budget survey data is used. Micro-data, in contrast with aggregated data, usually contains a significant portion of zero observations (no consumption recorded) that leads to censoring of data and potential selectivity problem resulting in biased estimates if inappropriate econometric model is used. We review different treatment methods available in the literature that control the selectivity problem. Concretely, it is Tobit model, Two-part model, Double-hurdle model, Sample selection model with three different estimators – FIML, Heckman two-step, and Cosslett’s semi-parametric estimator. On the empirical example we indeed show that firstly the treatment methods are necessary also for small levels of censoring and secondly the choice of treatment method matters even for different products within the same dataset. We compare performance over the above single-equation demand models together with OLS. The household demand is analysed for 13 different food products with high variety of level of censoring. We found that the Heckman two-step procedure and Cosslett’s semi-parametric estimators performed best among all examined techniques in our case and that these two estimators yield similar estimates of income and own-price elasticities. The Two-part model performs equivalently but the estimation results differ from the Heckman two-step and the Cosslett‘s estimator. The OLS estimates are biased and perform poorly together with Tobit model with weak performance.
R22|Electricity Prices and Consumers' Long-Term Technology Choices: Evidence from Heating Investments| This paper studies consumers' sensitivity to energy costs at the moment of making a long-term energy technology investment. The analysis exploits within-region variation in local, regulated electricity distribution prices that are very persistent over time and therefore a good measure of long-term price expectations. Price impacts are estimated on extensive administrative registry data of private persons acting as home builders in Finland during 2006-2011. The results show that electricity prices notably influence builders' heating choices, and price increases that are mostly due to taxation have induced demand for technologies based on renewable energy. However, the results on the comprehensive set of observable individual-level characteristics imply that issues related to information and credit availability may hamper price sensitivity.
R22|Geography and Media – Does a Local Editorial Office Increase the Consumption of Local News?|Urbanization and new digital technologies have significantly altered the news media industry. One major change is the disappearance of local editorial offices in many regions. This paper examines if there is a relation between access to local media in terms of editorial offices and journalists, and the likelihood of the public consuming local news. The study builds on fine level data for Sweden in 2006 and in 2013, allowing for a comparison of trends. Our results suggest that the existence of an editorial office in the municipality is not significantly related to the consumption of local newspapers but that accessibility to employed journalists who live in the municipality is.
R22|Climate risk and food security in Guatemala|In this study, we used a Computable General Equilibrium model of the Guatemalan economy to conduct simulations for a) a reduction in productivity due to climate change; and b) the effects of drought in agriculture. The reduction in productivity due to climate change would mean an important drop in the value added of agriculture and animal production, as well as a slight drop in industrial food production and the service industry. Under this scenario we should expect a fall in real GDP of 1.2%. The reduction of productivity could mean a reduced fiscal space, and a reduction in government expenditure because of lower tax revenues. More importantly, due to higher prices and lower income of households, this scenario could mean that consumption of agricultural goods for each type of household would be reduced in a relevant manner with great impacts on the food security aspect of access. One of the findings in the effects of drought in agriculture is a decrease of the value added of 23%. As expected, this situation would negatively affect the wages paid to unskilled workers, but also urban non-poor households would see a reduction of their disposable income due to higher food prices. One of the most interesting results is that the demand for land would fall by 38%. This is because as water would become scarcer, there would be fewer incentives to engage in agricultural activities. However, due to the importance of agricultural production for ensuring food security, these results show that a proper water allocation system is needed.
R22|Location Choice, Portfolio Choice|Households hold nondiversified stock portfolios of firms headquartered near their city of residence. Explanations assign a causal role for proximity, either in generating an informational advantage or a familiarity bias. Empirical analyses assume households locate randomly, even though they optimally select a city. This selection is important since latent location factors might be correlated with latent demand for local stocks. Building on location choice models from urban economics, we develop a Heckman (1977)-style model to account for the effect of location choices on portfolio choices. Adjusting for selection significantly reduces local bias and the performance of local stock picks.
R22|The Economics Of Forced Displacement: An Introduction|Forced displacement - defined as the displacement of refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) due to violence – has reached an unprecedented scale and global attention during the past few years, particularly in the aftermath of the Syrian refugee crisis in 2011 and the European Union’s migration crisis in 2015. As this plight gained momentum, economics found itself unprepared to answer the basic questions surrounding refugees and IDPs. Few economists or institutions were working on forced displacement. Economic theory or empirics had little to offer in terms of articles published in journals. Data were found to be scarce, unreliable or inaccessible. Can economics rise to the challenge? Is the economics of forced displacement different from neoclas-sical economics? Can we use off the shelves models to study forced displaced populations? What are we missing to do the economics of forced displacement? What are the data constraints that limit economists in this work? This paper provides a first non-technical introduction to these topics. We argue that the modelling of utility, choice, risk and information in a short-term setting is the key to address the problem. Neoclassical economics lacks some of the theoretical ingredients that are needed but recent developments in game theory, neuroeconomics and behavioral economics have opened new horizons that make the task of modelling forced displacement within reach. Empirics is clearly limited by the scarcity of quality data but an example shows how welfare economists can start working with existing data. Economists have no excuse to maintain the status quo and should get on with the work on forced displacement.
R22|Natural disasters and governmental aid: Is there a charity hazard?|"In the aftermath of natural disasters, governments frequently provide financial aid for affected households. This policy can have adverse effects if individuals anticipate it and forgo private precaution measures. While theoretical literature unequivocally suggests this so called ""charity hazard"", empirical studies yield ambiguous results. Drawing on rich survey data from German homeowners, we analyze charity hazard for different flood precaution strategies, namely insurance uptake and non-financial protection measures, and different flood risk areas. Our results indicate a substantial charity hazard in the insurance market for individuals residing in flood-prone areas. In contrast, we find a positive correlation between governmental aid and non-financial protection measures. Moreover, our results suggest that insurance and non-financial protection measures are rather complements than substitutes. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence that status-quo bias might play an important role for insurance uptake."

R22|Buy Locally? Big-Box Stores and Time-Inconsistent Preferences| The widespread closure of Mom-and-Pop shops, or small, locally owned stores, in the United States and elsewhere is a well-recognized phenomenon. These closures are generally met with dissatisfaction from the local community. These stores, however, often close due to a lack of patronage on the part of the same consumers who are upset by their closure. This behavior and subsequent disappointment are puzzling. I show that this phenomenon can be explained using a hyperbolic discounting, or time-inconsistency, framework. I develop a theoretical model to show that time-inconsistent consumers are less likely to patronize local businesses than time-consistent consumers. The sophistication effect, however, makes consumers more likely to shop at the local store than if they were naive. Further, I show that local stores are more likely to close in a community with a larger proportion of naive time-inconsistent consumers and that these closures cause a loss in welfare.
R22|The effect of sporting success and management failure on attendance demand in the Bundesliga: a revealed and stated preference travel cost approach| This study examines the private consumption benefits of sports attendance using revealed and stated preference data from 28 Football Bundesliga teams across three divisions. Survey respondents were presented with positive (sporting success) and negative (management failure) scenarios and asked for the number of game trips if each scenario occurred. The results of a pooled random effects Poisson model show that travel costs and ticket price have a significant negative effect on the number of home game trips. The weighted consumer surplus per game trip including travel costs and ticket prices is €345. Consumer surplus per game trip was found to change by €41 (first division) and €98 (second and third division) if the positive scenario occurred and by €39 if the negative scenario occurred.
R22|Determinantes del acceso al crédito formal e informal: Evidencia de los hogares de ingresos medios y bajos en Colombia|Este documento proporciona evidencia empírica sobre los determinantes de la probabilidad de que un hogar tenga crédito, con el sector formal o informal, tanto en zonas urbanas como rurales, para lo cual se utiliza información de la Encuesta Longitudinal Colombiana de la Universidad de los Andes. También, se analizan los posibles factores que afectan la probabilidad de que los hogares se encuentren atrasados en el pago de sus créditos. Los resultados indican que la probabilidad de que un hogar tenga crédito está relacionada positivamente con el hecho de que el jefe del hogar esté casado, con el nivel educativo, el nivel de ingreso, el tamaño del hogar, la propiedad de la vivienda y la participación laboral. En particular, las estimaciones indican que el ingreso y la educación tienen una correlación positiva con la probabilidad de tener crédito formal y negativa con la probabilidad de tener crédito informal. Finalmente, los choques que tienen un efecto directo sobre el ingreso de las familias y eventos inesperados aumentan la probabilidad de estar en mora. *** This paper studies the effects of an in utero program on birth outcomes addressed to vulnerable pregnant women. We use information from the Buen Comienzo program, an initiative run by the local government of Medellin, the second largest city of Colombia. In order to identify the effects we obtain matching estimates using data from program participants and the census of birth statistics. We find that the program increased the birth weight of participant children by 0.09 and 0.23 standard deviations for boys and girls, respectively, and reduced the prevalence of low birth weight by 2.6 and 4.6 ppts for boys and girls, respectively. In terms of size, the program reduces the incidence of being short by 3 and 4 ppts, for boys and girls, respectively. The program also significantly reduced preterm births between 3 and 8 ppts. We also provide evidence of the existence of heterogeneous effects depending on a mother’s exposure to the program and her frequency of attendance. Finally, an estimate of the cost-benefit ratio of the program suggests that its benefits could be 2 to 6 times its costs, respectively for boys and girls born from participant mothers with early exposure to the program.
R22|Non-Separable Time Preferences and Novelty Consumption: Theory and Evidence from the East German Transition to Capitalism|Non-separable intertemporal preferences and novelty consumption can explain the persistent correlation between economic development and obesity. Employing the German reunification as a fast motion natural experiment of economic development, we study how the sudden availability of novel food products impacts individual consumption patterns and body weight. Immediately after the reunification, East Germans consumed more novel western food and gained more weight than West Germans. The subsequent long-run persistence in food consumption and body weight among Eastern Germans cannot be explained by taste for variety; it provides evidence for habit formation in intertemporal consumption preferences.
R22|Location, quality and choice of hospital: Evidence from England 2002/3 - 2012/13|We investigate (a) how patient choice of hospital for elective hip replacement is influenced by distance, quality and waiting times, (b) differences in choices between patients in urban and rural locations, (c) the relationship between hospitalsâ€™ elasticities of demand to quality and the number of local rivals, and how these changed after relaxation of constraints on hospital choice in England in 2006. Using a data set on over 500,000 elective hip replacement patients over the period 2002/3 to 2012/13 we find that patients became more likely to travel to a provider with higher quality or lower waiting times, the proportion of patients bypassing their nearest provider increased from 25% to almost 50%, and hospital elasticity of demand with respect to own quality increased. By 2012/13 average hospital demand elasticity with respect to readmission rates and waiting times were ï€­0.2 and ï€­0.04. Providers facing more rivals had demand that was more elastic with respect to quality and waiting times. Patients from rural areas have smaller disutility from distance.
R22|Consolidated Group of Taxpayers: Infusion into the Russian Economic Practice|The article analyses the process of introduction of the consolidated taxation mechanism in Russia. The main purpose of the study is to conduct an assessment of the impact of consolidated groups of taxpayers on the national economy, including intergovernmental relations. Author further identifies the features and areas of further development of the consolidated taxation mechanism in the country. A 4-year period of activity of consolidated groups in Russia is taken for analysis, giving the opportunity to evaluate the results, to draw first conclusions, and allocate the problems associated with the subsequent planning and forecasting of these activities. Certain trends in application of new economic tools of the tax regulation are identified.
R22|Skill shortages in regional Australia: A local perspective from the Riverina|This paper examines the extent, mitigating strategies and consequences of skill shortages in the ‘food bowl’ Riverina region of Australia. Employing survey data, empirical models are developed to analyse the importance of firm size, firm age, regional market focus, and location and industry types influencing a series of skill shortage issues. Results indicate that half of businesses experience skill shortages. The consequences of hard-to-fill vacancies vary across firms and relate to lower productivity and higher running costs. A number of strategies are employed to varying degrees by firms including: recruiting internationally, training existing staff and employing less qualified staff to fill vacancies.
R22|An analysis of the welfare and distributive implications of factors influencing household electricity consumption|The deep economic crisis and the sharp rise in electricity prices have reduced electricity demand by Spanish households. This paper aims to analyse the responsiveness of household electricity demand and the welfare effects related to both factors in the 2006–2012 period by applying a demand model estimated with the quantile regression method. The results show that the electricity consumption of medium-high income households is particularly responsive to price increases, whereas that of medium-low income households is more responsive to changes in income. The retail electricity price increases and the economic crisis have led to lower and steeper U-shape price elasticities of demand and higher and steeper N-shape income elasticities of demand. The joint impact of those two factors on the welfare of lower-income households is higher in relative terms (i.e., as a share of household income) than for other income groups. These results suggest that the economic crisis and increases in retail electricity prices have had detrimental welfare effects, especially on the lower-income segment of the population. They should be considered when financing climate and energy policies through the electricity bill and provide a rationale to take such support, which pushes the retail electricity price upwards, out of the electricity bill.
R22|Efficiency snakes and energy ladders: A (meta-)frontier demand analysis of electricity consumption efficiency in Chinese households|Policy makers presently lack access to quantified estimates – and hence an explicit understanding – of energy consumption efficiency within households, creating a potential gap between true efficiency levels and the necessarily assumed efficiency levels that policy makers adopt in designing and implementing energy policy. This paper attempts to fill this information gap by empirically quantifying electricity consumption efficiency for a sample of more than 7,000 households. Adopting the recently introduced ‘frontier demand function’ due to Filippini and Hunt (2011) but extending it into the metafrontier context – to control for structural heterogeneity arising from location type – it is shown that consumption efficiency is little more than 60% on average. This implies huge potential for energy reduction via the expansion of schemes to promote energy efficiency. City households, which are the wealthiest in the sample, are shown to define the metafrontier demand function (and hence have the potential to be the most efficient households), but at the same time exhibit the largest inefficiencies. These facts together allow for a potential refinement on the household energy ladder concept, suggesting that wealth affords access to the best technologies thereby increasing potential energy efficiency (the ‘traditional view of the household energy ladder), but complementary to this these same households are most inefficient. This has implications for numerous areas of policy, including for example the design of energy assistance schemes, identification of energy education needs/priorities as well more refined setting of subsidies/tax-credit policies.
R22|Against all odds? Exploring the role of game outcome uncertainty in season ticket holders’ stadium attendance demand|In this study we investigate the important but rather ambiguous role of game outcome uncertainty (GOU) in consumers’ demand for professional sports. Specifically, using a unique and strongly balanced panel data set containing information on individual physical attendance from 13,892 season ticket holders (STHs) of a German professional football club, we find evidence for a positive effect of GOU on two differing spectator decisions – both the decision to physically attend a game in the stadium and the decision on what time to enter the stadium, an aspect which has so far been neglected in the literature. Moreover, GOU seems to play an especially important role in the decision-making of one particular group: STHs with comparatively high coordination costs.
R22|Location, quality and choice of hospital: Evidence from England 2002–2013|We investigate (a) how patient choice of hospital for elective hip replacement is influenced by distance, quality and waiting times, (b) differences in choices between patients in urban and rural locations, (c) the relationship between hospitals' elasticities of demand to quality and the number of local rivals, and how these changed after relaxation of constraints on hospital choice in England in 2006. Using a data set on over 500,000 elective hip replacement patients over the period 2002 to 2013 we find that patients became more likely to travel to a provider with higher quality or lower waiting times, the proportion of patients bypassing their nearest provider increased from 25% to almost 50%, and hospital elasticity of demand with respect to own quality increased. By 2013 average hospital demand elasticity with respect to readmission rates and waiting times were −0.2 and −0.04. Providers facing more rivals had demand that was more elastic with respect to quality and waiting times. Patients from rural areas have smaller disutility from distance.
R22|Design and performance analysis of radial-inflow turboexpander for OTEC application|Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) is a potential source of renewable energy. In order to design a turbine for maximizing the output power for very low working temperature application like OTEC, careful one-dimensional design followed by detailed three dimensional simulation is required. In this work a radial-inflow turbine with R-22 as working fluid is designed for a closed-cycle ocean thermal energy conversion plant of 2 kWe capacity. Design speed of the turbine is 34000 rpm. Inlet and outlet temperatures of designed turbine are 24.5 °C and 14 °C respectively. Three-dimensional fluid flow analysis inside the turbine at design and off-design conditions were carried out. Important dimensions of the turbine are: rotor tip and shroud radii of 24 mm and 19 mm respectively; blade widths at rotor inlet and outlet of 6 mm and 11 mm respectively; axial length of 17.5 mm; diffuser of 62 mm long. Volute casing designed has a circular cross section. The importance of the number of blades, blade filleting and stagger angle from the point of view of turbine performance are reported.
R22|The determinants of household's flood mitigation decisions in France – evidence of feedback effects from past investments|In this paper, we investigate the determinants of private flood mitigation in France. We conducted a survey among 331 inhabitants of two flood-prone areas and collected data on several topics, including individual flood mitigation, risk perception, risk experience, and sociodemographic characteristics. We estimate discrete choice models to explain either the presence of precautionary measures implemented by the household, or the intention to take such measures. We test the robustness of the Protection Motivation Theory in France, discuss its scope and investigate the existence of feedback effects from past investments on people's protection intentions. Our results confirm that the Protection Motivation Theory is a relevant framework to describe the mechanisms of private flood mitigation in France, highlighting in particular the importance of threat appraisal, threat experience appraisal, and coping appraisal. Some sociodemographic features are also significant to explain private flood mitigation. Our results also give evidence for feedback effects as they suggest that implementing precautionary measures reduces perceptions of the risk of flooding. The existence of these feedback effects implies that intended measures, rather than implemented ones, should be examined to explore further the determinants of private flood mitigation.
R22|An Econometric Analysis Of The Demand For Tourism In Mexico, Un Analisis Econometrico De La Demanda De Turismo En Mexico|This paper aims to determine the factors affecting tourism demand of Mexico in the US market. The econometric results show the main factor affecting the demand for tourism in Mexico is the prices of the destinations countries. Similarly, it was found that the variable tourism demand of residents of the United States to Mexico have significant common cycle with variable relative wealth. This explains that in the short term wealth of Americans is a determining factor in the demand for tourism to Mexico.
R22|An assessment of hydrocarbons as an alternative refrigerant: the Mauritian context| Currently, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluoro-carbons (HFCs) are the most commonly used refrigerants in the refrigeration and air condition sector in Mauritius. But due to ozone depletion and their high global warming potential, environmentally friendly refrigerants such as hydrocarbons are under consideration. However, hydrocarbon (HC) technology has only been commercialised in domestic refrigerators so far. In this study, two blends of hydrocarbons HC (95% propane, 5% ethane) and HC (50% propnane, 50% isobutane) are tested as an alternative replacement refrigerant in a bench-type window air conditioner operating on R22 and bench-type car air conditioning unit operating on R134a, respectively. The design approach characteristic of HCs, the retrofitting procedure and safety are discussed. The mass of HC refrigerant retrofitted was about 35% of the original R22 and R134a charge. Results of the tests indicated an improved COP of up to 12.9% when the units were converted from halogenated refrigerant to HC refrigerants. Discharge pressures were considerably lower implying lower energy consumptions.
R22|Efficiency in Domestic Space Heating: An Estimation of the Direct Rebound Effect for Domestic Heating in the U.S|Improvements in energy efficiency are increasingly seen as a key strategy to reduce energy consumption in the domestic sector. Yet, concerns are mounting that households rebound, meaning that they adapt to efficiency gains by increasing their demand, as efficiency improvements reduce relative costs of energy. This study investigates the elasticity of household energy consumption for space heating with respect to changes in household heating efficiency. We account for the simultaneity of energy efficiency and energy consumption by applying an instrumental variable approach. Using data from the 2009 Residential Energy Consumption Survey, we document that while there is substantial ‘takeback’ among US households, rebound rates are far too small to dominate energy savings from these improvements. Estimates of the direct rebound effect in domestic heating are about 30%. Moreover, we find no evidence for a substantial indirect rebound at the household level. However, we document that the degree of ‘takeback’ increases in energy prices, suggesting that price-based and efficiency-based policy instruments may counteract each other.
R22|Turn It Up and Open the Window: On the Rebound Effects in Residential Heating|This paper investigates how households respond to efficiency improvements of their heating system. The analysis is based on the stated preference approach with an innovative choice experiment. The design includes questions to quantify both the direct and indirect rebounds. A series of easy discrete possible changes have been suggested to prime the respondents for deciding on potential actions impacting their heating service demand. Responses to these qualitative choices are moreover used to cross-validate the quantitative results. Overall, we find relatively low direct rebound effects. However, after accounting for the indirect rebound calculated using energy embodied in goods and services purchased by re-spending initial savings, we estimate an average total rebound of about one third. The econometric analysis points to substantial variations across individuals that are partly explained by observed characteristics. The results are consistent with the conjunction that heating is a basic need which calls for little rebound in high-income groups.

R22|Technology Acceptance as Part of the Energy Performance Gap in Energy-Efficient Retrofitted Dwellings|This paper separates technological from human capabilities with regard to the operating of advanced heating systems. Our study shows that attitudes towards using such systems are equally influenced by a system's ease of use and its related thermal comfort as perceived by the user. However, the user does not perceive either of these influences directly; they are both mediated through the latent construct “perceived usefulness”. Our results reveal that in order to maximize the technology acceptance of advanced heating systems, the focus of interventions needs to be a twofold one. It is not only perceived thermal comfort – in its technological capacity of a delivered energy service – which is relevant; an easy-to-use system is equally important. The underlying psychological theory of this paper is that of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Using an adapted version of the technology acceptance model (TAM) – the energy TAM (eTAM) – we draw on questionnaire data from a field experiment conducted in Germany. The statistical inference is based on a partial least squares patch modeling (PLS-PM) approach.
R22|A Spatial Diffusion Model with Common Factors and an Application to Cigarette Consumption|This paper adopts a dynamic spatial panel data model with common factors to explain the non-stationary diffusion process of cigarette consumption across 69 Italian provinces over the period 1877-1913. The Pesaran (2015) CD-test and the exponent a-test of Bailey et al. (2015) are used to show that both weak and strong cross-sectional dependence are important drivers of the propagation of cigarette demand over this period. Stability tests on the coefficients and the CD-test on the residuals of the model are used to verify whether the data and both forms of cross-sectional dependence are modeled adequately. Cigarettes are found to be a normal good with an income elasticity of 0.4 and a price elasticity -0.4 in the long term. The price elasticity can be decomposed into a direct effect of -0.54 in the own region and a spillover effect to other regions of 0.15. This positive spillover effect is in line with previous spatial econometric studies which investigated cigarette demand in the U.S. states over a more recent period.
R22|Personal, family, local entrepreneurship. Economic initiative at the beginning of XXIth century at Nowy Targ Commune (Przedsiebiorczosc indywidualna, rodzinna, lokalna. Inicjatywa gospodarcza na pocz¹tku XXI wieku w gminie Nowy Targ)|This paper shows an anthropological analysis of economic initiatives at Nowy Targ Commune in Podhale. Firstly, cultural background is described, in which family and family farm have a crucial meaning. Furthermore, such oppositions as: home–external world/state, intellectual work-manual labor, to work–to moonlight, and also long-term tradition of labour migration are discussed. This article proposes a wide perspective of business’ analysis, containing family causation of an individual. The Internet becomes an essential aspect of present, highlanders’ entrepreneurship. Popularization of this new medium not only brought new economic possibilities for Podhale dwellers, but also highlighted many social differences. The most important ones, shaping personal entrepreneurship, are gender, age and received education.
R22|Adaptation to climate variability: Evidence from German households|Using panel data originating from two extensive surveys conducted in 2012 and 2014, we investigate German households' adaptation behavior in response to indoor heat stress during summer months. Providing detailed information of household characteristics, behavior and technical equipment, our unique database allows us to estimate a random-eff ects probit model on households' vulnerability and adaptive capacity. The estimates indicate that even moderate increases in temperatures are suffi cient to trigger investments in adaptation measures: While the propensity to adapt is heterogeneous across socio-economic groups, an increase of one degree Celsius in average summer temperature is associated with a rise of 2.3 percentage points in adaptation probability.
R22|HPAI Impact on EU-27’s Import Demand for Cooked and Uncooked Poultry and Other Meats| The article applied a Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) differential model to evaluate the impact of HPAI (H5N1) virus outbreaks on EU-27’s import demand for five meat products: cooked poultry, uncooked poultry, beef, pork, and other meats. One novel feature of this work is the division of poultry into two distinct import products—cooked (safe) and uncooked (less safe). Analysis shows that HPAI (H5N1) outbreaks had statistically significant impacts on EU27 import demand for meats, increasing cooked poultry and decreasing uncooked poultry, beef, pork, and other meats. The shift in import demand regime was permanent and statistically significant, making cooked poultry imports EU27’s largest, averaging more than 50 percent of EU imports in 2013 and 2014.
R22|The value of restoring urban drains to living streams| Many urban streams have been cleared of native vegetation and converted to open drains resulting in a loss of ecological and aesthetic function. There is a growing recognition of the importance of these functions and work is being done to restore urban drains and create fully functioning wetland ecosystems (“living streams”). Such restoration work involves substantial cost, and it is important to know if the benefits generated from “living streams” are greater than restoration costs. This paper presents a detailed economic analysis of an urban drain restoration project in Perth, Western Australia. Controlling for other factors, we find homes within 200m of the restoration site increased in value by 4.4% once the restored area became fully established. When we compare benefits to cost we find that, with real discount rates of 5%, 7%, and 9%, project benefit−cost ratios are 2.6, 2.5, and 2.2, respectively. We then show that current institutional arrangements in Western Australia make it difficult to implement urban drain restoration projects, even when project benefits are greater than project costs. The paper concludes by identifying changes to governance arrangements that would allow value enhancing restoration projects to be undertaken.
R22|Más allá de los promedios: patrones de segmentación del consumo de productos lácteos en España, 1964-2006|This article reconstructs the evolution of disparities in the consumption of dairy products in Spain from the mid-1960s to the early twenty-first century. At the start of the period, there were strong regional disparities, as well as a clear pattern of social hierarchization in the consumption of both milk and milk derivatives. These gaps were (totally or substantially) narrowed during the phase of great expansion in consumption that took place until the 1980s. From then on, a new consumption pattern began to take shape, its segmentation pattern consisting mainly of social re-hierarchization in the consumption of the newest and most dynamic products (refrigerated derivatives), and a significant generational factor in the contraction of milk consumption.

R22|Interest rates, debt and intertemporal allocation: evidence from notched mortgage contracts in the United Kingdom|Using a novel source of quasi-experimental variation in interest rates, we study the response of household debt and intertemporal consumption allocation to interest rates. We also develop a new approach to structurally estimate the Elasticity of Intertemporal Substitution (EIS). In the United Kingdom, the mortgage interest rate schedule features discrete jumps — notches — at thresholds for the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, creating strong incentives for bunching below those thresholds. We document large and sharp bunching below every notch, which translates into sizable interest elasticities of mortgage debt, between 0.1 and 1.4 across different LTV levels. We develop a dynamic model that links these reduced-form responses to the underlying structural EIS. The EIS is much smaller and less heterogeneous than the reduced-form elasticities, between 0.05-0.25 across LTV levels and household types. We show that our structural approach is robust to a wide range of assumptions on beliefs about the future, uncertainty, risk aversion, discount factors and present bias. Our findings have implications for the numerous calibration studies in economics that rely on larger values of the EIS.
R22|Economic Development, Novelty Consumption, and Body Weight: Evidence from the East German Transition to Capitalism|This paper develops a conceptual framework that can explain why economic development goes along with increases in body weight and obesity rates. We first introduce the concept of novelty consumption, which refers to an increase in food availability due to trade or innovation. Then we study how novel food products alter the optimal consumption bundle and welfare, and possibly lead to changes in body weight. We test our model employing the German reunification as a fast motion natural experiment of economic development. Our data elicit detailed information on East Germans' food consumption, body mass, and diet-related health. After the fall of the Wall, East Germans permanently changed their diet by consuming novel western food products. A significant population share permanently gained weight. This is consistent with our theoretical framework where past affects current consumption, and where novel goods determine consumption changes over time with ambiguous effects on diet-related health.
R22|The role of education for amenity based sorting in British cities|This paper investigates the relation between amenities and skills by looking at the sorting behavior of skilled individuals across neighbourhoods within British cities. Using a detailed micro dataset on housing transactions we recover a composite measure of local amenities that captures the level of attractiveness of each neighbourhood. By combining the amenity measure with data on British individuals we analyse how the cost associated with the consumption of amenities is distributed across education groups and across neighborhoods within cities defined as integrated labour markets. Results show that, holding constant the availability of job opportunities, high skilled individuals exhibit a moderate preference bias towards amenity consumption as they tend to sort into more attractive neighborhoods than lower skilled individuals with the same income.
R22|House Prices, Local Demand, and Retail Prices|We document a causal response of local retail prices to changes in local house prices, with elasticities of 15–20 percent across housing cycles. These price responses are largest in zip codes with many homeowners and are driven by changes in markups rather than local costs. We argue that markups rise with house prices because greater housing wealth reduces homeowners’ demand elasticity, and firms raise markups in response. Shopping data confirm that house price changes affect the price sensitivity of homeowners, but not that of renters. Our evidence suggests a new source of business cycle markup variation.
R22|The determinants of private flood mitigation measures in Germany — Evidence from a nationwide survey|Public flood protection cannot eliminate totally the risk of flooding. Hence, private mitigation measures which proactively protect homes from being flooded or reduce flood damage are an essential part of modern flood risk management. This study analyses private flood mitigation measures among German households. The final data set covers more than 4200 households from all parts of the country, including flood plains as well as areas which are typically not at a high risk of riverine flooding. The results suggest that the propensity to mitigate flood damage increases i.a. with past damage experience and damage expectations for the future. The latter effect can be interpreted as a ‘climate adaptation signal’ in the flood mitigation behaviour. All other factors remaining equal, a strong belief in a climate-change-induced increase of personal flood damage in the next decades correlates with an increase of the probability of flood mitigation by more than 10 percentage points. Moreover, empirical evidence for moral hazard in the flood mitigation behaviour cannot be observed. Households expecting insurance coverage do not reduce their mitigation efforts. Likewise, the expectation of government relief payments hinders mitigation only for some groups of households.
R22|Enabling sustainable transportation: The model-based determination of business/operating areas of free-floating carsharing systems|Free-floating carsharing systems with (and without) electric vehicles are emerging and there is limited knowledge where such concepts will succeed, regardless of their environmental benefits. Within this knowledge gap, the definition of the business/operating area is a key aspect. Inside this area a carsharing vehicle can be picked-up and dropped-off everywhere at any time. This research develops a model that helps to determine business areas a-priori by predicting inner-city booking hot-spots. The approach is based on modeling success factors as independent variables, namely population density, housing rent, city center distance, and hotel/restaurant density. With the help of these variables predictions for geographic zones in cities are made that prove to be helpful for designing operating areas for free-floating carsharing systems – a key challenge for providers' success when approaching new cities.

Results show that, holding constant the availability of job opportunities, high skilled individuals exhibit a moderate preference bias towards amenity consumption as they tend to sort into more attractive neighborhoods than lower skilled individuals with the same income.
R22|A Monstrous Hybrid: A comment on Brett Christophers´ interpretation of Swedish housing policy|In this comment it is argued that Christophers´ misunderstands the nature of the post war housing model in Sweden. This was actually a market friendly model where rent and price regulations were seen as something temporary and that an increase in supply was the most important policy. It is further argued that it is a mistake to describe the development in recent decades as a move towards a neoliberal model. Even if there are no state subsidies, there still is a municipal planning monopoly that reduce the supply of land. Municipalities have become more and more restrictive towards new construction, and a combination of NIMBYarguments and environmental demands have especially reduced the number of housing projects targeting households with lower incomes.
R22|An analysis of the welfare and distributive implications of factors influencing household electricity consumption|The deep economic crisis and the sharp rise in electricity prices have had a strong effect on electricity demand by Spanish households. This paper aims to analyse the responsiveness of household electricity demand and the welfare effects related to both factors in the 2006-2012 period. The results show that the electricity consumption of medium-high income households is particularly responsive to price increases, whereas that of medium-low income households is more responsive to changes in income. The retail electricity price increases and the economic crisis have led to generally lower and steeper U-shape price elasticities of demand and higher and steeper N-shape income elasticities of demand. The joint impact of those two factors on the welfare of lower-income households is higher in relative terms (i.e., as a share of household income) than for other income groups. These results suggest that the economic crisis and increases in retail electricity prices have had detrimental welfare effects, especially on the lower-income segment of the population. They should be taken into account when financing climate and energy policies through the electricity bill and provide a rationale to take such support, which pushes retail electricity price upwards, out of the electricity bill.

R22|An Empirical Analysis of Engel Curve on Energy for Households in Sabah and Sarawak Based on Location and Income Group|The study was focused in forming an empirical model of Engel curve on energy for households in Sabah and Sarawak. Open-ended questionnaire was used as an instrument of study involving 1,002 respondents in Sabah and Sarawak. The dependent variable was budget share of energy expenditure meanwhile the independent variables were total household expenditure, age, household size, educational level, gender and regional variables. The Ordinary Least Square estimation was carried out on the cross sectional data. The coefficients were used to estimate the Engel curve expenditure elasticities. The findings revealed that total household expenditure (income) and household size were the important determinant in explaining the energy expenditure. Meanwhile the estimation of Engel curve expenditure elasticities showed that energy was a necessity good for all income groups in both urban and rural areas. Low income group was found to be more sensitive on energy expenditure to the changes in household income.
R22|Household Deficiency in Demand for Water: Do Water Source and Travel Time Matter?|Despite the massive commitment by policy makers and stakeholders to increase the supply of water to households in Ghana, many households have a deficiency in their self-reported daily quantity of water required for drinking and for general use. This paper focuses on the effect of water source and travelling time on households’ deficiency in demand for water using the Sixth Round of the Ghana Living Standards survey. A Tobit regression analysis of data on 2,843 households reveals that a one minute increase in travelling time increases household deficiency in water demand by about 49 percent. Also, compared to pipe in dwelling/yard/plot, all other sources of water to the households come with greater levels of water deficiency, with unprotected well/spring/river-stream/dam-lake-pond generating the greatest (10.5 litres) levels of deficiency. Other significant predictors of household deficiency in water demand are per capita disposable income, number of rooms in the household, sex of the household head and regular payment of water bills. Government policies aimed at addressing household deficiency in water demand should focus on making more resources available to the Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) and the Community Water and Sanitation Agency so as to achieve more coverage of water accessible to both urban and rural households.
R22|Other profitable activities on family agricultural holdings according to their economic size|In the paper will be emphasized the importance of the other profitable activities (OPA) on the family agricultural holdings, according to their economic size within the territory of Republic of Serbia, with special focus on the Vojvodina Region. Economic size of the agricultural holding is recognized by the value of its total standard output (SA). Other profitable activities related to the agricultural holdings include incomes from agricultural products sale, rural tourism, fishery, etc., whether they are performed on or outside the holding. Other profitable activities that are not related to agricultural holdings include activities that do not consume resources of the holding, but only the labor, as like in previous case they may be carried on, or outside the holding. According to gained results, average economic size of the holding in the Republic of Serbia is 5.939 EUR, while the realized economic value on the family agricultural holdings (FAH) is 4.990 EUR. Census of Agriculture in 2012 showed that the highest average economic size of the agricultural holdings has a Vojvodina Region (12.032 EUR), what is 3,5 times higher than the value achieved in other regions. From the total sum of 631.552 agricultural holdings in the Republic of Serbia (family agricultural holdings (FAH), as well as legal entities (LE) and entrepreneurs) only 78.301 holdings possess DPA that are in relation to the holding (where 21% of them are within the economic class in range of 4.000 - 7.000 EUR). At the level of the Vojvodina Region, in total there were registered 147.624 agricultural holdings (AH), where 8.405 of them have OPA in relation to the holding (13,6% are within the class of economic sizes 100.000 and more EUR).
R22|Measuring the effect of health insurance companies on the quality of healthcare systems with kernel and parametric regressions|The paper applies parametric and kernel regressions to study the impact of private health insurers on quality related outcomes of social health insurance in Russian regions: infant mortality, maternal mortality and mortality under five years of age. The extended model captures endogeneity by employing an instrumental variable approach. The non-parametric model uses kernel regressions. The results reveal that the positive impact of private insurers is explained by regional institutional reforms.
R22|Exploratory Panel Data Evidence on the Relative Efficacy of Real Federal as Opposed to Real State Cigarette Excise Taxes in Reducing Cigarette Smoking in the United States|Within the context of the fixed-effects model, this study uses a2002-2007state-levelpanel dataset of the United States to investigate the relative effectiveness of real (constant-dollar) federal cigarette excise taxation versus real (constant-dollar) state cigarette excise taxation in reducing cigarette smoking in the United States. The empirical estimates in this study find that each of two aggregate measures of the extent of cigarette smoking, namely, the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per capita annually and the percentage of the population classified as smokers, is a decreasing function of both the federal cigarette excise tax and the state cigarette excise tax. However, it is also found that a given percentage increase in there all federal excise tax has a much greater negative impact on both the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per capita annually and the magnitude of the percentage of the population classified as smokers than does an equal percentage increase in the real state cigarette excise tax.
R22|Does the Presence of Very Young Children and/or Older Minor-aged Children in the Home Reduce Cigarette Smoking? Panel Data Evidence for the United States|Within the context of the Period Fixed-Effects Model, this study of cigarette consumption in the US uses a state-level panel dataset to investigate a new hypothesis. This hypothesis argues that the presence in the home of minor-aged children, that is, children under 18 years of age, reduces the percentage of the population that smokes cigarettes. The eclectic model includes the levels of federal plus state cigarette excise taxation along with a number of other established explanatory variables. The empirical estimates in this preliminary study find support for the hypothesis proffered here, that is, it is found that the percentage of the population that smokes cigarettes is a decreasing function of the percentage of households with minor-aged children residing in the home. Moreover, aside from providing further insight into smoker behaviour, the results from this study also raise the question that since this phenomenon has been ignored in previous related studies involving such public policies as cigarette taxation and cigarette smoking bans that those studies may suffer from omitted variable bias.

R22|Driving Forces of CO 2 Emissions in Emerging Countries: LMDI Decomposition Analysis on China and India’s Residential Sector|The main objective of this paper is to identify and analyze the key drivers behind changes of CO 2 emissions in the residential sectors of the emerging economies, China and India. For the analysis, we investigate to what extent changes in residential emissions are due to changes in energy emissions coefficients, energy consumption structure, energy intensity, household income, and population size. We decompose the changes in residential CO 2 emissions in China and India into these five contributing factors from 1990 to 2011 by applying the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method. Our results show that the increase in per capita income level was the biggest contributor to the increase of residential CO 2 emissions, while the energy intensity effect had the largest effect on CO 2 emissions reduction in residential sectors in both countries. This implies that investments for energy savings, technological improvements, and energy efficiency policies were effective in mitigating CO 2 emissions. Our results also depict that the change in CO 2 emission coefficients for fuels which include both direct and indirect emission coefficients slowed down the increase of residential emissions. Finally, our results demonstrate that changes in the population and energy consumption structure drove the increase in CO 2 emissions.
R22|Perceptions Of Marital Roles In Basic Commodity Groups Purchase Decision-Making|Family plays a primary role in the demand formation in consumer markets worldwide.It is the field where a wide variety of consumer decisions are made every day. Family decision-making is a complex process in which multiple individuals combine their personal needs, wants andresources in order to reach a satisfactory outcome. The development of the social system leads tomodifications of the known behavioral patterns of the family as a consumption unit. This paper isaimed at present-day Bulgarian family marital role structure. The distribution of roles betweenspouses was examined across 22 commodity groups using a convenience sample of 215respondents.

R22|Purchase and Utilization of New Fuel Efficient Vehicles in the US: Evidence from the 2009 National Household Transportation Survey Data|This paper applies a simultaneous equation model to examine the relationship between choices of new fuel efficient vehicles and their utilization using the 2009 NHTS data. The regression results indicate that travelers purchasing new fuel efficient vehicles with a fuel economy of at least 30 mpg drive more on a monthly basis than others owning a new vehicle with lower fuel economy. In addition, those who travel more are more likely to purchase a new fuel efficient vehicle with a fuel economy of at least 30 mpg in the study period. The gasoline price has a significant negative impact on new vehicle utilization while a significant positive impact on choices of new vehicles with a fuel economy of at least 30 mpg.

R22|Building and household X-factors and energy consumption at the residential sector|Energy use in residential buildings is one of the major sources of greenhouse gas emission production from cities. Using microdata from the 2009 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS), this study applies structural equation modeling to analyze the direct, indirect, and total impacts of household and building characteristics on residential energy consumption. Results demonstrate that the direct impact of household characteristics on residential energy consumption is significantly smaller than the corresponding impact from the buildings. However, accounting for the indirect impact of household characteristics on energy consumption, through choice of the housing unit characteristics, the total impact of households on energy consumption is just slightly smaller than that of buildings. Outcomes of this paper call for smart policies to incorporate housing choice processes in managing residential energy consumption.
R22|The impact of the household decision environment on fuel choice behavior|Consumer preferences for fuels and alternative cookstove technologies in Kenya are examined, focusing on household internal and external determinants driving choice behavior in a choice experiment. The potential for a transition towards cleaner and more efficient fuels and technologies is assessed by zooming in on three fuel-stove combinations. We find substantial demand and positive willingness to pay for the fuel-stove combinations in three locations representing different decision environments. Demand is significantly higher in the peri-urban and the resource abundant rural location than in the resource scarce rural location. The presence of better developed consumer markets for fuels in these locations functions as an important driver for cookstove adoption. Although charcoal and ethanol stoves are preferred over improved firewood stoves, continued firewood usage is expected. Energy switching behavior cannot be substantiated. Instead, energy stacking is more likely, where charcoal and ethanol add to and extend a household’s energy portfolio.
R22|Free-riding on tax credits for home insulation in France: An econometric assessment using panel data|This econometric study assesses the efficiency of the income tax credit system introduced in France in 2005 on investment decisions for household retrofits, focusing on insulation measures. A logit model with random individual effects is estimated using an unbalanced panel of 23,879 households surveyed over the period 2002–2011. An estimation in difference is performed to identify the impact of the policy. The tax credit is found to have had no significant effect during the first two years, suggesting a latency period related to inertia in households' investment decisions, possibly due to the complexity of the tax credit scheme. The tax credit had an increasing, significant positive effect from 2007 to 2010, before slightly decreasing in 2011. This is in line with changes in the tax credit rates, suggesting a correlation with the level of subsidy. Defined as the situation in which the subsidized household would have invested even in the absence of the subsidy, free-ridership progressively decreased over the period, was lower for insulation of opaque surfaces (roofs, walls, etc.) than for insulation of windows and depended on individual characteristics. The estimated average proportion of free-riders varies between 40% and 85% after 2006. In addition, we assess the potential bias caused by time-varying unobservable variables and conclude that our estimates of the impacts of the policy are conservative.

R22|Cultural heritage and the attractiveness of cities: evidence from recreation trips|Many cities are trying to attract tourists by investing in urban amenities. Cultural heritage is an important example, and substantial investments are needed to keep ancient inner cities and characteristic monumental buildings in good shape. The costs of these policies are usually clear, and the benefits are often much more difficult to assess. This paper attempts to fill part of this gap by studying the destination choices of urban recreation trips that have urban recreation as the main travel motive. We estimate a discrete choice model for destination choice that takes into account the potential importance of unobserved characteristics. The model allows us to compute the marginal willingness-to-travel for destinations offering more cultural heritage, which we measure as the area of the inner city that has a protected status because of the cultural heritage that is present there.

R22|Locally weighted linear combination in a vector geographic information system|Weighted linear combination is a multi-criteria decision analysis technique that can be used by decision-makers to select an optimal location from a collection of alternative locations. Its local form takes into account the range of attribute values within a user-defined neighbourhood in accordance with the range-sensitivity principle. This research explores locally weighted linear combination in a vector-based geographic information system. A custom application in ArcGIS 10 allows the user to select a neighbourhood definition from a standard set including contiguity, distance, and k-nearest neighbours, for which local weights are generated. A case study on vulnerability to heat-related illness in Toronto is used to illustrate the technique. The impact of local weighting on the heat vulnerability index is examined using visual analysis of the spatial patterns of heat vulnerability under the global and local approaches, as well as the sensitivity of the local approach to the selected neighbourhood definition. A trade-off analysis of the local weights is also presented. The combination of socio-demographic and environmental determinants in a locally weighted index results in patterns of heat vulnerability that could support targeted hot weather response at a micro-geographic level within urban neighbourhoods.

R22|Determinants of Households' Investment in Energy Efficiency and Renewables: Evidence from the OECD Survey on Household Environmental Behaviour and Attitudes|Many studies on household energy efficiency investments suggest that a wide range of seemingly profitable investments are not taken up. This paper provides novel evidence on the main factors behind consumer choices using the OECD Survey on Household Environmental Behaviour and Attitudes. The empirical analysis is based on the estimation of binary logit regression models. Empirical results suggest that households’ propensity to invest in clean energy technologies depends mainly on home ownership, income, social context and households’ information. Indeed, home owners and high-income households are more likely to invest than renters and low-income households. On the other hand, social context, such as membership in an environmental non-governmental organisation, and households’ knowledge about their energy spending and use may play a relevant role in technology adoption. Les déterminants de l'investissement des ménages dans l'efficacité énergétique et les énergies renouvelables : Résultat de l'enquête de l'OCDE sur les comportements et attitudes des ménages face aux questions d'environnement De nombreuses études sur les investissements des ménages en matière d'efficacité énergétique suggèrent qu'une large gamme d'investissements apparemment rentables n’est pas exploitée. Cette étude fournit de nouveaux éléments de preuve sur les principaux facteurs qui expliquent les choix des consommateurs à l'aide de l'Enquête de l'OCDE sur les comportements et les attitudes des ménages avec l’environnement. L'analyse empirique est basée sur l'estimation des modèles de régression logit binaires. Les résultats empiriques suggèrent que la propension des ménages à investir dans les technologies d'énergie propre dépend principalement de la propriété, du revenu, du contexte social et de l'information sur le sujet qu’obtiennent les ménages. En effet, les propriétaires de maison et les ménages à revenu élevé sont plus susceptibles d'investir que les locataires et les ménages à faible revenu. D'autre part, le contexte social, tels que l'appartenance à une organisation non gouvernementale pour la protection de l'environnement, la connaissance des ménages sur leurs dépenses d'énergie et l'utilisation peut jouer un rôle important dans l'adoption de la nouvelle technologie.
R22|The impact of conflict induced exile on entitlement of food: Evidence from rural Liberia|This article is a unique attempt to discover the impact of exile on the most basic human necessity, food entitlement. We argue that exile from society followed by reintegration attempts cause mental and physical trauma, emotional distress, cultural shock, depletion of technical skills, political oppression, loss of social cohesion and articulation. We use survey data randomized on levels of conflict and propensity of migration from 312 rural households in 22 Liberian villages from Loma, Nimba, and Grand Bassa counties. Our findings suggest that accounting for household demographics, farm size, attributes, and income; duration of exile increases the probability of food entitlement failure.
R22|Defensa social en tiempos de peligro. La clase terrateniente chilena y la cuestión agraria (1936-1940)|This article explores the political behaviour of Chilean landowners as a widespread pro-union agricultural movement emerged during the right-wing administration of Arturo Alessandri (1934-38) and the Radical Front government of Pedro Aguirre (1938-41). Both administrations were influenced by Chilean landowners and deployed strategies against the unionisation of peasants. The research presented here shows how resistance to agricultural unionism operated externally through the State apparatus (legislative projects, decrees and round table dialogues), and internally through socio-agricultural relationships, repression, and modernisation of labour contracts derived from Labour Code requirements.
R22|Income, distance and amenities. An empirical analysis|This paper analyses the income distribution of households in Barcelona metropolitan area. For this purpose we use the monocentric model. As the basic model does not have direct implications for this distribution, we survey the extensions of the model that have been used in empirical literature. One of the most promising ways is to introduce externalities in the decision process; they can result directly from exogenous amenities (given traits of urban area) or be created by other agents’ decisions. We first test the simple model relating income to distance. Then we introduce and test the model with exogenous amenities; recreational areas, transportation systems, health, educational and cultural infrastructure. In the third stage we test the model with spatial effects. We present evidence that any model with spatial effects improves significantly the empirical results.

R22|Timing and determinants of local residential broadband adoption: evidence from Ireland|This article examines the time path of broadband adoption for households in areas that are offered broadband service for the first time and the socioeconomic characteristics of broadband users generally. Using cross-sectional data on broadband take-up and socioeconomic characteristics of small areas in Ireland, linked to GIS data on ADSL availability over time, I find that local penetration growth rates are elevated immediately after service is offered. Local growth rates then decline towards the national average, reaching it after about 3.6 years. The article also includes estimates of the effect of various household characteristics on adoption, finding effects broadly consistent with the previous literature. Simultaneity in demand and supply are addressed using 2SLS regression. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014
R22|City size and household food consumption: demand elasticities in Spain| Are food price elasticities different across city sizes? The aim of this article is to estimate expenditure and own-price elasticities for 10 aggregated food product groups using the Spanish Household Budget Survey for the year 2010. These products are the ones for which the survey provides information regarding prices and quantities, thus allowing the application of an Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) model with censored data. The estimation procedure allows not only comparisons to be made among households with different levels of income, but also the contribution of residence characteristics to variations in demand. The results confirm that the size of the city in which the household resides has a similar significant and relevant effect on consumption patterns as family income level. This is especially clear with own-price elasticities. In Spain, large central cities show a greater response to price changes than smaller cities or rural peripheral areas.
R22|Repeat Sales Methods for Growing Cities and Short Horizons|The accurate estimation of real estate indices is important for many purposes. A common method to estimate these indices is to use a repeatâ€ sales procedure. Although this does not require property attributes, this method discards a large amount of sales. This paper proposes a method that can be used to incorporate a significant percentage of these discarded observations without requiring additional data collection by the researcher. We apply our method to the metropolitan statistical areas of Phoenix and Seattle and find that standard errors are on average twoâ€ thirds the value of standard errors from a repeatâ€ sales procedure in Seattle and threeâ€ eighths the value in Phoenix.
R22|Heterogeneous hospital response to a per diem prospective payment system|The paper demonstrates the adverse effects of degressive rates, dependent on the percentiles of length of stay, in a prospective payment system with per diem payments. Using the dynamic panel data estimates with a recent nationwide administrative database for major diagnostic categories in 697 Japanese hospitals in July 2007- March 2012, the paper shows that average length of stay significantly increases (decreases) for hospitals in percentiles 0-25 (51-100) of the pre-reform length of stay. The decline of the average length of stay is larger for hospitals in higher percentiles of the length of stay. Hospitals in percentiles 51-100 significantly raise planned early readmission rate. As a remedy to the problem, the paper discusses the applicability of the “best practice” rate-setting.
R22|Dietary Diversity in Urban and Rural China: An Endogenous Variety Approach| In the canonical consumer demand problem, an agent makes a decision about quantities to consume, under the assumption that all possible varieties are available and can be accessed at zero cost. Quantities of each budget item are adjusted to achieve maximum utility subject to the budget constraint. As a result, utility and expenditure reflect aggregations of quantity and, implicitly, variety. In reality, the cost of accessing variety may not be zero. In this paper we study the consumer’s choice problem using an endogenous variety approach, allowing variety access cost to influence consumption. We develop a conceptual framework for the problem and test its predictions empirically by comparing patterns of dietary diversity over time among a large sample of urban and rural Chinese consumers. We find that access costs, reflecting differences in infrastructure and household storage technologies, influence dietary diversity.
R22|Distribution of Tax Burden in the Gas Sector in Europe|Traditionally the distribution of the tax burden among the consumers and manufacturers of whichever goods is analyzed using the Marshall’s partial equilibrium model of market. Because of the prevailing role of the long-term contracts in trading with natural gas, the use of only market model is not sufficient. A specific model based on the contracting process should be developed. In this model the spot markets remain a significant factor in the distribution of the tax burden, but mostly with their impact on ex post power of contracting.
R22|City size and household food consumption. An application of the AIDS model to food demand elasticities in Spain|Empirical evidence on consumer behavior is of major importance in the formulation and analysis of economic policies. Changes in prices, income level, or decisions regarding taxes or other structural reforms that effect relative prices may produce very different effects depending on family income distribution or also across space. The aim of this paper is to estimate expenditure and own-price elasticities for ten aggregated food product groups using the Spanish Household Budget Survey for the year 2010. These products are the ones for which the survey provides information regarding prices and quantities, thus allowing the application of the Almost Ideal Demand System model (AIDS). This stimation procedure allows comparisons to be made not only among different levels of income, but also how relevant could be the place of residence characteristics. The results confirm that the size of the city in which the household resides has a similar significant and relevant effect on consumption patterns as family income level. This is especially clear with own-price elasticities. In Spain, large cities show a greater response to price changes tan small cities or rural areas.

R22|Any Given Sunday: How Season Ticket Holders' Time of Stadium Entrance Is Influenced by Outcome Uncertainty|This paper constitutes a unique micro-level exploration of the relation between game outcome uncertainty and the behavior of highly committed season ticket holders of a major Bundesliga soccer team. Specifically, we look at 3,113 season ticket holders attending all 17 home games in the 2012-13 season and explore whether outcome uncertainty had an impact on their stadium arrival time. We find strong evidence that increased uncertainty about the expected outcome prompts these spectators to enter the stadium earlier. Moreover, season ticket holders travelling from outside the hosting city or paying higher season ticket prices exhibit a stronger reaction to uncertainty compared with season ticket holders in the standing section. We also find that younger spectators are less likely to arrive late when uncertainty increases.
R22|Experimental energetic analysis of a vapor compression refrigeration system with dedicated mechanical sub-cooling|In this work, an experimental investigation into the effects, in terms of energy, of employing a dedicated mechanical subcooling cycle with a residential 1.5ton simple vapor compression refrigeration system is presented. A comparative analysis of the experimental cycle performance is conducted with and without the dedicated subcooler cycle when the room temperature is kept between 18 and 22°C. This is done in order to ascertain the percentage increase in efficiency due to use of a dedicated subcooling loop. R22 is employed as the refrigerant in the main cycle whereas R12 is flowing in the dedicated subcooling cycle. The experimental outcomes indicate that the load carrying capacity of the evaporator increased by approximately 0.5kW when R22 was subcooled, in the main cycle, by 5–8°C. It was also noted that, by using the subcooling, the second-law efficiency of the cycle increased by an average of 21%. Furthermore, the general trend indicated that this percentage increase is inversely proportional to the ambient temperature variation. The experimental work proves that dedicated subcooling can be used for increasing cooling capacity and efficiency.
R22|Retrofits and options for the alternatives to HCFC-22|HCFC-22, widely used in variety of refrigerating/heating equipment, has been scheduled to be phased out by Montreal Protocol. This decision will result in significant reduction of ozone depletion and global warming, holding on the climate benefits accrued so far. In this paper, significant focuses were paid on the HCFC-22 elimination policies, advanced technologies, feasibility substitutes, revolutionary innovations, assessment strategy and developing tendency. The latest developing situation of R744, R717, HC-290, RE170, HFC-32, HFC-161, HFC-152a, HFO-1234yf, HFO-1234ze (E) and their blends were summarized and evaluated technically. Currently there has been no such kind of fluids which can replace HCFC-22 perfectly in most of existing equipment. Many factors must be taken into consideration when selecting an alternative, such as thermodynamic property, environmental impact, system efficiency, technology, flammability, toxicity, cost, policy etc., which can be regarded as a multi-objective decision problem. It is predicted to be increasingly important to research the flammable characteristics of refrigerants, including flammable limits, ignition energy, heat and product of combustion. Special security arrangements were suggested when operating with the flammable refrigerants, covering the whole lifetime. In consideration of current situations, the diversified solutions are the inevitable trends on the basic of comprehensive comparison.
R22|India's senior citizen's policy and an examination of the life of senior citizens in North Delhi|The paper investigates the ageing situation in India and the development of the government initiatives for the welfare of senior citizens. It also presents the initial results of a survey that the author conducted in 2011 in North Delhi. The main features related to ageing in India are 'feminisation', 'rurality' and 'poverty'. The survey in North Delhi reveals the differences between the male and the female senior citizens, and the vulnerability of the latter, in particular. The social security coverage such as pensions and health insurance was found quite limited among the respondents.
R22|Social networks and trade of services: modelling interregional flows with spatial and network autocorrelation effects|Recent literature on border effect has fostered research on informal barriers to trade and the role played by network dependencies. In relation to social networks, it has been shown that intensity of trade in goods is positively correlated with migration flows between pairs of countries/regions. In this article, we investigate whether such a relation also holds for interregional trade of services. We also consider whether interregional trade flows in services linked with tourism exhibit spatial and/or social network dependence. Conventional empirical gravity models assume the magnitude of bilateral flows between regions is independent of flows to/from regions located nearby in space, or flows to/from regions related through social/cultural/ethic network connections. With this aim, we provide estimates from a set of gravity models showing evidence of statistically significant spatial and network (demographic) dependence in the bilateral flows of the trade of services considered. The analysis has been applied to the Spanish intra- and interregional monetary flows of services from the accommodation, restaurants and travel agencies for the period 2000–2009, using alternative datasets for the migration stocks and definitions of network effects.

R22|Comparing the Determinants of Mode Choice across Travel Purposes|This paper considers travel mode choice for a range of journey purposes in Ireland using micro-data for 2009. Results suggest that demographic and socio-economic variables, location and public transport availability are important determinants of mode choice. The results also indicate an attachment to the car as a mode of transport for non-commuting journeys when available, and especially when used regularly for work journeys. Importantly, the determinants of mode choice are found to differ across journey purposes suggesting that it is not valid to generalise the results from studies considering only one journey purpose.
R22|The transformative effect of unscheduled generation by solar PV and wind generation on net electricity demand|This study investigates the transformative effect of unscheduled solar PV and wind generation on electricity demand. The motivations for the study are twofold, the poor medium term predictions of electricity demand in the Australian National Electricity Market and the continued rise in peak demand but reduction in overall demand. A number of factors contribute to these poor predictions, including the global financial crisis inducing a reduction in business activity, the Australian economy’s continued switch from industrial to service sector, the promotion of energy conservation, and particularly mild weather reducing the requirement for air conditioning. Additionally, there is growing unscheduled generation, which is meeting electricity demand. This growing source of generation necessitates the concepts of gross and net demand where gross demand is met by unscheduled and scheduled generation and net demand by scheduled generation. The methodology compares the difference between net and gross demand of the 50 nodes in the Australian National Electricity Market using half hourly data from 2007 to 2011. The unscheduled generation is calculated using the Australian Bureau of Meteorology half hourly solar intensity and wind speed data and the Australian Clean Energy Regulator’s database of small generation units’ renewable energy target certificates by postcode. The findings are that gross demand rather than net demand helps explain both the overall reduction in net demand and the continued increase in peak demand. The study has two main conclusions. Firstly, a requirement for policy to target the growth in peak demand via time of supply feed-in tariff for small generation units. Secondly, modellers of electricity demand consider both net and gross demand in their forecasts. The time of supply feed-in tariffs are intended to promote the adoption of storage technologies and demand side participation and management. Modellers considering both net and gross demand are required to model unscheduled generation. This requirement ensues that more comprehensive solar intensity data be provided by the Bureau of Meteorology and that the Australian National Electricity Market Operator provide data in GIS format of each demand node using the Australian Statistical Geography Standard developed by Australian Bureau of Statistics to enable easier integration of large quantities of geographic data from a number of sources. The applicability of these finding become more relevant to other countries as unscheduled generation becomes more wide spread. This study is instrumental to a range of further research. Other sources of unscheduled generations should be considered to form a more comprehensive concept of gross demand, for instance, solar hot water and small hydro. Replacing electrical hot water heaters with solar hot water reduces the overnight demand, which may provide a considerable transformative effect on net electricity demand. In addition, energy efficiency is meeting demand for electricity; incorporating energy efficiency would form an even more comprehensive concept of gross electricity demand and could help improve longer term electricity demand projections.
R22|Information Technology and Transportation: Substitutes or Complements?|The increased availability and prevalence of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) provides opportunities to use such products as substitutes for transportation. Common examples of this substitution are telecommuting, video conferences, and online classes. However, despite the intuitive appeal of a substitution relationship existing between ICT and transportation, prior research has indicated that the relationship between ICT and transportation is quite complex; at times ICT substitutes for travel and at other times ICT and travel complement each other. Therefore, using a Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) model and data from the US Consumer Expenditure Survey and the Consumer Price Index, I analyzed the effect of ICT expenditures on transportation demand. The analysis indicates that ICT may serve as a substitute for air travel, but primarily serves as a complement for private transportation. Overall the data supports a complementary relationship between ICT and transportation, which indicates that an increase in technology may increase rather than decrease the negative externalities associated with transportation.

R22|The Rebound Effect for Passenger Vehicles|The United States and many other countries are dramatically tightening fuel economy standards for passenger vehicles. Higher fuel economy reduces per-mile driving costs and may increase miles traveled, known as the rebound effect. The magnitude of the elasticity of miles traveled to fuel economy is an important parameter in welfare analysis of fuel economy standards, but all previous estimates impose at least one of three behavioral assumptions: (a) fuel economy is uncorrelated with other vehicle attributes; (b) fuel economy is uncorrelated with attributes of other vehicles owned by the household; and (c) the effect of gasoline prices on vehicle miles traveled is inversely proportional to the effect of fuel economy. Relaxing these assumptions yields a large effect; a one percent fuel economy increase raises driving 0.2 to 0.4 percent.

R22|Patrones de segmentación del consumo de productos lácteos en España, 1958-2006|This article reconstructs the evolution of disparities in the consumption of dairy products in Spain from the late 1950s to the early twentyfirst century. At the start of the period, there were strong regional disparities, as well as a clear pattern of social hierarchization in the consumption of milk and milk derivatives. These gaps were (totally or substantially) narrowed during the phase of great expansion in consumption that took place until the 1980s. From then on, a new regime of consumption began to take shape and its segmentation pattern consisted mainly of a social re-hierarchization in the consumption of the newest and most dynamic products (refrigerated derivatives) and a significant generational factor in the contraction of milk consumption.
R22|Social Interaction and Public Goods Provision: A Case of Waste Management in Bandung, Indonesia|Successful minimisation of the gap between hypothetical and actual be-haviours requires to consider the dimension of individual social interaction in the decision process. While this dimension has been acknowledged to play an important role in the construction of private good preferences, however, in the context of public good, the role of social interaction has not been adequately examined. Therefore, to shed a light on the role of social interaction in shaping preferences toward public good, I conduct a contingent valuation (CV) study in which the respondents are enabled to have social interactions prior their willingness to pay (WTP) elicitation question. And in order to do this, I construct a sampling design where respondents are divided into three different groups, namely treated, untreated, and control groups. The respondents in the treated and untreated groups were allowed to interact/discuss with each other, within and across groups, prior to the WTP elicitation question. I find that treated and untreated respon-dents with social interactions have higher and significant likelihood to purchase the public good relatively to control respondents. While those who did not have interaction have a lower WTP for the improvement of waste management.
R22|Risk Preferences, Risk Perceptions, and Flood Insurance|We combine household-level data on the choice to purchase flood insurance with experiment-based risk preference data and subjective risk perception data. The sample covers a wide geographic area (the entire U.S. Gulf Coast and Florida's Atlantic Coast) and includes individuals exposed to varying levels of risk. This work represents one of very few analyses to do so. Results indicate that our experiment-based measure of risk aversion over the loss domain positively and significantly correlates with the decision to purchase a flood policy, as do perceived expectations of hurricane damage, eligibility for disaster assistance, and credibility of insurance providers.
R22|A Dynamic Model Of Housing Demand: Estimation And Policy Implications|Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) we specify, estimate and simulate a dynamic structural model of housing demand. Our model generalizes previous applied econometric work by incorporating realistic features of the housing market including non-convex adjustment costs from buying and selling a home, credit constraints from minimum downpayment requirements and uncertainty about the evolution of incomes and home prices. We argue that these features are critical for capturing salient features of housing demand observed in the PSID. After estimating the model we use it to simulate how consumer behavior responds to house price and income declines as well as tightening credit. These experiments are motivated by the U.S. recession starting in December of 2007 that saw large falls in home prices, large negative income shocks for many households and tightening credit standards. In the short run, relatively few households adjust their housing stock. Households respond instead by reducing non-housing consumption and reducing wealth because they wish to avoid losing their home and the associated adjustment costs. Households that adjust in the short run are those hit with a series of bad shocks, such as a negative income shock and a home price decline. A larger proportion of households do adjust their consumption in the long run, increasing their housing stock since housing is less expensive. However, such changes may occur several years after the shocks listed above.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
R22|Heterogeneous effect of coinsurance rate on the demand for health care: a finite mixture approach|The paper exploits finite mixture (latent class) models to account for consumer heterogeneity in estimating the effect of coinsurance rate on the demand for health care. The parametric analysis employs a two-part model, a Tobit model, and generalized linear models with latent classes. The non-parametric analysis uses matching estimators in each latent class to construct a control group of consumers and measure the average treatment effect of the natural experiment with a rise in nominal coinsurance rate. The paper exploits the 2000-2008 data of the Japanese Panel Survey of Consumers and the 2008 data of Japan Household Panel Survey. The estimations demonstrate a significant negative effect of nominal coinsurance rate on the demand for health care. The effect is primarily noticeable in the latent class of consumers with high health care demand, who constitute 21% of the sample. Our finding with the latent class models with Japanese data, where the assignment of insurance plans is exogenous, is similar to the results with the RAND Health Insurance Experiment data, where the assignment was randomized.
R22|Estimating income equity in social health insurance system|TThe paper measures horizontal equity in health care access and utilization in Japan by estimating the coefficients for income groups in a multi-part model which distinguishes between non-users of health care, the users of inpatient and outpatient care. To account for consumer unobservable characteristics, we apply a latent class approach. We address a retransformation problem of logged health care expenditure, using generalized linear models. Our sample is the 2009 data for 4,022 adult consumers (Japan Household Panel Survey). The coefficients for income groups are insignificant both in the binary choice models for inpatient/outpatient health care use, and in the models for health care expenditure. Consumers separate into two latent classes in the generalized linear model for outpatient health care expenditure. Although the results reveal horizontal equity in health care access and utilization in Japan, horizontal inequity remains in health insurance premiums and the prevalence of catastrophic coverage.
R22|The impact of private health insurers on the quality of Russian regional health systems|The 1991 law ‘On health insurance for the citizens of the Russian Federation’ established that social health insurance is to be offered by multiple private insurance companies. The paper is the first econometric analysis measuring the effect of private health insurers on quality related outcomes of social health insurance (SHI) systems in Russian regions. The baseline model introduces regional SHI system as a binary variable with unity value corresponding to the presence of private health insurers as the only agents at the SHI market. The extended model captures endogeneity by employing an instrumental variable approach. The non-parametric model uses kernel regressions. The results of parametric and kernel regressions reveal that the presence of private insurers is a significant determinant of infant and under-five mortality. The positive impact of private insurers is explained by regional institutional reforms. The methods of provider reimbursement are related to infant and under-five mortality, which offers suggestive evidence for enabling insurer competition through selective contracting with health care providers.
R22|Estimation of Demand for Different Fish Groups in Tripura| This paper has estimated the demand and income elasticity for different fish types in Tripura and has projected the demand of fish. Three-stage multiple budgeting framework of household was structured in simple way mitigating the drawback of limited sample size and aggregation problem. The coefficient of food and fish expenditure functions for urban, rural and overall Tripura have been found to be positive and significant, indicating that the response of food expenditure to income changes and fish expenditure to food budget changes are substantial. All the coefficients of specific fish consumption (local carps, local non-carps, inter-state non-carps and small weed fish) have been found to be significant, except for the coefficient of inter-state carps (IC) consumption function. Looking at the variability of income elasticities across the Choiced Fish Groups (CFGs), all CFGs have substantial importance with respect to income change, except inter-state carps (IC) which is likely to have no relation with the change in income basket for the consumers. The income elasticity of demand for local carps in Tripura has been found highest among all the CFGs and is expected to play a dominating role in meeting fish demand. Demand for the fish under the baseline scenario (considering base year 2004) is likely to grow at an annual rate of 3.38 per cent for the state and at the rate of 3.95 per cent and 2.00 per cent for urban and rural areas, respectively between 2004 and 2015. The demand for fish by 2015 has been projected as 80,153 Mt shared by 62,910 Mt of carps (local and inter-state) and 17,243 Mt of non-carps. The demand for local carps has been projected to be nearly 50 percent (40,624 Mt) of total projected demand of fish in 2015.
R22|Empirical Analysis of Demand of Natural Gas by Households in Europe|The article presents empirical analysis of demand of natural gas in 12 countries from European Union (EU), including Bulgaria, for the period 1989-2008. The ultimate goal is to assess the short-term and long-term elasticities of demand in different countries and in EU as a whole. These elasticities have to give a plausible picture of changing consumption of natural gas by the households and to allow determination and interpretation of the key indicator of the organization of gas sector – the relative price elasticity.

R22|Consumption sensitivities in Estonia: income shocks of different persistence|The Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH) entails that consumption reacts more strongly to persistent than to temporary income shocks. This prediction is tested using data from the Estonian Household Budget Surveys for 2002-2007. The dataset contains questions which make it possible to distinguish between persistent and temporary income shocks based on the households' own assessment. The estimations confirm that the marginal propensities to consume out of the two income shocks differ, households are forward-looking and seek to smooth consumption. Moreover, the estimated propensities of persistent shocks are of reasonable magnitudes, consistent with the PIH. Further analysis reveals, however, features that are in breach of the PIH. The consumption estimations are affected by lagged temporary income shocks. When income shocks are decomposed into positive and negative values, there is evidence of excess sensitivity to positive temporary shocks.
R22|Spatial random utility model with an application to recreation demand|The paper examines the relevance of unobserved spatial dependence between individual decision-makers in the analysis of discrete choices. To incorporate spatial interdependencies in the behavioral analysis, we propose a spatial random utility model of recreation demand. The model combines the set-theoretic concept of spatial neighborhood, endogeneity of spatial interdependencies, and unobservable individual preferences. Our estimation procedure uses an efficient pseudo maximum likelihood estimator. We apply the model to the study of recreational travel demand in Iowa and evaluate the significance of unobserved spatial interdependencies between individual households in recreational travel choices.
R22|Modeling quality demand with data from Household Budget Surveys: An application to meat and fish products in Greece|In this paper, we employ a method to examine the factors affecting quality choice by Greek households, using cross-sectional survey data. We illustrate the method using the raw data of the 2004/05 Household Budget Survey for meat and fish products. Quality elasticities of total food expenditure and household's age structure are derived. To cope with the zero expenditure problem, Heckman's two-step method is employed. Results generally suggest that several socio-economic factors affect quality demand for meat and fish.
R22|Homeowners' preferences for adopting innovative residential heating systems: A discrete choice analysis for Germany|Space heating accounts for a large fraction of the primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions of residential buildings in Germany. Besides targeting the insulation standard, innovative (i.e. renewable energies-based and/or energy-efficient) residential heating systems (RHS) offer the potential to reduce CO2 emissions from space heating. Therefore, understanding the determinants of the RHS adoption decision becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we analyze the influence of preferences about RHS-specific attributes on the homeowners' adoption decision. Moreover, we control for the influence of socio-demographic, home and spatial characteristics. To this end, we specify the discrete appliance choice by a multinomial logit model and apply it to representative survey data for Germany. Our findings show that there are different drivers for the adoption of innovative RHS (partly) based on renewable energies in newly built and existing 1- and 2-family homes, and that the importance of key drivers also differs across groups of homeowners and RHS, respectively. First, we find that adopters of a gas- and oil-fired condensing boiler with solar thermal support have a strong preference for energy savings, while adopters of a heat pump or wood pellet-fired boiler prefer being more independent from fossil fuels. Second, we find that owners of existing homes have less scope for preferences in the RHS adoption decision. The decision to replace a RHS in an existing home is rather driven by socio-demographic, home and spatial characteristics. Third, our findings are quite contrary for newly built homes. Here, preferences about RHS specific attributes are found to be highly relevant, while there is less evidence for an influence of socio-demographic, home and spatial characteristics on the adoption decision.
R22|Evaluating the relative strength of product-specific factors in fuel switching and stove choice decisions in Ethiopia. A discrete choice model of household preferences for clean cooking alternatives|Switching from conventional stoves to modern clean, safe, and efficient stoves will improve health and social welfare for the 2.7billion people worldwide that lack reliable access to modern energy services. In this paper, we critically review some key theoretical dimensions of household consumer behaviour in switching from traditional biomass cooking stoves to modern efficient stoves and fuels. We then describe the results of empirical research investigating the determinants of stove choice, focusing on the relative strength of product-specific factors across three wealth groups. A stated preference survey and discrete choice model were developed to understand household decision-making associated with cooking stove choice in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The study found that, with the exception of price and usage cost factors for the high wealth group, the product-specific factors that were investigated significantly affect stove and fuel choices. The relative strength of factors was assessed in terms of Marginal Willingness to Pay and provides some evidence that consumer preference for higher quality fuels and stoves tends to increase with increasing wealth.
R22|Hedonic house prices and spatial quantile regression|Despite its long history, hedonic pricing for housing valuation remains an active research area, and applications of new estimation methods continually push research frontiers. However, housing studies regarding Chinese cities are limited because of the short history of China’s free housing market. Such studies may, nonetheless, provide new insights given the nation’s current transitional stage of economic development. Therefore, this research makes use of publicly accessible sources to construct a new micro-dataset for an emerging Chinese city, Changsha, and it incorporates quantile regression with spatial econometric modeling to examine how implicit prices of housing characteristics may vary across the conditional distribution of house prices. Substantial variations are found, and the intuitions and implications are discussed. Additionally, the spatial dependence exhibits a U-shape pattern. The dependence is strong in the upper and lower parts of the response distribution, but it is little in the medium range.
R22|Why Do Landlords Include Utilities in Rent? Evidence from the 2000 Housing Discrimination Study (HDS) and the 2002 American Housing Survey (AHS)|This study assesses the decision to include utilities in the rent and the effect of this decision on rents. We utilize individual house-level data from the 2000 Housing Discrimination Study (HDS) and 2002 American Housing Survey (AHS), and determine that the cost of meter installation is not the only reason that utility costs are included in rent. We find evidence that landlords include utilities in the rent to attract more customers. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that utility inclusion behavior differs significantly between old and new building owners. For the hedonic rent estimation, we find that the decision to include the cost of utilities in the rent raises rent.
R22|Household Engel curve analysis for food, Beijing, China|Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the income sensitivity of food consumption in Beijing, China, using an original household survey data set collected by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Design/methodology/approach - An Engel curve model is fit to the household data of nine food categories and 35 food items, and both conditional and unconditional expenditure elasticities of demand are calculated and reported for the nine food groups and the 35 food items. Findings - Working's model fits the data well, and the elasticity estimates are all reasonable in terms of economic theory, size and signs. The results indicate a relative large range in income sensitivity among the nine food groups and 35 food items in response to changes in household food expenditure levels. Originality/value - The research analyzes unique and rich urban household survey data collected by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and is the most comprehensive analysis to date in terms of the number of food items studied for which expenditure elasticities are calculated. These elasticities may be used to study household food consumption patterns, to calculate caloric or nutrient elasticities, to study obesity in China, to study policy prescriptions in terms of taxes and subsidies on food, to infer welfare and affluence, and may be used as inputs into econometric models such as those used by the World Bank, IFPRI, and others.
R22|Impacts of urbanization on national residential energy use and CO2 emissions: Evidence from low-, middle- and high-income countries| Despite several previous studies, the potential differential impact of urbanization on energy consumption and CO2 emissions across stages of development has rarely been investigated. This paper attempts to fill this knowledge gap by examining the influence of urbanization on national residential energy use and emissions in low-, middle- and high-income countries. Using the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT) model and a sample of 88 countries for the period 1975?2005, interestingly, the results suggest that urbanization decreases residential energy use in the low-income countries, while it increases residential energy use in the high-income countries. In the middle-income countries, household energy consumption first falls and then rises with urbanization with a turning point at about 70%. Conversely, based on a sample of 80 countries over the same period, this study shows that urbanization increases residential emissions in the low- and middle-income countries, whereas the residential emissions of the high-income countries rise initially and decline subsequently with urbanization with a turning point at around 66%. These findings imply that urbanization brings with it both costs and benefits. These tradeoffs should be considered in future discussions of global energy and climate change policies.
R22|Public perceptions of earthquake risk and its impact on land pricing: The case of the Uemachi fault line in Japan|In this paper, we explore how asset pricing reflects public perceptions of earthquake risk using officially appraised prices of land situated along the Uemachi fault, lying along a north-south axis in the east of Osaka prefecture in Japan. We find that active fault risk has been included significantly in land pricing, only since residents and even policymakers first realized considerable earthquake risk involved in the land along the Uemachi fault by observing that in January 1995, the earthquake driven by the Rokko-Awaji fault had catastrophic damages on the southern part of Hyogo prefecture. We estimate that nonresidential land prices along the Uemachi fault are discounted by 4 percent for every 100 meters closer to the fault line.
R22|Distributional Effects of Lower Food Prices in a Rich Country|Controlling for differences in taxes and transportation costs, the Nordic Competition Authorities claims, in a report from 2005, that food prices are 11% higher in Sweden compared to the EU-15 countries. One explanation for this put forward in the report is the limited competition on this market which suggests there to be a potential for lower food prices. This paper focuses on distributional effects of a price decrease on food. Based on a simple model of household utility, the households demand for food is derived and estimated. Price and income elasticities for different income groups are then calculated based on these parameter estimates. Our results suggest that food is a normal good with an average income elasticity of approximately 0.18 and a price elasticity of 0.45. In addition, and of importance from a policy perspective, the results indicate the income elasticity to differ across income groups while price elasticities are constant.

R22|The impact of climate change on electricity demand in the Australian national electricity market|This paper aims to identify climate change adaptation issues in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) by assessing the robustness of the institutional arrangements that support effective adaptation from the demand side. This paper finds that three major factors are hindering or are required for adaptation to climate change: institutional fragmentation both economically and politically; distorted transmission and distribution investment deferment mechanisms; and failure to model and to treat the NEM as a node based entity rather than state based. Proposed solutions to the three factors are discussed. These proposed solutions are tested and examined in forthcoming reports.
R22|Reviewing the climate change adaptation readiness of the Australian national electricity market institutions|This paper aims to identify climate change adaptation issues in the Australian National Electricity Market by assessing the robustness of the institutional arrangements that support effective adaptation. The paper finds that three major factors are hindering or are required for adaptation to climate change: institutional fragmentation both economically and politically; distorted transmission and distribution investment deferment mechanisms; and lacking mechanisms to develop a diversified energy portfolio. Proposed solutions to the three factors are discussed. These proposed solutions are tested and examined in forthcoming reports.
R22|Feed-in tariffs for promoting solar PV: progressing from dynamic to allocative efficiency|The International Energy Association has observed that nearly all countries now offer or are planning feed-in tariffs (FiTs) for solar PV but debate has shifted from ‘if or how to implement a FiT’ to ‘how to move to a self-sustaining market post FiT’. The aim of this paper is to explain how a sustainable FiT can be designed for residential solar PV installations, focusing on the case of ‘solar rich’ Australia. Solar PV is approaching price parity at the retail level where the electricity price charged includes both transmission and distribution costs, in addition to the wholesale price. So the economic rationale for paying a FiT premium above market rates to achieve dynamic efficiency is no longer warranted. Socially, FiTs can be a problem because they tend to exacerbate social inequality by providing a transfer of wealth from poorer to richer households. Environmentally, FiTs can also fall short of their full potential to cut emissions if they lack ‘time of day’ price signals that reflect movements in the wholesale price. In this paper, we provide a framework in which a sustainable FiT can be designed that positively addresses all three areas of concern: social, environmental and economic. This framework identifies the market failures that exist in the residential solar PV electricity market, which include exacerbating inequity, poorly targeting myopic investment behaviour, inadequate transmission and distribution investment deferment price signals and inappropriate infant industry assistance. We argue that these market failures require addressing before the market can operate in an allocatively efficient manner. The sustainable FiT that we propose would lead to improvements in environmental, social and economic factors. The resultant transmission and distribution investment deferment would meet both environmental and economic objectives. Directly providing finance for solar PV installations would address both social equity and investment myopia. We argue that introducing appropriate pricing signals for solar PV installations via would be in the ongoing interest of all stakeholders. It is time to progress from FiTs focused on dynamics efficiency to a sustainable FiT that emphasises allocative efficiency as an explicit goal.
R22|Automobile Usage and Urban Rail Transit Expansion|Using individual travel diary data collected before and after the rail transit coverage expansion in urban Beijing, this paper estimates the impact of rail accessibility improvement on the usage of rail transit, automobiles, buses, walking, and bicycling, measured as percent distance traveled by each mode in an individual trip. My results indicate that the average rail transit usage significantly increased, by 98.3% for commuters residing in the zones where the distances to the nearest station decreased because of the expansion, relative to commuters in the zones where the distances did not change. I also find that auto usage significantly decreased, by 19.8%, while the impact on bus usage was small and not statistically significant. Average walking and bicycling distance (combined) increased by 11.8%, indicating that walking and bicycling are complements to urban rail transit, instead of substitutes. Furthermore, I find that estimated changes in auto usage and rail transit usage vary significantly with auto ownership and income.
R22|El consumo de productos lácteos en España, 1950-2010|This paper, a case study of the great transformations undergone by food consumption patterns in Spain since c. 1950, reconstructs the evolution of the consumption of milk and milk derivatives. The paper homogenizes and triangulates the information given by several statistical sources, which use different methodologies and cover different periods. This information is combined with qualitative material. Milk consumption grew rapidly during the first half of the period and, after a phase of stagnation, started to decrease in the last years of the twentieth century. On the contrary, the consumption of (an increasing variety of) milk derivatives grew steadily throughout the whole of the period. The contrast between the respective trajectories of milk and its derivatives underlines the relevant role played by the elaboration and diversification of foodstuffs in the shaping of consumption patterns.
R22|The Effects of Population Ageing on Private Consumption — A Simulation for Austria Based on Household Data up to 2050|The level, as well as the structure of private consumption, is influenced by the age structure of the population. This is shown for Austria in the first part of the paper. Age-specific saving rates and consumption patterns on national and regional levels are identified through an analysis of household data of the Austrian consumer budget survey. In a second step, the gained data is used to simulate the future development of the private saving rate and consumption structure in Austria, based on the population projections up to 2050. According to the simulation results, an increase in the private saving rate is to be expected on a national, as well as on a regional level, due to the changing shares of age groups. Furthermore, consumption goods and services in the field of transport will lose significance in favour of expenditures for housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, food and non-alcoholic beverages, as well as health products and services.

R22|Repeat Buying Behavior for Ornamental Plants: A Consumer Profile| This paper used an electronic survey conducted in Texas to study the main factors affecting the frequency of purchase, measured in transactions per month, for ornamental plants. While we found several differences in demographic characteristics of respondents, the two major factors impacting the frequency of buying for ornamental plants were the purpose of the purchase (self use vs. gifts) and seasonality. Respondents with a college degree in the older age groups, and higher income levels had a lower frequency of buying while individuals with medium income levels increase frequency of buying. Several ornamental plant attributes were also included in the analysis.
R22|Predicting aggregate food consumption for a specific geographic area: an application to southeast Minnesota| This thesis develops a framework for estimating food expenditures for a variety of U.S. communities, including regions, states counties and metropolitan areas. The framework is then illustrated by providing estimates of household expenditures for 19 food categories at the national level, in the Twin Cities metropolitan area and in the Southeastern Minnesota area. First household characteristics are related to food expenditures using Consumer Expenditure Survey Data (CEX); then expenditures are aggregated at the community level by applying household demographic profiles from American Community Survey data to the estimations from Consumer Expenditure Survey data. This research is distinctive because (1) it suggests a general and universal model for forecasting food expenditure patterns at almost any regional level; and (2) it provides a good estimation of food expenditure to match with current foodshed analysis. The regression results present a comprehensive relationship between demographic factors and consumer expenditures on 19 food categories. Findings also show that household purchasing patterns are significantly different across regions and that it is not accurate to use average CEX results for the nation to estimate aggregate expenditure by households in a particular locale.
R22|Expert opinion and cuisine reputation in the market for restaurant meals| As food is an experience good, the market for restaurant meals is a market where the cost of acquiring information regarding quality is relatively high. In such markets consumers often turn to reputation measures to guide purchase decisions. As Australia does not have a longstanding cuisine style of its own, and given Australia has been open to substantial immigration inflows since federation, it represents an especially appropriate market to study regarding the impact of individual restaurant reputation and collective cuisine reputation on meal prices. The following study uses the hedonic price approach to investigate the implicit price of individual reputation indicators, cuisine type reputation indicators, and other objective indicators in the market for restaurant meals. The empirical findings presented suggest that both individual restaurant reputation and cuisine type reputation are important. Other important factors are shown to include the quality of the restaurant wine list, the availability of private dining rooms, and whether or not there is an outdoor dining option.
R22|Participation in environmental organizations: an empirical analysis|The literature on volunteering has increased over the last few years. However, despite the importance of active environmental participation for solving public good and externality problems, there is still a lack of substantial empirical evidence regarding several interesting factors that influence this form of volunteering. This empirical study investigates the area by analyzing a cross-section of individuals from 38 countries using micro-data from wave III of the World Values Survey (1995–1997). The results suggest that individuals' active participation in environmental organizations is related not only to socioeconomic factors but also to political interest. We also find that a higher level of corruption is related to participation in environmental organizations. However, the situation is different for transition countries in which there was a collapse of institutional structures. The energy required to negotiate the ensuing chaos may have crowded out other forms of engagement.
R22|Change in energy performance as a result of a R422D retrofit: An experimental analysis for a vapor compression refrigeration plant for a walk-in cooler|In this paper, the energy performance of a walk-in cooler working with R22 and its substitute R422D are experimentally studied. The experimental investigation was carried out considering three different operating conditions; in particular, the AHRI standard has been used as reference for operating conditions. All tests were run at steady state conditions and keeping the external air temperature at 35°C. The experimental analysis allowed the determination of cooling capacity, the electrical power absorbed, the COP and other variables characterizing the working of the plant. The results demonstrated that the cooling capacity for R422D was lower than for R22, while the electrical power absorbed with R422D was higher than that with R22. As consequence, the COP of R422D was lower than that of R22. Furthermore, technical proposals are introduced with the aim of improving the overall performances of those plants, which could be retrofitted with R422D.
R22|Experimental performance evaluation of a vapour compression refrigerating plant when replacing R22 with alternative refrigerants|This paper presents the results of an experimental analysis comparing the performance of a vapour compression refrigerating unit operating with R22, and its performance in comparison to a new HFC fluid, substituting the former according to Regulation No 2037/2000. In particular, the plant working efficiency was first tested with R22 and then with three new HFC fluids: R417A, R422A and R422D. The investigation verified that despite the case of substitution and the advantage of being able to continue to use mineral oil as a lubricant in the compressor, the performance with the new tested fluids did not result as efficient as when using R22.
R22|Controlling households' drilling fever in France: An economic modeling approach|Using primary data collected at the national and local levels in France, this paper shows how water price increase, initially intended to generate environmental benefits through reducing water use, has produced economic incentives for households to drill their own garden boreholes. The paper first presents the results of a national survey which identifies the increasing number of garden boreholes as an issue of concern in a majority of the French counties. It then presents a microeconomic model which represents the households' decision to construct a borehole. The model is used to simulate the impact of various water pricing scenarios on tube well development and residential water demand at regional level. The paper ends with a discussion of the social impact of emerging independent supply strategies.
R22|An experimental investigation of the global environmental impact of the R22 retrofit with R422D|In recent years a new refrigerant, R422D, has been introduced as substitute of R22 for refrigeration systems. This new fluid is an easy-to-use, non-ozone-depleting HFC refrigerant and, differently from its predecessor (R407C), it is compatible with mineral oil. However, R422D has a very high GWP, and it tends to worsen the efficiency of retrofitted R22 systems. Consequently, even if R422D respects the limits of Montreal Protocol, its global environmental impact could be high. In this paper, we report an experimental analysis in terms of TEWI aimed to identify the global environmental impact of R22 systems retrofitted with R422D. For this purpose, we considered a direct expansion refrigerator for commercial applications and we investigated energy consumption with the temperature of the cold reservoir set to −5, 0, 5, 10°C. The experimental investigation confirmed that the system, when retrofitted with R422D, leads to an increase of TEWI. Therefore an optimization analysis aimed to eco-friendly scenarios was performed.
R22|Enrolment in Micro Life and Health Insurance: Evidences from Sri Lanka|Microinsurance is an emerging concept protecting households from the potentially catastrophic expenditures associated with family related shocks. Therefore, this paper presents evidence on the determinants of insurance participation using probit models on household survey data from Sri Lanka, conditional on household's microfinance institution enrolment. Further, we employ multivariate probit regressions to analyse factors affecting the participation in different types of insurance. We find that the household’s experience of a family related shock is positively associated with the participation in micro health insurance schemes under study. There is strong evidence that microinsurance has not yet succeeded in proportionately reaching the most vulnerable households. Notably, education of the household head is a strong determinant of microinsurance participation.
R22|Microfinancial Services And Risk Management: Evidences From Sri Lanka|This paper examines the importance of financial services as risk coping mechanisms in Sri Lanka, while insurance and savings products function as ex-ante, i.e., preventive, strategies for consumption smoothing, credit is typically used as an ex-post risk coping strategy. Based on household survey data, it estimates the determinants of the household¡¯s use of one, two or all three types of microfinancial services and for different combinations of financial services applying ordered probit models. There is empirical evidence that household¡¯s probability to participate in microfinancial services increases with rising self perception towards risk. Further, it depends highly on the type of risk, if a household is more or less likely to use microfinancial services, whereas the accessibility to one, two or three microfinancial services are related to the experience of specific hazards in the past. In confirmation with earlier findings, the poor are less likely to use microfinancial services than their better-off counterparts.

R22|Homeowners' Preferences for Adopting Residential Heating Systems: A Discrete Choice Analysis for Germany|Space heating accounts for a large fraction of the primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions of residential buildings. Besides targeting the insulation standard, residential heating systems (RHS) based on renewable energy sources offer the potential to reduce energy demand for space heating. Therefore, understanding the determinants of the homeowners’ adoption decisions in favor of RHS becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we analyze the influence of preferences about RHS-specific attributes on the adoption decision. Moreover, we control for the influence of socio-demographic, home and spatial characteristics. For this purpose, we specify the discrete appliance choice as a multinomial logit model. We apply the model to representative survey data for Germany. Our findings show that there are different drivers for the adoption of RHS in newly built and existing 1- and 2-family homes, and that the importance of key drivers also differs across groups of homeowners and RHS, respectively. First, we find that adopters of a gas- and oil-fired condensing boiler with solar thermal support have a strong preference for energy savings, while adopters of a heat pump or wood pellet-fired boiler prefer being more independent from fossil fuels. Second, we find preferences about RHS-specific attributes to be highly relevant for owners of newly built homes, while evidence for an influence of the control variables is scarce. Third, we find that socio-demographic, home and spatial characteristics have a higher and more differentiated impact in the case of existing homes. These variables predetermine the decision context and leave less leeway for the influence of preferences when replacing a RHS in an existing home.
R22|Homeowners' Motivation to Adopt a Residential Heating System: A Principal-Component Analysis|Heating demand accounts for a large fraction of the overall energy demand of private households in Germany. A better understanding of the adoption and diffusion of energy-efficient and renewables-based residential heating systems (RHS) is of high policy relevance, particularly against the background of climate change, security of energy supply and increasing energy prices. In this paper, we explore the multi-dimensionality of the homeowners’ motivation to decide between competing RHS. A questionnaire survey (N=2440) conducted in 2010 among homeowners who had recently installed a RHS provides the empirical foundation. Principal component analysis shows that 25 items capturing different adoption motivations can be grouped around six dimensions: (1) cost aspects, (2) general attitude towards the RHS, (3) government grant, (4) reactions to external threats (i.e. environmental or energy supply security considerations), (5) comfort considerations, and (6) influence of peers. Moreover, a cluster analysis with the identified motivational factors as segmentation variables reveals three adopter types: (1) the convenience-oriented, (2) the consequences-aware, and (3) the multilaterally-motivated RHS adopter. Finally, we show that the influence of the motivational factors on the adoption decision also differs by certain characteristics of the homeowner and features of the home.
R22|The Diffusion of Cattle Ranching and Deforestation: Prospects for a Hollow Frontier in Mexico’s Yucatán|his article investigates the behavioral drivers of pasture creation and associated implications for deforestation in a 22,000 km2 agricultural frontier spanning the base of Mexico’s southern Yucatán. After developing a theoretical model that highlights the role of social networks and information spillovers with respect to the decision to begin cattle ranching, we use household data to estimate an econometric duration model of the determinants of pasture creation. Although pasture fits well with the typical household’s resource constraints, its continued expansion contributes to a hollow frontier dynamic in which the spread of low-value cattle ranching coincides with decreasing population.

R22|Functional Ingredients and Food Choice: Results from a Choice Experiment| In this paper we present the results of a Choice Experiment (CE) conducted to examine how the inclusion of an attribute for a functional ingredient affects consumer food choice. Specifically, we examine consumer attitudes towards bread and the inclusion of a functional ingredient (eg, inulin), which can be added to bread to increase the quantity and the effectiveness of fibre in the final product A novel feature of the design of this CE was the use of Means-End-Chain analysis via semi-structured interviews to reveal key attributes to be included in the CE. In addition, the CE included the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ) so as to collect information on all participants underlying eating behaviours. Preliminary analysis of the data reveals that bread type determines choice, and that the inclusion of a functional ingredient yielded relatively small measures of value. Also, the use of a Latent Class Model reveals that there are differences in willingness-to-pay (WTP) between groups of respondents and that group membership can be partly explained by the DEBQ information. The public health implications of these findings are discussed.
R22|The Willingness to Spend on Healthcare: Evidence from Singapore| For the past few decades, the household healthcare expenditures have experienced a phenomenal growth in Singapore. This paper seeks to identify the underlying socio-economic factors that contribute towards this phenomenon by employing time series data to examine the household willingness to spend on healthcare from 1970 to 2006. The results from our log-linear regression show that the willingness to spend on healthcare is positively related to the proportion of Singapore's population who are elderly, the literacy rate, the ratio of price of other goods and services to the price of healthcare, and the establishment of Singapore's mandatory health savings plan, Medisave. In terms of their effects on the growth of Singapore's willingness to spend on healthcare, the most important factors are the ageing of the population and the increase in the literacy rate.
R22|The Economic Value Of Protecting Inventoried Roadless Areas: A Spatial Hedonic Price Study In New Mexico|The objective of this paper is to examine the off‐site benefits, as capitalized into housing values, of protecting 1.6 million acres of Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRAs) in the state of New Mexico, United States. In light of petitions filed by various U.S. states to maintain the status of IRAs as roadless lands, spatial hedonic price models are estimated and used to calculate the implicit value of IRAs in New Mexico. Findings show that a two‐stage least squares (2‐SLS), robust spatial‐lag model is the most appropriate econometric representation of the hedonic price function, and that IRA lands are a significant and positive determinant of house value. After controlling for the presence of Wilderness Areas (WAs) and other characteristics, results indicate that, on average, there is a 5.6% gain in the property value of a house from being located in, or adjacent to, a Census tract with IRAs. In the aggregate, this gain represents 3.5% of the value of all owner‐occupied units in New Mexico ($1.9 billion in capitalized value, or an annualized value in perpetuity of $95 million, assuming a 5% interest rate).

R22|Neighborhood Effects: Accomplishments And Looking Beyond Them|ABSTRACT The paper addresses the empirical significance of the social context in economic decisions. Decisions of individuals who share spatial and social milieus are likely to be interdependent, and econometric identification of social effects poses intricate data and methodological problems, including dealing with self‐selection in spatial and social groups. It uses a simple empirical framework to introduce social interactions effects at different levels of aggregation, and examines estimation problems in linear models, the impact of self‐selection and of nonlinearities. It also examines neighborhood effects in job matching and proposes a research agenda that offers new techniques and data sources.
R22|Risk Management among the Poor: The Case of Microfinancial Services|This paper argues that the level of financial services provision determines the risk management strategies among the poor. The paper estimates the determinants of the household’s use of one, two or all three types of microfinancial services applying ordered probit models and additionally probit models for combinations of them. By doing this on household survey data from Sri Lanka, there is empirical evidence that household's probability to participate in microfinancial services increases with rising self perception towards risk. Further, we find that it depends highly on the type of risk, if a household is more or less likely to use microfinancial services in Sri Lanka, whereas the accessibility to one, two or three microfinancial services is determined by the experience of specific hazards in the past. The study finds that the poor are less likely to use microfinancial services than their better off counterparts.
R22|The impact of crime on housing land prices and the effects of police boxes and voluntary groups on crime prevention in Japan|Many people now fear crime in Japan, which has had the image of being a safe country, because the crime rate has increased dramatically and the rate of crime detection has decreased at the same time. As demand for low-crime residential areas becomes stronger, low-crime rates may affect land prices in Japan. High levels of land prices may reflect the high economic value of low-crime neighborhoods. However, the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimate may cause a bias because the crime rate is not necessarily an exogenous determinant of land price. Therefore, in this study, we adopt the instrumental variable (IV) method, and use instrumental variables such as distance from police boxes and existence of voluntary anti-crime groups, and analyze the effects of property crime rates on residential land prices. The results show that a 10% decrease in the rate of burglaries causes an average rise in residential land prices of 1%.
R22|What determines credit participation and credit constraints of the poor in peri-urban areas, Vietnam?|This paper uses a novel dataset collected by the first author from peri-urban areas of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam in 2008 to examine how the poor use their loans, and factors affecting their credit participation and credit constraints. The paper finds the presence of many commercial banks in the areas does not help the poor, but the poor rely heavily on informal credit. Loans in the peri-urban areas are mainly used for non-productive purposes, which stresses the importance of consumption smoothing motives. Further, households in more rural wards have a higher probability of borrowing than more urban households, thanks to better community relationships and higher interpersonal trust. Competition by borrowing neighbours adversely affects the opportunity for borrowing in urban wards where the poor households’ borrowings rely much more on subsidized credit funds. A closer look at specified microcredit sources reveals that household behaviours differ in each market segment. Furthermore, the poor are highly credit-constrained. Wealthier households, in terms of asset holdings and phone possession, among the poor group appear less credit-constrained. However, except in the most rural part of the study area, the likelihood of credit constraints increases with distance to the nearest banks, which suggests that supply-side intervention could help in overcoming credit constraints. Overall, the poor in urban wards are more credit-constrained because of exclusion by commercial banks and weak interpersonal trust.
R22|Geographic Access and Demand in the Market for Alcohol|Policy in many regions restricts geographic access to alcohol by reducing the number of outlets where alcohol is available for purchase. In previous studies, imprecise measures of access and the lack of a theoretical framework have caused improper economic interpretations of how reducing access should affect consumer behavior. This paper makes several improvements in the study of geographic access to alcohol, employing new economic theory, new techniques for measuring access, and spatial econometric techniques. We find that although reducing access does reduce apparent per capita consumption of liquor, economic theory suggests that many alcohol-related problems are unlikely to be affected.

R22|Integrated Theoretical Framework for a Homeowner's Decision in Favor of an Innovative Residential Heating System|Insight into the homeowner’s adoption decisions in favor of a specific innovative residential heating system (RHS) helps us to understand and assess the dynamics of the adoption and diffusion of such technological systems as a “social” phenomenon. This phenomenon emerges from the individual decisions of a set of heterogeneous actors on the market. In our research, we develop an integrated theoretical framework for assessing a homeowner’s adoption decision in favor of a specific innovative RHS. Taking the theory of planned behavior (TPB) (Ajzen, 1991) and the perceived characteristics of innovations (PCI) (Moore and Benbasat, 1991) as a starting point, we propose a framework that explicitly accounts for external factors (esp. economic aspects) and personal-sphere determinants. This allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the role of a homeowner’s personal-sphere as well as of the influence of perceived economic and other external factors on the RHS adoption process. We motivate our research with background on the case of Germany. Our theoretical framework can serve as a basis for empirically researching homeowners’ adoption decisions in favor of a specific RHS and for developing a conceptual multi-agent simulation model for investigating the diffusion of RHS.

There is pointed out the role and significance of economic relations and interdependencies for the acquisition of highly urbanized territories around the world. There is also noted the inv estment attractiveness of megapolises in conditions of internationalization and globalisation. There are drawn the territorial, demographic, social and transport problems of megapolises. There is taken into consideration the impact of European urbanization processes over the socio - economic development on the territory of Republic of Bulgaria. As the basis for the analysis there are used the cross - border European transport corridors and the part European capitals play in that process. There are identified th e future urban corridors as well as the emerging tourist settlement agglomeration along the Bulgarian Black Sea coast.
R22|The Impact Of Socio-Demographic Factors And Political Perceptions On Consumer Attitudes Towards Genetically Modified Foods: An Econometric Investigation| This survey-based paper investigates the impact of socio-demographic factors, along with political perceptions, as expressed by attitudes towards globalization, on consumer attitudes towards GM foods, in Greece. Different aspects of consumer attitudes regarding GM foods are examined, such as general preference, banning, labeling, intention to purchase them at a sufficiently low price, the nutritional category of food product and the proximity of the genetic modification to the final product. Econometric analysis using Logit and Probit models was conducted. Estimates clearly show that in general, attitudes towards GM foods are not affected by socio-demographic characteristics. However, political perceptions are a significant influential factor.
R22|Padrão de consumo de alimentos no Brasil| Food purchasing in Brazil has undergone major changes in the last few decades caused by structural shifts such as urbanization, changes in demographic characteristics and increase in participation of women in the labor force. Therefore, it is necessary to identify thoroughly new consumption patterns of families, especially concerning determinants of food purchasing decision. The objective of this study was to understand the consumption pattern of Brazilian families for food products by means of a qualitative response variable model including eighteen food products using POF 2002/2003 data. The Probit model was chosen to estimate this decision. Estimation results showed that purchasing probabilities of staple foods were negative related to family monthly income, while meat, milk and other products showed a positive relation. Regional, educational and urbanization variables were also important. Households whose head is a woman have smaller purchasing probabilities in most commodities in the sample.
R22|Using Revealed and Stated Preference Data to Estimate the Demand and Consumption Benefits of Sporting Events: An Application to National Hockey League Game Trips|This paper examines the demand for hockey game trips among metropolitan and non-metropolitan residents of Alberta, Canada. Using data on both revealed and stated preference game trip behaviour from a telephone survey conducted throughout Alberta, we estimate the effect of ticket prices, team quality, arena amenities, and capacity on the latent demand for NHL hockey. We find that lower ticket prices, higher team quality and additional capacity encourage attendance. The base case consumer surplus per game is $50 for those who had attended hockey games and about 50% less for those who had not attended games. Exploiting the stated preference data, we develop a number of other consumer surplus estimates. We also include travel costs in the estimation of the demand function and estimate the full value of the game trip considering both ticket prices and travel costs. Sold out arenas in Calgary and Edmonton generate annual consumption benefits of $40 and $35 million. Considering the full price consumer surplus for the Calgary Flames of $103 per game trip, the annual consumption benefits may be as high as $82 million. Key Words: Hockey demand, revealed preference, stated preference, consumer surplus
R22|Stockholding: Does housing wealth matter?|The existence of an equity premium puzzle has been largely emphasized in the empirical literature: one observes low risky assets holding that the standard portfolio choice model (with expected and discounting utility and homothetic preferences) is not able to explain. Besides modifications of rationality assumptions, other changes have been introduced in the standard framework to account for this equity premium puzzle: the existence of transaction costs, liquidity constraints or other risks (e.g. risks associated with employment, income, health,). These background risks (i.e. risks that are unavoidable, exogenous and independent from the financial market risk) may lead households to reduce their stockownership in order to limit their global exposure to risk. Recent developments examine the role of housing on stockholding as another background risk. This paper analyses the empirical link between stockholding and housing wealth within this framework. We use the French wealth survey (Enquête Patrimoine 2004, Insee) that gives us detailed information on households portfolio, socio-demographic variables, and several measures of preference and exposition to various risks (income, unemployment, health, and business). We find that an increase in the housing to net wealth ratio crowds out stock market investment for a given total financial wealth: when facing real estate exposure to risk, households tend to moderate their global exposure to risk by limiting the share of their financial wealth invested in stocks. Among the other significant determinants of the equity premium puzzle, we emphasize the role of transaction and information costs, the attitude toward risk and the exposition to various risks in hampering investments in stocks.
R22|Savings, Credit and Insurance: Household Demand for Formal Financial Services in Rural Ghana|This paper argues that the study of the demand for financial services in developing countries leaves out part of the story, if it looks at only one of the three elements of the so called finance trinity, i.e. savings products, loans, or insurances, as is largely done in the literature. In contrast to previous research, it is assumed that households' choice for any of these services is strongly interconnected. Therefore, the paper simultaneously estimates the determinants of household demand for savings, loans and insurances by applying a multivariate probit model on household survey data from rural Ghana. On the one hand, the estimation results confirm the common finding that poorer households are less likely to participate in the formal financial sector than better off households. On the other hand, there is empirical evidence that the usage of savings products, loans and insurances does not only depend on the socio-economic status of households, but also on various other factors, such as households' risk assessment and the past exposure to shocks. In addition, trust in the providing institution and its products appear to play a key role.

It is investigated experimentally the effects of gas mixture rate, evaporator air inlet temperature (from 24 to 32Â Â°C), evaporator air mass flow rate (from 0.58 to 0.74Â kg/s), condenser air inlet temperature (from 22 to 34Â Â°C) and condenser air mass flow rate (from 0.57 to 0.73Â kg/s) on the coefficient of performance (COP) and exergetic efficiency values of vapor compression heat-pump systems. To determine the effect of the chosen parameters on the system and optimum working conditions, an experimental design method suggested by Genichi Taguchi was used. In this study, it was observed that the most effective parameters are found to be the condenser air inlet temperature for COP and exergetic efficiency.
R22|Can an Islamic model of housing finance cooperative elevate the economic status of the underprivileged?|A formal home loan is onerous to subprime borrowers in efficient markets. This can deter homeownership for financially strapped individuals, leading to a market failure. This paper proposes a special form of cooperative mortgage financing (practiced in Oman) to overcome this market failure. We integrate the literature of mortgage design with that of informal savings schemes (i.e., ROSCAs/ASCRAs) to illustrate that this mode of financing dissipates credit risk better than the formal mode of financing. It is also resilient to volatility of interest rates and allows prepayments without any additional charges. Finally, we verify the assertions of Besley et al. (1994) and Hart and Moore (1998) that cooperative mortgages are pareto-superior to formal mortgages in special cases.

This paper looks at the economic and social position of first and second generation transmigrants of Javanese origin in the north-western part of the Province of Riau, Sumatra, in the aftermath of the 1997-98 monetary crisis. The data are from two villages in a transmigration settlement area near Pasir Pangarayan, where several thousand transmigrant families were resettled during the 1980s. It is based on the findings of a study undertaken in 2001 in a transmigration area in the Province of Riau in the context of the International Labour Organization’s InFocus Programme on Socio-Economic Security “Indonesia: Improving Security After the Crises”.
R22|Examining Diet Quality and Body Mass Index in Rural Areas Using a Quantile Regression Framework|Under- and overeating (based on calories) are different problems than being under- and overweight (based on BMI); they thus require different economic prescriptions. To study these differences, I use a quantile regression method that allows an examination of covariate effects at different points in the distribution. The examination focuses on differences in rural and urban areas, and also in characteristics such as education, age, and other economic, demographic and behavior variables. Results suggest that policy in rural areas and the South must emphasize recommendations based on dietary guidelines. I also find that the characteristics typical of rural areas have a large effect regardless of the region.
R22|Factors Affecting Hospital Choice for Rural Iowa Residents|This study uses Iowa Hospital Association records related to inpatient and outpatient procedures performed at rural Iowa hospitals to examine how institutional, locational, and individual characteristics affect choice of hospitals for rural residents. The rural residents most likely to bypass their local hospitals are younger people with private outpatient insurance already living a long distance from any hospital. Complex procedures and life-threatening illnesses can reduce the probability of choosing the nearest rural hospital. Rural residents also appear less likely to bypass the nearest rural hospital for outpatient services.

R22|When skilled and unskilled labor are mobile: a new economic geography approach|This paper develops an analytically solvable new economic geography model of the ‘footloose entrepreneur’ class in which not only skilled labor is mobile, but also unskilled labor. Allowing unskilled labor to move freely between different regions increases the agglomeration incentive of skilled labor. Depending on the level of unskilled labor mobility, the geographical distribution of economic activity is either a ‘pitchfork’ or a ‘tomahawk’. If unskilled labor is very mobile, complete agglomeration is the only stable outcome. When trade costs are high, skilled and unskilled labor migration reinforce each other leading to agglomeration of both types of labor in the same region. For lower levels of trade cost, unskilled labor returns to its region of origin, whereas skilled labor remains concentrated.

El caso del segmento turístico recreativo de Alta Montaña|High mountain tourism poses a dilemma for an increasing number of those concerned due to the conflict between recreational enjoyment of the area, its economic exploitation and conservation of the fragile areas that will inevitably be affected by it. This is a particularly important issue in the Pyrenees mountains. This paper looks at the impact on the environment of High Mountain Recreational Tourism Centres (CTRAM) and the concept of sustainability. We propose ways to improve the situation, describing the nature of the relationships between the different stakeholders and their differing degrees of bargaining power when taking decisions regarding the creation of sustainable value. Within this context, participation through Social Economy has a significant role, as it encourages and increases the involvement of the local population and different agents in the process.

Se analizan tres cadenas de suministro con capacidad de producción limitada: la misma cadena de suministro tradicional estudiada por Evans y Naim, una cadena EPOS (Exchange Point of Sales) y una cadena sincronizada. Se adopta un sistema de métricas para evaluar los beneficios de los nodos de la cadena medidos en términos de estabilidad de la orden de pedido, estabilidad de los inventarios, y robustez del sistema, y en términos de beneficios para el cliente, medidos en términos de backlog. Los resultados sugieren que la saturación de la demanda en una cadena tradicional puede generar un doble riesgo"": satisfacer una demanda de mercado distorsionada y por lo tanto sobredimensionada a un coste de producción significativamente elevado. Que los efectos negativos de la capacidad limitada están significativamente reducidos en las cadenas colaborativas.""******The aim of this paper is to deepen the analysis of Evans and Naim (1) on the relationship between the limited production capacity and the Bullwhip effect, and updated according to recent configurations of collaborative supply chains.

Adopting a metrics system to assess the benefits of the nodes in the chain measured in terms of stability of the order, stability of the inventories, and robustness of the system, and in terms of benefits to the client, measured in terms of backlog. The results suggest (I) the saturation of demand in a traditional string can generate a ""double risk"": to meet a market demand and thus distorted oversized to a significantly higher cost of production. (II) the negative effects of limited capacity are significantly reduced in collaborative supply chains."
R22|Some Child Cost Estimates for South Africa|The heterogeneous demographic composition of South African households means that the way that household income or expenditure is converted into an individual-level welfare measure is likely to matter. This paper examines the monetary and time costs of the most common economic dependents in households: children. The monetary costs of children are estimated at about half those of an adult. Time costs are substantial, and borne almost exclusively by women. Estimates that incorporate time costs suggest that children’s “full costs” are about twice monetary costs alone; with household resources fixed, the average, combined expenditure and time impact of children is very similar to adding an equivalent number of adults.
R22|Performance simulation of refrigerated display cabinets operating with refrigerants R22 and R404A|This paper describes the analysis and performance comparison of a display cabinet system using refrigerant R404A and its substitute refrigerant R22. The model of the display cabinet is developed at steady state and integrated from three main component sub-models, air-cooling finned-tube evaporator, air curtain and display cabinet body. The evaporator model is built up based on the distributed method, which can simulate the heat exchangers with different circuit structures. The frost effect on the performance of the evaporator is included in the model. The correlations for the heat transfer and pressure drop calculations of both air and refrigerant sides are purposely selected in the evaporator model. In addition, the evaporator model has been validated with experimental results at steady states from published literature. Several correlated functions from the detailed numerical solution are used for the model of the air curtain. Some simplifications are also utilized for the model of display cabinet body. The performance simulation and comparison of the display cabinet using refrigerants R404A and R22 are carried out at different indoor ambient conditions especially at varied ambient air humidity to mimic the actual indoor space conditions in super stores. Some significant results such as the comparison of cooling load requirement for different refrigerant display cases have been obtained from the simulation, which can significantly contribute to the optimal cabinet design and operating analysis.

The location pattern emerging as market equilibrium is 'bubble-shaped', i.e. it features dispersion both at high and low trade costs and stable equilibria with partial and full agglomeration for intermediate levels of trade costs. We show that the market equilibrium is characterized by over-agglomeration for high trade costs and under-agglomeration for low trade costs, and we work out analytically that a net pecuniary externality is the underlying cause of this market failure. One particularly noteworthy result is that the net pecuniary externality is positive at high levels of trade freeness. However, there is no market under-agglomeration unless this positive net pecuniary externality interacts with an additional congestion force originating in the (per se efficient) competitive housing market.
R22|Commuting costs and labor force retirement|This paper studies whether the increase in home-workplace separation observed among U.S. older male workers in the last decades of the 20th century can partly account for earlier retirement. We first extend a conventional residential location-labor supply model in order to examine potential mechanisms linking commuting and retirement. After showing that, as a consequence of the urban residential equilibrium, it is possible that workers residing further from the workplace retire earlier, PSID data and an instrumental variables approach are combined in order to assess the nature and strength of the relation.
R22|Impuestos y ProtecciÃ³n Medioambiental: Un AnÃ¡lisis de las Preferencias Individuales a nivel Europeo|El presente trabajo tiene como finalidad analizar las preferencias que los individuos muestran respecto a la protecciÃ³n del medioambiente, mediante la aceptaciÃ³n de incrementos impositivos que permitan a los diferentes Estados obtener ingresos a fin de implementar polÃ­ticas de preservaciÃ³n del entorno natural. Para ello, se ha planteado la aplicaciÃ³n de modelos probit a una muestra representativa de individuos pertenecientes a diferentes paÃ­ses europeos durante la dÃ©cada de los 90, procedente de las bases de datos World Values Survey y European Values Survey. Los resultados ponen de manifiesto la influencia de factores heterogÃ©neos, tales como la educaciÃ³n, la renta, las actitudes polÃ­ticas o el capital social, identificando de esta manera los grupos sociales con mayor predisposiciÃ³n a contribuir econÃ³micamente a la conservaciÃ³n del entorno natural.
R22|Migration and Social Change: Some Conceptual Reflections|"Examining the multiple ways in which migration relates to social change is a daunting task. It requires, first of all, defining what social change is and, secondarily, delimiting the scope of analysis to certain types of migration and not others. The greatest dangers that I envision in this enterprise are, first, getting lost in generalities of the ""social change is ubiquitous"" kind and, second, attempting to cover so much terrain as to lose sight of analytic priorities and of major, as opposed to secondary, causal linkages. I seek to avoid these dangers by discussing first the concept of social change, second identifying the types of migration to be considered, and third examining the major factors that link one to another. I conclude the paper with four theoretical and methodological considerations suggested by the analysis that may guide future work in this field."
R22|Does household expenditure on education in India depend upon the returns to education?|This paper analyses whether the amount households spend on education depends upon the returns to education prevalent in the region in which they live. To this end, we estimated rates of return to education separately for boys and girls in 33 states and UTs in India. These rates of return were then included in our education expenditure model. Our results clearly indicated that the rate of return to education was highly significant in increasing the amount spent on education by the household both for boys and girls. However, we find that the impact of this variable is much larger at secondary level and for girls.
R22|The determinants of individuals' attitudes towards preventing environmental damage|This paper investigates empirically the determinants of individuals’ attitudes towards preventing environmental damage in Spain using data from the World Values Survey and European Values Survey for the periods 1990, 1995 and 1999/2000. Compared to many previous studies, we present a richer set of independent variables and found that strongly neglected variables such as political interest and social capital have a strong impact on individuals’ preferences to prevent environmental damage. An interesting aspect in our study is the ability to investigate environmental preferences over time. The results show strong differences over time. Finally, using disaggregated data for Spanish regions, we also find significant regional differences.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
R22|Household Determinants of Fuelwood Choice in Urban Ethiopia: a Case Study of Iimma Town|Fuelwood remains the primary energy to a majority of the population in Africa. However, little is known about the factors influencing its use particularly in urban centers where alternative energy sources are available. Using cross-sectional survey data from 200 households in the Jimma town of Ethiopia, this study investigates why some urban households use more fuelwood than others. Empirical results of the Tobit model reveal that the association between per capita income and per capita fuelwood consumption is non-linear and that per capita fuelwood consumption is inversely associated with family size and education of the household head. Additionally, refrigerator ownership has a significant positive effect on per capita charcoal consumption. Therefore, energy policy and development projects aimed at reducing fuelwood dependency in urban areas of Ethiopia should work not only to increase the supply of modern energy but also reduce poverty to the poor households.
R22|Wann werden Serviceleistungen nachgefragt? – Ein Mikrosimulationsmodell alternativer Ladenöffnungszeiten mit Daten der Zeitbudgeterhebung ServSim|Ziel dieser Studie ist die empirisch fundierte Untersuchung der tageszeitlichen Nachfrage nach Serviceleistungen. Datengrundlage hierfür ist die Zeitbudgeterhebung 2001/2002 des Statistischen Bundesamtes. Den Rahmen für unsere Analyse bilden die neuen Regulierungen der Ladenschlusszeiten in Deutschland. Auf eine kurze Darstellung der historischen Entwicklung und der Diskussion über die Liberalisierung folgt eine deskriptive Analyse der vorgefundenen tageszeitliche Nachfragestruktur nach Serviceleistungen. Darauf aufbauend analysieren wir mit zwei alternativen Bevölkerungsszenarien des Statistischen Bundesamtes für die Jahre 2010 und 2020 das tageszeitliche Nachfrageverhalten für wichtige sozio-ökonomische Gruppen der Gesellschaft anhand unseres neuen Mikrosimulationsmodells ServSim. Für die multivariate Erklärung der tageszeitlichen Lage der Nachfrage nach Serviceleistungen ziehen wir insbesondere ein Rare-Events-Modell heran. Sowohl die deskriptiven Ergebnisse, die mikroökonometrischen Schätzergebnisse als auch die Ergebnisse der Simulationen liefern deutliche Unterschiede im tageszeitlichen Nachfrageverhalten besonders vor dem Hintergrund sozio-ökonomischer Differenzierungen der Gesellschaft.
R22|Multi-Dimensional Analysis of Poverty in Ghana Using Fuzzy Sets Theory|The paper studies the multidimensional aspects of poverty and living conditions in Ghana. The aim is to fill the vacuum that has been left by traditional uni-dimensional measures of deprivation based on poverty lines, exclusively estimated on the basis of monetary variables such as income or consumption expenditure. It combines monetary and non-monetary, and qualitative and quantitative indicators, including housing conditions, the possession of durable goods, equivalent disposable income, and equivalent expenditure, with a number of composite human welfare measures. The study employs the fuzzy-set theoretic framework to compare levels of deprivation in Ghana over time usig micro data from the last two rounds of the Ghana Living Standard Surveys (1991/1992 and 1998/1999). The estimation results of the membership functions, depicting the levels of deprivation for the various categories of deprivation indicators, show a composite deprivation degree of 0.2137 for the whole country in 1998/99 as compared to 0.2123 in 1991/92. This deprivation trend reveals that poverty levels hard scarcely changed in Ghana. In fact, it even rose slightly during the nineties, contrary to the uni-dimensional analytical GLSS 4 report of an overall broadly favourable trend in poverty in Ghana during the 1990s.
R22|Aging, Gender and Neighbourhood Determinants of Distance Traveled: A Multilevel Analysis in the Hamilton CMA|The objective of this study is to investigate the determinants of mean trip distance traveled by different mode types. The study uses data from the Hamilton CMA in Canada, and multilevel models to investigate demographic aging factors, gender differentials, and neighbourhood attributes on distance traveled. The results of the study validate previous findings regarding the decline in distance traveled as age advances. In addition, it is found that: 1) While this effect of age is present for all modes analyzed (car-driving, car-passenger, and bus) it is considerably more marked for car-driving; 2) There are significant gender effects compounded by the interrelated factors of employment constraints, household dynamics, and greater reliance on travel modes other than car driving; and 3) Neighbourhoods with high commercial and residential mix showed a negative relation with distance traveled only in the case of car-driver.
R22|Platform Competition in Pay-TV Market|In this paper, we undertake an empirical analysis of the current Japanese pay-TV market, where cable TV carriers and CS digital satellite carriers are the main players. After examining the factors for subscribing to pay-TV and the competitive situation in the market, we have the following findings; (1) Cable TV carriers promote high value-added service provision, such as bundling internet access, and these activities result in competitive superiority over CS carriers. (2) Cable TV carriers receiving bigger investment from local governments tend to gain higher rates of subscription, although they provide smaller numbers of channels with a low charge. (3) The number of terrestrial broadcasting channels which are transmitted via pay-TV carriers can have a large impact on competitive advantage when getting subscribers in the pay-TV market.
R22|Wann werden Serviceleistungen nachgefragt? Ein Mikrosimulationsmodell alternativer Ladenöffnungszeiten mit Daten der Zeitbudgeterhebung ServSim|The objective of this study is the empirical founded analysis of the daily demand for service activities, over the hours of the day. Our microdata base consists of time-diaries of the nation wide Time Use Survey 2001/2002 of the German Federal Statistical Office. The frame for this analysis are new shopping hours regulations in Germany. After an illustration of the historical development of shopping hours in Germany and after a short discussion of the liberalization of shopping hours we describe the daily structure of the demand for service activities. We analyze the demand structure for two alternative scenarios and for important socio-economic groups of the society on the basis of our new microsimulation model ServSim. Background of these two scenarios are population projections for the years 2010 and 2020 which were conducted by the Federal Statistical Office Germany. These projections were used to adjust (reweight) the data by a 'static-aging'-approach. The multivariate explanation of the demand for service activities inconducted. The descriptive results, the microeconometric estimation outcomes and the Microsimulation results show clear distinctions of the daily demand in particular against the background of socio-economic groups of the society.
R22|Institutions and Development in Latin America: A Comparative Analysis|We review the theoretical literature on the concept of institutions and its relationship to national development, propose a definition of the concept, and advance six hypotheses about institutional adequacy and contributions to national development. We then present results of a comparative empirical study of existing institutions in three Latin American countries and examine their organizational similarities and differences. Employing the qualitative comparative method (QCA) proposed by Ragin, we then test the six hypotheses. Results converge in showing the importance of meritocracy, immunity to corruption, absence of islands of power, and proactivity in producing effective institutions. Findings strongly support Evans' theory of developmental apparatuses.
R22|Prospects for Household Borrowing in Greece and their Importance for Growth|The paper analyses the evolution of household borrowing in Greece, in an attempt to examine its importance for growth. The analysis suggests that the need to maintain household debt at sustainable levels is likely to induce a drop in the rate of growth of household debt to substantially lower levels. As implied by a simple model developed in the paper, a possible drop will cause a considerable weakening of the injection that household debt contributes to the internal demand for consumption and housing. Taking into account the restrictions Greece is faced with in the area of public spending, the possibility of such a weakening is argued to justify concerns with regard to the future prospects of domestic demand growth.
R22|Spatial Interdependence in a Metropolitan Setting| Abstract Consideration is given to the spatial structure of the metropolitan area, and to the tendency for this to be generalized in terms of the stark dichotomy of city and suburbs. Focusing on a four-zone metropolitan area, a model of spatial interaction is outlined, the components of which are based on intersectoral trade, labour mobility, and consumption-expenditure patterns. These components are drawn together as layers in an organized sequence of processes. The linked components are shown to give rise to intricate patterns of spatial interdependence. These have the effect of blurring the city–suburbs distinction, and are fundamentally different from comparable patterns at other spatial scales.
R22|Assessing the Value of Clean Air in a Developing Country: A Hedonic Price Analysis of the Jakarta Housing Market, Indonesia|This paper is motivated by the common argument that clean air is a luxury good and has much less or even no value in a less developed country. It applies a hedonic property value analysis, a method commonly used to infer the value of clean air in developed countries, using a combination of data on house values and their characteristics from the Indonesian Family Life Survey, and data of the ambient level of six different pollutants in Jakarta, Indonesia. The result suggests that air quality may affect property value in Jakarta, indicating a preference toward environmental amenities. Moreover, this study is one of the first hedonic studies that may potentially give comparable estimates of the value of clean air in developing countries.
R22|Participation in Environmental Organizations: Political Interest and State Capacity|The literature on volunteering has strongly increased in the last few years. However, there is still a lack of substantial empirical evidence about the determinants of environmental participation. This empirical study analyses a cross-section of individuals using micro-data of the World Values Survey wave III (1995-1997), covering 38 countries, to investigate this question. The results suggest that not only socio-demographic and socio-economic factors have an impact on individuals? active participation in environmental organizations, but also political attitudes. Furthermore, we observe regional differences. Interestingly, there is the tendency that environmental participation is a stronger channel for action in developing countries, where weak and dysfunctional states lead people to pursue their goals through non-governmental sector activities. We also find that a higher level of perceived corruption leads to a stronger participation in environmental organizations, which shows that individuals take action when they perceive that the government is corrupt.
R22|Crowding-out effect of tobacco expenditure and its implications on intra-household resource allocation|The aim of this paper is to examine if tobacco consumption crowds-out consumption of basic needs and whether it has implications for nutrition intake and intra-household resource allocation in developing countries. In the process we also examine whether preference over other commodities for tobacco users and non users vary significantly. Using a nationally representative household sample survey from India for the year 1999-2000, we analyze the pattern of spending on various groups of commodities by the status of tobacco consumption of households. Average per capita per diem intake of nutrients such as calorie, fat and protein were reported to be lower among the high tobacco spending group of households vis-`a-vis the no-spending category. A system of quadratic conditional Engel curves was estimated for a set of ten broad groups of commodities. Separability between tobacco and most other goods was rejected. The results suggest that tobacco consuming households had lower consumption of certain commodities such as milk, clean fuels and entertainment which has direct bearing on mostly children and female members in the household suggesting possible `gender effects' and biases in intra-household resource allocation. Tobacco spending also found to have negative effects on household nutrition intake.
R22|Diseño de un experimento de preferencias declaradas para la elección de modo de transporte urbano de pasajeros|This paper develops a stated choice experiment design which is used to build up the survey forms for the estimation of a binary logit model for urban travel demand. The model is estimated with a pilot survey, from which are calculated the values of travel time savings and the value of waiting time for taxi/remis and bus users in the city of Córdoba. The demand elasticities for each mode of transport are also estimated and the market shares for each mode are forecasted in a scenario analysis of different policies.
