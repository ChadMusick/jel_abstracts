L95|Revisiting the management of stationary fuel supply security and gas diversification in Hungary|This paper aims to assess the security of stationary fuel supply in Hungary by applying the three-dimensional approach, encompassing availability, affordability and sustainability. The main focus is on primary energy fuels in relation to electricity, but the approach is also applied, in part, to electricity itself. It is shown how select influencing factors affect the choices made from among security of supply dimensions. Although providing a source-by-source review, special attention is paid to nuclear energy and natural gas. For a long time, natural gas has been the fuel that Hungary is particularly sensitive to in terms of security of energy supply. Thus, gas diversification has become a key issue, analysed here also by using my own gas diversification scheme. I find that considerable progress has been made in this area. However, along with the 2014 decision on the construction of new units at the Paks Nuclear Power Plant (Paks II), aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in Hungarian electricity supplies, the energy agenda has changed considerably. With Paks II, Hungary’s dependence will both decrease and increase – as new types of risks emerge. In such circumstances, a Nuclear–Solar/Biomass–Natural Gas concept of the electricity mix seems to be emerging in Hungary.
L95|Assessment of the Impact on Household Welfare of Pressurized Potable Water Supply in Northern Cyprus|This paper first contains an estimation of the willingness to pay by for reliable potable water supply of households in a situation where a public water supply is available but the quality of the service is such that the water is neither reliable nor potable. This is a problem that plagues millions of households living cities in both low and middle income countries. The analysis is carried out by measuring the averting expenditures undertaken by households. Second, a cost-benefit analysis is conducted in order to measure the net benefit gained by households from investments to upgrade the existing municipal water distribution systems in Northern Cyprus so that it would be able to continuously deliver potable water to all households. It is found that average willingness to pay for reliable water supply is 22.4 TL/m3 (3.73 Euro/m3). On the basis of the economic cost-benefit analysis, we find that present value of total economic benefits of households are six times of the total investment costs of replacing all the water distribution system within the city of Famagusta. The present value of the net benefit per household is on average 23,644 TL (3,940 Euro). Each year, every household is losing 2,500 TL (416 Euro) if the completing of the rehabilitation is delayed.
L95|Integrated Investment Appraisal of Water and Sanitation Projects: A Case of Senegal Water and Sanitation Project|This study is an appraisal of a rural water and sanitation project in Senegal. The Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) done in this study employs the Integrated Investment Appraisal Approach (IIA) which typically includes the financial, economic, stakeholder and risk analyses of the project. The impacts on all major stakeholders are quantified. Senegal’s water supply coverage was 75 percent in 2004. Of the 75 percent of the total population. 64 percent of the rural population is covered, and 90 percent of the urban population has access to water. In the case of sanitation, however, with only 33 percent coverage of the entire population of Senegal. To further improve the water and sanitation sector of Senegal, especially in the rural areas, the African Development Bank (AfDB) decided to intervene with a series of engagements. This study is the appraisal of the first phase of the African Development Bank’s (AfDB) engagement in the rural water and sanitation in Senegal. This initiative is directed towards ensuring that Senegal reaches its millennium development goals. The intervention is structured such that addresses the needs of both the water supply and sanitation infrastructure.
L95|Management Efficiency Evaluation of Water Supply Systems in North-Eastern Region of Thailand|This paper presents key findings of a comprehensive research aimed at evaluating the management efficiency of water resources and water supply systems in Thailand. The study was carried out in 4 North-Eastern provinces: Nakhon Ratchasima, Chaiyaphum, Surin, and Buri Ram. Four management aspects were examined, namely water resource, water quality, health risk, and engineering. Twenty-seven village water supply systems (VWSSs) and ten city water supply systems (CWSSs) were systematically selected and investigated. The 2 groups represent small systems in rural areas and big systems in city areas, respectively. Water samples were collected once in the rainy season and another in the dry season. For VWSSs, results indicated that 7 reservoir-using systems would have insufficient raw water ranging from 6 - 12 months per year in the next 20 years. Treated water from both surface-water and groundwater VWSSs, in some cases, had color, fecal coliform, and total coliform values which exceed drinking water standards; and had less than 0.02 mg/L residual chlorine, indicating lack of disinfection protection. Multi-route risk assessment revealed several cases of total cancer risk values higher than 10-6, though the HI values seemed to indicate no risk of concern. Evaluation of the engineering aspect predicted that 44% of the plants would have inadequate treatment capacity in the long-run. For CWSSs, it was found that most of the raw water resources ? large reservoirs and major rivers ? can accommodate the future water needs in the next 20 years. Most plants also have the capability to reserve excess water for usage in the dry season and have adequate reservoir sizes. A few water quality parameters were not conforming with standard, e.g. color, iron, and residual chlorine, which could be due to inappropriate operating condition. The health risk study revealed that the THMs levels were within the drinking water standards but the health risk was high in certain cases. On the other hand, the heavy metals were within standards and acceptable risk level. Most of CWSSs have a successful and efficient operation due to the appropriate structure of the organization and knowledgeable plant operators. Some plants, however, have high electricity cost which leads to loss of money in the operation. Comparison of VWSSs and CWSSs results help to understand their current management situation and discrepancy. The research outcomes are beneficial to water supply plant operators and administrators in rural and urban areas and can support relevant parties in management improvement.
L95|A modelling approach for the German gas grid using highly resolved spatial, temporal and sectoral data (GAMAMOD-DE)|Natural gas is the fossil fuel with lowest CO2-emissions, compared to coal, lignite or oil. Regarding the ongoing energy transition in Germany, the extend usage of natural gas provide advantages that might be built a bridge to a low carbon energy system until 2050. Against this backdrop, this paper introduces a model for the German natural gas market (GAMAMOD-DE) with focus on infrastructure utilisation. Following a linear optimization approach, the model considers a highly resolved grid structure of pipelines, storages and cross-border connections to neighbouring countries. The spatial and temporal resolved gas demand is divided into three different sectors: industry, heating and electricity. An application for the year 2012 shows the performance and validation of the proposed model. Results show the utilisation of infrastructure and enable an assessment of the level of security of supply during the considered time frame. In addition, the findings suggest that although European customers suffered on cold winter days in 2012, from a system part of view, the security of supply (SoS) was always ensured. Further research should focus on analysing SoS and resilience of gas networks in the mid- and long-term, especially when sector coupling between electricity and gas is far advanced.
L95|Do economic regulatory agencies matter to private-sector involvement in water utilities in developing countries?|This paper suggests that, for developing countries, the creation of economic regulatory agencies, separate from the ministry in charge of water and sanitation, may not be a necessary or sufficient condition to stimulate large scale private involvement (PPPs) in the sector. The odds of an impact are higher for Latin American countries than other regions and for countries with higher income levels. They are also better when inflation is high. At the margin, the odds are unrelated to the contract type, except for greenfield projects, for which they may be contraindicated.
L95|Water Tariffs and Consumers' Inaction|We study adoption by more than 150,000 households of an optional transitional water tariff implemented in the South-East of England in conjunction with an universal metering pro-gramme. We document how inertia leads customers to relinquish substantial financial gains, with less than a third of customers who would benefit from adopting the transitional tariff actually doing so. We also show how households responds not only to overall gains, but also to more short-term gains from adopting the tariff. Households in high income/high education neighbourhoods display a higher responsiveness to potential savings, as do households where the contract holder is of prime age instead of being more senior or junior. Finally, the probability of adoption is positively impacted by adoption by neighbours, thus suggesting the presence of peer effects. We also look at the timing of the call, showing how most customers choose to call early on, when less information is available, but the issue is more prominent. The choice of when to call is consistent with customers taking into account the option value of waiting, as well as future consumption patterns.

L95|Utilities Governance, Incentives, and Performance: Evidence from the Water Sector in India|Network utilities across the world are subject to regulation and political scrutiny. In developing countries, managing the trade-offs between socioeconomic and environmental objectives in public water and energy utilities is particularly challenging. These industries share important underlying technical and economic features. Therefore, many economic, governance, and policy lessons are transferable across these sectors. In India, the water sector suffers from mounting financial losses, lack of access, and poor quality of service. There is a dearth of literature on the multi-faceted nature of utility performance related to water utilities. We examine the socioeconomic and environmental aspects of urban water supply in India. We use a stochastic frontier analysis approach and distance functions to analyse the performance of 304 urban water supply utilities in three Indian states during the period 2010-2015. The results suggest that incentive-based economic reform and regulation would help the utilities improve their performance. More specifically measures to improve cost recovery, billing efficiency and reduce losses would help the utilities to enhance service delivery, expand coverage and induce efficiency in the sector. The results also show the dependence of water utilities on groundwater sources which is unsustainable in the long run. We highlight the need for designing economic incentives to improve the performance of utilities and enable them to achieve social and sustainability objectives.

L95|Security of energy supply and gas diversification in Poland|Poland entered the twenty-first century with an unsustainable energy/electricity mix, strongly over-dependent on coal. This situation seems to be changing very slowly, while there are multiple factors that make it imperative for the issue to be urgently addressed. On the one hand, this paper aims to assess the security of the stationary fuel supply by applying the conventional three-dimensional approach, encompassing availability, affordability and sustainability. On the other, we plan to use our own scheme to analyse gas diversification (Weiner, 2017: 6), i.e. a fuel which, alongside coal, is a very sensitive issue linked to the security of the Polish electric power fuel supply. We demonstrate that the three-dimensional approach is also appropriate for addressing the issue of supply security in the case of a country with a securitized energy agenda based on fears of problems with the availability and affordability of Russian gas supplies. It also highlights Poland’s concern over foreign technological reliance regarding renewables production. We show how the energy perspective, the institutional context, as well as perceptions regarding threat, dependence and Russia influence choices made from among different security of supply dimensions. We find that though the role of coal will surely decrease, there is great uncertainty about Poland’s energy policy and security of supply because of deficiencies in infrastructure and the unknown future role of the particular fuels in the energy/electricity mix, also expected to include nuclear. We can observe that every energy policy step possible is being taken to maintain the role of coal, and Poland moves toward sustainability only as much and as soon as it is required by its EU membership. Not only does the coal industry capture Poland’s energy policy, but also geopolitical considerations cement reliance on coal, providing low energy import dependence. Regarding gas, we find that since the January 2009 Russian–Ukrainian gas crisis, Poland has taken action to diversify its gas supplies, and it has finally achieved results, but there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding Russian gas imports.
L95|Estimating Urban Water Demand Elasticities using Regression Discontinuity: A Case of Tangerang Regency, Indonesia|We estimate the effect of water tariff adjustment in Tangerang city, Indonesia in November 2014 on monthly water consumption. Due to typical water-block pricing strategy, estimating water demand elasticities are likely to be complex. A unique panel monthly water consumption dataset at consumer level in Tangerang regency covering the period of January 2011â€“September 2016 is used. Using regression discontinuity framework, we find a 13% average tariff increase reduces 4% household water consumption on average. Further, our estimates suggest the tariff adjustment provides no effects on high-income households, industrial, and commercial consumers. We also find more elastic response of water consumption in short-run period than in long-run.
L95|Does Indonesiaâ€™s Macroeconomic Work Well Towards the Political Year?|This paper utilizes the timeframe of 2014â€“2018 as the period with some of the global underperformed macroeconomic indicators. This paper found that in late 2016, Indonesiaâ€™s macroeconomic indicators started shown some improvements that keep real and monetary sectorâ€™s equilibrium to be stable. This paper observes the external balance of current account, exchange rate stability, inflation and interest rate as well as consumption patterns, saving-investment gap, fiscal discipline and fiscal sustainability. It analyses the government expenditure multiplier, real and monetary sector stability and institutional coordination between fiscal authority, monetary authority, and financial service authority. Real sector improvements which have been rolling since 2017 has significantly contributed to the recent Indonesiaâ€™s macroeconomic stability. Technically, if all on the track, this will sustain during the upcoming political year of 2019.
L95|Convergence of European natural gas prices|Over the period 2015-2050 the consumption of natural gas of European OECD countries is expected to grow more than the consumption of any other energy source. Although these countries are interconnected and in most cases share a common currency, their wholesale national gas markets are highly heterogeneous. We study the determinants of cross-country convergence of natural gas prices for industrial consumers in fourteen European countries. Our empirical analysis is based on the notions of pairwise, relative and convergence. We show that there is evidence of pairwise price convergence and that some key characteristics of gas markets, such as the maturity of trading hubs and the degree of interconnection, are positively associated with the existence of a convergence process. This result carries over to the notion of sigma-convergence and is robust to a number of changes in the implementation of the statistical tests. The analysis of relative convergence points to the existence of price-growth convergence, while price-level convergence is not supported by the data. Lastly, we assess the the short-run implications of price convergence focusing on the speed of reversion to equilibrium after a system-wide shocks hits the cointegrating relation.
L95|Shock Value: Bill Smoothing and Energy Price Pass-Through|"Energy prices are volatile, affect every consumer and industry in the economy, and are impacted by regulations including gas taxes and carbon pricing. Like the pass-through literature in general, the growing energy pass-through literature focuses on marginal prices. However, multi-part pricing is common in energy retail pricing. I examine the retail natural gas market, showing that while marginal prices exhibit full or nearly full pass-through, fixed fees exhibit negative pass-through. This is consistent with the stated desire by utilities and regulators to prevent ""bill shock."" I discuss implications for pass-through estimation and for proposed alternative pricing structures for regulated utilities."
L95|Peer Effects in Water Conservation: Evidence from Consumer Migration|Social interactions are widely understood to influence consumer decisions in many choice settings. This paper identifies causal peer effects in water conservation during the growing season, utilizing variation from consumer migration. We use machine learning to classify high-resolution remote sensing images to provide evidence that conversion to dry landscaping underpins the peer effects in water consumption. We also provide evidence that without a price signal, peer effects are muted, demonstrating a complementarity between information transmission and prices. These results inform water use policy in many areas of the world threatened by recurring drought conditions.

L95|The Influence Of Regulation And The Operational Environment On Chinese Urban Water Utilities| China is currently facing water scarcity issues, which can partially be relieved with improvements in efficiency in its urban water supply sector. Using a manually collected utility-level dataset for 2009-2013, we examine the regulatory context and performance of Chinese urban water utilities, taking into account their operational environment. Our main findings are that: (1) an increase in the number of non-technical staff does not increase output levels, while an increase in the number of technical staff, length of pipe or electricity usage can increase output; (2) customer density and non-household user rates are associated with lower levels of inefficiency (or higher levels of measured efficiency), while outsourcing staff rate, non-revenue water rate, and average piped water pressure do not significantly affect efficiency. These results suggest that Chinese urban water utilities can be improved through performance-based regulation and incentives that take into account the operational environment of utilities.
L95|The CMA's assessment of customer detriment in the GB retail energy market|The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has recently investigated the GB energy market and found an Adverse Effect on Competition (AEC) in the retail market for domestic (residential) customers. It estimated the associated customer detriment to be an average of £1.4 billion per year over 2012-15, rising to almost £2 billion in 2015. Citing these figures, the Government has introduced a Bill to require the energy regulator Ofgem to impose a price cap on most domestic energy tariffs. The CMA’s calculation is unprecedented with respect to its nature, magnitude and policy impact. It has implications for the conduct of competition policy and beyond. This paper seeks to understand and appraise the nature of this calculation, and to question whether it is appropriate as a basis for future policy.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

L95|Nuclear Power in the Twenty-First Century: An Assessment (Part I)|Nuclear power was one of the most important discoveries of the twentieth century, and it continues to play an important role in twenty-first century discussions about the future energy mix, climate change, innovation, proliferation, geopolitics, and many other crucial policy topics. This paper addresses some key issues around the emergence of nuclear power in the twentieth century and perspectives going forward in the twenty-first, including questions of economics and competitiveness, the strategic choices of the nuclear superpowers and countries that plan to either phase out or start using nuclear power, to the diffusion of nuclear technologies and the emergence of regional nuclear conflicts in the “second nuclear age”. The starting point for our hypothesis is the observation that nuclear power was originally developed for military purposes as the “daughter of science and warfare” (Lévêque 2014, 212), whereas civilian uses such as medical applications and electricity generation emerged later as by-products. Based upon this observation, we interpret the nuclear industry in terms of “economies of scope”, where strategies, costs, and benefits must be assessed in the multiproduct context of military and civilian uses of nuclear power. We propose a classification of different economic perspectives on nuclear electricity generation, and confirm the consensus of the literature that on its own, nuclear power has never been an economic method of producing electricity: not a single reactor in existence today was constructed by a private investor in a competitive, market economic framework. The economics-of-scope perspective is a useful heuristic to interpret countries’ strategic choices regarding the use of nuclear power. The paper provides a survey of strategies used by the nuclear superpowers (United States, Russia, China), by countries phasing out nuclear power because they cannot benefit from economies of scope (e.g., Italy, Spain, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland), and by potential newcomers who may expect synergies between military and civilian uses (e.g., Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, perhaps one day also Japan). We conclude that the future of nuclear power in the twenty-first century must be assessed in terms of economies of scope, and that a purely “economic” analysis of nuclear electricity is insufficient to grasp the complexity of the issue; this also raises conceptual challenges for energy modelers. The paper leaves out some important questions to be addressed in a future Part II of the assessment, such as economic and technical issues of plant decommissioning, long-term storage of waste, and the potential role of nuclear energy in climate policies.
L95|Do Private Water Utilities Operators Care about Regulatory Agencies in Developing Countries ?|This paper shows that the creation of an independent regulatory agency (IRA) is often not a necessary or sufficient condition to help countries attract private participation in the operation and financing of the water and sanitation sector of developing countries. The odds of an impact are, however, significantly higher for Latin American and Caribbean countries and to a lesser extent Eastern European countries, than for any other region. Higher income levels and higher prices are also correlated with a higher effectiveness of IRAs in attracting private sector financing. The analysis of the impact on the various types of PPP contracts shows that, at the margin, IRAs are irrelevant in general, to the contract choice, except for greenfield projects for which IRAs may be counterproductive at the margin.
L95|Fuel cost uncertainty, capacity investment and price in a competitive electricity market|This paper studies the effect of natural-gas fuel cost uncertainty on capacity investment and price in a competitive electricity market. Our model has a two-stage decision process. In the first stage, an independent power producer (IPP) builds its optimal capacity, conditional on its perceived uncertainties in fuel cost and electricity demand. In the second stage, equilibrium prices and quantities are determined by IPPs competing in a Cournot market. Under the empirically reasonable assumption that per MWh fuel costs are log-normally distributed, we find that a profit-maximizing IPP increases its capacity in response to rising fuel cost volatility. Consequently, the expected profit of the IPP and expected consumer surplus increase with volatility, rejecting the hypothesis that rising fuel cost uncertainty tends to adversely affect producers and consumers. Expected consumer surplus further increases if the IPP hedges the fuel cost risk. However, the IPP's optimal strategy is not to do so. The policy implication of these results is that the government should not intervene to reduce the price volatility of a well-functioning spot market for natural gas, chiefly because such intervention can have the unintended consequence of discouraging generation investment, raising electricity prices, and harming consumers.
L95|Loss allocation in energy transmission networks|In this paper we study a cost allocation problem that is inherent to most energy networks: the allocation of losses. In particular, we study how to allocate gas losses between haulers in gas transmission networks. We discuss four allocation rules, two of them have already been in place in real networks and two others that are defined for the first time in this paper. We then present a comparative analysis of the different rules by studying their behavior with respect to a set of principles set forth by the European Union. This analysis also includes axiomatic characterizations of two of the rules. Finally, as an illustration, we apply them to the Spanish gas transmission network.
L95|Is energy efficiency capitalized into home prices? Evidence from three U.S. cities|We test for evidence that energy efficiency features are capitalized into home prices in three U.S. metropolitan areas. Using hedonic regressions and multiple matching procedures, we find that Energy Star certification is associated with higher sales prices in two of the markets: the Research Triangle region of North Carolina and Portland, Oregon. We find that local “green” certifications in Portland and in Austin, Texas, are also associated with higher prices and that the estimated price impacts are larger than those from Energy Star. Matching on observables proves to be important in some cases, reducing the estimated impacts compared with models without matching. We calculate the implied energy savings from the estimated premiums and find that, in the Research Triangle market, the Energy Star premiums approximately equal the savings that program is designed to achieve, but in Portland, the premiums are slightly greater than the program's savings due to low energy costs in the region.

L95|Global socio-technical regimes|This paper addresses the question why socio-technical transitions follow similar trajectories in various parts of the world, even though the relevant material preconditions and institutional contexts vary greatly between different countries. It takes a critical stance on the implicit methodological nationalism in transition studies’ socio-technical regime concept and proposes an alternative ‘global’ regime perspective that embraces the increasingly multi-scalar actor networks and institutional rationalities which influence transition dynamics beyond national or regional borders. By drawing on globalization theories from sociology and human geography we show that socio-technical systems often develop institutional rationalities that are diffused via international networks and thus become influential in various places around the world. In so doing, we shed light on the multi-scalar interrelatedness of institutional structures and actors in socio-technical systems and elaborate on the implications for the conceptualization of transition dynamics. The paper illustrates this with the case study of an unsuccessful transition in the Chinese water sector. Recent studies indicate that key decisions on wastewater infrastructure build-up were not only influenced by path-dependencies stemming from China’s national context, but equally (or even more critically) by an import of the dominant rationality of the water sector’s global socio-technical regime. We conclude by discussing the contours of a new research agenda around the notion of global socio-technical regimes.
L95|Integration of DERs on power systems: challenges and opportunities|The integration of large amounts of distributed energy resources (DERs) as photovoltaic solar generation, micro-cogeneration, electric vehicles, distributed storage or demand response pose new challenges and opportunities on the power sector. In this paper, we review the current trends on: i) how consumers adopting DERs can self-provide energy services and provide other services at system level, ii) what can be expected at distribution networks and how retail markets will evolve with more proactive and market engaged consumers, iii) what are the effects and integration of DERs on wholesale markets, and iv) what are the challenges that DERs pose on cybersecurity and the opportunities for improving system resilience. Several recommendations are given for achieving an efficient integration of DERs. For instance, the design of a comprehensive system of prices and charges and the elimination of existing barriers for market participation are crucial reforms to achieve a level playing field between distributed and centralized resources when providing electricity services. This paper summarizes part of the work developed under the MIT Utility of the Future study.
L95|Hedging spark spread risk with futures|This paper discusses the spark spread risk management using electricity and natural gas futures. We focus on three European markets in which the natural gas share in the fuel mix varies considerably: Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. We find that spark spread returns are partially predictable, and consequently, the Ederington and Salas (2008) minimum variance hedging approach should be applied. Hedging the spark spread is more difficult than hedging electricity and natural gas price risks with individual futures contracts. Whereas spark spread risk reduction for monthly periods produces values of between 20.05% and 48.90%, electricity and natural gas individual hedges attain reductions ranging of between 31.22% and 69.06%. Results should be of interest for agents in markets in which natural gas is part of the fuel mix in the power generation system.
L95|Managing energy supply security and gas diversification in Hungary - putting theory into practice|For a long time, gas has been the fuel that Hungary is particularly sensitive to in terms of security of energy supply; thus, gas diversification has become a key issue. However, along with the 2014 decision on the construction of new units at the Paks Nuclear Power Plant (Paks-2), the energy agenda has changed considerably. Paks-2 will have a decisive role in ensuring security of supply, and, in fact, it has already begun to perform a role in energy decisions. This paper aims to assess, on the one hand, the security of the stationary fuel supply in Hungary by applying the conventional three-dimensional approach, encompassing availability, affordability and sustainability, and, on the other, use our own gas diversification scheme to analyse the issue of gas diversification. We find that considerable progress has been made on gas diversification, and Paks-2 can also be included in our diversification scheme as a kind of sectoral diversification option. Prior to the Paks-2 decision, Hungary had followed an upward trajectory for its security of supply, despite certain negative developments. With Paks-2, Hungary’s dependence will both decrease and increase – as new types of risks emerge. There is great uncertainty about Hungary’s energy policies and security of supply, with the role of coal, gas and renewables in the energy/electricity mix still not settled. Their future is expected to be heavily dependent on political decisions rather than energy market factors, though energy market uncertainties are also high.
L95|Paying for Water in Ontario's Cities: Past, Present, and Future|Throughout much of the 20th century, water was seen as plentiful and water rates did not promote conservation. Today, water is treated as a relatively scarce resource and governments are concerned about financing new and rehabilitated infrastructure. However, most municipalities still do not set prices for water at levels that would encourage conservation, thereby allowing the overconsumption of water, and leading to increased demand for expensive infrastructure. Setting efficient prices for water, sewage collection and treatment, and stormwater runoff would include (1) multi-part pricing for water to accommodate capacity constraints, economies of scale, and peak-load demand; (2) greater use of meters and volumetric pricing for residential and commercial sewer usage; and (3) stormwater user fees based on the volume of runoff. In smaller or remote municipalities, the amalgamation, regionalization, or privatization of water and sewer systems could lead to greater efficiencies. Meanwhile, the Province should set water safety standards, coordinate water utility systems, and put in place a regulatory framework that would support necessary but unpopular increases in water rates.
L95|The Political-Economy Implications of the Transition from State-Owned to Mixed-Owned Enterprises: Evidence from the European Gas Sector|This paper analyses how the transition from State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to Mixed- Owned Enterprises (MOEs) in the European gas sector affected the European states’ ability to pursue public policy objectives. More specifically, the analysis focuses on the extent to which public and private interests can be reconciled within MOEs’ strategy. The paper suggests that the rise of profitability as the central objective for MOEs has prevented states from pursuing some, though not all, of the policy objectives that they could pursue before the transition. For example, states can no more pursue large-scale plans of economic and technological development through MOEs, or ensure consumers’ price affordability irrespective of market fluctuations. However, states may still be able to positively contribute to energy security thanks to the major shares held in MOEs, for instance by vetoing divestment from import infrastructure. The analysis suggests the need for states to devise alternative ways to pursue their objectives in the framework of national and European energy policy.
L95|Crude by Rail, Option Value, and Pipeline Investment|The U.S. shale boom has profoundly increased crude oil movements by both pipelines–the traditional mode of transportation–and railroads. This paper develops a model of how pipeline investment and railroad use are determined in equilibrium, emphasizing how railroads' flexibility allows them to compete with pipelines. We show that policies that address crude-by-rail's environmental externalities by increasing its costs should lead to large increases in pipeline investment and substitution of oil flows from rail to pipe. Similarly, we find that policies enjoining pipeline construction would cause 80-90% of the displaced oil to flow by rail instead.
L95|Crude Oil Price Differentials and Pipeline Infrastructure|Crude oil production in the United States increased by nearly 80 percent between 2008 and 2016, mostly in areas that were far from existing refining and pipeline infrastructure. The production increase led to substantial discounts for oil producers to reflect the high cost of alternative transportation methods. I show how the expansion of the crude oil pipeline network reduced oil price differentials, which fell from a mean state-level difference of $10 per barrel in 2011 to about $1 per barrel in 2016. Using data for the Permian Basin, I estimate that the elimination of pipeline constraints increased local prices by between $6 and $11 per barrel. Slightly less than 90 percent of this gain for oil producers was a transfer from existing oil refiners and shippers. Refiners did not pass on these higher costs to consumers in the form of higher gasoline prices.
L95|Natural Gas Transits and Market Power - The Case of Turkey|Turkey is a key country in order to realize the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC) due to its geographical location. However, as the main transit country within the SGC, Turkey could potentially exert market power with gas transits. Whether Turkey exerts market power or not, is crucial for an economic assessment of the SGC. Hence, the article investigates this issue quantitatively using a global partial equilibrium gas market model. An oligopolistic and a competitive supply structure in Europe in 2030 are considered in the model. If the European gas market in 2030 is characterized by an oligopolistic supply, Turkey is able to exert market power resulting in higher prices compared to competitive transits, in particular in South Eastern Europe. In a competitive market structure, however, the importance of the SGC and thus the potential of Turkish transit market power is limited.
L95|Gli incentivi allâ€™efficienza energetica nelle Gare per il Servizio di Distribuzione Gas: riflessi di Finanza Pubblica Locale|This paper provides timely and updated analysis of the role of incentives to energy efficiency, namely to investments efficiency improving, conveyed through the â€œwhite certificate systemâ€ or â€œenergy efficiency certificatesâ€ against annual obligations that fall at the expense of natural gas distributor. Are analyzed the ways of performance of the obligation to purchase and the role played in this matter by the institutional players (GME, GSE, AEEGSI, Ministry of Economic Development). The analysis is therefore developed on the subject of â€œadditional energy efficiency certificatesâ€ that competitors (bidders) in the race for the award of natural gas distribution service can offer to Municipalities hanging in â€œMinimum Territorial Areaâ€ (ATEM) and on the fallout that such minimum offer has in the â€œFinancial Planâ€ prepared by competitor in support of his offer. Finally the authors analyze some problems and critical aspects of the system and made synthetically any proposal to eliminate them.

L95|Welfare effects of unbundling under different regulatory regimes in natural gas markets|Abstract In this paper, we develop a theoretical model that enriches the literature on the pros and cons of ownership unbundling vis-à-vis lighter unbundling frameworks in the natural gas markets. For each regulatory framework, we compute equilibrium outcomes when an incumbent firm and a new entrant compete à la Cournot in the final gas market. We find that the entrant’s contracting conditions in the upstream market and the transmission tariff are key determinants of the market structure in the downstream gas market (both with ownership and with legal unbundling). We also study how the regulator must optimally set transmission tariffs in each of the two unbundling regimes. We conclude that welfare maximizing tariffs often require free access to the transmission network (in both regulatoy regimes). However, when the regulator aims at promoting the break-even of the regulated transmission system operator, the first-best tariff is unfeasible in both regimes. Hence, we study a more realistic set-up, in which the regulator’s action is constrained by the break-even of the regulated firm (the transmission system operator). In this set-up, we find that, for a given transmission tariff, final prices in the downstream market are always higher with ownership unbundling than with legal unbundling.
L95|The impact of piped water supply on household welfare|In the absence of piped water from a utility company, households rely on alternative supply from small-scale private providers. We quantify losses of wellbeing associated with using small-scale private providers instead of piped water from the utility company. We measure welfare in three dimensions: health, wealth (income), and time available for education, work, or leisure. An empirical application to Burkina Faso reveals that households' greatest welfare losses are in terms of time availability. The opportunity cost of collecting water is estimated to be 23 hours per week, which is comparable to half of a full weekly working period of an employed person. This loss is often borne by women. In terms of health and affordability of water, paradoxically, households using alternative sources of water are slightly better off.
L95|The impact of rainwater harvesting on household labor supply|This paper explores the effects of rainwater harvesting (RWH) on aggregate household labor supply in areas prone to droughts. Using a Brazilian survey on rainwater harvesting, we find that having a RWH infrastructure at the homestead increases household wellbeing through three channels: (i) a direct time allocation effect - since households spend less time fetching water from distant sources, the time saved is allocated to other productive activities; (ii) a direct input effect - since water is an essential input for agricultural households and more labor hours are available, the cistern technology may contribute to increase the household's agricultural production. Both direct effects associate the labor-saving technology with an increase in productive labor supply. Finally, there is (iii) an indirect consumption effect - as a consequence of larger production, households can exchange larger quantities of own production against market goods, further increasing the household wellbeing.
L95|An Exploration of a Strategic Competition Model for the European Union Natural Gas Market|Following Jansen et al. (2012), we examine an unconventional Cournot model of the European Union natural gas market with three major suppliers Russian Gazprom, Norwegian Statoil, and Algerian Sonatrach. To reect Russia's other strategic consideration besides profit, we incorporate a relative market share into Gazprom's objective function. We prove that when Gazprom pursues the control of market share along with profit, it will be good news for consumers but bad news for its pure profit maximising rivals. We further show that by seeking a proper market share, Gazprom can achieve the same profit of a Stackelberg leader in a simultaneous move model as in the standard sequential move leader-follower model. Compared with Jansen et al.'s, our approach makes the analysis considerably simpler and more transparent.
L95|Infrastructure and poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa: A review|This paper reviews the book 'Infrastructure and Poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa' by Antonio Estache and Quentin Wodon. The authors summarize the political debate on infrastructure policy in Africa in a very compelling and knowledgeable way and make a convincing case for pro-poor subsidies. Yet, this review points out two reservations: The evidence on the welfare enhancing benefits of infrastructure investments is less conclusive than suggested in the book. The book also misses out on the recent technological developments that enable the provision of decentralized services, which might render classical network based infrastructure partly redundant in the future.
L95|The Welfare Consequences of the 2015 California Drought Mandate: Evidence from New Results on Monthly Water Demand| In response to the severe California drought, in April 2015, Governor Jerry Brown issued an executive order mandating statewide reductions in water use. The mandate aimed to reduce the amount of water consumed statewide in urban areas by 25% from 2013 levels. The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) proposed regulatory instructions that grouped urban water utilities into nine tiers, with conservation standards ranging from 8% to 36%. In this paper we evaluate welfare losses caused by this mandate. Understanding the proposed regulation’s welfare losses requires estimating water demand. Using fixed effect models and data from 2004 to 2009 on 111 urban water utilities, an annual demand curve is estimated. The estimated demand elasticity is between -0.61 and -0.1 which is heterogeneous across the regions and seasons. In the second step, we use the estimated annual demand function to recover price elasticities for a sample of 53 urban water utilities in California, which provide water for more than 20 million customers. We considered two scenarios to calculate welfare losses in Northern and Southern California: the governor’s mandate, and a hypothetical 25% uniform cut back. The results for Northern California indicate an average welfare loss of $6,132 per acre-foot of shortage for a governor’s mandate and $4,424 for a 25% uniform shortage. In Southern California, the average estimated welfare loss is $2,113 per acre-foot of shortage for a governor’s mandate and $2,171 for a 25% uniform shortage. Results indicate the monthly household-level willingness-to-pay to avoid the governor’s mandate is $36 in Northern California and $25 in Southern California.
L95|Anatomy of Risk Premium in UK Natural Gas Futures|In many futures markets, trading is concentrated in the front contract and positions are rolled-over until the strategy horizon is attained. In this paper, a pair-wise comparison between the conventional risk premium and the accrued risk premium in rolled-over positions in the front contract is carried out for UK natural gas futures. Several novel results are obtained. Firstly, and most importantly, the accrued risk premium in rollover strategies is significatively larger than conventional risk premiums and increases with the time to delivery. Specifically, for strategy horizons between three and six months, this difference increases from 1% to 10%. Secondly, it is the first time that risk premium in day-ahead futures has been measured in this market. The average value of the day-ahead risk premium is 0.5% per day and it is statistically significant. Thirdly, all risk premiums are significantly larger and more volatile in winter. Finally, risk premium time-variation is analyzed using a regression model. It is shown that reservoirs, weather, liquidity, volatility, skewness, and seasons are able in all cases to explain between 21% and 59% of the risk premium time-variation (depending on the futures maturity and sub-period).
L95|Strategic Capacity Investment under Hold-up Threats: The Role of Contract Length and Width|This article analyzes the impact of incomplete contracts’ length on investment in a bilateral relationship. The seller has the power to set the contract terms whereas the buyer decides on the investment level, which acts as a cap on future demand. Two-part tariffs succeed at implementing the optimal investment and consumption even if commitment is limited, and the contract’s duration is irrelevant. Interestingly, this efficient solution is rendered possible by subsidies on consumption during the contract. In other terms, duration matters hugely for the contract details (the timing of transfers), not for its performance. Under certain circumstances that we discuss, linear pricing may have to be used, which leads to suboptimal investment. We show that longer contracts are less efficient, meaning that a degree of completeness (pricing width) may be strictly complementary to another one (contract length). The buyer’s surplus increases with respect to the contract duration, whereas the seller loses more in profit than the social surplus decreases. A longer contract actually protects expropriable investors rather than investment itself.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L95|Incorporating The Rural Areas’ Particularities In The Water Supply Management Systems In Romania|The existence of the safe water supply and sewerage systems, especially in the rural areas of Romania, are mandatory for the insurance of the public health. In this context, a series of Romanian regional water and sewerage services suppliers developed Total Quality Management Systems, starting with the implementation of multiple ISO standards and in response to the need for answering to high requirements, both for constant development / modernization of the infrastructure and expansions to new consumers, as for the permanent improvement of the water supply, sewerage and wastewater treatment’s quality. The Total Quality Management Systems inter-relate a series of quality components, all of them functioning in a unitary–integrated way, using specific rules and procedures for assuring the increase of the delivered services’ quality and performance. The results begin to be seen on all areas of the concerned water suppliers’ activity: from the operational field to the commercial, staff’s performance, environmental and customer care ones. one of the main fundaments of the monetary creation – aspect which is indissolubly related to the idea of evolution, more precisely, to the idea of economic development.
L95|Identifying Consumers’Profiles Concerning Residential Lighting|Reducing electricity consumption, by decreasing residential light- ing, falls in the range of measures aimed to save 20% of primary energy consump- tion in European Union, up to 2020, and further to improve energy efficiency after 2020. Public lighting and appliances is about 14 % of total electricity consump- tion, in Romania. New energy efficient lighting technologies might contribute to a substantial decreasing of household electricity consumption. Data set used to ap- ply the scientific methodology presented in the paper was gathered in a survey re- search, aiming to investigate Romanians attitude and behavior about lighting con- sumption in households. The goals of this research paper are both to identify the factors associated with the replacement of old incandescent lamps, with the new energy efficient compact fluorescent lamps and light emitting diodes, and to identi- fy Romanian typologies of consumers and the patterns of their behavior. In order to accomplish the research goals, a model of analysis, based on Cluster Analysis and Multiple Correspondence Analysis methods has been proposed in the paper.
L95|Kaum Kostenvorteile durch Unternehmenszusammenschlüsse in der Trinkwasserversorgung|With more than 6,000 water utilities, Germany’s drinking water supply industry is highly fragmented. The German Monopolies Commission has recommended a consolidation of the sector, which could lead to potential cost benefits for utilities as well as price reductions for consumers. Hardly any empirically reliable studies of the German drinking water supply exist, however—particularly with regard to market structure. The present study analyzes possible economies of scale and the impact of water utility mergers. The results indicate that mergers would be of little benefit to larger suppliers and would lead to cost savings only in special cases, which suggests that changes to the drinking water supply market structure would only play a minor role in reducing costs. As it would actually be likely to lead to drawbacks for both utilities and consumers, a total consolidation of Germany’s drinking water utilities is not advisable. Mit mehr als 6 000 Versorgungsunternehmen ist die Trinkwasserversorgung in Deutschland stark fragmentiert. Hierdurch stellen sich Fragen nach möglichen Kostenvorteilen einer Konsolidierung des Sektors und daraus resultierenden Preissenkungsmöglichkeiten für die VerbraucherInnen. In diesem Zusammenhang hat auch die Monopolkommission bereits eine Konsolidierung des Sektors empfohlen. Bislang liegen jedoch kaum empirisch belastbare Untersuchungen der deutschen Trinkwasserversorgung vor – insbesondere in Hinblick auf die Marktstruktur. Die vorliegende Studie beschäftigt sich mit der Analyse von möglichen Größeneffekten sowie den Auswirkungen von Zusammenschlüssen von Wasserversorgungsunternehmen (WVU). Die Ergebnisse deuten kaum auf Vorteile größerer Versorger hin. Zusammenschlüsse von Versorgern führen nur in Einzelfällen zu Kosteneinsparungen. Marktstrukturelle Veränderungen der Trinkwasserversorgung zum Zwecke der Kostensenkung spielen damit nur eine untergeordnete Rolle. Auf Basis dieser Studie ist die Konsolidierung der gesamten Trinkwasserversorgung Deutschlands nicht zu empfehlen, weil diese vermutlich zu Nachteilen für WVU und VerbraucherInnen führen würde.
L95|Cost Structure and Economies of Scale in German Water Supply|Potable water supply in Germany is highly fragmented. A consolidation of the industry could, therefore, lead to lower cost of water supply and price savings for the customers. In this paper we estimate a total cost function for potable water supply based on a unique sample of German water utilities observed between 2004 and 2010. Newly available data allows for a detailed cost modeling approach. Capital stocks are estimated using the Perpetual Inventory Method, while capital costs are estimated using a weighted cost of capital approach. Local water suppliers are found to have strong cost advantages compared to regional suppliers. While the results indicate strong density effects, economies of scale are only found for the smallest water utilities. Thus, the results argue against a consolidation of the industry.
L95|Geopolitical Impact on Transformation of Territorial Organization of Russian Pipeline Transport in the Post-Soviet Time|The article presents the research on transformation of territorial organization of Russian pipeline transport in the post-Soviet time, considering its relations with neighbouring countries. The research identifies general ways of such transformation: The influence of Russia’s desire to escape from the dictate of the transit countries exporting energy; the impact of Russia’s struggle for the transportation of gas and oil extracted in the Caspian Sea basin; the influence of the struggle for the transportation of oil and gas in the Asia-Pacific region. A new database including the main pipelines and sea ports in Russia, revealed correlations in the development of pipeline transport in the post-Soviet period with the development of infrastructure of the country’s sea transport. The article identifies positive changes in the transport infrastructure (construction of Russian alternative pipeline projects), which will reduce the degree of Russian dependence on relations with neighbouring countries, as well as negative changes (construction of alternative Russian pipeline projects). The attention is focused on changing geopolitical importance of neighbouring to Russia states (Turkey, Kazakhstan and China) under the influence of transformation of the country pipeline transport.
L95|Energy Imports, Geoeconomics, and Regional Coordination: The Case of Germany and Poland in the Baltic Energy System - Close Neighbours, Close(r) Cooperation?|When the Baltic Sea region is included in debates concerning European energy policy, the focus often lies on the transit of natural gas. However, this focus on gas transit is too narrow to fully grasp the region as a wider element within the complex fabric of the European energy system. This article therefore approaches the energy system of the Baltic Sea region in a holistic manner and discusses flows of natural gas, oil, coal, and electricity. Against this backdrop, the article presents and discusses the energy supply and demand situation of the Baltic Sea littoral states. Focussing strictly on the Baltic Sea region in a narrow geographical sense allows a detailed visualisation of energy flows between individual countries. From a geoeconomic perspective, the article then analyses and compares the positions of Germany and Poland in the regional energy system; furthermore, scenarios concerning the effect of Polish and German national energy policies on regional energy flows are presented and discussed. As most European countries are energy importers, this discussion focuses on the effect of national policies on energy imports and their impact on the regional energy system. Based on this discussion, the article evaluates the geoeconomic implications of these scenarios for Poland and Germany and the prospects for better aligning the two countries’ national energy policies
L95|Cross-border constraints, institutional changes and integration of the Dutch–German gas market|We evaluate the contribution of nine institutional changes to the integration of the Dutch and German gas markets. We analyse this contribution through the impact of bottlenecks in the cross-border infrastructure on the absolute value of cross-border price differences. In the period 2007–2013, the absolute value of the differences in price levels between the Dutch and the German NCG market decreased, indicating more integration. We find evidence that the improved connections within the German networks as well as between the Dutch and the German network contributed to this. The strengthening of the connections with the UK market and the Russian supply, however, had a negative effect on market integration between the Dutch and the German NCG market. The liquidity-enhancing changes within the Dutch market had a negligible effect.

L95|Marcellus Shale and structural breaks in oil and gas markets: The case of Pennsylvania|This paper first documents the rapid increase in Pennsylvania's share of U.S. natural gas production from ongoing development of the Marcellus Shale formation. It does stand to reason that the Marcellus Shale boom has made Pennsylvania natural gas production far more influential on aggregate oil and gas markets than before, but does such a differential effect appear in the data? Can we say, unequivocally, that the Marcellus Shale boom caused Pennsylvania's natural gas output to move the needle on national natural gas prices more so than before the boom occurred? These questions are investigated utilizing a threshold VAR model based on Tsay's (1998) test for unknown break points to investigate how, if at all, Pennsylvania's rapidly growing share of national natural gas production has altered the linkages between Pennsylvania's natural gas production and overall oil and gas prices. Findings indicate a structural break in the impact of Pennsylvania's natural gas production on natural gas prices occurring in early 2009, a date that matches well with the onset of the state's rapid production growth. Pre-break, there is minimal evidence that changes in Pennsylvania's production had a significant effect on the aggregate U.S. natural gas market; but when post-break data is included, an increase in Pennsylvania's production leads to a lower average national price of natural gas, which is transitory and lasts for only a few months. These results provide statistical support to the notion that Pennsylvania has become a substantial component of the U.S. natural gas market at least in the short-run.
L95|Measuring the effects of natural gas pipeline constraints on regional pricing and market integration|Natural gas pipeline capacity sets physical limits on the quantity of gas that can be moved between regions, with attendant price effects. We find support for the hypothesis of integrated regional markets. Using data on daily pipeline flows and capacities in Florida and Southern California, we estimate reduced-form price effects of capacity constraints. We find that pipeline congestion increased realized citygate prices by at least 11% over the mean in Florida and by 6% over the mean in Southern California. We attribute the difference in price effects to more binding capacity constraints in the Florida pipeline network. Our estimates provide guidance for interstate pipeline investments.
L95|Economics of U.S. natural gas exports: Should regulators limit U.S. LNG exports?|This study assesses the level and destination of U.S. LNG exports, using a global natural market model under a wide range of EMF 31 scenarios. The scenarios reflect different U.S. natural gas resource outlooks, market conditions, changing U.S. environmental regulations, and possible changes in geopolitical conditions that affect the global natural gas demand and supply. U.S. LNG exports respond to market conditions under each scenario and are free from any artificial limits. In the near-term, U.S. LNG exports are uncompetitive in the Reference case and in the long-run U.S. LNG exports are significant when U.S. natural gas resources are plentiful. However under demand shocks (increase demand in Asia) or supply shocks (reduction in Russian supplies) or persistence of oil-indexed pricing cases, U.S. LNG exports become competitive to varying degrees. U.S. exports depend not only on U.S. economics but also on how U.S. prices change relative to price changes in other regions of the world. We conclude that limiting U.S. LNG exports is inconsistent with simulated uncertainties, and it should be left to the market to determine the levels and destination of exports.
L95|Do firms sell forward for strategic reasons? An application to the wholesale market for natural gas|Cournot models of oligopolistic interaction in forward and spot markets have shown that firms may sell forward for risk-hedging reasons only, or for both risk-hedging and strategic considerations. Using data from the Dutch wholesale market for natural gas where we observe the number of players, spot and forward sales, churn rates and prices, this paper presents evidence that strategic reasons play an important role at explaining the observed firms’ hedging activity. Our test for strategic behavior is based on the theoretical relationship between the number of sellers and the incentives to sell forward: if risk-hedging is the only motive behind firms’ decision to sell forward, then hedging activity ought to decrease in the number of firms; otherwise, if strategic reasons are relevant, then firms incentives to sell forward should increase in the number of competitors.
L95|Conservation policies: Who responds to price and who responds to prescription?|The efficiency properties of price and nonprice instruments for conservation in environmental policy are well understood. However, there is little evidence comparing the effectiveness of these instruments, especially when considering water resource management. We exploit a rich panel of residential water consumption data to examine heterogeneous responses to both price and nonprice conservation policies during times of drought while controlling for unobservable household characteristics. Our empirical models suggest that among owners of detached, single-family homes in six North Carolina municipalities, relatively low-income households are more sensitive to price and relatively high-consumption households are less sensitive to price. However, prescriptive policies such as restrictions on outdoor water use result in uniform responses across income levels, while simultaneously targeting reductions from households with irrigation systems and historically high consumption.
L95|Performance of the Tunisian Water Utility: An input-distance function approach|The main objective of this paper is to analyse the performance pattern in the Tunisian drinking water industry. The industry is a state monopoly, administered by the Tunisian Water Utility (TWU) since 1968. We apply the stochastic distance frontier method to TWU data over a period of 11 years, from 1999 to 2009. This approach is used to estimate water production technology, to measure technical efficiency levels and total factor productivity growth, and to investigate the factors influencing efficiency levels and those driving productivity growth. The results suggest that performance-based regulation can improve efficiency and enhance productivity in the Tunisian water industry.
L95|Market and regulatory factors influencing smart-grid investment in Europe: Evidence from pilot projects and implications for reform|Electricity distribution system operators (DSOs) are expected to invest heavily in system innovation in the form of smart grids (SG) in order to help achieve energy policy goals. In this context, regulatory reforms to spur DSOs investments are considered a policy priority. Based on a review of the European regulatory status and using a dataset of 459 innovative SG projects, this study focuses on market and regulatory factors and performs a series of statistical tests to investigate how the different factor levels affecting SG investments in Europe. The results show that (1) lower market concentration in the electricity distribution sector (2) the use of incentive-based regulatory schemes; and (3) the adoption of innovation-stimulus mechanisms are key enablers of SG investments.
L95|Water affordability issues in developed countries – The relevance of micro approaches|In developed countries, water affordability issues are regarded as a non-significant problem. This paper analyses the prevalence of affordability problems at household level and the determinants that might affect their occurrence. From a questionnaire-based survey, Portuguese household level data are used to show that average measures can mask affordability issues for substantial proportions of the low income groups. Findings also indicate that to tackle affordability problems more successfully, special tariff schemes should consider household income, size (large families) and composition (children in poorer households).

L95|Investments in a Combined Energy Network Model: Substitution between Natural Gas and Electricity?|Natural gas plays an important role in the future development of electricity markets, as it is the least emission-intensive fossil generation option and additionally provides the needed plant operating flexibility to deal with intermittent renewable generation. As both the electricity and the natural gas market rely on networks, congestion in one market may lead to changes in the other. In addition, investment in one market impacts investment in the other market to the extent that these investments may even become substitutes for each another. The objective of this paper is to develop a dynamic model representation of coupled natural gas and electricity network markets to test the potential interaction with respect to investments. The model is tested under simplified conditions as well as for a stylized European network setting. The results indicate that there is sufficient potential for investment substitution and market interactions that warrant the application of coupled models, especially with regard to simulations of long-term system developments.
L95|Combining Energy Networks|Electricity markets depend on upstream energy markets to supply the fuels needed for generation. Since these markets rely on networks, congestion in one can quickly produce changes in another. In this paper we develop a combined partial equilibrium market model which includes the interactions of natural gas and electricity networks. We apply the model to a stylized representation of Europe’s electricity and natural gas markets to illustrate the upstream and downstream feedback effects which are not obvious on first sight. We find that both congestion and loop-flow effects in electricity markets impact prices and quantities in markets located far from the initial cause of the market changes.

L95|Finance and System of Provision of Water; The Case of Istanbul|Unlike many other metropolises around the world, water supply in Instanbul has been subject to commercial practices since the 19th century. The difference today, however, it is in the stage of a privatisation process of water resources, rather than the provision of water itself to the consumers. The role of the state at different levels still has an important and major role in the provision of water. Even if the water resources are started to be privatised, the financialisation of water provision is quite limited. That is why this paper focuses on the changing finance tools and the changing role of the state in water provision in Istanbul in a historical context.
L95|The Role of the State in Financialised Systems of Provision: Social Compacting, Social Policy, and Privatisation|This paper draws on a series of case studies to consider the Role of the State, using the systems of provision (SoP) approach where the state and market are not considered to be dichotomous entities (as in most orthodox literature). Rather, markets are organised by the state in ways that are continually evolving. Our coverage of this extensive topic has been delimited by focusing on three aspects of the role of the state. The first of these is social compacting which considers the ways in which economic, political and ideological interests relate to the state. This section considers the state’s role in representing different social interests with a declining influence of labour. The second aspect addressed here is the state’s role in social policy and the provision of basic services. The paper shows that this increasingly comes down to providing for the hard to serve while wider concerns of equity and redistribution are neglected. Finally the paper explores the role of the state in connection with privatisation. Using the empirical evidence of the case studies, the paper shows that implementation and outcomes have been diverse across sectors and countries but common strands are emerging. These sectors are far from competitive, and privatisation has created conditions for significant rent extraction in ways that were unintended at the time of privatisation
L95|Thirteen Things You Need to Know about Neoliberalism|This paper examines the theories and practices of neoliberalism drawing upon five case studies of housing and water across Poland, Portugal, South Africa, Turkey and the United Kingdom. This examination ranges across thirteen aspects of (‘things you need to know about’) neoliberalism. They include the argument that neoliberalism is not reducible to a cogent ideology or a change in economic or social policies, nor is it primarily about a shift in the relationship between the state and the market or between workers and capital in general, or finance in particular. Instead, neoliberalism is a stage in the development of capitalism underpinned by financialisation. Neoliberalism is highly diversified in its features, impact and outcomes, reflecting specific combinations of scholarship, ideology, policy and practice. In turn, these are attached to distinctive material cultures giving rise to the (variegated) neoliberalisation of everyday life and, at a further remove, to specific modalities of economic growth, volatility and crisis. Finally, this paper argues that there are alternatives, both within and beyond neoliberalism itself.
L95|Housing and Water in Light of Financialisation and “Financialisation”|This paper addresses the impact of financialisation on the systems of provision (SoPs) drawing on a series of case studies in housing and water – both non-financial sectors. In order to understand this more fully, the paper first considers some of the theoretical constructs connecting money, commodities and finance, exploring the theories of money, the extension of that theory to finance and the specification of the processes attaching finance to the non-financial. The paper shows that both case-study sectors have increasingly been subject to market forms with, for example, land markets in housing and cost recovery practices in water provision. However there are different forms of monetary relations across the case studies. Simply to equate financialisation with commodification would be misleading. The diversity of arrangements across sectors and locations is addressed in the paper by making the distinction between commodification (production for private profits), the commodity form (periodic payments for a good or service in the absence of a profit motive) and commodity calculation (application of a monetary logic without money changing hands). Each of these is associated with different forms of marketization and “market forces” but they are underpinned by different economic and social structures. The paper then goes on to tie these insights to financialisation and contemporary capitalism more generally with reference to the case studies. For housing there is variegation in the extent to which the expansion of finance coincides with expansion of material provision, as shown with for example the different outcomes from expanding lending for house production as opposed to mortgage lending for consumption. In water, there is diversity in the extent and nature of privatisation and this has led to differences in the extent and depth of financial intervention across the case studies. England and Wales lies at one extreme with heavily entrenched financialisation while this is considerably less significant in the case studies with less privatisation. The final section of this paper considers the implication of the different forms of financialisation for economic and social reproduction including gender.
L95|Social Norms and Information Diffusion in Water-saving Programs: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment in Colombia|This paper investigates direct and spillover effects of a social information campaign aimed at encouraging residential water savings in Colombia. The campaign was organized as a randomized field experiment, consisting of monthly delivery of consumption reports, including normative messages, for one year. Results indicate that social information and appeals to normbased behavior reduce water use by up to 6.8% in households directly targeted by the campaign. In addition, we find evidence of spillover effects: households that were not targeted by the campaign reduced water use by 5.8% in the first six months following the intervention. Nevertheless, neither direct nor spillover effects can be attributed to social networks for any of our chosen proxies of social and geographic proximity.
L95|The Energy Union pillars: competitiveness, security and sustainability|This research focuses on the study of energy union, from the perspective of the three pillars: competitiveness, sustainability and security. The author uses descriptive research methodology to analyze the implementation of the main objectives of energy union. The article analyzes, based on the literature in the energy field, the weaknesses and the strengths of each pillar. The study findings show the opportunities, but also the challenges that hinder the development of energy union and identify the priorities for Romania.
L95|The demand for tap water quality: Survey evidence on water hardness and aesthetic quality|We carry out a survey to provide quantitative evidence about households' demand for qualitative aspects of tap water supply. We focus on two characteristics that are of importance for households: water hardness and aesthetic quality in terms of taste, smell and appearance. Our survey administration targets a representative sample of the population in England and Wales, and aims to elicit expenditures on products that improve the overall experience with these aspects of water quality. For water hardness, we find that around 14% of households employ at least one water softener device or purchase products such as softening tablets or descaling agents. For aesthetic quality of tap water, around 39% of households report some averting behaviour, the most common being the use of filtering devices, purchase of bottled water, or addition of squash or cordial. To study how expenditures on these products vary with the level of service quality, we match household data to highly disaggregated records on regional water hardness (in mg CaCO3/l) and aesthetic quality, as measured by the regional rate of complaints. Our econometric analysis suggests that households' decision to incur averting expenditures varies with service quality in a statistically and economically significant manner, providing novel evidence that utility customers actively respond to non-health related utility service provision.
L95|Central and East European diversification under new gas market conditions|The Russo–Ukrainian gas crisis of January 2009 encouraged Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) to diversify away from Russian gas supplies and new gas market conditions have afforded some opportunities for doing so. This paper assesses these achievements, as well as factors preventing CEE countries from benefiting therefrom. The paper addresses four main areas of CEE diversification: (1) gas demand, (2) domestic gas production, (3) transit, as well as (4) gas supply and physical infrastructure for source diversification. There is great variation in the degree of dependence on gas, gas imports, Russian gas and transit countries, across the CEE states. Some progress has been made in diversifying, but the degree of progress and the patterns vary significantly from country to country. Due to long-term gas import commitments and the lack of available import capacity, CEE countries can take only limited advantage of changed gas market conditions. But some countries have genuinely benefited from ongoing developments. Transit-avoidance pipelines can also increase security of supply for CEE consumers by providing the opportunity to arbitrage across gas transit corridors. Despite many criticisms, the EU has taken steps that may help mitigate Russian influence.
L95|Innovative regulations, incomplete contracts and ownership structure in the water utilities|Abstract Using an incomplete contract framework, we analyse new forms of regulation and private participation in public services. This paper explains contractual efficiency in the absence of financially guaranteed investments in public private partnerships. The example of a number of African countries underlines how a series of national, normative law reforms can give rise to innovations in approaches to regulation. This new hybrid form of regulation, inspired by a French regulation approach combining commission regulation and franchise bidding, could be more effective than previous approaches to regulation, in the sense of being more stable and more closely aligned with stakeholder expectations. This approach to regulation would appear to be more efficient economically, while integrating the objectives of solidarity tariffs and social water access connections. Based on these analyses, our results show (1) the impact on the robustness of new lease contracts on financing constraints, and (2) the advantages of Asset Owner Companies that reconcile explicit commitments and special purposes. We demonstrate that this achieves optimum efficiency by encouraging parties to determine jointly the optimal level of costs and investment. In addition, the mechanism fosters discussion about the possibility of institutionalizing Asset Owner Companies by predetermining the distribution of risk in lease contracts.
L95|Estimating Alternative Technology Sets in Nonparametric Efficiency Analysis: Restriction Tests for Panel and Clustered Data|Nonparametric efficiency analysis has become a widely applied technique to support industrial benchmarking as well as a variety of incentive-based regulation policies. In practice such exercises are often plagued by incomplete knowledge about the correct specifications of inputs and outputs. Simar and Wilson (Commun Stat Simul Comput 30(1):159-184, 2001) and Schubert and Simar (J Prod Anal 36(1):55-69, 2011) propose restriction tests to support such specification decisions for cross-section data. However, the typical oligopolized market structure pertinent to regulation contexts often leads to low numbers of cross-section observations, rendering reliable estimation based on these tests practically unfeasible. This small-sample problem could often be avoided with the use of panel data, which would in any case require an extension of the cross-section restriction tests to handle panel data. In this paper we derive these tests. We prove the consistency of the proposed method and apply it to a sample of US natural gas transmission companies from 2003 through 2007. We find that the total quantity of natural gas delivered and natural gas delivered in peak periods measure essentially the same output. Therefore only one needs to be included. We also show that the length of mains as a measure of transportation service is non-redundant and therefore must be included.

L95|Economies of scale in Peru’s water and sanitation sector|This paper quantifies economies of scale in Peru’s water and sanitation (W&S) sector based on a five-year panel (2006–2010) that examines 39 water services providers. Our findings highlight the lack of economies of scale in the Peruvian W&S sector as a whole. Cost savings are possible through water volume increases (Economies of Production Density) and a higher provision density (Economies of Customer Density), but not via an increase in the number of served municipalities (overall Economies of Scale). Some agglomerations are possible, yielding cost reductions of up to 9 %. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016

L95|Economic and Strategic Expectations from Trans Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline Project|Following the successful implementation of the oil strategy, Azerbaijan began to define strategic objectives in relation to gas export policy. Currently, Azerbaijan is the only country in the region exporting gas to the international markets (Turkey, Russia, Georgia). For this reason, it is seen as “the provider and participant” of Southern Gas Corridor by EU. In this direction, Azerbaijan aims to be the country of an important and strategic natural gas exporter. From Shahdeniz field to the end European user, it targets to take part in the every ring of the value chain. These assumptions bring Azerbaijan to the position of a remarkable natural gas supplier for the export of large amount of gas to the European markets through Nabucco West. The implementation of the project with financial and technical capabilities of Azerbaijan and Turkey has made it a project to be realized between Turkey-Azerbaijan. TANAP means Turkey and Azerbaijan will emerge together in the European market for energy transportation. Along with Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan and Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum, TANAP has reinforced Turkey’s position as a necessary energy corridor in delivering the energy resources of the Caspian Sea to the Western markets. In this paper, expected strategic and economic outcomes of TANAP are analyzed.
L95|Achieving Efficiency in Gas Pipeline Connection: Evidence from Ghana|The demand for the use of natural gas is on the increase as an energy source. Natural gas transportation requires a continuous pipeline network from the source of gas across long distance to the various destinations. The main objective involves extending gas pipelines from Takoradi to all the regional capital towns in Ghana to meet the growing demands of its citizenry in order to provide economy and efficiency with regards to cost and environmental sustainability by developing a straight forward method of locating pipeline facilities and designing pipeline networks. The problem is formulated as a network of distances and the solution is presented based on Primâ€™s Algorithm for minimum connections. Data on distances are obtained from the Ghana Highways Authority. The total distance covered by the pipe line network if the existing road networks were used from Takoradi to all the regional capitals towns in Ghana is 5,094km. After Primâ€™s Algorithm was used, the total distance covered decreased to 1,590km which is about 68.8% reduction in the distance covered with regards to cost and the environmental damage caused by construction of pipelines (soil, forest, rivers, wetlands, noise from compressor stations during pipeline discharge and risk of pipeline leakage).
L95|Natural Gas Contract Decisions for Electric Power|Natural gas power plants can further specify their procurement contracts with pipeline distributors using a firm contract option that guarantees delivery at an additional cost. Using transaction level data from 2008-2012 we empirically test what characteristics lead to use of firm contracts and how the premium for firm contracts changes with these characteristics. Using variation in power plants technology type (combined vs. simple cycle) and electricity market structure (restructured vs. regulated), we generally find support for transaction cost theory in the data. Smaller plants, plants located in states with more variance in electricity demand, and plants in states with more inflow pipeline capacity are statistically less likely to use a firm contract. Firm contracts are on average 2.5% (14 cents per Mcf) more expensive and this premium increases as the weather is colder and the state a plant is located in has less inflow capacity.
L95|Renewal Investment in Water Infrastructure and Sustainability of Municipal Water Service Utility|This paper estimates renewal investment in aging water infrastructure to investigate the fiscal sustainability of water service utilities operated by municipalities in Japan. Specifically, we focus on the water infrastructure in Nishiwaki City, Hyogo Prefecture and estimate the past infrastructure investment and the future renewal costs, and further forecast the future balance of payment in the water utility account. The past infrastructure investment is estimated on the basis of the actual record of water supply facilities such as water pipes developed and the actual construction costs at present, and the amount of future renewal investment is estimated on the assumption that investment would be made after the end of each facility fs service life. The estimated annual amount of renewal investment during the 50 years from FY2017 to FY2065 comes to 0.9 to 1 billion yen per year. It is about three times as large as the annual average of recent infrastructure investment by Nishiwaki City from FY2009 to FY2013, which stands at 334 million yen. The result suggests that the future renewal investment will be a huge fiscal burden on this city. Assuming that earnings from water supply services will decline in the future and the present revenues structure and water service charge will not be changed, the city will run out of its accumulated funds (internal reserve funds) in the water utility account by around FY2020 and will face revenue shortfalls. In order to renew infrastructure as needed while maintaining the present water services, the city must consider countermeasures such as the integration or abolition of facilities, revision of water charges, reform of the management approach, and the possibility of covering a part of expenses by general public expenditure, as soon as possible. It is also necessary to understand that this situation is not a particular problem faced by one local city but it is common to all municipalities throughout the country.
L95|Price Regulation and Environmental Externalities: Evidence from Methane Leaks|We estimate expenditures by US natural gas distribution firms to reduce natural gas leaks. Reducing leaks averts commodity losses (valued at around $5/Mcf [thousand cubic feet]), but also climate damages ($27/Mcf) because the primary component of natural gas is methane, a potent greenhouse gas. In addition to this private/social wedge, incentives to abate are weakened by this industry’s status as a regulated natural monopoly: current price regulations allow many distribution firms to pass the cost of any leaked gas on to their customers. Our estimates imply that too little is spent repairing leaks—we estimate expenditures substantially below $5/Mcf, that is, less than the commodity value of the leaked gas. In contrast, expenditures on accelerated pipeline replacement are in general higher than the combination of gas costs and climate benefits (we estimate expenditures ranging from $48/Mcf to $211/Mcf). We conclude by relating these findings to regulatory-induced incentives in the industry.
L95|Designing Nonlinear Price Schedules for Urban Water Utilities to Balance Revenue and Conservation Goals|This paper formulates and estimates a household-level, billing-cycle water demand model under increasing block prices that accounts for the impact of monthly weather variation, the amount of vegetation on the household’s property, and customer-level heterogeneity in demand due to household demographics. The model utilizes US Census data on the distribution of household demographics in the utility’s service territory to recover the impact of these factors on water demand. An index of the amount of vegetation on the household’s property is obtained from NASA satellite data. The household-level demand models are used to compute the distribution of utility-level water demand and revenues for any possible price schedule. Knowledge of the structure of customer-level demand can be used by the utility to design nonlinear pricing plans that achieve competing revenue or water conservation goals, which is crucial for water utilities to manage increasingly uncertain water availability yet still remain financially viable. Knowledge of how these demands differ across customers based on observable household characteristics can allow the utility to reduce the utility-wide revenue or sales risk it faces for any pricing plan. Knowledge of how the structure of demand varies across customers can be used to design personalized (based on observable household demographic characteristics) increasing block price schedules to further reduce the risk the utility faces on a system-wide basis. For the utilities considered, knowledge of the customer-level demographics that predict demand differences across households reduces the uncertainty in the utility’s system-wide revenues from 70 to 96 percent. Further reductions in the uncertainty in the utility’s system-wide revenues in the, range of 5 to 15 percent, are possible by re-designing the utility’s nonlinear price schedules to minimize the revenue risk it faces given the distribution of household-level demand in its service territory.
L95|Improving transport and energy infrastructure investment in Poland|Poland has significantly upgraded its infrastructure network over the past decade. However, bottlenecks still weigh on productivity growth and environmental and health outcomes. The EU 2014-20 programming period is an opportunity to improve the management of infrastructure investment. In the transport sector, the country allocated most recent funding to roads, but it plans significant investment in railway and urban public transport in 2014-20. Strengthening metropolitan governance, building up medium-term infrastructure management capabilities and reducing funding uncertainty would ensure more efficient spending. In the energy sector, electricity generation capacity is tight, while regulatory uncertainty, administrative burdens and a lack of interregional and international trade capacity has hampered the development of renewables. The authorities are seeking to develop nuclear power, but they need to take fully into account tail risks involved and its long-term costs. More energy efficiency investment would also be valuable, as current support systems do not provide sufficient incentives. Améliorer l'investissement en infrastructures de transports et énergétiques en Pologne La Pologne a significativement renforcé son réseau d’infrastructures au cours de la dernière décennie. Cependant, des goulets pèsent toujours tant sur la croissance de la productivité que sur la santé de la population et l’environnement. La période de programmation 2014-20 de l’UE est une opportunité d’améliorer la gestion de l’investissement en infrastructures. Dans le secteur des transports, après avoir financé principalement les infrastructures routières, la Pologne prévoit de consacrer d’importants investissements aux transports ferroviaires et publics urbains entre 2014 et 2020. Une meilleure gouvernance des métropoles, des capacités accrues de gestion des infrastructures à moyen terme et une réduction de l’incertitude des financements garantiraient une plus grande efficience des dépenses. Par ailleurs, dans le secteur de l’énergie, les installations de production électrique satisfont tout juste les besoins, tandis que l’incertitude réglementaire, le poids des charges administratives et les capacités commerciales insuffisantes aux niveaux interrégional et international freinent le développement des énergies renouvelables. Les autorités cherchent à développer le nucléaire, mais elles doivent tenir pleinement compte des risques extrêmes et de ses coûts à long terme. La Pologne aurait également intérêt à investir davantage dans l’efficacité énergétique car les dispositifs de soutien actuels ne fournissent pas des incitations suffisantes.
L95|Regulations in services sectors and their impact on downstream industries: The OECD 2013 Regimpact Indicator|This document presents the new 2013 set of the OECD Regulatory Impact (REGIMPACT) indicator. It measures the impact of regulatory barriers to competition in non-manufacturing sectors on all industries, through intermediate inputs. The paper describes how the indicator is calculated and discusses a number of challenges and trade-offs when constructing the indicator. They relate to the composition of the indicator, how the slow-moving or time-invariant retail and professional services regulation data are integrated with the annual energy, transport and communication regulation (ETCR) indicator and what sector weights are used for the calculation of the REGIMPACT indicator. The document then compares the 2003, 2008 and 2013 vintages of the REGIMPACT indicator and the alternative (narrow and wide) definitions of the 2013 indicator. Finally, the paper uses sectoral data to illustrate the extent to which different vintages and alternative indicator definitions can possibly influence sector-level panel regression results for outcome variables such as productivity, investment and labour inputs. Réglementation dans les secteurs des services et leur impact sur les industries en aval : la version 2013 de l'indicateur REGIMPACT de l'OCDE Ce document présente une version révisée en 2013 de l'indicateur REGIMPACT de l'OCDE. Il mesure pour chaque industrie, l'impact des obstacles réglementaires à la concurrence, par le biais des intrants intermédiaires dans les secteurs non manufacturiers. Ce document décrit la méthodologie utilisée pour calculer cet indicateur et examine un certain nombre de défis et de compromis liés à sa construction. Ils se rapportent à la composition de l'indicateur, notamment l’intégration de séries avec peu de variation temporelle telles que l’indice de réglementation dans le commerce de détail ou les services professionnels avec les indicateurs annuels de réglementation dans les secteurs de l'énergie, du transport et des télécommunications (ETCR) ainsi qu’aux pondérations sectorielles utilisées pour le calcul de l’indicateur REGIMPACT. Le document compare ensuite les versions 2003, 2008 et 2013 de cet indicateur et les définitions alternatives (étroites et larges) de l'indicateur REGIMPACT. Enfin, le document utilise des données sectorielles pour illustrer dans quelle mesure les différentes versions et définitions peuvent éventuellement influencer les résultats de régression en données de panel au niveau sectoriel pour des variables telles que la productivité, l'investissement et l’emploi.
L95|Evaluating the effect of upside and downside slope on flow hydraulic in cylindrical overflows by using Flow 3D software|Features and behavior of flow in hydraulic structures is one of the complex phenomena. Cylindrical overflow is a simple hydraulic structure which is used for energy dissipation, control and flow measurement. Hereof the sharp, wide and climactic edges overflows are used commonly. In water transmission and distribution systems, cylindrical overflows and crest- circular overflows because of being affordable and ease of fabrication compared with other overflows can be used for measurement of flow rate, evacuation buildings of flow water and controlling the level of water in canals and reservoirs. The water flow on overflow of dams and used overflows in water supply and sewage networks are some cases that a design engineer is in contact with them.
L95|Information provision and consumer behavior: A natural experiment in billing frequency|In this study, I estimate a causal effect of increased billing frequency on consumer behavior. I exploit a natural experiment in which residential water customers switched exogenously from bimonthly to monthly billing. Customers increase consumption by 3.5–5% in response to more frequent information. This result is reconciled in models of price and quantity uncertainty, where increases in billing frequency reduce the distortion in consumer perceptions. Using treatment effects as sufficient statistics, I calculate consumer welfare gains equivalent to 0.5–1% of annual water expenditures. Heterogeneous treatment effects suggest increases in outdoor water use.
L95|Clustered into control: Causal impacts of water infrastructure failure|The causal economic impacts of water infrastructure disruptions in OECD countries are largely unknown. Using details of water main break events in Washington, DC, and hourly traffic speeds for 2,182 road segments in a quasi-experimental difference-in-difference design, we estimate the causal effect of main failure on congestion. We use k-means clustering to match treated road segments to control segments. Although precisely estimated, the magnitude of our treatment effects is economically small even when accounting for temporal traffic heterogeneity. Our results suggest that traffic concerns alone are not a justification for policy makers to alter repair strategy for distributed water infrastructure.
L95|A Model for Shale Gas Wastewater Management|Unconventional oil and gas production using hydraulic fracturing generates significant quantities of wastewater that may contain potentially harmful pollutants. The concerns associated with shale gas development necessitate an investigation of shale gas water and wastewater management using a systematic approach to make sure that shale gas development is environmentally sustainable. In this research, we adopt an integrated system analysis approach to examine the life cycle of water in the hydraulic fracturing process. Specifically, we developed a multi-objective programming model for shale gas water and wastewater management that incorporates the objectives of four types of decisionmakers: oil and gas well developers and operators, centralized wastewater treatment facility planners and operators, environmental regulators, and social planners. This paper lays out a modeling framework that can, in the future, be used for a case study of optimal shale gas water and wastewater management. It also provides directions for future expansion of the model.
L95|Forecasting Urban Water Demand in California: Rethinking Model Evaluation| Urban water managers rely heavily on forecasts of water consumption to determine management decisions and investment choices. Typical forecasts rely on simple models whose criteria for selection has little to do with their performance in predicting out-of-sample consumption levels. We demonstrate this issue by comparing forecast models selected on the basis of their ability to perform well in-sample versus out-of-sample. Our results highlight the benefits of developing out-of-sample evaluation criteria to ascertain model performance. Using annual data on single-family residential water consumption in Southern California we illustrate how prediction ability varies according to model evaluation method. Using a training dataset, this analysis finds that models ranking highly on in-sample performance significantly over-estimated consumption (10% − 25%) five years out from the end of the training dataset relative to observed demands five years out from the end of the training dataset. Whereas, the top models selected using our out-of-sample criteria, came within 1% of the actual total consumption. Notably, projections of future demand for the in-sample models indicate increasing aggregate water consumption over a 25-year period, which contrasts against the downward trend predicted by the out-of-sample models.
L95|European natural gas seasonal effects on futures hedging|This paper is the first to discuss the design of futures hedging strategies in European natural gas markets (NBP, TTF and Zeebrugge). A common feature of energy prices is that conditional mean and volatility are driven by seasonal trends due to weather, demand, and storage level seasonalities. This paper follows and extends the Ederington and Salas (2008) framework and considers seasonalities in mean and volatility when minimum variance hedge ratios are computed. Our results show that hedging effectiveness is much higher when the seasonal pattern in spot price changes is approximated with lagged values of the basis (futures price minus spot price). This fact remains true for short (a week) and long (one, three and six months) hedging periods. Furthermore, volatility of weekly price changes also has a seasonal pattern and is higher in winter than in summer. A simple volatility seasonal model that is based on sinusoidal functions on the basis improves the risk reduction obtained by strategies in which hedging ratios are estimated with linear regressions. Seasonal hedging strategies, linear regression based strategies, or even a naïve position, perform better than more sophisticated statistical methods.
L95|Governance Romanian natural gas market regulation|This paper addresses the issue of regulation in the gas sector in Romania. According to internal energy market rules, all companies must be able to provide quality services freely across the EU. To achieve this objective should be as natural gas distributors in the market to comply with European competition law, namely Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. As competition law is not always applied correctly, consumers of natural gas in Romania are discouraged about the legal and regulatory framework, this analysis is to capture some deficiencies of the regulatory process of the natural gas market in Romania in terms of competition and what consequences they can produce in the future.
L95|Incentives, Efficiency and Quality in Regulated Monopolies under Customer Ownership|We extend the theory of monopoly regulation under imperfect information to the case of customer, rather than investor, ownership. The firm's manager can exert two types of effort - a contractible effort to reduce costs, and a non-contractible effort to increase quality. The former decreases expected costs and increases expected profits, while the latter increases expected demand, costs and consumer surplus. We show that the manager faces a conflict between pursuing cost reductions and quality when his or her net marginal disutility of cost-reducing effort is sufficiently increased by quality-enhancing effort. We further show that this conflict can arise even without an effort substitution effect. Thus stronger incentives (i.e. a higher managerial profit share) induce greater cost-reducing effort, but lower quality-enhancing effort. Since customer owners value consumer surplus as well as profits, they optimally provide the manager with weaker incentives than investor owners - who only value profits - for a given regulated price. This implies higher quality but lower efficiency under customer ownership, given price. A customer-owned firm is optimally set a tighter price cap than an investor-owned firm if its profits are less price-sensitive than is relative consumer surplus. This can result in quality differences being reduced between ownership types, but with ambiguous impacts on efficiency differences. Failure to account for ownership-related differences in objective functions gives rise to regulatory distortions.
L95|Price Convergence and Information Efficiency in German Natural Gas Markets|" type=""main"" xml:id=""geer12034-abs-0001""> In 2007, Germany changed network access regulation in the natural gas sector and introduced a so-called entry–exit system. The spot market effects of the reregulation remain to be examined. We use cointegration analysis and a state space model with time-varying coefficients to study the development of natural gas spot prices in the two major trading hubs in Germany and the interlinked spot market in the Netherlands. To analyse information efficiency in more detail, the state space model is extended to an error correction model. Overall, our results suggest a reasonable degree of price convergence between the corresponding hubs. Market efficiency in terms of information processing has increased considerably among Germany and the Netherlands."
L95|Does Energy Consumption Respond to Price Shocks? Evidence from a Regression-Discontinuity Design|" type=""main""> We exploit unique features of a recently introduced tariff schedule for natural gas in Buenos Aires to estimate the short-run impact of price shocks on residential energy utilization. The schedule induces a non-linear and non-monotonic relationship between households' accumulated consumption and unit prices, thus generating exogenous price variation, which we exploit in a regression-discontinuity design. We find that a price increase causes a prompt and significant decline in gas consumption. The results also indicate that consumers respond more to recent past bills than to expected prices, which argues against an assumption of perfect awareness of complex price schedules by consumers."
L95|Pipeline Power: A Case Study of Strategic Network Investments|We analyze the impact of three controversial pipeline projects on the power structure in the Eurasian network for natural gas. Two pipelines, “Nord Stream” and “South Stream,” allow Russian gas to bypass transit countries, Ukraine and Belarus. The third project, “Nabucco,” aims at diversifying Europe’s gas imports by accessing producers in Middle East and Central Asia. If network power is measured with the Shapley Value we obtain a clear ranking of the projects which corresponds to the observed investment patterns. Nord Stream’s strategic value is huge, easily justifying the high investment cost for Germany and Russia. The additional leverage obtained through South Stream is much smaller and Nabucco is not viable. For the nucleolus in contrast, none of the pipelines has any strategic relevance at all, which contradicts the empirical evidence on investment.
L95|Strategic Investment and International Spillovers in Natural Gas Markets|This paper presents a game-theoretic analysis of multimarket competition with capacity investments, applied to international gas markets. It identifies a strategic advantage of «focused» pipeline gas producers (e.g., Gazprom) over «diversified» multimarket exporters of liquefied natural gas (e.g., Qatar). Based on this, the paper examines the spillover impacts of the Fukushima nuclear accident onto European gas markets, both in the short- and longer-term. It also discusses Russia’s gas export strategy, especially the 2014 deals with China. More generally, the analysis shows how a less efficient oligopolist can be more profitable, and speaks to policy discussions about «security of supply» in energy markets.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

Martin Faulstich und Mechthild Baron, Sachverständigenrat für Umweltfragen, kommen zu dem Ergebnis, dass Fracking energiepolitisch nicht notwendig ist und keinen maßgeblichen Beitrag zur Energiewende leisten kann. Es sollte derzeit wegen gravierender Wissenslücken im kommerziellen Umfang nicht zuzulassen werden. Walter Frenz, Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen, weist darauf hin, dass, unter juristischen Gesichtspunkten, ein geeigneter Vorschlag für eine den Chancen und Risiken von Fracking gerecht werdende Anpassung des geltenden Rechts, insbesondere des Wasserhaushaltsgesetzes, existiert. Matthias Knauff, Universität Jena, zeigt dass der Gesetzgeber bei seinen Entscheidungen nicht völlig frei ist. Unter der Voraussetzung einer Beachtung der bestehenden Umweltschutzstandards sei Fracking eine grundrechtlich geschützte Tätigkeit, deren Untersagung nicht allein aus politischen Gründen möglich sei. Allerdings könnten die damit einhergehenden bekannten und unbekannten Risiken im Sinne des Vorsorgeprinzips eine Einschränkung rechtfertigen. Nach Ansicht von Hans-Joachim Kümpel, Bundesanstalt für Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe (BGR), ist Fracking eine beherrschbare Technologie, während Leon Leschus und Sven Schulze, Hamburgisches WeltWirtschaftsInstitut (HWWI), alles in allem Skepsis im Hinblick auf Fracking in Deutschland für angebracht halten.

Las principales falencias que ha tenido este proyecto se basan en la baja implementación de los mecanismos de regulación y sanción por parte de los organismos encargados, y del mal uso de los recursos públicos que el departamento de Casanare ha destinado para tal fin. Actualmente, esta población se encuentra sin el suministro de agua potable, y por lo tanto se enfrenta a condiciones críticas de salubridad.
L95|European Climate Targets Achievable without Nuclear Power|The upcoming Climate Change Conference in Paris will once again highlight the need for action to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions in order to mitigate climate change. The relevant global energy scenarios are often still based on the assumption that the expansion of nuclear power can contribute to climate change mitigation. The spiraling investment and operating costs of nuclear plants, the unresolved issues concerning the dismantling of these plants and permanent storage of nuclear waste, and the continuing lack of insurability against nuclear accidents make nuclear power extremely unattractive from an economic perspective. As a result, many nuclear power companies are facing financial difficulties. The nuclear renaissance was simply a fairy tale: the majority of the around 400 nuclear power stations currently in operation around the world are outdated and will still need to be dismantled after they have been decommissioned. The construction of new nuclear power plants is restricted to a small number of countries, predominantly China. DIW Berlin has modeled a number of scenarios to forecast European power supply up to 2050 and these show that, with a marked expansion of renewable energy sources, Europe can meet its climate targets without nuclear power. The proliferation of more cost-effective renewable energy technologies, particularly wind and solar power, can compensate for the anticipated decline in nuclear power. In a scenario that includes no new nuclear power plant construction at all, renewables account for 88 percent of powergeneration capacity. Nuclear power was not, is not, and never will be a sustainable energy source and is, therefore, unsuitable for an efficient climate policy. A transition to greater use of renewables is the more cost-effective option overall.

L95|No Barriers to Investment in Electricity and Gas Distribution Grids through Incentive Regulation|Since early 2009, electricity and gas distribution in Germany has been subject to incentive regulation designed to ensure greater efficiency in electricity and gas grid operation. However, it remains to be seen how changes to the regulatory framework will affect the investment behavior of distribution system operators. Against this background, the present study empirically analyzes the investment activities of distribution system operators for the period from 2006 to 2012. The key questions are whether the introduction of incentive regulation in 2009 has had an empirically demonstrable impact on investment and whether this effect is due to the introduction of incentive regulation per se, or to its specific design. The findings show a positive effect on investment since the introduction of incentive regulation which, in particular, is determined by the specific design of regulation.

The relevant global energy scenarios are often still based on the assumption that the expansion of nuclear power can contribute to climate protection. The increasing investment and operating costs of nuclear plants, the unresolved issues concerning the dismantling of plants and permanent storage of nuclear waste, and the continuing lack of insurability against nuclear accidents make nuclear power extremely unattractive from an economic perspective.

Die kommende Klimakonferenz in Paris wird einmal mehr den Handlungsbedarf zur globalen Minderung von Treibhausgasemissionen verdeutlichen, um die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels einzudämmen. Relevante globale Energieszenarien gehen oftmals noch davon aus, dass der Ausbau der Atomkraft einen Beitrag zum Klimaschutz leisten wird. Die deutlich gestiegenen Investitionskosten für neue Atomkraftwerke, zunehmende Betriebskosten, ungelöste Fragen des Rückbaus und der Endlagerung und die nach wie vor fehlende Versicherbarkeit von Atomunfällen machen die Atomenergie wirtschaftlich jedoch äußerst unattraktiv. Dementsprechend befinden sich viele Atomkonzerne in finanziellen Schwierigkeiten. Eine angebliche Renaissance der Atomenergie gibt es nicht: Die meisten der weltweit rund 400 Atomkraftwerke, die derzeit betrieben werden, sind alt und müssen nach ihrer Stilllegung zurückgebaut werden. Der Kraftwerksneubau beschränkt sich auf wenige Länder, vor allem China. Szenarioanalysen des DIW Berlin für die europäische Stromversorgung bis 2050 zeigen, dass Europa seine Klimaschutzziele bei einem deutlichen Ausbau erneuerbarer Energien auch ohne Atomkraft erreichen kann. Dank zunehmend kostengünstiger Technologien, insbesondere Windkraft und Photovoltaik, kann der zu erwartende Rückgang der Atomkraft kompensiert werden. In einem Szenario gänzlich ohne Neubauten von Atomkraftwerken stellen die erneuerbaren Energien im Jahr 2050 88 Prozent der Stromerzeugungskapazitäten dar. Atomkraft war, ist und wird keine nachhaltige Energiequelle und ist daher für eine effiziente Klimapolitik ungeeignet. Der Umbau hin zu einem verstärkten Einsatz erneuerbarer Energien ist gesamtwirtschaftlich die kostengünstigere Variante.

L95|Rückbau und Entsorgung in der deutschen Atomwirtschaft: öffentlich-rechtlicher Atomfonds erforderlich|At present, the question how to finance the decommissioning of nuclear plants and the management of radioactive waste, and how to structure the next steps of the German nuclear phase-out is in the center of the current debate. There is a threat that nuclear power plant operators could partially abdicate their financial responsibility in the long term. Previous experiences have shown that decommissioning nuclear plants and managing radioactive waste often involves substantial delays and cost increases. So far, a permanent repository for highly radioactive waste is still missing. At the same time, the capacity of the repository Konrad for low and medium level radioactive waste, which is currently being built, is too low for all the waste expected. In order to secure the financing of plant decommissioning and radioactive waste management in the long term, several concepts are being discussed, among them intra-corporate funds, a public fund, as well as hybrid solutions of these approaches.Because of the existing interdependencies between plant decommissioning and waste management and a very long time horizon, the establishment of a public fund appears to be most suitable in order to secure long-term financing, to adhere to the “polluter-pays principle”, and to mitigate the financial risks of the society. The German government should thus establish a single public fund which secures the financing of both plant decommissioning and radioactive waste management. The payments to the fund should be spread over time in order to help the companies to adapt. Fragen der Finanzierung des Rückbaus von Atomkraftwerken und der Entsorgung radioaktiver Abfälle stehen im Mittelpunkt der gegenwärtigen Diskussion um die weitere Ausgestaltung des Atomausstiegs. Es besteht die Gefahr, dass sich die Atomkraftwerksbetreiber ihrer finanziellen Verantwortung langfristig zumindest teilweise entziehen. Die bisherigen Erfahrungen zeigen, dass es beim Rückbau von Atomkraftwerken und bei der Entsorgung radioaktiver Abfälle oft zu erheblichen Verzögerungen sowie Kostensteigerungen kommt. Bisher fehlt nach wie vor ein Endlager für hochradioaktive Abfälle, während beim derzeit im Bau befindlichen Endlager Konrad für schwach- bis mittelradioaktive Abfälle die genehmigten Kapazitäten absehbar zu knapp bemessen sind. Zur langfristigen Sicherung der Finanzierung des Kraftwerksrückbaus und der Entsorgung radioaktiver Abfälle werden derzeit die Bildung von unternehmensinternen Fonds, die Schaffung eines öffentlich-rechtlichen Fonds sowie Mischformen dieser Konzepte diskutiert. Aufgrund der Interdependenzen zwischen Rückbau und Entsorgung sowie des langen abzudeckenden Zeitraums erscheint die Einrichtung eines öffentlich-rechtlichen Fonds am besten geeignet, um die Finanzierung dauerhaft zu sichern, das Verursacherprinzip zu wahren und die finanziellen Risiken für die Gesellschaft zu mindern. Die Bundesregierung sollte deshalb einen öffentlich-rechtlichen Fonds einrichten, der sowohl der Finanzierung des Rückbaus der Atomkraftwerke als auch der Entsorgung radioaktiver Abfälle dient. Die Zuführung der notwendigen Mittel zum Fonds sollte zeitlich gestreckt werden, um den Unternehmen die Anpassung zu erleichtern.
L95|Keine Investitionshemmnisse in Elektrizitäts- und Gasverteilnetze durch Anreizregulierung|Since early 2009, power supply in Germany has been subject to incentive regulation designed to ensure greater efficiency in electricity and gas grid operation. However, it remains to be seen how changes to the regulatory framework will affect the investment behavior of distribution system operators. Against this background, the present study empirically analyzes the investment activities of distribution system operators for the period from 2006 to 2012. The key questions are whether the introduction of incentive regulation from 2009 onwards can be attributed to an empirically demonstrable impact on investment and whether this effect is due to the introduction of incentive regulation per se, or to its specific design. The findings show a positive effect on investment since the introduction of incentive regulation which, in particular, is determined by the specific design of regulation. Seit Anfang 2009 unterliegt die Energieversorgung in Deutschland der Anreizregulierung, durch die ein effizienter Betrieb von Strom- und Gasnetzen sichergestellt werden soll. Unklar ist allerdings, wie sich die veränderten regulatorischen Rahmenbedingungen auf das Investitionsverhalten der Netzbetreiber auswirken. Vor diesem Hintergrund wird in der vorliegenden Untersuchung die Investitionstätigkeit der Netzbetreiber für den Zeitraum von 2006 bis 2012 empirisch analysiert. Zentrale Fragestellungen sind, ob der Einführung der Anreizregulierung ab 2009 ein empirisch nachweisbarer Einfluss auf die Investitionstätigkeit zugeschrieben werden kann und ob dieser Einfluss auf die Einführung der Anreizregulierung per se oder auf ihre spezifische Ausgestaltung zurückgeht. Im Ergebnis kann mit Einführung der Anreizregulierung ein positiver Effekt auf die Investitionstätigkeit festgestellt werden, der insbesondere durch die spezifische Ausgestaltung der Regulierung bestimmt wird.
L95|Financing LNG Projects and the Role of Long-Term Sales-and-Purchase Agreements|The financing of infrastructures is a major topic in recent energy policy debates. Project finance, as a specialized form of debt finance, thereby has become a well-established financing tool. This paper contributes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the determinants of the debt ratio in project finance, using data on 26 liquefied natural gas (LNG) export and import projects. We argue that lenders will make their decision on how much to lend dependent on the risk profile of the project. In this vein, a project’s off-take agreements serve as a security for financial contracts. We empirically show that the debt ratio of an LNG project decreases with increasing risks associated to future cash flows. Estimation results confirmthat leverage increases with higher shares of a project’s capacity sold under long-term sales-and-purchase agreements, with a lower capital outlay of the project, and with a lower risk index of the country where the project is located.
L95|Testing fractional persistence and non-linearities in the natural gas market: An application of non-linear deterministic terms based on Chebyshev polynomials in time|Studying variations of natural gas prices in relation to consumer prices may give us better indicators for the analysis of economic activity. This paper deals with the analysis of natural gas spot prices using fractional integration techniques in the context of non-linear deterministic trends. We find nonstationarity with mean reverting coefficients (i.e., orders of integration in the range (0.5, 1)) in the daily and monthly series, as well as in their logarithmic transformations. Evidences of non-linearities are only obtained in the monthly series which may be a consequence of the higher degree of volatility associated with this frequency.
L95|Economies of scale and scope in expansion of the U.S. natural gas pipeline network|I analyze cost, capacity, mileage, and technical data for 254 U.S. natural gas pipeline projects over the period 1997–2012. Although project costs exhibit economies of scale over the capacity margin and economies of scope over the spatial margin, network expansion costs may not exhibit cost economies overall. That is, proportional increases in both transmission capacity and length (in miles) may result in a proportional (or even greater-than-proportional) increase in expansion costs. Moreover, large projects (high-capacity pipelines spanning long distances) likely require installation of compression horsepower, which has direct cost effects. My results suggest such projects exhibit significant diseconomies in cost structure. As a result, pipeline tariffs based on cost-of-service pricing likely present a disincentive for prospective pipeline customers to commit to long-term contracts—which are necessary for the pipeline to acquire regulatory permission to build—particularly for large, long-distance expansion projects. The implication is that cost-of-service pricing may inhibit network expansion, exacerbating congestion issues.
L95|All quiet on the eastern front? Disruption scenarios of Russian natural gas supply to Europe|The 2014 Russian–Ukrainian crisis reignited European concerns about natural gas supply security recalling the experiences of 2006 and 2009. However, the European supply situation, regulation and infrastructure have changed, with better diversified import sources, EU member states being better connected and a common regulation on the security of supply has been introduced. Nevertheless, European dependency on natural gas remained high. This paper investigates different Russian natural gas export disruptions scenarios and analyses short- and long-term reactions in Europe. We use the Global Gas Model (GGM), a large-scale mixed complementarity representation of the natural gas sector with a high level of technical granularity with respect to storage and transportation infrastructure. While we find that most of the EU member states are not severely affected by Russian disruptions, some East European countries are very vulnerable. Prioritizing the removal of infrastructure bottlenecks is critical for securing a sufficient natural gas supply to all EU member states.
L95|The development of gas hubs in Europe|This paper investigates the development of wholesale markets for natural gas at the different stages of market liberalization. We identify three steps in the process: wholesale trade initially develops to cope with balancing needs when the shippers and suppliers segments become more fragmented; once the market becomes more liquid, it turns out to be a second source of gas procurement in alternative to long term contracts; finally, to manage price risk financial instruments are traded. We review in detail the different regulatory measures that must be introduced to create an efficient and functioning wholesale gas market. Finally, we analyze the evolution of gas hubs in the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy in terms of market rules and market liquidity. We argue that each of these country cases can be easily located into the evolutionary path we have highlighted at the beginning, with the UK and the Netherlands leading the process, Germany and Italy constrained by limited supply; Italy is also showing an interesting counterfactual.
L95|Are retail prices of ethanol, gasoline and natural gas in the midwest cointegrated? An asymmetric threshold cointegration analysis|This paper examines whether there is a long run equilibrium relationship, and the short run dynamic adjustment of such a relationship between the retail prices of selected transportation fuels in the Midwest. The study uses monthly data for the period October 2006 to December 2013. The analysis involves the nonlinear Threshold Autoregressive (TAR) and the Momentum Threshold Autoregressive (M-TAR) models of threshold cointegration, and the Momentum Threshold Vector Error Correction Models (M-TVECM), after pretesting for nonlinearities. The empirical results provide an unambiguous evidence of cointegration and asymmetric adjustments to the long run equilibrium relationship following deviations from the empirically estimated thresholds. There is robust empirical evidence of bi-directional Granger causality. There is empirical evidence that shocks to ethanol have lasting effects on gasoline prices than a corresponding shock to gasoline on ethanol prices. The empirical results have huge policy implications for the current debate on the future of the Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS) mandate in the United States.
L95|Empirical analysis of the generalized consumption asset pricing model: Estimating the cost of capital|Other than the problematic discounted cash flow and capital asset pricing models that have been used for decades, no other asset pricing models have generally been adopted for estimating the cost of common equity capital. A recently developed and promising general consumption asset pricing model for estimating costs of common equity is successful in empirical tests and applied for estimating the cost of common equity. This research presents an empirical investigation of the model for application to the regulation of public utilities and stock market and compares the cost of capital results with the CAPM. The model is applicable for estimating the cost of common equity capital for any stock. The paper recommends that the GCAPM be considered as an additional asset model with the others that are typically used as additional information in estimating the cost of common equity capital.
L95|A study of the negotiated-settlement practice in regulation: Some evidence from Florida|Negotiated settlements have become a frequently used alternative to contested proceedings when setting prices charged by public utilities under the US rate-of-return regulatory model. The behavior of the representatives of consumer advocates and the firms during settlement negotiations determine customer prices. This paper examines this behavior by using data from the Florida Public Service Commission to estimate the payoff functions of both parties. The estimation suggests that the advocate and the firm weight the present rate change more than the consumer's future average price and the firm's future operating revenue in their settlement decisions. It also indicates that the time saved by settlements is not a primary reason for their popularity.
L95|Drivers of non-revenue water: A cross-national analysis|Reducing water losses is seen as key to sustainable water management, but turns out to be challenging. This paper applies a panel data analysis with fixed effects to assess the major drivers of non-revenue water, some of which are under the control of utilities and some of which are not. The analysis finds that the most important drivers are population density per kilometer of network and type of distribution network, which are mostly resulting from urbanization patterns which are factors mostly out of the control of the utility. Yet, low opportunity costs of water losses and high repair costs of water losses have an important adverse effect on water loss reduction. We also found that the country environment in which the utility operates has an important impact on non-revenue water levels.
L95|Strategic investment and international spillovers in natural gas markets|This paper presents a game-theoretic analysis of multimarket competition with capacity investments, applied to international gas markets. It identifies a strategic advantage of «focused» pipeline gas producers (e.g., Gazprom) over «diversified» multimarket exporters of liquefied natural gas (e.g., Qatar). Based on this, the paper examines the spillover impacts of the Fukushima nuclear accident onto European gas markets, both in the short- and longer-term. It also discusses Russia’s gas export strategy, especially the 2014 deals with China. More generally, the analysis shows how a less efficient oligopolist can be more profitable, and speaks to policy discussions about «security of supply» in energy markets.
L95|Territorial Restrictions and Consumer Welfare in a Mixed Oligopoly: The Japanese Gas Supply Market (in Japanese)|This study empirically examines the welfare effects of territorial restrictions on town gas services in Japan by modeling the choice of gas service made by a set of households. The Japanese gas market includes two major types of gas services: the liquefied petroleum (LP) gas service and the town gas service. Although LP gas prices and LP gas service areas are not regulated, town gas prices and town gas service areas are heavily regulated by the government. Particularly, territorial restrictions on town gas services essentially prohibit providers of town gas from expanding their service area. Logically, the government should readjust town gas service areas frequently in response to demand. However, town gas service areas have not been readjusted. Territorial restrictions on town gas service areas could cause a loss in consumer welfare. Using data on the Japanese gas market for the period from 1998 to 2005, and deploying a two-stage procedure, this study analyzes whether territorial restrictions on Japanese town gas services cause a loss in consumer welfare. First, a demand model, assumed to have a nested logit structure, is estimated. The estimation reveals that the characteristics of gas services play a significant role in demand substitution between town gas and LP gas. Second, using the estimated demand parameters, a simulation exercise is conducted; the outcome indicates that an expansion of town gas services to areas without town gas pipelines has allowed some households to switch from LP gas to town gas. In the static Cournot competition among LP gas suppliers, this switch results in an intensification of competition among these suppliers, leading to a decrease in LP gas prices (5.8%) and a consequent improvement in consumer welfare (13.8%). These results suggest that the government should facilitate an expansion of town gas services to areas without town gas pipelines. JEL Classification: L43, L95
L95|Sovereign States and Surging Water: Brahmaputra River between China and India|Brahmaputra river basin is one of the most vulnerable areas in the world subject to combined effects of glacier melt, extreme monsoon rainfall and sea level rise. Water is emerging as a new possible irritant between China and India. For India, Water of Brahmaputra constitutes a major lifeline for people of Tibet and North Eastern states. The building of dams and diversion projects in Tibet by China is a matter of grave concern for lower riparian states. For China, it is having hidden inclination to create employment potentials for more than millions of people by making Brahmaputra diversion project forward. The requirement of fresh water as the pollution grows and population rise has forced China to have the Tsangpo-Brahmaputra River project. The objective of this paper is to focus the reaction of both people on the water diversion issue, disastrous ecological consequences and the urgent necessity for having a water treaty between Asian giants. It also examines the hegemonic tendencies of China on Brahmaputra River & exercise of power for economic gains and outcomes. The policies China takes on trans- Boundary Rivers are not symptom of peaceful nature of its rise. In addition, it establishes the fact that sharing of information, ecosystem-friendly policies, thought and mutual understanding will dispel the suspicion and develop trust between two countries, creating an enabling environment for better management of Brahmaputra River.
L95|Financialisation and neoliberalism; The case of water provision in Portugal|The study analyses the evolution of water provision in Portugal. It argues that the Portuguese water system of provision is deeply marked by the process of financialisation of the Portuguese economy, leading to high levels of private indebtedness that sustained a neoliberal agenda until the crisis of 2008-09. The history of the neoliberal transformation of water provision in Portugal is examined, paying particular attention to the progress achieved and the transformations occurring in its business model and finances, including the role of different agents in these processes. The neoliberal transformation of the Portuguese system of water provision is then set against the effects of the recent economic crisis. It concludes that the recent progress in the water SoP has been interrupted through a halt in investment and pressure for higher tariffs which, in a context of declining disposable income, intensifies social vulnerability.
L95|Water Infrastructure Financing In Spain: Potential For Securitization|Water scarcity is a persistent problem in Spain. There has consequently been a long-standing debate about the role that the public sector must play in water policies, as well as that of market-based instruments. In this paper we analyze the advantages and disadvantages associated with public and private financing of water infrastructure projects. For this purpose, we discuss how water infrastructure financing has evolved in Spain over the past century and analyze the possibilities of using securitization to finance water infrastructure projects. We present an optimization program that could facilitate public securitization processes to determine the optimum volume of cash transfer in each period, and we solve this using fuzzy programming.
L95|Using discrete choice experiments to regulate the provision of water services: do status quo choices reflect preferences?|Discrete choice experiments (DCE) are increasingly used to quantify the demand for improvements to services provided by regulated utility companies and inform price controls. This form of preference elicitation, however, often reveals a high frequency of status quo (SQ) choices. This may signal an unwillingness of respondents to evaluate the proposed trade-offs in service levels, questioning the welfare theoretic interpretation of observed choices and the validity of the approach for regulatory purposes. Using the methodology for DCE in the regulation of water and sewerage services in England and Wales, our paper contributes to the understanding of SQ choices in several novel dimensions. First, we control for the perception of the SQ and the importance of attributes in day-to-day activities. Second, we use a split sample design to vary both the description of the SQ and the survey administration mode (online vs. in-person). Third, the service attributes can both improve or deteriorate, so that the SQ is not necessarily the least-cost option. Fourth, we examine SQ choices in individual choice tasks and across all tasks so as to identify the determinants of serial SQ choices. Our results suggest that individual SQ choices mostly reflect preferences and thus represent important information for the regulator. However, serial SQ choices are mainly driven by cognitive and/or contextual factors, and these responses should be analysed as part of standard validity tests.

L95|Does Regulatory Independence Translate into a Higher Degree of Liberalization? - Evidence from EU Energy Regulators|Independent regulatory authorities are a basic prerequisite for a successful liberalization process. However, contrary to what is expected, both graphical analyses and OLS regressions for a small sample of electricity and gas regulators operating in 16 European countries reveal a negative relationship between the authorities' formal autonomy from politicians and the scope of market reforms. These findings might suffer from endogeneity, though, so we draw on political scientists' explanations for diverging independence levels to construct appropriate instruments. The 2SLS-IV results then confirm conventional wisdom: the higher the degree of regulatory autonomy, the higher the level of liberalization.
L95|Parametric and Non-Parametric Cost Efficiency Benchmarking of Water Utilities in Russia|The activities of the water companies in Russia are regulated in order to overcome market failures caused by regional monopolization, information asymmetries and the need to find a balance between the interests of consumers and company objectives for its normal functioning and development. In the Russian Federation, the regulator uses the outdated and inefficient cost method, which deprives the company an incentive to reduce their own costs. However, Russian regulator is in active discussion about the transition to modern long-term management regulation practices in order to increase companies’ efficiency, which in the framework of the regulation defines the future of the company's profits. Russian regulator should take more active steps to encourage regulated companies to increase efficiency and productivity. Solution is to move to using benchmarking, which allows to identify sources of companies’ inefficiency to assess the validity of the established tariffs. This study presents the first attempt to implement benchmarking methods used by the world's leading regulators to determine the cost efficiency of companies and improve their potential. The authors tested a parametric (COLS) and non-parametric (DEA) methods to assess the performance of companies with different technical and economic characteristics more accurately. The study makes a number of recommendations for the specification of the model, assessing its sensitivity to the changes in samples. The authors concluded that the model based on COLS is of high quality and resistance to changing of sample while assessing the technical efficiency. However, a similar statement for DEA models is unfair, since the inclusion in the analysis of either too large or too small companies does not lead to plausible results. On the other hand, DEA allowed to assess not only the technical efficiency of companies but also the allocative one. In general, the authors have shown that the potential for increasing the efficiency of Russian water supply companies is large enough, and the regulator is necessary to accelerate the transition to incentive regulation in order to increase efficiency in the sector.
L95|Diversification of Natural Gas Supply - Main Objective of EU Energy Union Project|"The tense political context created by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the security risks entailed to the transport routes from the Caspian Sea to Europe, represented an increasing threat to EU security of energy /gas supply . Dependence on a small number of suppliers, some of them dominant or uncertain, such as Russia, made EU vulnerable to ""divisive"" tactics and threats of blocking energy supply routes. More than half of the gas consumed in the EU comes from third countries and more than 1/3 from Russia. But Europe is well positioned geographically to benefit from the important changes looming in the coming years, in the changing configuration of gas flows worldwide. After the identification and extensive exploitation of shale gas in the United States, mankind faces a potential surplus of natural gas that needs, however, an adequate infrastructure to reach the consumers and erode market dominance of traditional exporters, headed by Russia."
L95|“Political connections, corruption, and privatization of public services: Evidence from contracting out water services in Spain”|Political corruption is a type of market failure. One area of public policy where corruption is relatively common is the contracting out of public services. Private firms can improve their chances of obtaining contracts by bribing politicians or public servants and funding political parties. In the same vein, firms can gain access to policy makers by hiring influential former politicians –a practice commonly referred to as revolving-doors. In Spain, a number of corruption cases, involving all the major political parties, are presently under judicial investigation. Some of these cases involve water contracts. Also, there is evidence showing that private firms have been funding political parties as well as hiring former politicians for top positions. In this paper, we use information from 892 privatizations of water services in Spanish municipalities between 1984 and 2014 and logistic multinomial regression techniques to study the association between specific firms securing contracts and the political parties ruling the municipalities. We find evidence of a systematic association between the Popular Party (Partido Popular or PP) and the firm, Aqualia, part of the large Spanish holding company, Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas (FCC), which is known to have funded the PP. Furthermore, former PP politicians have been appointed to top positions in the FCC board of directors.
L95|Information systems (is) in the supply chain management (scm): A case of liquefied petroleum gas (lpg) of bangladesh|A supply chain is the set of values adding activities connecting the enterprise’s suppliers and its customers. Flow of Information has become a crucial function in setting objective, drawing strategy, taking right decision regarding supply chain of LP Gas throughout the whole country by linking the supplier, manufacturer, distributor, dealer/ retailer and customer to achieve optimum productivity, overall satisfaction and joyful relationship at competitive costing. As LP Gas is a necessary commodity, quick and effective information system helps a manager to understand the customer response, their demand, inventory in stock, amount to be produced, time frame and location of delivery. This study, we have focused on application of information systems in the supply chain of LPG industry. Here we used multi-method to get the best result. The study is compiled with the help of both primary and secondary data. We have collected data from 152 respondents in the relevant field. To achieve objective properly we developed a semi-structured interview schedule for collecting the information. We have analyzed our data by employing descriptive statistics and Cronbach’s alpha test. This paper illustrated the role of IS in sourcing, network designing, transportation, inventory management, forecasting, aggregate planning, setting goal, benchmarking the goal, troubleshooting from very beginning of the supplier relationship to the end customer relationship keeping smooth internal information flow throughout the process. We found that, if we apply information systems in all steps and drivers of supply chain of LPG industry then it can develop the integrated supplier relationship, strong internal supply chain management, maintain the customer relationship management and so on. This study we have also given some recommendations to the LPG industry of Bangladesh for applying information systems in the supply chain process.

L95|Consolidating the water industry: an analysis of the potential gains from horizontal integration in a conditional efficiency framework|The German potable water supply industry is regarded highly fragmented, thus preventing efficiency improvements that could happen through consolidation. Focusing on a hypothetical restructuring of the industry, we use a cross-section sample of 364 German water utilities in 2006, applying Data Envelopment Analysis, to analyze the potential efficiency gains from hypothetical mergers between water utilities at the county level. A conditional efficiency framework is applied to account for the water utilities’ operating environments. A conditional order-m approach is applied for the detection of potential outlying observations. Merger gains are decomposed into a technical efficiency effect, a harmony effect and a scale effect. The greatest efficiency improvement potentials turn out to result from reducing individual inefficiencies while pure merger gains are found to be low. The results suggest improving incentives for efficient operations in water supply and a consolidation of the smallest water utilities. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
L95|Removing Cross-Border Capacity Bottlenecks in the European Natural Gas Market—A Proposed Merchant-Regulatory Mechanism|We propose a merchant-regulatory framework to promote investment in the European natural gas network infrastructure based on a price cap over two-part tariffs. As suggested by Vogelsang (J Regul Econ 20:141–165, 2001 ) and Hogan et al. (J Regul Econ 38:113–143, 2010 ), a profit maximizing network operator facing this regulatory constraint will intertemporally rebalance the variable and fixed part of its two-part tariff so as to expand the congested pipelines, and converge to the Ramsey-Boiteaux equilibrium. We confirm this with actual data from the European natural gas market by comparing the bi-level price-cap model with different reference cases. We analyze the performance of the regulatory approach under different market scenarios, and identify relevant aspects that need to be addressed if the approach were to be implemented.

L95|Bargaining Power and Value Sharing in Distribution Networks: A Cooperative Game Theory Approach|This paper introduces a novel methodology for analyzing bargaining games on network markets, which are markets where transactions occur by means of distribution networks (e.g., gas, electric energy, water, etc.). The overall economic surplus obtained in the market is distributed among all network agents the on the basis of their bargaining power, which in turn depends on a variety of factors: position of each agent (e.g., a country) in the network, reliability in the cooperation scheme (e.g., geo-political stability), existence of market distortions and availability of outside options (e.g., alternative energy sources). The method we propose, which is illustrated here through an application to a fictitious network structure, is based on a two-stage process: first, a network optimization model is used to generate payoff values under different coalitions and network structures; second, cooperative game solutions are identified. Any change in the network structure entails both a variation in the overall welfare level and in the distribution of surplus among agents, as it affects their relative bargaining power. Therefore, expected costs and benefits, at the aggregate as well as at the individual level, can be compared to assess the economic viability of any investment in network infrastructure. A number of model variants and extensions are also considered: changing demand, exogenous instability factors, market distortions, externalities and outside options.

L95|Financing the Evolution of London’s Water Services: 1582 to 1904|This paper examines the evolution of water supply as a private, for-profit business from its origins in sixteenth century London until its transfer to a public monopoly at the start of the twentieth century. From 1582 onwards, 29 private water companies operated at different times in the area which became Greater London. By 1850, these had consolidated into eight local monopolies operating within mutually-agreed boundaries. The survival of private services depended on a mix of economic, institutional and political factors. Financial sustainability was achieved through early start-up investment subsidies and a pricing policy that kept the basic charge for a household connection constant in nominal terms for two and a half centuries. As quality regulation was introduced after 1852, services were transformed from low-pressure, intermittent and untreated supply, to a treated, continuous, high-pressure service universally available and affordable to all. Over the long run, users paid for services, with wealthier households providing a cross-subsidy to poorer ones through time. The policy implication is that early public sector financial support in the form of grants, soft loans or patient equity may be necessary to launch private sector solutions for water services, and that quality and price regulation is needed to drive quality improvements, achieve universal coverage and cap excess profits.
L95|The Overview Of The Main Gas Pipelines In The Black Sea Region: Political And Economic Aspects|Topicality. The Black Sea region is very dynamic in terms of economic development, security problems and interstate relations. All of the countries in this region are heterogeneous but energy issue plays a pivotal role in their foreign policy priorities. It is the only one common denominator that can both foster cooperation and catalyze conflict in the Black Sea basin. The problem of transporting energy has an impact not only on the Black Sea countries, but also on the Southeastern Europe, Russia, the Caspian Sea, Middle East, and ultimately the European consuming markets. Thus, the issue of energy transition needs the experts’ and scientists’ attention fixed on the Black Sea region in order to come together facing the latter-day challenges. The energy challenge has a multi-dimensional nature. Aim. Thus, this paper aims to provide an overview of the energy transaction issues focusing on the economic effects of the most important gas pipelines within the Black Sea region. Particular attention is going to be paid to the problem of the energy routes’ diversification and pipelines which connect the carbon-rich countries of the Middle East and Caspian region and Europe. Also, it is aimed to give a comprehensive analysis of the energy challenge within the Black sea region, focusing on energy efficiency of the gas pipelines which go through this extremely important energy hub. Methods - scientific methods of data analysis, historical and statistical overview, predictive analysis qualitative indicators, comparative method, method of description, case study. Results. The creation of a stable markets, interconnected and transparent natural gas supply would largely counteract the risks. The flexibility transport infrastructure, numerous and capable pipelines, underground storage capacities and their management may play an important role in the sector’s ability to manage supply shocks.
L95|Improving infrastructure in the United Kingdom|The United Kingdom (UK) has spent less on infrastructure compared to other OECD countries over the past three decades. The perceived quality of UK infrastructure assets is close to the OECD average but lower than in other G7 countries. Capacity constraints have emerged in some sectors, such as electricity generation, air transport and roads. Developing and regularly updating a national infrastructure strategy, with the National Infrastructure Plan being a welcome first step in this direction, would contribute to reduce policy uncertainty and tackle capacity constraints in a durable way. The design of coherent development plans by local authorities congruent with the national and local planning systems should continue to improve project delivery. The government intends to finance a large share of infrastructure spending to 2020 and beyond through private capital. Unlocking private investment in a cost effective and transparent way could be supported by further improving incentives for greenfield investment, continuing to carefully assess and record public-private partnerships, and promoting more long-term financing instruments. This Working Paper relates to the 2015 OECD Economic Survey of the United Kingdom (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-united-kingdom.htm). Améliorer les infrastructures au Royaume-Uni Au Royaume-Uni, les dépenses dans les infrastructures ont été inférieures à ce qu’elles ont été dans d’autres pays de l’OCDE au cours des trois dernières décennies. La perception de la qualité des actifs d’infrastructure y est comparable à la moyenne de l’OCDE, mais est plus faible que dans les autres pays du G7. Des contraintes de capacité se sont fait jour dans certains secteurs comme la production d’électricité, le transport aérien ou le réseau routier. L’élaboration et l’actualisation régulière d’une stratégie nationale en matière d’infrastructures, avec le Plan National d’Infrastructure étant une première étape bienvenue en ce sens, contribuerait à réduire les incertitudes au niveau de l’action publique et de s’attaquer de manière durable aux contraintes de capacité. La conception, par les collectivités locales, de plans de développement cohérents conformes aux systèmes de planification nationaux et locaux améliorerait la livraison de projets. Le gouvernement a l’intention de financer une grande partie des dépenses d’infrastructures jusqu’en 2020 et au-delà en mobilisant des capitaux privés. Le déverrouillage de l’investissement privé de manière transparente et avec un bon rapport coût/efficacité pourrait être soutenu en améliorant les incitations à investir dans des installations entièrement nouvelles, de recenser et d’évaluer soigneusement les partenariats public-privé et de promouvoir de nouveaux instruments de financement à long terme.

L95|Regulation of Natural Gas in the United States, Canada, and Europe: Prospects for a Low Carbon Fuel|The United States and Canada have seen a competitive and technological revolution in unconventional natural gas production in the 21st Century—dramatically lowering the price of gas and displacing high-carbon coal with low-carbon gas for power generation. This gas revolution came from an earlier revolution in the regulation of gas pipelines, which ended the obstruction of gas markets by pipeline interests. Neither revolution has spread to Europe, where increasingly protectionist EU legislation has effectively blocked competitive pipeline entry and related gas markets. As a result, unconventional gas is untapped, coal displaces gas for power generation, and oil-linked gas prices have cost EU consumers a staggering $425 billion more than their US counterparts have paid since 2009 for about the same quantity of gas. Europe faces a serious institutional challenge to adopting the kind of pipeline regulation that facilitates the competitive flow of natural gas supplies and the accompanying lower carbon emissions.

L95|Natural Gas: An Overview of a Lower-Carbon Transformation Fuel|This article provides an overview of the natural gas industry, which we view as a bridge fuel toward a lower-carbon energy system in many countries and regions around the world. Based on a review of the literature, an econometric analysis of natural gas prices and contracts, and the authors’ experience with the natural gas industry, this introductory article to the symposium on the Prospects for Natural Gas in a Lower-Carbon Context provides an overview of research on natural gas markets over the last decade and examines various features of the natural gas industry, including its technical structure, activities in the value-added chain, trade and market trends, short- and long-term price developments, and the geopolitical landscape. More specifically, we describe the natural gas sector and provide an overview of production, reserves, and consumption. We also examine the evolution of long-term contracts between producers and large-scale buyers of natural gas and present some recent empirical evidence. Finally, we discuss the changing geopolitics of natural gas, focusing in particular on the future roles of the United States as a potential natural gas exporter and Asia as the major importing region.

L95|Household Deficiency in Demand for Water: Do Water Source and Travel Time Matter?|Despite the massive commitment by policy makers and stakeholders to increase the supply of water to households in Ghana, many households have a deficiency in their self-reported daily quantity of water required for drinking and for general use. This paper focuses on the effect of water source and travelling time on households’ deficiency in demand for water using the Sixth Round of the Ghana Living Standards survey. A Tobit regression analysis of data on 2,843 households reveals that a one minute increase in travelling time increases household deficiency in water demand by about 49 percent. Also, compared to pipe in dwelling/yard/plot, all other sources of water to the households come with greater levels of water deficiency, with unprotected well/spring/river-stream/dam-lake-pond generating the greatest (10.5 litres) levels of deficiency. Other significant predictors of household deficiency in water demand are per capita disposable income, number of rooms in the household, sex of the household head and regular payment of water bills. Government policies aimed at addressing household deficiency in water demand should focus on making more resources available to the Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) and the Community Water and Sanitation Agency so as to achieve more coverage of water accessible to both urban and rural households.
L95|Functional or structural separation to deal with vertical foreclosure effects in the electronic communications industry, pending the Second British Telecoms Review (2015)|The paper tackles the discussion about vertical separation in the electronic communications sector, in its two main forms functional and structural. The author will argue how mandatory structural separation under certain conditions could be a possible option. The evidence is provided by the analysis of recent commitment decisions adopted by the European Commission in the energy sector, and by structural separation undertakings signed in Australia and New Zealand in the past few years. The paper considers the theoretical background, such as the various forms of separation identified by the OECD in 2001 and 2011, but also the current discussion around the Second Telecoms Review (2005-2015) in the United Kingdom.
L95|A Literature Review on the Sediment Transport Process in Shallow-Grade Culverts and Storm Sewers|Sedimentation of fine muddy material in culverts and storm sewers becomes an important issue in Texas coastal plain shallow-grade drain systems. It leads to a reduction inflow capacity with time and an associated high cost of cleaning. It may not be possible to maintain the required 2 feet per second along sewer in time. The objective of study is to conduct an extensive literature review, and field survey to implement physical experiment for quantifying the sediment transport process in shallow grade culverts and storm sewers. The previous studies indicate that culverts or sewers should be designed to transport fine grains as a suspended load and transport granular sediments as a bed load, and to erode the sediment deposition with high flow velocity to achieve self-cleaning. The suspended load, bed load and bed erosion sediment transport equations have been developed as the function of the sediment grain size, the sediment concentration, the slope of the culverts or sewers, the bed roughness. To quantify the sediment characteristics, three samples were collected from the culvert, the ditch and the sewer located in Orange County of southeast Texas. The sieve analysis indicates that d50 are greater than 0.5mm and d65 are greater than 1mm for all the samples. However, more fine particles are included in the sewer sump and ditch than that in the culvert. The ongoing study is to set up a physical model based on the key variables in the previous transport equation to study the transport process in shallow grade culverts and storm sewers.
L95|Does Information Provision Shrink the Energy Efficiency Gap? A Cross-City Comparison of Commercial Building Benchmarking and Disclosure Laws|Information failures may help explain the so-called “energy efficiency gap” in commercial buildings, which account for approximately 20 percent of annual US energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Building owners may not fully comprehend what influences energy use in their buildings and may have difficulty credibly communicating building energy performance to prospective tenants and buyers. Ten US cities and one county have addressed this problem by passing energy benchmarking and disclosure laws. The laws require commercial buildings to report their annual energy use to the government. We evaluate whether the laws have had an effect on utility expenditures in office buildings covered by the laws in four of the early adopting cities—Austin, New York, San Francisco, and Seattle—and find that they have reduced utility expenditures by about 3 percent. Our view is that these estimated effects in the early days of the programs are largely attributable to increased attentiveness to energy use.
L95|The privatisation of urban water services: theory and empirical evidence in the case of Spain|Following the wave of deregulation and privatisation of public firms that started in Anglo-Saxon economies in the late 1970s, most industrialised countries changed their laws to encourage the contracting out of local services. Accordingly, in 1985 many Spanish municipalities began to privatise their urban water services. However, three decades after the first privatisations took place, and against a backdrop of increasing opposition to new privatisations, several municipalities are now returning to the public provision of these services. In this context, after establishing a theoretical framework for privatisation, this paper goes on to describe the main features of the process of privatisation of urban water services in Spain, as well as recent trends towards remunicipalisation. With no clear empirical evidence as to whether public or private management of urban water services is better, this ongoing debate is set to continue and will be strongly influenced by prevailing ideological trends as well as other environmental factors.

L95|Private Sector Involvement in Water Services: Theoretical Foundations and Empirical Evidence|Water services management has become a key issue as urban water supply is considered a service of general interest in the European Union (EU, 2001). In this context, public-private partnerships (PPP) have emerged as a usual way of local water services provision. This paper contributes to analyze the effects and consequences of PPP in the management of water resources. First of all, we develop a theoretical framework to show the effects of water services contracting-out on water prices. Second, we estimate the model using a sample of Spanish municipal water services recently privatized. Our findings support that, in a context of limited resources, local governments are using public-private partnerships in order to get additional fundings to reduce their indebt- ness levels. Moreover, the fact of setting a high reservation price as a way to guarantee a minimum amount of resources has had consequences in terms of water price increases after water services privatization.
L95|Welfare Effects of Water Pricing in Germany|The observed two-part tariff price structure (consisting of a lump-sum price and linear marginal price) for drinking water in Germany does not reflect the cost structure reported in the literature. Recovering marginal costs from a sample of 251 German counties, we see that there are positive price-cost margins, while lump-sum prices are too low. A price structure readjustment along welfare economic principles (marginal cost pricing, lump-sum price ensures cost-recovery) would increase the mean consumer surplus by 0.037% of the local GDP or €2.129 million per county, assuming a share of 15% variable costs in total costs.
L95|Network access and market power|We use cooperative game theory to study the impact of the liberalization of EU natural gas markets on the balance of power between ‘local champions', customers, and outside producers, such as Russian Gazprom. We calibrate a model of the Eurasian gas network and distinguish between two steps of the reform: first, the opening of access to transit pipes and second, the opening of access to distribution systems, hence customers. Using the Shapley Value as a power index, we find a modest and rather heterogeneous impact from the first step. The impact of the second step is much larger and yields a clear pattern: all local champions lose, while all customers and all outside players gain. As one third of the losses of champions within EU leaks to players abroad, current reforms might enhance the dominance of already powerful outside producers. When network power is assessed with the nucleolus, in contrast, full liberalization of access to customers does not benefit outside producers at all.
L95|La riforma della distribuzione gas in Italia: implicazioni patrimoniali, finanziarie e di regulation|The effects of a complex liberalisation process in local gas distribution are examined in this paper. The aim of this analysis is to emphasise the multidimensional aspects of such a reform in gas market regulation at local level. First of all, Local Public Finance will bear strong losses due to minimisation of local public networks' remuneration and as a consequences of potential losses in local public small/medium firms. Also effective competition will be very feeble, due to strong financial barriers to entry the market. An oligopolistic scenario is probable, if not almost sure, for Gas Distribution Industry in the next few years, as the announced reform will be implemented without any correction in Public Regulation.
L95|Corporate Governance in der Energiewirtschaft – zwischen Unternehmenswert und Public Value|Eine verantwortungsvolle Corporate Governance soll dazu beitragen, dass einerseits das Energieunternehmen und andererseits der wesentliche Gesellschafter, die Kommune, bei der Erfüllung ihrer Ziele unterstützt werden. Wie jeder private Anteilseigner strebt die politische Führung einer Kommune einen angemessenen Einfluss auf Entscheidungen bei den Beteiligungen der kommunalen Stadtwirtschaft an. Neben dem Vertrauen in eine geeignete Geschäftsleitung und einer effektiven Unternehmensaufsicht ist besonders die Ausgestaltung des Zielsystems erfolgskritisch. Für das Zielsystem von kommunalen Energieunternehmen präsentiert der Artikel die beiden Konzepte Wertorientierte Unternehmensführung und Public Value Management. Auch wenn die Kapitalgeber bei der wertorientierten Steuerung im Vordergrund stehen, sind auch zufriedene Stakeholder die Voraussetzung für eine Erhöhung des Unternehmenswerts. Ein Wert für die Kapitalgeber wird nur geschaffen, wenn die Kunden einen hohen Nutzen wahrnehmen, die Lieferanten für ihre Produkte und Dienstleistungen wertschöpfende Erträge erwirtschaften und die Beschäftigten angemessen vergütet werden. Entsprechend ist dabei auch der Public Value zu berücksichtigen. Public Values sind Werte für die Gesellschaft, für die Bürgerinnen und Bürger einer Gebietskörperschaft oder Region. Eine Orientierung des Energieunternehmens hin zum Public Value führt zu einem ganzheitlichen Verständnis des Unternehmens als Mitglied, als aktiver und kooperierender Teil des Netzwerks Kommune. Folgende Public Values werden vorgestellt: Einbezug der Öffentlichkeit, Gesellschaftliches Engagement, Ökologische Nachhaltigkeit, Querverbund, Förderung der Gründungsregion und das regionalökonomische Netzwerk. Für diese Public Values werden jeweils anwendbare Kennzahlen zur Steuerung und Messung präsentiert. Durch die authentische Berücksichtigung des Public Value im Rahmen der Corporate Governance können sich kommunale Energieunternehmen gegenüber dem Wettbewerb, insbesondere auch den privaten Wettbewerbern differenzieren. Eine bessere Kundenbindung kann die Folge sein. Abschließend werden Ansatzpunkte für die Verbesserung der Corporate Governance im Zuge der Einführung des Public Value Ansatzes und darüber hinaus präsentiert.
L95|Nonparametric measures of returns to scale: an application to German water supply|The evaluation of market structures and the quantification of returns to scale in network industries usually are of high interest for researchers and policy makers. Regarding the debate on optimal market structures in German potable water supply, we use a cross-sectional sample of 364 German water utilities observed in 2006 to derive a nonparametric measure of scale elasticity for the water industry. The data sample is validated by applying a super-efficiency approach and a statistical testing procedure for outlier detection. Besides using a standard data envelopment analysis approach, a conditional efficiency approach is applied to account for the water utilities’ operating environments. The results indicate non-decreasing returns to scale for the majority of water utilities and constant or non-increasing returns for larger utilities. Optimal firm size is found to be generally larger than the current sample median firm size. Efficiency improvements could be realized by increases in firm sizes and through a consolidation of the industry. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014
L95|The experience of private investment in the South African water sector: The Mbombela Concession| South Africa is a water-stressed country that over a protracted period has suffered from poor water service delivery. The major problems are inefficient operations, lack of capacity in spending allocated budgets, unclear management structures, and a long-term decline in capital expenditure. Economists have long argued that private investment will bring good fiscal control and efficient structures and will improve service delivery. However, there may be trade-offs between this improved economic efficiency and the necessity to pursue more egalitarian social outcomes. The purpose of this research is to explore the experience of private-sector investment on operational efficiencies and social objectives in the South African water sector in the Mbombela Concession. The study concludes that, in this case, private investment has enhanced service delivery by improving efficiency, technical skills and the capacity to spend allocated budgets without any significant negative impacts on equitable water distribution.

L95|Gas and Electricity Market Design for a Flexible Operation of Gas-fired Power Plants|Gas‐fired power plants constitute a direct and important link between the gas and the electricity sectors and thus between the Target Models for electricity and gas. As the need for a flexible operation of gas-fired power plants will increase in tomorrow’s low‐carbon power markets, so also will the challenges for market design of both sectors in allowing for flexible trading arrangements. For the electricity markets, options to advance intraday and balancing market design are currently discussed, such as complex bids, the frequency of intraday and balancing market clearing, and the joint optimization of energy and reserve markets. For the gas market, concrete options for design advances are yet to be explored. The success – and the flaws – of the implementation of the new EC Network Codes for gas will provide new food for debates. Last, the interaction between gas and electricity TSOs in balancing the heavily interlinked short-term electricity and gas markets poses a need for (more) coordination between the different types of TSOs.
L95|TSO-TSO-DSO Cooperation: How to align System Operation in Future Power Markets?|With increasing variability of demand and supply, transmission system operators (TSOs) across Europe adapt their internal processes and operational approaches. These processes comprise different interfaces with other market participants (e.g. via balancing markets, reserve procurement or NTC calculation). However, currently internal TSO approaches and market interfaces differ widely among TSOs in Europe. Different methods of reserve procurement, balancing rules, gate closure and algorithms for market clearing prevail. The Target Model aims at improving this situation and therefore is concerned with the definition and alignment of market protocols for these different interfaces. However, currently the focus lies on information exchange and to some extent a standardization of balancing energy products. Placing the core of TSO operation itself, also for system-services and internal market clearing processes, in the center of the debate, could lead to additional benefits both with respect to cross-border network operation as well as cross-border energy trade.

Moreover, the energy represents a public utility with a powerful social impact. Due to these considerations, the development approach of this important sector of Romania’s national economy, is made with specific mechanisms as for a public interest utility, which needs more competitive mechanisms, where the price is formed through a free competition between a diversity of suppliers and clients, which become gradually free to buy the energy they need, based on stable and transparent market mechanisms, supervised by the regulating authorities and trading agents.

L95|What Determines Efficiency? An Analysis of the Italian Water Sector|The Italian water sector has encompassed major changes since mid?90s when law 96/94 has entered into force. Next to private participation, integration of services and growth in production scales, the reform was intended to revolutionize the traditional financial model almost fully based on public funds. Although citizens, politicians and experts on water services have been debating for a long time on the impact of the reform on the industry, as well as on the fairness of a tariff system inspired by the concept of full cost recovery, we are still on a state of uncertainty. The final purpose of this paper is to provide regulators with guidelines that could be used to revise water tariffs in a way that may be cost?efficient, sustainable and fair to the most. According to the analyses, which rely on firm?specific Xinefficiency scores, despite a satisfactory mean level of performance, in the period under investigation, efficiency improvements have been limited. Moreover, the results demonstrate that both the ownership structure and politics do have an impact on the efficiency of the firms: in particular, public shareholding and centreright local governments negatively affects firms’ performances. To this respect, we think that a more effective regulation would also have the side effect of loosening the ties between politicians and managers.

L95|Análisis del entorno institucional y de política pública. Así como de la evolución de la generación y el consumo de agua y de las inversiones en acueducto y alcantarillado, con el fin de valorar el reto que representa el Plan de Desarrollo de Bogotá Human|El aumento de población en el territorio de la Sabana de Bogotá incrementará la demanda de agua a un ritmo de 2,47% anual hasta el 2032. La oferta de agua según la estimación realizada hace 10 años en el anterior plan de abastecimiento era de 21 m3/seg; sin embargo, diferentes razones climáticas, ambientales y sociales han comprometido la calidad del agua en la Cuenca Alta del Río de Bogotá, por lo cual las estimaciones se han reajustado hasta 16-19 m3/seg. Lo anterior implica que se deberán efectuar inversiones para atender la demanda creciente de la región. La Empresa de Acueducto y Alcantarillado de Bogotá encomendó a Fedesarrollo realizar un análisis de la coyuntura de los recursos hídricos en Bogotá y los municipios de la región. Este estudio se enfoca en la identificación de los diferentes factores que afectan las actuales tendencias de demanda y oferta de agua potable y alcantarillado y su posible impacto a 2032 desde el punto de vista demográfico, económico, territorial y ambiental. Por el lado de la oferta, el creciente deterioro en la calidad de las fuentes hídricas está afectando la capacidad de suministro, pues en ocasiones la captación de agua con características fisicoquímicas adecuadas para el tratamiento no es suficiente. Este deterioro progresivo está ligado al desorden en el crecimiento del territorio, ya que en los últimos años se han asentado actividades humanas en zonas que impactan la calidad del agua. Del lado de la demanda, el crecimiento de la población, el aumento del ingreso de la población y políticas como la del mínimo vital jalonarán el crecimiento del consumo de agua, y la apuesta por una ciudad más compacta implicará una recomposición de la demanda de agua en su interior. Finalmente, como complemento, el estudio también analiza la política del mínimo vital en el servicio de agua en Bogotá, con la cual la administración distrital tiene el objetivo de reducir la desigualdad y generar un mayor ingreso disponible para las familias pobres de la ciudad. Las situaciones descritas, sumadas al envejecimiento de las redes actuales en la ciudad de Bogotá, hacen necesario que se impulsen estrategias de gestión del territorio y mecanismos de financiamiento de nuevas inversiones por parte de la ciudad y la región. En este contexto, este estudio plantea estrategias para una gestión integral del recurso hídrico que permita responder a las necesidades de agua en la región.

L95|Market power consolidation and M&A success: A study of US-American and German utility takeovers|A wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) was observed in the North American and European energy utilities market. We analyze the impact of these M&A transactions on market power, studying 139 takeovers of energy utilities by applying event study methodology. Stock price reactions of acquiring and target firms as well as of their competitors are used to detect changes of market power. While we do not find any significant results pointing in this direction for transactions in the US, our findings indicate that the potential to increase market power is indeed an important motive for takeovers within the German energy utilities market.

This article delivers an overview of several estimates of the investment requirement in the European energy sector and estimates the total required investment expenditures until 2030. To ensure the financing of these investment expenditures, further adaptation of the legal framework in the European member states is necessary; even most importantly, the regulatory framework of cross-border infrastructure projects needs to be improved.
L95|European Natural Gas Supply Secure Despite Political Crises|Natural gas is a significant contributor to European energy supply. Hence, the political crisis between Russia and Ukraine increases fears of the consequences of Russia suspending natural gas supplies to Ukraine and the European Union. The last time this had occurred was in the winter of 2009 when Russia and Ukraine disputed about the price of natural gas and transit costs. However, the European Union has subsequently increased the security of its gas supply. Progress has been made in implementing the measures proposed by the European Commission, particularly the diversification of supply sources and the expansion of natural gas infrastructure to secure supply from various countries. The opportunities to ease temporary supply bottlenecks have improved significantly within the Union in recent years. Nevertheless, Russia remains a major supplier of natural gas to the EU. The Russian gas company Gazprom plays a key role in Eastern Europe and is also gaining importance in Germany. However, this dependency is not a one-way street: Russia generates high export revenues from its natural gas trade and currently has few alternatives to exporting to the EU. Model calculations by DIW Berlin show that Europe can largely cope with a supply disruption by Russia via Ukraine. Some Eastern European countries, however, would struggle to fully offset a complete suspension of Russian supply. To further increase supply security in Europe in the medium term, it will be necessary to continue diversifying gas supplies, particularly by making more efficient use of existing infrastructure, and expanding pipelines and capacity to import liquefied natural gas. Additionally, Europe should consider setting up strategic gas reserves. Another important step would be to continue to improve energy efficiency in all sectors and consistently expand renewable energy sources as part of the European energy and climate strategy.

Consequently, the political crisis between Russia and Ukraine increases fears of the consequences of Russia suspending natural gas supplies to Ukraine and the European Union. The last time this occurred was in the winter of 2009, as Russia and Ukraine disputed the price of natural gas and transit costs. However, the European Union has subsequently increased the security of its gas supply. Measures proposed by the European Commission are becoming more and more successful, particularly the diversification of sources of supply and an accompanying expansion of natural gas infrastructure to secure supply from third-party countries. Opportunities to ease temporary supply bottlenecks have improved significantly within the Community in recent years. Nevertheless, Russia remains a major supplier of natural gas to the EU. The Russian gas corporation Gazprom is gaining importance in Eastern Europe, and increasingly also in Germany. However, this dependency is not a one-way street: Russia generates high export revenues from its natural gas trade. It currently has few alternatives to exporting to the EU. Model calculations by DIW Berlin show that Europe can cope with any supply disruption by Russia via Ukraine. Some Eastern European countries, however, suffer most from a complete supply stop by Russia. To further increase supply security to Europe in the medium term, it will be necessary to continue diversifying gas supplies, especially by making more efficient use of existing infrastructure, and expanding its pipelines and its capacity to import liquefied natural gas. Additionally, Europe should consider building up strategic gas reserves. It also seems advisable to continue to improve energy efficiency in all areas and consistently expand renewable energies as part of its energy and climate strategy. Erdgas leistet einen wichtigen Beitrag zur europäischen Energieversorgung. Umso mehr schürt die politische Krise zwischen Russland und der Ukraine die Angst vor den Folgen eines möglichen russischen Lieferstopps von Erdgas in die Ukraine und die Europäische Union. Zu einem solchen Ereignis kam es zuletzt im Winter 2009, als sich Russland und die Ukraine über den Erdgaspreis und die Transitgebühren stritten. Seither hat die Europäische Union die Sicherheit ihrer Erdgasversorgung jedoch erhöht. Die Umsetzung der von der Europäischen Kommission vorgeschlagenen Maßnahmen, insbesondere die Diversifizierung der Bezugsquellen und der damit verbundene Ausbau der Erdgasinfrastruktur zur Belieferung aus Drittländern, ist vorangekommen. Die Möglichkeiten, temporäre Versorgungsengpässe zu überbrücken, haben sich in den vergangenen Jahren auch innerhalb der Gemeinschaft deutlich verbessert. Dennoch bleibt Russland ein wichtiger Erdgaslieferant der EU. Der russische Erdgaskonzern Gazprom spielt in Osteuropa und zunehmend auch in Deutschland eine wichtige Rolle. Gleichwohl gibt es keine einseitige Abhängigkeit Europas: Russland erzielt hohe Exporteinnahmen aus dem Handel mit Erdgas und besitzt derzeit nur wenige Alternativen zum Export in die EU. Modellrechnungen des DIW Berlin zeigen, dass Europa eine mögliche Lieferunterbrechung Russlands durch die Ukraine weitestgehend kompensieren kann. Einen kompletten Lieferstopp Russlands könnten einige osteuropäische Länder dagegen nur bedingt ausgleichen. Um die Versorgungssicherheit in Europa mittelfristig weiter zu erhöhen, ist es notwendig, die Diversifizierung des Erdgasbezugs weiter fortzusetzen, insbesondere über eine effizientere Nutzung der bestehenden Infrastruktur sowie einen Ausbau der Importkapazitäten für verflüssigtes Erdgas und der Pipelines. Auch sollte eine strategische Gasreserve in Betracht gezogen werden. Wichtig ist zudem, die Energieeffizienz in allen Bereichen weiter zu verbessern und erneuerbare Energien im Zuge der europäischen Energie- und Klimastrategie weiterhin konsequent auszubauen.
L95|Europäische Energiewirtschaft: hoher Investitionsbedarf für Nachhaltigkeit und Versorgungssicherheit|For the European Union to keep on track with its energy and climate targets, large investments are required in electricity generation, infrastructure and energy efficiency. The electricity sector takes the center stage.

Damit die Europäische Union ihre selbstgesteckten Energie- und Klimaziele erreichen kann, sind umfangreiche Investitionen in die Stromerzeugung, die Strom- und Erdgasinfrastruktur sowie in die Energieeffizienz notwendig. Eine zentrale Bedeutung kommt dabei dem Stromsektor zu. Dieser DIW Wochenbericht liefert einen Überblick über verschiedene Kostenschätzungen des Investitionsbedarfs im Energiesektor und schätzt die zu erwartenden Gesamtkosten ab. Zur Finanzierung dieser Investitionen bedarf es der konsequenten Umsetzung der europäischen Rahmenbedingungen auf nationaler Ebene; vor allem aber sollte der Regulierungsrahmen für grenzüberschreitende Infrastrukturprojekte gestärkt werden.
L95|Elasticities of Supply for the US Natural Gas Market|In this paper we investigate natural gas producer's reactions to changes in market prices. We estimate price elasticities of aggregated supply in the most competitive market for natural gas: the United States. Using monthly time series data form 1987 to 2012 our analysis is based on an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Bound Cointegration approach to obtain short and long-run elasticities of natural gas supply. Results suggest that natural gas producers in a competitive market are not able to react to prices in the very short-run but respond inelastic in the long-run. These findings are not only of great value for policy makers but also for gas market modelers.
L95|Increasing Block Tariffs in the Water Sector – An Interpretation in Terms of Social Preferences|Many developing countries around the world apply progressive water tariffs, often structured in the form of discretely increasing block tariffs (IBTs). These tariffs have been criticized in the welfare economic literature due to their perceived inefficiency: many of the prices charged under IBTs do not correspond to marginal costs and thus violate the principle of allocative efficiency. In this paper we explore an alternative interpretation of the widespread use of IBTs, in terms of social preferences and fairness considerations. For this, we rely on an extension of the Fehr, E., and K. Schmidt (1999. “A Theory of Fairness, Competition, and Cooperation.” Quarterly Journal of Economics 114: 817–868.) utility function, including inequality aversion, to which we add another parameter representing a reference for redistribution which reflects a societal preference to correct for income difference perceived as unfair. Additionally, the model includes a variable on household size, finding that, as poor households are on average larger, a simple IBT tariff disregarding household size may not be “fair”.
L95|Access to natural gas storage facilities: Strategic and regulation issues|In this paper, we analyze the strategic function of gas storage focusing on how gas storage decisions impact competition between gas companies on both spot and downstream markets. Using a two-tier oligopolistic structure, we first show that gas storage is actually used strategically even in a symmetric oligopolistic setting along the gas value chain. Storage is then a way to intensify competition on the spot market. Second, we analyze the setting where a company has favored access to storage, for example due to a historical monopolistic position, and we analyze this as a leadership situation in the context of TPA regulation. We then show that this setting compels the leader to adopt a strategic storage decision. This strategy consists of levels of gas stored being greater than supplies available in the downstream market. Such a leader decision is part of a strategy to raise a rival's costs. Furthermore, one can think that optimal regulation of the access to storage facilities would prevent such a behavior. However, especially when storage is not too costly, we show that preventing a storage strategy for the leader is not optimal, since the strategy helps to reduce the spot market price.
L95|Strategic Eurasian natural gas market model for energy security and policy analysis: Formulation and application to South Stream|The mathematical formulation of a strategic Eurasian natural gas market model is presented. The model represents horizontal oligopolistic relationships among producers, bilateral market power between producer (Russia) and transit (Ukraine) countries, detailed transport constraints, and operation decisions over a 20year time horizon. To demonstrate the model's capabilities, a financial and market analysis of the proposed South Stream gas pipeline from Russia via the Black Sea to South Europe is summarized. Insights obtained include the following. First, expectations of high demand growth in Europe and/or transit risks do not justify the construction of the South Stream pipeline because under all demand and Ukraine transit interruption scenarios, the net benefits to the South Stream participants are negative (the NPV ranges from −$1.9billion (bn) to −$7.4bn). Second, Ukraine's perception of high transit market power vis-à-vis Russia may trigger the construction of the otherwise unprofitable South Stream project. Thus, under Ukraine's high transit market power scenario, the NPV of South Stream ranges between $2.4bn and $24.5bn. Third, we find that the South Stream investment increases the efficiency of the European gas market under the following conditions: (i) when gas demand in Europe grows 2% per year up to 2030, (ii) when Ukraine poses high transit market power, or (iii) under a combination of severe transit risks through Ukraine and low demand scenarios in Europe. It should be noted that the value of South Stream to both its project sponsors and the market as a whole is much higher when Ukraine exercises transit market power than under the high demand scenario. Therefore, whether Ukraine is likely to wield market power is crucial to the success of the South Stream project because that is the only scenario in which the project yields both a positive expected NPV to its sponsors and the highest value to the market as a whole.
L95|Estimating base temperatures in econometric models that include degree days|Heating and cooling degree days are in common use in conditional demand models, billing analysis, and large-scale energy forecasts. The implications of either choosing an ex-ante base temperature, or scanning over the base temperatures, as suggested in Fels (1986) and recommended by some evaluation protocols, are infrequently considered. These procedures result in biased estimates of weather-driven loads because of correlated errors-in-variables, and impart a downward bias to the variance of those estimates by a factor of two. A non-linear estimation procedure that corrects for these biases and an ex-ante correction factor for evaluating prior evaluations are offered.
L95|Price discrimination and limits to arbitrage: An analysis of global LNG markets|Gas prices around the world vary widely despite being connected by international trade of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Some industry observers argue that major exporters have acted irrationally by not arbitraging prices. This is also difficult to reconcile with a competitive model in which regional price differences exist solely because of transport costs. We show that a model which incorporates market power can rationalize observed prices and trade flows. We highlight how different features of the LNG market limit the ability and/or incentive of other players to engage in arbitrage, including constraints in LNG shipping. We also present some rough estimates of market power in short-term sales by Qatar (to Japan and the UK), and discuss the potential impact of US LNG exports.
L95|The impact of regulation, privatization and competition on gas infrastructure investments|In recent years we have witnessed several reforms in network industries, as privatization, regulatory changes and opening to competition in certain segments of the value chain. In sectors such as electricity and gas, this opening to competition is possible only in certain activities (i.e. generation, storage of natural gas and supply), maintaining as a natural monopoly the activities of distribution and transmission, and therefore still subject to regulation.
L95|Will additional federal enforcement improve the performance of pipelines in the U.S.?|This paper provides the first empirical analysis of the effectiveness of regulatory enforcement in increasing the environmental and safety performance of U.S. natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline operators. The analysis combines data on federal regulatory inspections, enforcement actions, and penalties with data on injuries, fatalities, property damage, and barrels of product lost through pipeline “incidents” for 2006–2011 for the 344 largest pipeline operators in the U.S. The results of the analysis do not provide compelling evidence that either federal inspections or civil penalties are particularly effective in increasing performance; however, the number of federal cases initiated against an operator does have a significant effect on many forms of performance, although not for incidents in general. The results also suggest that some targeting of federal enforcement resources is based on past performance, but there may be room for even more effective targeting. Finally, the analysis reveals interesting patterns between state and federal enforcement efforts.
L95|Perceived price in residential water demand: Evidence from a natural experiment|Under complicated billing structures, the price to which consumers respond remains inconclusive. In this paper, I exploit a quasi-experiment to estimate a causal effect of price for residential water customers during the introduction of increasing block rates for a North Carolina utility. Perceived price is identified through a billing anomaly in which changes in marginal and average prices move in opposite directions. Empirical results contribute evidence that residential water customers respond to average price. Average price elasticity estimates vary from −0.43 to −1.14 across the distribution of consumption in triple-difference models, with an estimate of −0.31 in the tightest bandwidth of regression discontinuity specifications.
L95|The child health implications of privatizing africa's urban water supply|Can private sector participation (PSP) in the piped water sector improve child health? I use child-level data from 39 African countries during 1986–2010 to show that PSP decreases diarrhea among urban-dwelling, under-five children by 2.6 percentage points, or 16% of its mean prevalence. Children from the poorest households benefit most. PSP is also associated with a 7.8 percentage point increase in school attendance of 7–17 year olds. Importantly, PSP increases usage of piped water by 9.7 percentage points, suggesting a possible causal channel explaining health improvements. To attribute causality, I exploit time-variation in the private water market share controlled by African countries’ former colonizers. A placebo analysis reveals that PSP does not affect respiratory illness, nor does it affect a control group of rural children.
L95|Utility regulation in Africa: How relevant is the British model?|This article considers whether African utility regulators can draw useful lessons from the British experience over the past thirty years. We focus on three features that are considered key properties of the British regulatory model: price-cap incentive regulation, independent regulatory agencies and an emphasis on introducing competition where possible. For each property, we ask how relevant the model is for most African countries. Overall, we argue that although the British model probably has some lessons which can help improve utility performance in Africa, the problems that they help to solve are generally second-order. Ultimately, institutional weaknesses are the main root of regulatory failure in many African countries, and these weaknesses call for a model of regulation designed specifically to address them.
L95|Economies of scale and scope in Australian urban water utilities|This paper estimates economies of scale and scope for 55 major Australian urban utilities over the period 2005/06 to 2008/09. The models used specify operating and capital costs as a function of chemical and microbiological compliance, water losses, water quality and service, water main breaks, total connected properties, and urban water supplied. The input variables used to help determine water utility costs include the density of properties served and the sourcing of water from bulk suppliers, groundwater, recycling and surface water. In terms of economies of scale, the evidence suggests strong economies of scale at relatively low levels of output (50–75% of current mean output). In terms of product-specific economies of scale (increasing the scale of a specific output in isolation), there is substantially stronger evidence that the operating costs of urban water utilities would benefit from increasing scale with regard to chemical compliance, water quality and service complaints, and the number of connected properties. In contrast, capital costs would benefit from scale increases with regard to the management of water losses and water main breaks. For economies of scope, it is clear that there are substantial cost benefits from the joint production of treated quality water delivered across a network with minimal water losses and main breaks. The main cost advantage at all levels of output is decreasing water losses, and this would benefit both operating and capital costs.
L95|The efficiency effects of merging Italian water companies|"The Italian water sector is highly fragmented. Legislative reforms proposed during time tried to steer the industry towards greater consolidation of the service suppliers. The underlying consideration is that an increase in operational scale can generate potential improvements in efficiency and hence a reduction in tariffs. Using the methodology Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), this paper investigates, for the first time on the Italian case, the potential gains or losses associated with merger plans between companies within regional territories. The results generally indicate potential efficiency gains achievable at the individual levels. A positive ""pure"" effect due to merger seems to hold when very small companies are involved, even if the on average merger itself does not seem to play a significant role."
L95|Working Paper 10-14 - De prijs van elektriciteit en aardgas voor ondernemingen in België - Samenstelling, niveau en evolutie ten opzichte van de buurlanden|In 2012 ever growing prices of electricity and natural gas compelled the federal governmentto take measures to better control these prices, and thus improve Belgian competitiveness. This studyexplores the evolution of the prices of electricity and natural gas for enterprises in Belgium and threeneighbouring countries. It is done for 2007 - 2014 and using energy price data from Eurostat and someother sources. The average electricity prices in Belgium have long been the second highest of the fourcountries, but the price increases were less strong than in Germany and France. That’s why today theprices are moderate to low, suggesting that the measures must have been effective. During the wholeperiod since 2007, the prices of natural gas were relatively low. Still, attention should be paid to theprices, in particular those of electricity. This is of uttermost importance for energy-intensivemanufacturing. All for countries grant discounts on energy levies, in some cases even on networktariffs. The position energy-intensive manufacturing in Belgium may therefore be less favourable thanwould be suggested by the average prices. Hence, it remains important to analyse energy prices forenergy-intensive manufacturing.
L95|Can Information Reduce Nonpayment for Public Utilities? Experimental Evidence from South Africa|"Nonpayment for public utilities is an important constraint to expanding service access in developing countries. As a potential policy response, this study implements and evaluates a randomized water education campaign in a low income peri-urban area in South Africa. We estimate substantial treatment effects: on the order of a 30% increase in payments over a three-month period. Surprisingly, these effects are not driven by an increase in householdsâ€™ knowledge. We consider various possible explanations, and argue that the intervention likely had ""nudging"" effects on households. Our findings have important implications for understanding energy conservation and other public information campaigns."
L95|Microeconometric Analysis of Residential Water Demand|This paper develops a structural model for obtaining price elasticities and evaluating consumer’s response to changes in nonlinear tariffs when only panel data on household consumption are available. The model and the empirical strategy address problems implied by nonlinear tariffs, existence of a fixed cost, and use of limited data, giving rise to a random effects model with a nonlinear individual effect. Results show that the estimated model does well at fitting data and demand is inelastic, although elasticity varies by initial consumption block. Then, I estimate welfare consequences of implementing several demand policies. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014
L95|The economic performance of Swiss drinking water utilities|This paper measures the performance in terms of costs of Swiss drinking water utilities accounting for environmental factors. We estimate a translog stochastic variable cost frontier using two different techniques on an unbalanced panel of 141 water distribution utilities over the years 2002–2009, for a total of 745 observations. Results show that exogenous factors have an impact on variable cost. More precisely, we find that the share of pumped over total extracted water, population density, altitude and meteorological factors (maximum 30 days temperature and extreme precipitation events) have a significant impact on variable cost. Likelihood ratio tests emphasize the importance to include observed heterogeneity in the estimations. Efficiency rankings provided by models accounting for exogenous factors and their counterparts without them are however relatively similar. On the contrary, the efficiency ranks differ strongly between alternative estimation techniques. In assessing the economic performance of utilities, the most important choice thus seems to be about the way unobserved heterogeneity is treated.

L95|Under pressure: community water systems in the United States—a production model with water quality and organization type effects|This paper examines the interaction of productive efficiency, water quality and organizational type. A water quality index is constructed employing various contaminants which are then treated together with variables including organizational type as endogenous in an input distance function model. The cost of drinking water quality and inefficiency are derived and hypothesis tests estimated concerning their variation by location, organization type and water quality. The key findings are that more technically efficient water utilities deliver higher quality drinking water and that private firms distribute higher quality water at a higher price and at a higher implicit cost than public utilities despite no overall inefficiency differences between the two organizational types.

L95|Regulated price reforms and unregulated substitutes: the case of residential piped gas in Argentina|This paper examines the impact of regulated piped gas price changes on connection decisions and households’ welfare. The analysis explicitly considers bottled gas as a substitute for piped gas and therefore uses a simple utility maximization model that yields both a gas-type choice model and a demand specification whose parameterization allows examining households’ responses to regulated price changes. The results show that relative gas prices and household features explain households’ piped gas usage. They also provide insights on the distribution of welfare changes. The findings illustrate the impact of tariff rebalancing and unregulated substitutes on further access to regulated network services. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
L95|Productivity throughout regulatory cycles in gas utilities|This paper examines productivity patterns in price cap regulated utilities around price reviews. We specify a variable cost function that we estimate using alternative specifications of technical change. Results show that the pattern of pure technical change differs within and between regulatory cycles. They also provide evidence that exogenous investment reduces the ratchet-problem, that strategic cost cutting behavior is reduced when regulatory cycles are short and that, absent these two features, industry productivity is consistent with strategic cost cutting behavior.

L95|Service quality, scale economies and ownership: an econometric analysis of water supply costs|Issues related to service quality are crucial for water utility management and regulation. Omitting these aspects, especially when they are treated as exogenous, can lead to large biases in estimating cost functions as well as to misleading information concerning technology. In this article, we integrate the output multi-dimension in the cost function, considering delivered water volume and service quality as being endogenous. Network-related scale measures and private versus public ownership are investigated with the objective of evaluating how endogenous quality may affect their impact on costs. A translog cost model is estimated from a dataset of US water utilities. It is shown that including the quality level of the delivered services has a significant impact on scale economies and ownership effects. Significant economies of scope confirm the existence of trade-offs between water production and service quality. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
L95|Ownership unbundling of natural gas transmission networks: empirical evidence|The European Commission has intensively examined the mandatory separation of natural gas transmission from production and services. However, economic theory is ambiguous on the price effects of vertical separation. In this paper, we empirically analyze the effect of ownership unbundling of gas transmission networks, considered to be the strongest form of vertical separation, on the level of end-user prices. Therefore, we apply different dynamic estimators such as system GMM and the bias-corrected least-squares dummy variable estimator to an unbalanced panel consisting of 18 EU countries over 19 years, allowing us to avoid the endogeneity problem and to estimate the long-run effects of regulation. We introduce a set of regulatory indicators as market entry regulation, ownership structure, vertical separation and market structure, as well as account for structural and economic country specifics. Among the different estimators, we consistently find that ownership unbundling has no impact on natural gas end-user prices, while the more modest legal unbundling reduces them significantly. Furthermore, third-party access, market structure and privatization show significant influence, with the latter leading to higher prices. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
L95|Economic Factors of Competition Development in Russian Gas Industry|The article analyzes economic factors of competition development in Russian gas industry. The analysis is conducted on the basis of comparison of structural characteristics of competition with peculiarities of industrial markets in different stages of production process in the gas industry. The conclusion about the necessity to keep vertical integration with competition in the industry is maintained with the analysis of alternative opportunities of provision of the open access to pipelines for independent extracting companies.
L95|A Retrospective Look on the Ports Sector in Romania Before and After the Global Financial Crisis|Industries and ports services may represent - by attracting domestic and foreign investments, by creating jobs at local level - a catalyst for related activities of goods and services production. As a binder between national and external business area, Ports sector can contribute, through a multiplier effect, to support the economic development of the country. After analyzing the main statistical indicators for Ports activities in Romania, we concluded that there were some unfavourable developments, enhanced by global and financial crisis. The solution to stop these adverse developments could be a domestic or foreign capital infusion, in order to improve the efficiency of Ports activity, to meet the future challenges that European ports might face by 2030.
L95|El impacto del uso del tiempo de las mujeres en el Perú: un recurso escaso y poco valorado en la economía nacional|Las medidas convencionales del bienestar, como el producto bruto interno o la pobreza, no tienen en cuenta los bienes producidos dentro del hogar ni tampoco el trabajo realizado en casa y que no es remunerado. El presente documento revisa la cuantificación del valor agregado generado dentro de un hogar peruano, sobre la base del recálculo que se hace al salario promedio de los trabajadores domésticos. Paralelamente, propone una medida complementaria a la pobreza monetaria, que toma en consideración los requerimientos de tiempo para la producción de un hogar: la pobreza de tiempo. El cálculo de esta última revela que son pobres el 43.7% de la población de 2010, 12.62 puntos porcentuales por encima de la pobreza oficial predicha. Es decir, hay 12.62% de la población cuya vulnerabilidad está oculta frente a la medida convencional de pobreza, que no considera la carencia de tiempo de las personas. La investigación empieza en la sección II, donde se presenta el nuevo cálculo del salario de un trabajador doméstico y, a la luz de éste, se revisa la valoración del PBH en lo que se refiere al método de costo de reemplazo. Al mismo tiempo, se utilizan estos resultados mejorados para visibilizar el aporte de las mujeres al trabajo no remunerado que se realiza dentro del hogar, distinguiendo por diferentes factores geográficos y sociales. En la sección III, se explica la definición de la pobreza de tiempo, su metodología de cálculo y la manera en que ha sido aplicada en otros países de la región; asimismo, se presentan los resultados del cálculo de la pobreza de tiempo para el caso peruano. Finalmente, en la sección IV, se proponen algunas conclusiones y recomendaciones de política a la luz de los resultados encontrados.
L95|Governance Matters: Universal Access to Water|Universal access to water is acknowledged as a fundamental human right which governments have to secure. To improve access to water, it has been argued that an important factor, if not the most important, is to strengthen water sector governance and reduce corruption. Looking at the relationship between governance indicators and access to water sources and controlling for various factors, our contribution fills a gap in proving empirically, for a cross-country analysis including 147 countries, that governance indeed matters. In particular, we add a nuance to the debate, showing that rural population is more vulnerable to weak governance.
L95|Eficiencia energética en el sector de agua y saneamiento: estimaciones utilizando una función de requerimientos de insumo<BR>[Energy efficiency in the water and sanitarion sector: an input requirement function estimate]|We analyze by means of frontier methods (input requirement function) the relative energy efficiency of urban water and sanitation providers in Brazil. We estimate energy savings through measures the sector could implement on variables which control. We find a 63 percent efficiency average, with respect to best practices in the sample (the frontier). We estimate that a 10 percent reduction in unaccounted-for water can reduce 4.2 percent the electricity consumption for the whole sample; also, a reduction in 10 percent of the breach of coverage between sanitation and water can achieve reductions of 1.45 percent in the input under study.
L95|Enabling and Integrative Infrastructure Policy: The Role of Inverse Infrastructures in Local Infrastructure Provision with Special Reference to Finnish Water Cooperatives|Infrastructures are necessary to support the functionality of urban communities. Globalization, increased polycentricity, new trends in governance and tightening public budgets have increased interest in alternative ways of providing such infrastructures. One product of this trend is the ‘inverse infrastructure,’ which refers to a modularized, semi-autonomous and user-driven infrastructure that is a result of the self-organization of local actors. In this study, we discuss the nature of such infrastructures and the challenges they pose to local infrastructure policy with special reference to the case of water cooperatives in Finland. Our conclusion is that inverse infrastructures have a potential to contribute to local infrastructure services either as cost-effective alternative or as supplement to large technical systems. Their full utilization requires, however, enabling and integrative infrastructure policy.
L95|A better deal for consumers and an attractive environment for investors: How the UK’s economic regulators are developing the use of regulatory and competition powers|There are great expectations in the UK for infrastructure and its role in delivering for customers and society, promoting efficiency and economic growth. These expectations are matched by an ambitious forward programme of investments in renewal and expansion of network capacity and quality across sectors, in some cases backed by the government and in others by private investors. Economic regulation and competition have a big role to play in aligning the interests of investors with the interests of customers and society. Specifically, in relation to investors, economic regulation and competition help to ensure investment is efficient, with the right investment taking place the right place, at the right time and at efficient cost. In this context, regulatory coherence and stability has rarely been so important. 2 In this paper we discuss • the relationship between competition and regulation, and the way regulators use their powers; • the importance of independent regulation in helping to ensure the delivery of what customers and society need, want and can afford from regulated sectors, particularly against a background of major investments in UK infrastructure; • how economic regulation needs to learn and evolve if it is to continue to help ensure delivery of what customers and society expect, given that regulated sectors and the environment in which they operate change over time; and • how the regulators are working together to maximise the benefits from coordination or read across between sectors.

This paper discusses: • the relationship between competition and regulation, as well as the way regulators use their powers; • the importance of independent regulation to ensure that consumer services are delivered efficiently, particularly in the context of major infrastructure investments in the United Kingdom; and • how UK economic regulators work together to improve the efficiency, uniformity and productivity of economic regulation.
L95|Energy Situation In The Western Balkan Countries|This paper analyzes the current situation in the energy sector in the Western Balkans. Since this region was affected by war a little more than a decade ago, the energy sector and in particular infrastructure requires additional investments in reconstruction and development. After democratic changes all countries have applied for membership in the European Union, and currently have a different status as an candidate or potential candidate with a clear orientation for membership in the EU community-28th. Given that energy is one of the sectors in which it is necessary to align the legal framework with EU legislation, guidelines of Energy 2020 - A strategy for competitive, sustainable and secure energy are binding for the countries of the Western Balkans. Hence, the use of renewable energy resources and reducing greenhouse gase emision are not only a necessity but also the obligation arising from the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries. In this paper we point to the potential and energy management capabilities of renewable energy resources.
L95|Efficient Retail Pricing in Electricity and Natural Gas Markets|"A long line of research investigates whether the retail prices of electricity and natural gas send proper signals about scarcity in order to induce efficient consumption. Historically, regulated utilities have not designed tariffs that set marginal prices equal to marginal costs. Currently, some jurisdictions are opening the retail sectors to competition via ""retail choice."" These new regimes replace imperfect regulation with imperfect competition as the process by which retail tariffs are formed. We discuss the challenges in evaluating the efficiency of tariffs and present evidence of how pricing has changed in markets with retail choice."
