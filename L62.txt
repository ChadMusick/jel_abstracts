L62|Blurred Boundaries: A Flexible Approach for Segmentation Applied to the Car Market|Prominent features of differentiated product markets are segmentation and product proliferation that blurs the boundaries between segments. I develop a tractable demand model, the Ordered Nested Logit, which allows for asymmetric substitution between segments. I apply the model to the automobile market where segments are ordered from small to luxury. I find that consumers, when substituting outside their vehicle segment, are more likely to switch to a neighboring segment. Accounting for such asymmetric substitution matters when evaluating the impact of new product introduction or the effect of subsidies on fuel-efficient cars.
L62|Costs of Submarine Maintenance at Public and Private Shipyards|Public shipyards, which are owned and operated by the Navy, conduct a large majority of all submarine maintenance. To reduce delays at public shipyards, the Navy sent 29 submarines to private shipyards for Docking Selected Restricted Availability (DSRA) overhauls between 1993 and 2017. During that period, 117 DSRA overhauls were done at public shipyards. The overhauls conducted at private shipyards have been 31 percent less expensive, on average, by CBOâ€™s estimate. That gap has narrowed in recent years, but CBOâ€™s data include only one overhaul at a private shipyard after 2010.
L62|Consumer myopia in vehicle purchases: evidence from a natural experiment|A central question in the analysis of fuel-economy policy is whether consumers are myopic with regards to future fuel costs. We provide the first evidence on consumer valuation of fuel economy from a natural experiment. We examine the short-run equilibrium effects of an exogenous restatement of fuel-economy ratings that affected 1.6 million vehicles. Using the implied changes in willingness-to-pay, we find that consumers act myopically: consumers are indifferent between $1 in discounted fuel costs and 15-38 cents in the vehicle purchase price when discounting at 4%. This myopia persists under a wide range of assumptions.
L62|Smart products: liability, timing of market introduction, and investments in product safety|This paper addresses the role of product liability for the emergence and development of smart products such as autonomous vehicles (AVs). We analyze how the liability regime affects innovative activities, as well as the timing of market introduction and market penetration of such smart products. We develop a dynamic model in which at each point in time, a potential (monopolistic) innovator decides on how much to invest in the safety stock of the smart product and on the product price, once it has been launched. Calibrating the model to the U.S. car market, our analysis reveals policy-relevant trade-offs when shifting more liability on the producers of AVs. First, while this improves the safety of AVs in the long run, the safety stock is accumulated more slowly. Second, it delays the market introduction of AVs, and also slows down market penetration, which hampers the innovator’s incentives for safety investments in the short- and intermediate term. As a result, the safety level of AVs at a given point in time decreases as the liability regime becomes more stringent. Furthermore, there is a threshold for the innovator’s burden of liability beyond which she forgoes to develop the AV altogether. Finally, we find that direct AV safety regulation is welfare-superior compared to a stringent liability regime, as it induces higher levels of AV safety in the short and intermediate term.
L62|Trust, investment and competition: theory and evidence from German car manufacturers|Based on data from a comprehensive benchmarking study on buyer-supplier relationships in the German automotive industry, we show that more trust in a relationship is associated with higher idiosyncratic investment by suppliers and better part quality - but also with more competition among suppliers. Both associations hold only for parts involving comparatively unsophisticated technology, and disappear for parts involving sophisticated technology. We rationalize all these observations by means of a relational contracting model of repeated procurement with non-contractible, buyer-specific investments. In relationships involving higher trust, buyers are able to induce higher investment and more intense competition among suppliers - but only when the buyer has the bargaining power. This ability disappears when the bargaining power resides with the supplier(s).

L62|Early 20th Century American Exceptionalism: Production, Trade and Diffusion of the Automobile|The beginning of the twentieth century provides a unique opportunity to explore the interaction of rapid technological progress and trade barriers in shaping the worldwide diffusion of a new, highly traded good: the automobile. We scrape historical data on the quantity and value of passenger vehicles exported from the United States to other destination countries, annually from 1913 to 1940. We model the rise of US automobile from global obscurity toward a level dependent upon the extent of long-run pass-through of US prices into destination markets and destination GDP per capita. The results based on a diffusion model with CES preferences and non-unitary income elasticity shows that 62% of the gap in diffusion levels between the U.S. and the rest of the world is due to price frictions such as markups, tariffs, and trade costs, while the remaining 38% is due to income effects.

L62|Digital piracy in Asian countries|Abstract Piracy has been one of the most flamboyant topics in the legal and economic literature of the last two decades. The increased importance assigned to copyright in national economies determined the imposing of this issue as one of the leading voices in the exports of many developed countries. However, the impact of several disruptive innovations (such as the internet and all its related technologies) has weakened the original role of copyright, thus stimulating a wide scholarly literature. While the core of this stream of literature has in general considered consumers like potential infringers and tried to check the impact of piracy on sales and industry profits, a few papers have considered the behavioral perspective. This aspect becomes crucial if one wants to take consumers’ viewpoint into account, while studying the inner factors that led them to infringe copyright. Yet, behavioral law and economics literature teaches us that beside any normative claims, the individuals’ compliance to the law depends on a complex interaction of factors including risk perception, size of sanctions, psychological determinants, and cultural values which jointly determine the social norms that must be properly understood in order to make efficient laws. If a handful of papers have already tried to gain insights on consumers’ behavior in western countries, the issue is still largely neglected in many countries in the rest of the world. This paper takes advantage of a survey conducted through field research in four Asian countries, (China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam) in order to provide an innovative picture of consumers’ behavior and sketch out some more general policy implications.
L62|Micro-work, artificial intelligence and the automotive industry|Abstract This paper delves into the human factors in the “back-office” of artificial intelligence and of its data-intensive algorithmic underpinnings. We show that the production of AI is a labor-intensive process, which particularly needs the little-qualified, inconspicuous and low-paid contribution of “micro-workers” who annotate, tag, label, correct and sort the data that help to train and test smart solutions. We illustrate these ideas in the high-profile case of the automotive industry, one of the largest clients of digital data-related micro-working services, notably for the development of autonomous and connected cars. This case demonstrates how micro-work has a place in long supply chains, where tech companies compete with more traditional industry players. Our analysis indicates that the need for micro-work is not a transitory, but a structural one, bound to accompany the further development of the sector; and that its provision involves workers in different geographical and linguistic areas, requiring the joint study of multiple platforms operating at both global and local levels.
L62|Quelles frontières géographiques pour les systèmes d’innovation technologique ?. Une analyse par les co-brevets appliquée au véhicule à pile à combustible|This paper wishes to contribute to the Technological Innovation System (TIS) literature. More precisely, we study the geographic delineation issue of a focal TIS. In a first part, we explain why co-patents are a good tool for mapping a TIS. Then considering the Fuel Cell Vehicle (FCV) as a focal TIS, we analyse 10 carmakers? co-patent networks in FCV technologies between 2000 and 2013. Our database includes 3,250 co-patents. The results show: 1) the nationalization index is rather strong for 5 carmakers, and weak for 3 others; 2) carmakers call upon different kinds of partners, located, moreover, in different places. The final section learns the lessons from the empirical study. JEL Codes: O31, O33, L62
L62|The future of road transport|"A perfect storm of new technologies and new business models is transforming not only our vehicles, but everything about how we get around, and how we live our lives. The JRC report ""The future of road transport - Implications of automated, connected, low-carbon and shared mobility"" looks at some main enablers of the transformation of road transport, such as data governance, infrastructures, communication technologies and cybersecurity, and legislation. It discusses the potential impacts on the economy, employment and skills, energy use and emissions, the sustainability of raw materials, democracy, privacy and social fairness, as well as on the urban context. It shows how the massive changes on the horizon represent an opportunity to move towards a transport system that is more efficient, safer, less polluting and more accessible to larger parts of society than the current one centred on car ownership. However, new transport technologies, on their own, won't spontaneously make our lives better without upgrading our transport systems and policies to the 21st century. The improvement of governance and the development of innovative mobility solutions will be crucial to ensure that the future of transport is cleaner and more equitable than its car-centred present."
L62|Access to Data in Connected Cars and the Recent Reform of the Motor Vehicle Type Approval Regulation|The need for regulatory solutions for access to in-vehicle data and resources of connected cars is one of the big controversial and unsolved policy issues. Last year the EU revised the Motor Vehicle Type Approval Regulation which already entailed a FRAND-like solution for the access to repair and maintenance information (RMI) to protect competition on the automotive aftermarkets. However, the transition to connected cars changes the technological conditions for this regulatory solution significantly. This paper analyzes the reform of the type approval regulation and shows that the regulatory solutions for access to RMI are so far only very insufficiently capable of dealing with the challenges coming along with increased connectivity, e.g. with regard to the new remote diagnostic, repair and maintenance services. Therefore, an important result of the paper is that the transition to connected cars will require a further reform of the rules for the regulated access to RMI (esp. with regard to data access, interoperability, and safety/security issues). However, our analysis also suggests that the basic approach of the current regulated access regime for RMI in the type approval regulation can also be a model for developing general solutions for the currently unsolved problems of access to in-vehicle data and resources in the ecosystem of connected driving.
L62|Data-sharing in IoT Ecosystems from a Competition Law Perspective: The Example of Connected Cars|This paper analyses whether competition law can help to solve problems of access to data and interoperability in IoT ecosystems, where often one firm has exclusive control of the data produced by a smart device (and of the technical access to this device). Such a gatekeeper position can lead to the elimination of competition for after-market and other complementary services in such IoT ecosystems. This problem is analysed both from an economic and a legal perspective, and also generally for IoT ecosystems as well as for the much discussed problems of â€œaccess to in-vehicle data and resourcesâ€ in connected cars, where the â€œextended vehicleâ€ concept of the car manufacturers leads to such positions of exclusive control. The paper analyses, in particular, the competition rules about abusive behavior of dominant firms (Art. 102 TFEU) and of firms with â€œrelative market powerâ€ (Â§ 20 (1) GWB) in German competition law. These provisions might offer (if appropriately applied and amended) at least some solutions for these data access problems. Competition law, however, might not be sufficient for dealing with all or most of these problems, i.e. that also additional solutions might be needed (data portability, direct data (access) rights, or sector-specific regulation).
L62|Digital transformation in the automotive supply chain: China, Germany, Italy and Japan in a comparative perspective|A wide literature on digital transformation in manufacturing and services has explored its impact on long term changes in labour demand and skills and on productivity and growth. A new perspective on the ongoing digital transformation has been prompted by Oecd to highlight specific metrics needed to assess its impact on the economy and society and to support innovation policies. Drawing on these contributions, this paper aims to shed light on the impact of digital transformation on the reorganization and relocation of the various segments of the automotive supply chain. In particular, it will focus on the effects generated by different paces of adoption of digital technologies in this supply chain, with regard to both the various segments and the various sizes of companies, in different countries. The causes of this heterogeneity will be discussed and the implications for the full impact of the ongoing transformation will be considered in relation to industrial and innovation policy in Europe. The paper addresses the issue by reviewing empirical evidence on the automotive supply chain, which includes the most advanced manufacturing and service companies that are now adopting digital technologies. Evidence from case studies in the automotive industry in China, Germany, Italy and Japan will help in identifying the main challenges of digital transformation for European countries, which will involve a strongly interrelated supply chain both within and outside Europe.
L62|Digital upgrade in the automotive supply chain in Mexico: issues and challenges|The ongoing digital transformation poses diverse challenges to the automotive sector. While the process of digitalisation will lead to technical and organisational changes across and within the global value chains, the ongoing changes in the trade agreements spurred by the Trump administration may change the location advantages of previous plants and their specialisations. In addition, investment in the electric car may offer first-mover advantages in markets, while requiring the re-organisation of the value chains. Mexico, ranked in 2018 as the seventh producer at world level, is an important case study for several reasons: among these, its cost advantages, its former privileged access to the US market, that attracted many OEMs from Europe, Asia, the US, and its role in the prospective regionalization of world trade. By using interviews to automotive suppliers, experts and business associations of the automotive industry, the paper aims at providing a first outline on issues to be addressed in an analysis looking at how these changes are affecting opportunities for the OEMs in their value chains based in the Mexican automotive system.
L62|Monthly Payment Targeting and the Demand for Maturity|In this paper, we provide evidence of the importance of monthly payments in the market for consumer installment debt. Auto debt in particular has grown rapidly since the Great Recession and has eclipsed credit cards in total debt outstanding. Auto-loan maturities have also increased such that most auto-loan originations now have a term of over 72 months. We document three phenomena we jointly refer to as monthly payment targeting. First, using data from 500,000 used auto loans and discontinuities in contract terms offered by hundreds of lenders, we show that demand is more sensitive to maturity than interest rate, consistent with consumers managing payment size when making debt decisions. Second, many consumers appear to employ segregated mental accounts, spending exogenous payment savings on larger loans. Third, consumers bunch at round-number monthly payment amounts, consistent with the use of budgeting heuristics. These patterns hold in subsamples of constrained and unconstrained borrowers, challenging liquidity constraints as a complete explanation. Our estimates suggest that borrower focus on payment size, combined with credit-supply shocks to maturity, could significantly affect aggregate outstanding debt.

L62|Should Electric Vehicle Drivers Pay a Mileage Tax?|In many countries the revenue from gasoline taxes is used to fund highways and other transportation infrastructure. As the number of electric vehicles on the road increases, this raises questions about the effectiveness and equity of this financing mechanism. In this paper, we ask whether electric vehicle drivers should pay a mileage tax. Though the gasoline tax has been traditionally viewed as a benefits tax, we take instead the perspective of economic efficiency. We derive a condition for the optimal electric vehicle mileage tax that highlights a key trade-off. On the one hand, there are externalities from driving including traffic congestion and accidents that imply a mileage tax is efficient. On the other hand, gasoline tends to be underpriced, so a low (or even negative) mileage tax might be justified to encourage substitution away from gasoline-powered vehicles. We then turn to an empirical analysis aimed at better understanding the current policy landscape for electric vehicles in the United States. Using newly available nationally-representative microdata we calculate that electric vehicles have reduced gasoline tax revenues by $250 million annually. We show that the foregone tax revenue is highly concentrated in a handful of states and is highly regressive, as most electric vehicles are driven by high-income households, and we discuss how this motivates and informs optimal policy.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L62|Firms and Collective Reputation: A Study of the Volkswagen Emissions Scandal|This paper uses the 2015 Volkswagen emissions scandal as a natural experiment to provide evidence that collective reputation externalities matter for firms. We find that the Volkswagen scandal reduced the U.S. sales of the other German auto manufacturers—BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Smart—by about 105,000 vehicles worth $5.2 billion. The decline was principally driven by an adverse reputation spillover, which was reinforced by consumer substitution away from diesel vehicles and was partially offset by substitution away from Volkswagen. These estimates come from a model of vehicle demand, the conclusions of which are also consistent with difference-in-differences estimates. We provide direct evidence on internet search behavior and consumer sentiment displayed on social media to support our interpretation that the estimates reflect a reputation spillover.
L62|Early 20th century American exceptionalism: Production, trade and diffusion of the automobile|The beginning of the twentieth century provides a unique opportunity to explore the interaction of rapid technological progress and trade barriers in shaping the worldwide diffusion of a new, highly traded good: the automobile.

We model the rise of US automobile from global obscurity toward a level dependent upon the extent of long-run pass-through of US prices into destination markets and destination GDP per capita. The results based on a diffusion model with CES preferences and non-unitary income elasticity shows that 62% of the gap in diffusion levels between the U.S. and the rest of the world is due to price frictions such as markups, tariffs, and trade costs, while the remaining 38% is due to income effects.
L62|A critical evaluation of the economics of Indian automobile industry|It is a well-known fact that India is emerging as an ‘automobile hub’ for the entire global economy on account of its large pool of talented automobile designers and cost competitive workforce. The present rate of growth in India’s GDP is more than that of China. This promising growth story is also partially on account of robust growth in India’s automobile industry. Almost all the global automobile manufacturers are now directly and indirectly associated with Indian economy for a sustainable business. Yet, there are quite a few gaps in the overall economics of Indian automobile industry. This paper attempts to present these gaps with micro analysis of each aspect impacting the future journey of this most value-adding industry. The paper also attempts to present a few original ideas essential for strengthening the economics of Indian automobile industry. The coverage of this paper comprises of an inquiry into ten different dimensions of the present state of affairs of the Indian automobile industry. It also explores a possible analysis of the potentiality of this industry to act as a growth engine for India’s sustainable economic prosperity. Virtually India also should prove to be a growth engine to push the global economy to its normalcy during the present difficult days.
L62|The determinant factors of automotive industry investment decision in Indonesia|Automotive industry contributes directly and indirectly to economic growth in Indonesia. Investment in this industry has increased after declining in the previous years. This paper examines some internal and external factors influencing the investment decision in this industry by using E-views for listed automotive company in Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2013 to 2017. This study finds that both net cash flow from operation and investment opportunity set (IOS) as internal factors have a significant and positive relationship to the investment decision. The capital market pressure as an external factor has a significant and negative relationship to the investment decision. The composition of the independence commissioner as an external factor does not have a significant relationship to the investment decision. By comparing the coefficient of the significant variables, the net cash flow from operation is a dominant factor in the investment decision. This fact relates to the report published by Bank Indonesia, as a central bank, that the increasing free cash flow of corporation enhances the investment in Indonesia. This study contributes as a reference to the free cash flow literatures and the capital market authority especially in the developing country.
L62|The Moderating Effect of Fuel Prices On the Market Value of Fuel Efficiency, Driving Intensity, and Co2 Emissions|In the current paper, we quantify the effect that fuel prices have on vehicle prices\' responsiveness to fuel economy. We apply a hedonic price model to the German automobile market by using data on detailed technical specifications of high-sales vehicles of three sequential model years. In the contribution to previous research, our specification enables us to distinguish between consumers\' valuation of fuel economy versus their reaction to changes in fuel prices. Two sources of changes in consumers\' willingness-to-pay for better fuel economy are discussed - changes in the budget for driving a car and changes in capital investments in better car quality. We also discuss the subsequent changes in the optimal driving intensity and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions. Differences in the effects are studied for various car makes of both diesel and gasoline engines.
L62|Equilibria Under Knightian Price Uncertainty|We study economies with Knightian uncertainty about state prices. We introduce an equilibrium concept with sublinear prices and prove that equilibria exist under weak conditions. In general, such equilibria lead to inefficient allocations; they coincide with Arrow–Debreu equilibria if and only if the values of net trades are ambiguity‐free in mean. In economies without aggregate uncertainty, inefficiencies are generic. Equilibrium allocations under price uncertainty are efficient in a constrained sense that we call uncertainty–neutral efficient. Arrow–Debreu equilibria turn out to be non‐robust with respect to the introduction of Knightian uncertainty.
L62|Japanese Knowledge Transfer via Training in Mexico?s Automotive Industry|The automotive industry has been considered a source for development because of its impact on employment, knowledge transfer capabilities and backward and forward linkages with other industries. However, only a handful of developing countries have achieved an internationally competitive automotive industry. This might be attributable to the industry requiring not only skilled labor but also a strong supporting industry able to provide from 20,000 to 30,000 parts and components. In an ideal setting, supplier firms and assembly plants work interconnected creating positive externalities to each other, but for developing countries, it has been shown that this is difficult to achieve. The case of Mexico stands out as a country that has successfully attracted major automotive assemblers but has not been able to develop a solid supplier base. Despite the increasing presence of Japanese firms in Mexico, local firms have not been able to enter automotive chains primarily due to the inability to meet technological and quality requirements. This study analyzes specific cases of knowledge transfer to local firms under a training project from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The results show improvements in quality and productivity measurements of participating firms. The knowledge acquired through training was internalized and diffused within the firm allowing for industry-specific certifications, market growth, and market diversification.
L62|Brands in Motion: How Frictions Shape Multinational Production|Following the 2016 Leave vote in the referendum on UK membership in the EU and the election of Donald Trump, trade agreements have entered a period of great instability. To predict the impact of possible disruptions to existing arrangements requires counterfactual analysis that takes into account the complex set of factors influencing the production and marketing strategies of multinational corporations. We estimate a model of multinational decision-making in the car industry. This model predicts the production reallocation and consumer surplus consequences of changes in tariffs and non-tariff barriers induced by US-led protectionism, Brexit, transpacific, and transatlantic integration agreements.
L62|The middle-technology trap: The case of the automotive industry in Turkey|This paper argues that Turkey has fallen into a middle-technology trap on the borders of a weak innovation system (IS) and strong global value chains (GVCs). Detailed information from a primary R&D and innovation funding agency is used to show that the technological characteristics of the funded automotive R&D and innovation projects remained reasonably stable between 1995 and 2011. This result is cross-validated with two qualitative designs on beneficiary firms and automotive industry experts. The qualitative designs aided in identifying three mechanisms that explain how the Turkish automotive industry has fallen into a middle-technology trap. Analysis at the project, firm, and expert levels indicate that despite extensive upgrading and learning in manufacturing, the automotive industry has failed to build innovation capabilities. Turkey's delegated role in the automotive GVC, the joint venture (JV) structure and the lack of complementarities collectively work in creating a trap that impedes further technological development.
L62|Loss Minimization through the Allocation of DGs Considering the Stochastic Nature of Units|Smart grid as the cleaner alternative to the legacy power system can improve technical, economical, and environmental aspects of the system up to a considerable degree. In smart grids, Distributed Generation (DG) units; which play an important role, should be optimally allocated. In this paper, DG placement is conducted with the goal of loss minimization of the grid considering the technical limitations associated with the voltage profile of the buses as well as the stochastic nature of the DGs. In this paper, three different kinds of DGs are included which are wind turbines, solar panels, and biomass generators. The results related to the case study which is IEEE standard 33 bus system reveals that the costs can be dramatically decreased.
L62|Synthesizing Cash for Clunkers: Stabilizing the Car Market, Hurting the Environment|We examine the impact of European car scrappage programs on new vehicle registrations and respective CO2 emissions. To construct proper counterfactuals, we develop MSCM-T, the multivariate synthetic control method using time series of economic predictors. Applying MSCM-T to a rich data set covering two outcomes of interest, ten economic predictors, and 23 countries, we first analyze Germany which implemented the largest program. We find that the German subsidy had an immensely positive effect of 1.3 million program-induced new car registrations. Disentangling this effect reveals that almost one million purchases were not pulled forward from future periods, worth more than three times the program's 5 billion budget. However, stabilizing the car market came at the cost of 2.4 million tons of additional CO2 emissions. For other European countries with comparable car retirement schemes, we show further positive results regarding vehicle registrations. Finally, we demonstrate that all non-scrapping countries could have considerably backed their vehicle markets by adopting scrappage subsidies.
L62|Credit Shocks and Equilibrium Dynamics in Consumer Durable Goods Markets|"This paper studies the equilibrium dynamics in consumer durable goods markets after aggregate credit shocks. We introduce two novel features into a general-equilibrium model of durable consumption with heterogeneous households facing idiosyncratic income risk and borrowing constraints: (1) different qualities of durable goods trade on secondary markets at market-clearing prices; and (2) households endogenously choose when to trade them or scrap them. The model successfully matches several empirical patterns that we document using data on U.S. car markets around the Great Recession. After a tightening of the borrowing limit, debt-constrained households postpone the decision to scrap and upgrade their low-quality cars, depressing mid-quality car prices. In turn, this effect reduces wealthy households' incentives to replace their mid-quality cars with high-quality ones, thereby decreasing new-car sales. We further use our framework to study the effects of collateral constraints and aggregate income shocks, and to evaluate targeted fiscal stimulus policies such as the Car Allowance Rebate System in 2009 (""Cash for Clunkers"")."
L62|An Econometric Analysis of the Determinants of Passenger Vehicle Sales in Germany|The automobile market is one of the most significant sectors of the German economy both in terms of value added and number of employees. This paper focuses on the determinants of automobile demand in Germany from 2008 to 2016. We apply multiple linear regression in order to estimate new passenger vehicle sales, using monthly data on price, product parameters, quality ratings, macroeconomic variables as well as government incentives as explanatory variables. For each car segment, a separate model is built, with the purpose of uncovering similarities and differences between distinct segments. Our results indicate that quality is significant for all groups, while consumers’ attitudes towards vehicle prices vary from segment to segment. Purchasers of large-sized cars are sensitive to the fuel efficiency of vehicles, whereas drivers of small-sized vehicles pay less attention to fuel consumption. Most of the consumers in Germany are not considering vehicle emissions in their purchasing behavior. The results of this study can help automobile manufacturers to make strategic decisions and help policymakers to understand the automobile market better.
L62|AUTO-SHIFT APPLICATION PILOT (ASaP) Control System: An Invention for a Trainee Friendly and Danger Free Driving Vehicle|The facilitation of effective driving lesson is the preoccupation of every Technical Vocational Education (TVE) institution offering driving competency program. It is observed that with one steering wheel unit the driving lessons are delayed since both trainee and trainer will take turns positioning in the same steering wheel during demonstration and application of driving competencies. Likewise, the safety of both trainer and trainee is at stake since the trainer?s control of the trainee?s manipulation of the steering wheel and pedals is done only through verbal instruction. This development study aimed to invent Auto-Shift Application Pilot (ASaP) control system to be used in innovating a trainee friendly and a danger-free school driving vehicle. ASaP controls the functioning of the two sets of the steering wheel and two sets of pedal respectively for the trainer and the trainee to facilitate teaching-learning of car driving competencies. Using descriptive design, test and evaluation of the functionality and aesthetic design of ASaP control system were conducted by 5 school driving trainers and 15 driving trainees as respondent. Results showed that ASaP control system is highly functional with the mean score of 4.6 and competitive in its aesthetic design with the mean score of 4.2. It is recommended that this ASaP control system is installed in a school driving vehicle for a trainee friendly and trainee danger free driving lessons.
L62|The Fisher Body Case and Organizational Economics|In 1919, General Motors acquired a non-controlling equity interest in the Fisher Body Company and signed a ten-year contract stipulating the terms under which Fisher would be the exclusive supplier of car bodies to GM. In 1926, GM acquired the remaining equity in Fisher Body. In 1978, Benjamin Klein, Robert Crawford, and Armen Alchian used the GM acquisition of Fisher Body as an illustration of the asset-specificity or “holdup” theory of vertical integration. Their paper became widely influential, and the Fisher case quickly developed into an omnipresent meme in the economics of organization. In the year 2000, however, the meme suddenly exploded into a cause célèbre. No fewer than five papers appeared attacking both the theory and the history in the Klein et al. account – including a paper by Nobel Laureate Ronald Coase, who entered into an often-contentious debate with Klein. This paper tells the story of the Fisher Body acquisition and of the academic controversy it spawned. The controversy has lessons – including some surprising and ironic lessons – for the economic history of the American automobile industry, for the economics of organization, and for the conduct of inquiry in economics.
L62|R&D, IP, and firm profits in the North American automotive supplier industry|Economic theory implies that research and development (R&D) efforts increase firm productivity and ultimately profits. In particular, R&D expenses lead to the development of intellectual property (IP) and IP commands a return that increases overall profits of the firm. This hypothesis is investigated for the North American automotive supplier industry by analyzing a panel of 5000 firms for the years 1950 to 2011. Results indicate that R&D expenses in fact increase profitability at the firm level. In particular, increases in the R&D expense to sales ratio lead to increases in the profit contribution of intangible assets relative to sales. This indicates that more R&D intensive IP should command higher royalty rates per sales when licensed to third parties and within multinational enterprises alike.
L62|Die Patentleistung der deutschen KFZ-Unternehmen: Eine Analyse der Patentanmeldungen beim deutschen Patent- und Markenamt unter Berücksichtigung von branchen- und technologiespezifischen Schwerpunkten|Megatrends wie die zunehmende Elektrifizierung des Antriebsstrangs und das autonome Fahren führen zu einem gravierenden Strukturwandel im Fahrzeugbau. Die vorliegende Studie analysiert, wie gut die deutschen KFZ-Unternehmen auf diesen Strukturwandel vorbereitet sind. Hierzu werden die Patentanmeldungen der deutschen Hersteller, Zulieferer und Entwicklungsdienstleister des aktuellsten verfügbaren Jahres analysiert und folgende Fragen beantwortet: Welcher Anteil aller deutschen Patentanmeldungen entfällt aktuell auf den KFZ-Bereich? Leisten dabei Hersteller oder Zulieferer einen höheren Beitrag zum Innovationsgeschehen? In welchen Technologiebereichen sind die deutschen KFZ-Unternehmen mit Bezug auf die Internationale Patentklassifikation (IPC) besonders forschungsaktiv und welche Bedeutung nimmt dabei der konventionelle Antriebsstrang ein, der durch den Strukturwandel an relativer Bedeutung verlieren wird? Die Ergebnisse beziehen sich auf die Patentanmeldungen des aktuellsten verfügbaren Jahres und zeigen, dass die deutschen KFZ-Unternehmen bereits heute viel besser und zukunftssicherer aufgestellt sind, als von der öffentlichen Meinung kolportiert wird.

L62|Intermediaries and Product Quality in Used Car Markets|We examine used car dealers’ roles as intermediaries. We present empirical evidence supporting that cars sold by dealers have higher quality: (1) dealer transaction prices are higher than private market prices and this dealer premium increases in the age of the car as a ratio and is hump-shaped in dollar value, and (2) used cars purchased from dealers are less likely to be resold immediately. We formalize a model to show that these empirical facts can be rationalized either when dealers serve to alleviate information asymmetry between sellers and buyers or when dealers facilitate assortative matching between heterogenous-quality cars and heterogeneous consumers. Lastly, based on predictions of the model, we use the data to distinguish these two theories and find evidence for both, but the preponderance of the evidence supports the asymmetric information theory.
L62|A Historical Survey of Ship Reactivations|In December 2016, the Navy released a new force structure assessment that called for a ï¬‚eet of 355 shipsâ€”substantially larger than the current force of 283 ships. This report focuses on one of several approaches that the Navy could use to increase the size of its fleet: reactivating decommissioned ships. It draws insights from past experiences that might inform lawmakersâ€™ decisions about reactivating retired ships in the future.

L62|The Impact of Product Recalls on the Secondary Market:Evidence from Dieselgate|We examine the effects of Volkswagen's emissions scandal (`Dieselgate`) on the secondary car market in Israel. Using administrative data on all car transactions in Israel, we measure the scandal's effect on the number and the composition of transactions involving used vehicles made by the Volkswagen Group. We also use data from the leading classified ad website and measure the effect of the scandal on the resale price of used Volkswagen vehicles. According to our findings, the Volkswagen emissions scandal had a statistically significant negative effect on the number of transactions involving vehicles made by Volkswagen (nearly -18.0%) and on their resale price (nearly -6.0%). We also find that the reduction in the number of transactions was driven mostly by private sellers and that non-private sellers barely shied away from the market. We discuss potential explanations for these findings.
L62|Learning from failure across products|Learning rates for the same or similar products differ significantly across firms. One reason for this heterogeneity may be that most firms are multiproduct firms and that they learn both within and across the products they produce and sell. Moreover, the organization of production and the technological design of (families of) products may affect the extent of learning across products. We study learning from failures within and across products in the US automotive industry, using safety recalls as a particularly costly form of product failure. We find that firms indeed learn from failure across products, but learning is faster if products use a common technological platform or are produced in a common plant. Severe product failures involving a supplier also lead to increased across-product learning. Our results shed light on the characteristics of firms' learning from failure across products and extend the existing literature, which typically studies learning at the firm or the product level and thus misses out on an important channel for learning in manufacturing contexts.
L62|Credit Shocks and Equilibrium Dynamics in Consumer Durable Goods Markets|This paper studies the equilibrium dynamics arising in consumer durable goods markets in response to aggregate credit supply shocks. To this end, we develop a general-equilibrium model of durable consumption with heterogeneous households facing idiosyncratic income risk and borrowing constraints. Two novel features of our framework are that: 1) used durable goods trade on secondary markets at market-clearing prices; and 2) households endogenously choose when to scrap them. The model successfully matches several empirical patterns of U.S. car markets around the Great Recession that we document using a rich dataset on the prices of new and used vehicles as well as CEX data on households' vehicle replacement activity. After a negative credit shock (i.e., a tightening of the borrowing limit), debt-constrained households postpone the decision to scrap and upgrade their cars. The economy experiences a period of low resale prices for used cars, which reduces wealthy households' incentives to replace their cars, thereby decreasing new-car sales. We also use our framework to study the effects of aggregate income shocks, the role of cars as collateral, and to evaluate targeted fiscal stimulus policies such as the Car Allowance Rebate System in 2009 (``Cash for clunkers'').
L62|Testing localization of Thai automobile industries|The development of industrial clusters is crucially important for industries such as automobiles. However, it is still doubtful whether all parts suppliers should be localized, regardless of the parts categories. We tested the above hypotheses using data compiled from the Thailand Automotive Industry Directory 2014. First, the factors affecting the location of the Thai automobile industry were reviewed. Second, the kernel density of the bilateral distances between parts suppliers was estimated. Finally, hypothesis testing on the localization of parts suppliers was conducted. The study found that the automobile industry as a whole was significantly localized, and significant localization occurs only within 150 km, in terms of bilateral distance between firms.
L62|Structure and comparison of the electronics and motor vehicle value chains in East Asia|This paper explores the structure of the electronics and the motor vehicle value chains in East Asia. Trade in value added analysis and its decomposition method are applied to the inter-country input–output data of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The method of value chain mapping has been introduced to illustrate the upstream and downstream transactions of goods and services along the value chain. The result of the analysis shows that the electronics industry has a greater vertical specialisation (VS) share than the automotive industry. The decomposition analysis reveals that the Korean industries were strongly integrated into the Chinese value chains, whereas the Thai industries continued to be overwhelmingly dependent on Japan, albeit, with increased linkages with neighbouring Southeast Asian economies. Moreover, value chain mapping demonstrated that China has increased its presence not only as an export platform for multinational firms but also as a consumer of final goods―especially for the Korean industries.
L62|How suppliers penetrate overseas market : internationalization of Chinese firms from the value chain perspective|This paper examines how Chinese firms serving the low-end domestic market internationalize into developing country markets abroad. It adopts a value-chain-focused approach to analyze the internationalization of Chinese firms into the Vietnamese motorcycle industry. The analysis shows that it was Chinese component suppliers rather than Chinese motorcycle manufacturers that successfully penetrated low-end market at the destination. Chinese suppliers did so by focusing on production-related expertise to provide key components to many locally-owned firms that undertook end-product assembly and distribution. The findings suggest that the research on the internationalization of Chinese firms needs to be embedded in the context of industrial organization in Chinese industries and its transformation.
L62|The Welfare Implications of the European Trucks Cartel|We present a pragmatic approach to calculating the total economic loss induced by a cartel, focusing on the European trucks cartel (1997-2011). Overall, we estimate a net welfare loss up to € 15.5 bn. and an overcharge to the amount of 7.6%. Our approach builds on the theory of monopoly pricing and uses the publicly available profit data of the infringing companies. It is comprehensible, transparent, and applicable to collusion on list prices, what makes it particularly relevant for both policymakers and practitioners.
L62|Data Governance in Connected Cars: The Problem of Access to In-vehicle Data|Through the application of the technological solution of the “extended vehicle” concept the car manufacturers can capture exclusive control of the data of connected cars leading to serious concerns about negative effects on competition, innovation and consumer choice on the markets for aftermarket and other complementary services in the ecosystem of connected and automated driving. Therefore a controversial policy discussion has emerged in the EU about access to in-vehicle data and the connected car for independent service providers in the automotive industry. This paper claims that this problem should be seen as part of the general question of the optimal governance of data in the ecosystem of connected and automated mobility. The paper offers an overview about this policy discussion and analyzes this problem from an economic perspective by using a market failure analysis. Besides competition problems (esp. on markets for aftermarket and other services in the connected car) also market failures in regard to technological choice (extended vehicle vs. interoperable on-board application platform) and information and privacy problems (“notice and consent” solutions) can emerge, leading to the question of appropriate regulatory solutions. The paper discusses solutions through data portability, data rights, competition law, and recommends a sector-specific regulatory approach.
L62|Integration of Small Technology-Based Firms in Aeronautics|This paper examines the role of small technology-based firms (TBF) in aeronautics industrialization processes. In particular, given the susceptibility of these firms to the changing nature of industrial production, it focuses on the integration and growth of small TBFs in aeronautics supply chains. We use the case study of Embraer, the Brazilian firm that leads the regional aircraft segment, to uncover processes through which small TBFs can integrate its supply chain, creating value and enhancing regional technological capabilities. This case is of particular relevance since Embraer pioneered the introduction of risk-sharing partnership for product development in aeronautics, followed by other aircraft manufacturers, which led to significant changes in the supply chains structures. Based on 100 semi-structured interviews with leading experts in Brazil and Portugal, our research shows that aeronautics inherent specificities impose several challenges to the integration and growth of small TBFs into the aeronautics supply chain. We identify 11 main challenges for the integration and growth of small TBF suppliers in aeronautics, and 5 major reasons why despite these challenges, some of these firms make the strategic decision of entering this sector. In addition, we argue that small TBFs should be promoted through regulatory frameworks that take into account the aircraft development process.
L62|The Capitalization of Consumer Financing into Durable Goods Prices|A central question in the study of business cycles and credit is the relationship between asset prices and borrowing conditions. In this paper, we investigate the effects of cross-sectional credit-supply shocks on the prices of durable goods. Understanding how prices capitalize credit in the cross-section is important for understanding the incidence, transmission, and aggregation of credit-supply shocks. Using loan-level data on the prices paid for used cars by millions of borrowers and hundreds of auto-loan lenders, we measure what happens to individual-level prices when only some borrowers are exposed to an exogenous shock to the user cost of credit. Holding car quality fixed with a battery of age-make-model-trim by month fixed effects, we document that loan maturity is capitalized into the price treated borrowers pay for identical cars, attenuating the benefit of cheaper financing. For a car buyer with an annual discount rate less than 8.9%, the benefits of being offered cheaper credit are more than offset by the higher purchase price of the car. Overall, our estimates suggest that one additional year of loan maturity is worth 2.8% of the car’s purchase price, an implied elasticity of price with respect to monthly payment size of –0.23.
L62|Subsidizing Mass Adoption of Electric Vehicles: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from California|Little is known about demand for EVs in the mass market. In this paper, we exploit a natural experiment that provides variation in large EV subsidies targeted at low- and middle-income households in California. Using transaction-level data, we estimate two important policy parameters using triple differences: the subsidy elasticity of demand for EVs and the rate of subsidy pass-through. Estimates show that demand for EVs amongst low- and middle-income households is price-elastic and pass-through is complete. We use these estimates to calculate the expected subsidy bill required for California to reach its goal of 1.5 million EVs by 2025.
L62|Explaining Thailand’s Automotive Manufacturing Success|We argue that the success of Thailand’s export-oriented automotive industry was based on three factors. First was the substantial public investment in productivity-raising port facilities and related infrastructure, beginning in the 1990s, that constituted the Eastern Seaboard economic corridor. The second was the exchange rate depreciation that accompanied the 1997-99 Asian Financial Crisis. Jointly, these two factors made manufacturing production for export more profitable. The third was two key policy changes adopted by the Thai government shortly after the crisis, and partly in response to it: (a) abolition of restrictions on foreign ownership, and (b) abolition of local content requirements.
L62|Sorting on the Used-Car Market After the Volkswagen Emission Scandal|The disclosure of the VW emission manipulation scandal caused a quasi-experimental market shock in the observable quality of VW diesel vehicles. We consider a classical model for adverse selection and sorting to derive an empirically testable hypothesis about the impact of observable quality on the supply of used cars. We test the hypothesis with data collected from an online car selling platform which reflects about 50% of the German used-car market. The empirical approach is based on a conditional difference-in-differences method. We find that the supply of used VW diesel vehicles increases after the VW emission scandal. This finding is consistent with the predictions of the theoretical model. Furthermore, we find the positive supply effects increase with the probability of manipulation.
L62|Does marketing widen borders? Cross-country price dispersion in the European car market|We study cross-country price differences in the European market for new passenger cars based on detailed pricing and technical data. Car prices in Europe converged until the year 2003, but not thereafter. Even then the price range of the median model across EU15 countries was close to 20%. This cross-country price differentiation is systematically linked to common product features, varies significantly across models and increases systematically with the market segment. Identical cars are positioned individually by country, for example via tailored feature bundles. Both the convergence of prices in anticipation of a future reduction of barriers to arbitrage and the systematic price differentials point to active pricing-to-market strategies that treat countries as marketing regions.
L62|Relational Contracts, Competition and Innovation: Theory and Evidence from German Car Manufacturers|Using unique data from buyer-supplier relationships in the German automotive industry, we unveil a puzzle by which more trust in a relationship is associated with higher idiosyncratic investment, but also more competition. We develop a theoretical model of repeated procurement with non-contractible, buyer-specifi c investments rationalizing both observations. Against the idea that competition erodes rents needed to build trust and sustain relationships, we infer that trust and competition tend to go hand in hand. In our setting trust and rents from reduced supplier competition behave like substitutes, rather than complements as typically understood.
L62|Firms and Collective Reputation: the Volkswagen Emissions Scandal as a Case Study|"This paper uses the 2015 Volkswagen emissions scandal as a natural experiment to provide causal evidence that group reputation externalities matter for firms. Our estimates show statistically and economically significant declines in the U.S. sales and stock returns of, as well as public sentiment towards, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Smart as a result of the Volkswagen scandal. In particular, the scandal reduced the sales of these non-Volkswagen German manufacturers by approximately 76,000 vehicles over the following year, leading to a loss of approximately $3.7 billion of revenue. Volkswagen's malfeasance materially harmed the group reputation of ""German car engineering"" in the United States."
L62|Preconditions, windows of opportunity and innovation strategies: Successive leadership changes in the regional jet industry|We analyse the drivers of two successive leadership changes in the regional, or mid-sized jet market, a particularly dynamic segment of the commercial aircraft industry. In the first instance, Bombardier, a Canadian newcomer, assumed leadership over the incumbents, BAe and Fokker, in 1995. In 2005, the Brazilian firm, Embraer, became the market leader in terms of number of regional jet deliveries. Our theoretical framework considers discontinuities in the building blocks of sectoral innovation systems as windows of opportunity for which challenger firms can devise strategic responses allowing them to assume market leadership. It also considers preconditions as necessary capabilities limiting the number of potential challenger companies. The analysis of leadership change shows that more efficient engines and technological improvements in subsystems, changing oil prices, business cycles, liberalization of air transport services, scope clauses and government interventions provided technological, demand and regulatory windows of opportunity. Launching new aircraft families (an architectural innovation), targeting the 50- and the 100–120-seat niche markets gave first Bombardier’s CRJ family and later Embraer’s E-Jet family the leadership. The fate of failed challengers and incumbents point to the importance of incumbent traps, technological and financial capabilities, the timing of windows of opportunity, speedy strategic response, a proper evaluation of future demand and sheer luck, as long lead times and sunk costs entrap incumbents and other inadequately responding companies.
L62|The German motor vehicle industry: Costs and crisis|Japanese expertise with a flexible and efficient automobile manufacturing system posed a challenge to the German motor vehicle industry, renowned for high quality. We investigate cost characteristics of the German industry, including scale economies, input relationships, and other issues. We find German production still has scale economies available, that labor and outsourced intermediate goods and domestic and outsourced intermediate goods are substitutes, the industry has increased its use of outsourced inputs, labor demand has become more sensitive to its own price and that of outsourced inputs, and the industry restructuring appears to have been successful in increasing its international competitiveness.
L62|Formation of Automotive Manufacturing Clusters in Thailand|The development of the local supplier base and the formation of industrial clusters are important for industries, especially the automotive industry. This study focuses on local supplier development and the formation of automotive clusters in Thailand. Using the Thailand Automotive Industry Directory 2014, the study investigates the type of parts produced by the respective suppliers, as well as the geographical distribution of suppliers in the automotive clusters. The study finds that the number of firms producing each type of parts is different, depending on the ownership structure. Also, the location of automotive establishments has changed over time, reflecting the changes in location advantages of the respective regions as well as government policy.
L62|Viet Nam's Automotive Supplier Industry: Development Prospects under Conditions for Free Trade and Global Production Networks|Despite foreign direct investment occurring in the 1990s, automobile production in Viet Nam has not progressed beyond assembly. Due to forthcoming trade liberalisation in ASEAN, these assembly operations are endangered from closure as car-makers consider shifting to imports from more developed automobile manufacturing countries in the region. This paper analyses the current state of the automotive industry in Viet Nam and seeks to formulate policy recommendations based on the findings.
L62|Current Status and Traits of the Auto Parts Industry in Viet Nam|This study aims to clarify the current situation and traits of the Vietnamese automobile industry by showing the status of its automobile and auto parts industry. The whole picture of the automobile industry in Viet Nam is discussed first, and then the vulnerability of the auto parts industry, which is the biggest feature and an issue to be addressed in the future, is highlighted as it is the auto parts industry that ultimately determines the competitiveness of the auto industry. The study looked at studies that have been undertaken on this subject. The number of analytical studies dedicated to the auto industry in Viet Nam is extremely small. Besides, most of them have been conducted only in the context of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) automobile industry in general. Studies by Tetsuya Kobayashi (2013) and Yingshan Jin (2016) are among them. These studies are basically intended to provide the actual picture of the automobile industry in Viet Nam. This research paper will focus on the auto parts industry in Viet Nam with the aim of getting closer to its core. It should be noted that many of auto parts suppliers in Viet Nam have started operations as motorcycle parts suppliers, and some of them have transformed from motorcycle to auto parts suppliers. Section 1 describes the establishment of the motorcycle industry in Viet Nam and the formation and expansion of the motorcycle parts industry. Section 2 describes the start of automobile production and the peculiarity of the supply chain formation. Section 3 discusses the possibility of converting from motorcycle parts suppliers to auto parts suppliers. During this process, the global value chain advocated by Gary Gereffi and Miguel Korzeniewicz (1994) is considered to see if and how it will apply and evolve in Viet Nam.
L62|Working Paper 08-17 - Vehicle stock modelling in long term projections - Survey of the literature|Transport models used for long-term projections should reflect the impact of shared, automated and electric mobility modes. The objective of the current paper is to derive lessons from the existing literature on vehicle ownership modelling to find options to further improve the PLANET model, which is used for projections of transport demand in Belgium.PLANET is already well equipped to represent the impacts of shared and automated cars on the opportunity cost of travel time, the load factors and the annual mileage of cars.
L62|The new automobile modular platforms: from the product architecture to the manufacturing network approach|This paper analyses the key factors for the adoption of the new automobile modular platforms through an eclectic perspective linking the product architecture with the manufacturing network approach. An exploratory analysis of the European production networks of seven automobile manufacturers shows that the benefits of the modular platforms’ adoption depend on two factors: the degree of platform modularity and the manufacturing issues of each carmaker —product portfolio, production volumes and network size. The results indicate that the degree of modularity of the platform chosen should be aligned with the manufacturing issues; otherwise, benefits might not reach expectations

L62|The Elusive Effects of CAFE Standards|Despite decades of empirical assessment, economists have not reached consensus on key impacts of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, including how much they reduce fuel consumption. Evaluating CAFE is complicated by factors such as consumers' expectations of future fuel prices, their valuation of and responsiveness to changes in fuel economy, automakers' optimal technological and strategic behavior, changes in used-vehicle markets, and the path of energy prices. I investigate the effects of many of those factors in a quantitative assessment of CAFE. I do so by modifying the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s National Energy Modeling System and using it to simulate variations from a set of reference assumptions. Results are especially sensitive to consumersâ€™ valuation of expected fuel cost savings and to the future course of oil prices.
L62|Different interpretations of the automotive industry and its role in three semi-peripheral regions of the EU|The paper investigates the role of the automotive industry in the Baltic, Visegrád and Iberian region, summarizing the relevant literature. In the analysis of each country, the study discusses the importance of the automotive industry in the national economy and the role of individual countries in the global trade. Based on the literature there are different approaches regarding the activities belonging to the automotive industry. The vehicle production is vertically integrated, therefore the industry involves many other activities that sell their products to other industries as well. On the other hand economic contribution of the automotive industry can be interpreted in a broad way including downstream activities related to the use of the motor vehicle, and the socioeconomic employment as well. The broader definition of automotive industry in this paper is based on this previous approach. The study defines the automotive spillovers on the basis of the NACE nomenclature to show how these activities contribute to employment, production and value added in the examined countries.
L62|Impact of new technologies on the organization of global value chains (1): dynamic transformations within global value chain typology|This paper is one of two articles that consider the impact of new technologies on the organization of global value chains (GVCs). The current paper considers value chains in two representative industries, namely, the automotive industry and electronic equipment industry, and the other forthcoming paper will examine the apparel industry and material processing industry. The study draws on the analytical framework developed by Gereffi et al. (2005), who presented a GVC typology and mechanism of value chain transformation.
L62|Incumbents' Asymmetric Responses to Environmentally Friendly Entrants in the Automotive Industry|The influence of innovative entrants on incumbents is considered important for technological change. We analyze this influence for the global transition towards alternative technology vehicles (ATVs). Our results indicate that entrants' ATV-related knowledge accumulation stimulates average incumbent's ATV-related research. Regarding global entrants, incumbents with higher ATV patent stocks increased patenting stronger; supporting previous literature on competitive reactions to entry. Responding to domestic entrants, however, incumbents with low ATV patent stocks increased whereas incumbents with high stocks decreased patenting; suggesting that advanced incumbents outsource research or overtake entrants. Further, certain characteristics and not merely the quantity of entrants drive incumbents' responses.
L62|Clusters of specializations in the automotive supply chain in Italy. An empirical analysis using text mining|The wide literature exploring supply chains is polarized on two perspectives: micro analyses focusing on management strategies of companies, and macro assessment of cross-country interdependences. In order to explore the ongoing innovation paths, this paper adopts a third perspective on the supply chain, focusing on the internal structure of specializations within the automotive supply chain in Italy. If we compare the degree of fragmentation across global value chains, the automotive supply chain has the highest degree of fragmentation. With regard to Italy, its structural characteristics (number, size of companies, location) and dynamics of change deserve attention both for its large share in domestic production and for its interconnections with other supply chains. In this paper, we explore a strategy to identify a classification of specializations within the automotive supply chain grounded on the textual description of activities provided by companies when they register their business. Pending the acquisition of the database for the other years of the Observatory, in this work the analysis refers only to 2017 data.

L62|What Goes On under the Hood? How Engineers Innovate in the Automotive Supply Chain|The questions addressed in this volume are motivated by the recognition that engineers play an important role in generating innovation and economic growth. In this chapter, we seek to offer some description of engineering work by looking in detail at a specific manufacturing industry—firms that supply automakers—to gain insight into how engineers create innovation. Autos account for 5% of US GDP and in 2011, 70% of auto suppliers contributed design effort, a task typically performed by engineers, making the auto supply chain an important context in which to study engineering and innovation. Some highlights from our original survey data include a wide range in terms of size and strategies of supply chain companies; a majority was small- to medium-sized, often family-owned. We observed barriers to patenting for manufacturing firms developing process rather than product innovations. And interviews revealed the importance of customers for the innovative efforts of supplier firms. Certain Japanese customers were preferred because they shared expertise and helped suppliers improve, while other, American, customers were viewed as having unreasonable demands for regular, incremental price reductions and did not offer technical or organizational support.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L62|Local Protectionism, Market Structure, and Social Welfare: China's Automobile Market|While China has made great strides in transforming its centrally-planned economy to a market-oriented economy, there still exist widespread interregional trade barriers, such as policies and practices that protect local firms against competition from non-local firms. This study documents the presence of local protectionism and quantifies its impacts on market competition and social welfare in the context of China’s automobile market. This market exhibits a salient feature that vehicle models by joint ventures (JVs) and especially state-owned enterprises (SOEs) command much higher market shares in their headquarter province than at the national level. Through spatial discontinuity analysis at provincial borders, falsification tests, and consumer surveys, we first confirm protective policies such as subsidies to local brands as the primary contributing factor. We then set up and estimate a market equilibrium model to quantify the impact of local protection, controlling for other demand and supply factors. Counterfactual simulations show that local protection leads to significant choice distortions, resulting in 18.7 billion yuan of consumer welfare loss, amounting to 40% of total subsidy. Provincial governments face a prisoner’s dilemma: according to our estimates, local protection reduces aggregate social welfare, but the provincial governments have no incentive to unilaterally remove local protection.
L62|Attribute Substitution in Household Vehicle Portfolios|Household preferences for goods with a bundle of attributes may have complex substitution patterns when one attribute is changed. For example, a household faced with an exogenous increase in the size of one television may choose to decrease the size of other televisions within the home. This paper quantifies the extent of attribute substitution in the context of multi-vehicle households. We deploy a novel identification strategy to examine how an exogenous change in the fuel economy of a kept vehicle affects a household's choice of a second vehicle. We find strong evidence of attribute substitution in the household vehicle portfolio. This effect operates through car attributes that are correlated with fuel economy, including vehicle footprint and weight. Our findings suggest that attribute substitution exerts a strong force that may erode a substantial portion of the expected future gasoline savings from fuel economy standards, particularly those that are attribute-based. Elements of our identification strategy are relevant to a broad class of settings in which consumers make sequential purchases of durable portfolio goods.
L62|Characteristics of transit tourism in Hungary with a focus on expenditure|This study introduces the behaviour of participants in transit tourism in Hungary with a focus on their expenditure. With the help of multivariable mathematical-statistical methods, the motivational background and the spending characteristics of foreigners visiting Hungary between 2009 and 2013 are explored; in addition, the factors influencing expenditure, according to nationality, are investigated. According to our investigations, people in transit, whose spending is continuously increasing, make up a significant share of the expenditure of foreigners arriving in Hungary. Typical types of spending during transit are fuel purchases and dining at restaurants. Among transit visitors to Hungary, Romanian, Serbian (including Monte-negro and Kosovo), and Bulgarian nationals have the highest share. While the number and expenditure of transit visitors slightly increased during the examined period, the per capita spending decreased. The results of the study show that this is due to the changes in the composition of the countries involved. Changes in transit tourism expenditures are largely determined by nationality. The most important conclusion of our research is that the most significant characteristics of transit depend on general European trends (labour market conditions, tourism supply, etc.) and conditions (visa requirements, transport infrastructure, accommo-dation along transit routes, among others) provided for transit visitors by Hungary.
L62|Robot path planning in a dynamic and unknown environment based on Colonial Competitive Algorithm (CCA) and fuzzy logic|Robot path planning has been one of the favorite areas for many Machine Learning researchers from the past up to date. The trajectory designed for a robot can be simple or complex. The robot must pass through obstacles which are either movable or fixed. One of the considerable ways for robot path planning in the dynamic and unknown environment is a combination of Evolutionary algorithm and Fuzzy logic. There are different kinds of evolutionary algorithms such as Genetic algorithm, Ant Colony algorithm, Colonial Competitive algorithm, etc. A new approach has been proposed in this paper for robot path planning in the dynamic and unknown environment based on both the Colonial Competitive algorithm and fuzzy rules. The implemented results of the proposed method present its superiority over previous methods which used only fuzzy logic method.
L62|Predicting the Present Revisited: The Case of Thailand|"Google is currently the most-used search engine in the world. There are approximately 3.5 billion searches being conducted on Google each day. With real-time processing, Google Trends data can be used in a prediction technique called nowcasting (or ""predicting the present"") ? using the current period's real-time information to estimate the current period's indicators of interest. In this paper, we showed how Google Trends can be used for nowcasting Thailand's various economic indicators. The sectors being analyzed are (i) the labor market sector (unemployment rate and unemployment registration), (ii) the real sector (automobile sales), and (iii) the financial sector (SET index). The results revealed that incorporating the Google Trends data into the prediction models improved the Adjusted R-Squared and improved the predication accuracies under various measures."
L62|Condiciones de Mercado y Calidad como Determinantes del Traspaso del Tipo de Cambio: Evidencia a partir de Microdatos|Este documento estima el traspaso del tipo de cambio a los precios utilizando datos del mercado de vehículos usados. Para ello, utilizamos información semanal de anuncios de ventas de vehículos publicados en el diario El Comercio entre los años 2014 y 2016. Encontramos, controlando por las características invariantes de cada vehículo y anunciante, que en promedio el precio de los vehículos en soles varía 0.7 por ciento, cuando el tipo de cambio varía en 1 por ciento. Asimismo, hallamos evidencia de un menor traspaso del tipo de cambio cuando la calidad del vehículo y la estrechez de mercado son mayores. Finalmente, encontramos evidencia de asimetrías en el traspaso tipo de cambio a los precios, las cuales dependen también de la estrechez de mercado y la calidad del vehículo.
L62|Thailand’s Automotive Manufacturing Corridor|Thailand’s export-oriented automotive industry is a recognized economic success story. How did it happen and what lessons might other countries draw? This paper argues that the success of the industry was based on three factors. First was the substantial public investment in port facilities and related infrastructure, beginning in the 1990s, that constituted the Eastern Seaboard economic corridor. Second was the exchange rate depreciation that followed the 1997–1999 Asian Financial Crisis, making manufacturing production for export more profitable. The third factor was two key policy changes adopted by the Thai government shortly after the crisis, and partly in response to it: (a) abolition of restrictions on foreign ownership and (b) abolition of local content requirements. Neighboring countries, including Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, also experienced the crisis and were potential competitors in attracting foreign investment in automotive production for export. But they did not adopt these two key reforms.
L62|Consumer valuation of fuel costs and the effectiveness of tax policy: Evidence from the European car market|To what extent do car buyers undervalue future fuel costs, and what does this imply for the effectiveness of alternative tax policies? To address both questions, we show it is crucial to account for consumer heterogeneity in mileage and other dimensions. We use detailed product-level data for a long panel of European countries, and exploit variation in fuel prices by engine type. We find there is only modest undervaluation of fuel costs. As a consequence, fuel taxes are unambiguously more effective in reducing fuel usage than product taxes based on fuel economy, because fuel taxes better target high mileage consumers.
L62|Sorting on the Used-Car Market After the Volkswagen Emission Scandal|The disclosure of the VW emission manipulation scandal caused a quasi-experimental market shock in the observable quality of VW diesel vehicles. We consider a classical model for adverse selection and sorting to derive an empirically testable hypothesis about the impact of observable quality on the supply of used cars. We test the hypothesis with data collected from an online car selling platform which reflects about 50% of the German used-car market. The empirical approach is based on a conditional difference-in-differences method. We find that the supply of used VW diesel vehicles increases after the VW emission scandal. This finding is consistent with the predictions of the theoretical model. Furthermore, we find the positive supply effects increase with the probability of manipulation.

L62|Incumbents' responses to innovative entrants: A multi-country dynamic analysis|The influence of innovative entrants on incumbents is considered important for technological change. We analyze this influence for the global transition towards alternative technology vehicles (ATVs). Our results indicate that entrants' ATV-related knowledge accumulation stimulates average incumbent's ATV-related research. Regarding global entrants, incumbents with higher ATV patent stocks increased patenting stronger; supporting previous literature on competitive reactions to entry. Responding to domestic entrants, however, incumbents with low ATV patent stocks increased whereas incumbents with high stocks decreased patenting; suggesting that advanced incumbents outsource research or overtake entrants. Further, certain characteristics and not merely the quantity of entrants drive incumbents' responses.
L62|Demographic determinants of car ownership in Japan|This study empirically examines the demographic determinants of car ownership in Japan between 1980 and 2009. Unique car cohort data, composed of the car age and 11 car types, at the prefectural level, is analyzed. The primary reason for examining the demographic determinants of car ownership in Japan is because Japan is projected to face radical demographic changes in the next few decades. These projected changes include depopulation and an aging population with diminishing household size. This study will be the first empirical study of the car cohort model with large countrywide observations in the recent literature. This study classifies the demographic determinants into five categories: (I) longitudinal factors, (II) economic factors, (III) natural factors, (IV) social factors, and (V) other transports. Although some tendencies vary among car types, this study finds the following tendencies of ordinary car ownership (compact four-wheel drive trucks and regular and compact passenger cars). Regarding the longitudinal factors, the long-run effect is much higher than average in the recent literature, whereas the semi elasticity of car age is approximately −7%. Regarding the economic factors, the elasticities of income and fuel price on car ownership tend to be less intense than in earlier studies. Regarding the natural factors of population increase, the elasticities of population and average household size on car ownership tend to be negative. This indicates that a decrease in population and household size in Japan will accelerate car ownership. In addition, the ratio of elderly people has various effects depending on car types. Regarding the social factors of population increase, car ownership tends to be encouraged by the concentration of population within prefecture, and increased and decreased for relatively new (aged 2–11) and old (aged 12+) cars, respectively, by the concentration of population across prefectures. The former is probably due to a composite effect in urban and rural areas, whereas the latter may be a quick update cycle due to an effect of urbanization. Regarding other transports, the degrees of train and bus use tend to be negatively associated with ordinary car ownership. However, these effects are considerably small and often insignificant as in the literature.
L62|A regression model of product differentiation|This note develops a model of product differentiation that can be estimated using standard regression techniques and applies it to a panel data set of new car sales. The model allows for complex substitution patterns according to an overlapping nest structure that makes cars closer substitutes if the share brand, body type, and/or quality level. A nest comprising all the car alternatives ensure that they are closer substitutes with each other than with the outside good. In addition, the model comprises fixed effects by car model, controlling for unobserved car quality.
L62|Bailing on the Car That Was Not Bailed Out: Bounding Consumer Reactions to Financial Distress|This paper examines how consumers react to the financial distress of durable goods manufacturers by looking at the Swedish new car market. We employ a difference-in-differences matching methodology whereby we compare sales of carmaker Saab with those of a carefully constructed control group of substitute products. To account for possible substitution between products in the treatment and control groups, we propose and apply bounds to our difference-in-differences matching estimator. We then refine the bounds and provide conditions under which they depend only on the products' own- and cross-price elasticities. We find that even accounting for potential substitution, there was a significant decrease in the sales of Saab following its filing for administration. These findings are robust to a number of robustness checks and alternative hypothesis.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L62|Interdependence between iron ore production and maritime transport|The maritime industry plays an important role in international trade, transporting a total of 10,1 billion tons of merchandise in 2015, representing over 80% of all global trade, with dry cargo estimated to account for over two thirds of the total seaborne trade. Bulk carriers supply the raw materials needed by the steel industry and container ships transport the steel products. Demand and supply for seaborne transport is influenced by trends in global economy and worldwide demand for commodities. The paper analyzes the most important economic determinants in the supply of metallurgical raw materials, highlighting the importance of the shipping sector.
L62|Evaluating the effect of upside and downside slope on flow hydraulic in cylindrical overflows by using Flow 3D software|Features and behavior of flow in hydraulic structures is one of the complex phenomena. Cylindrical overflow is a simple hydraulic structure which is used for energy dissipation, control and flow measurement. Hereof the sharp, wide and climactic edges overflows are used commonly. In water transmission and distribution systems, cylindrical overflows and crest- circular overflows because of being affordable and ease of fabrication compared with other overflows can be used for measurement of flow rate, evacuation buildings of flow water and controlling the level of water in canals and reservoirs. The water flow on overflow of dams and used overflows in water supply and sewage networks are some cases that a design engineer is in contact with them.
L62|Planned Obsolescence and Product-Service Systems: Linking Two Contradictory Business Models|Planned obsolescence and product-service systems are two business models which have evolved as popular strategies for technology oriented companies. Interestingly they appear to be contradictory. While planned obsolescence refers to the policy of planning or designing a product with a limited life span, product-service systems are integrated combinations of products and services, designed to jointly meet and fulfill specific customer needs. We present examples that illustrate both approaches and reveal and discuss interdependencies and linkages between the two business models. Based on additional illustrative cases, we discuss possible combinations of both approaches and develop a conceptual framework for evaluating the applicability of hybrid combinations of planned obsolescence and product-service systems with respect to different industries and corporate resources and competencies. Although there is no connection at first sight, our conceptual framework suggests that planned obsolescence and product-service systems are not mutually exclusive, but rather describe two ends of a business model or strategy continuum. Moreover, our framework provides some straightforward managerial implications and paves the way for further research.
L62|Fuel Prices, New Vehicle Fuel Economy, and Implications for Attribute-Based Standards|Energy efficiency standards based on product attributes may interact with market conditions and affect the overall stringency of the standards. In this paper we analyze the interaction between gasoline prices and the redesigned and tightened federal fuel economy standards. Tightened standards tend to reduce the effect of gasoline prices on market shares. Furthermore, under the standards a vehicle’s fuel economy requirement depends on its size. Lower gasoline prices incentivize consumers to purchase new vehicles with lower fuel economy, which are typically larger and therefore face lower fuel economy requirements. Using monthly data from 1996 to 2015, we find that fuel prices have had a smaller effect on market shares in recent years than previously. This result appears to be driven by a stronger response to rising than falling or stable prices. We construct two proxies for the stringency of the standards, and we find limited evidence that the standards affect the relationship between fuel prices and market shares. Using the estimated responsiveness to fuel costs from the 2008–15 period, the estimates imply that the 25% gasoline price decrease between 2014 and 2015 had a modest effect on average fuel economy and the average fuel economy required by the standards.
L62|Although economic theory suggests that market size and fuel costs affect fuel-saving technology adoption by vehicle manufacturers, there is very little empirical evidence. We document a strong connection between market size, as measured by a vehicle’s sales, and technology adoption. Using a demographics-driven demand shifter to instrument for market size, we find that a 10 percent increase in market size raises power train efficiency by 0.2 percent, compared with a mean improvement rate of 1.4 percent per year between 1997 and 2013. Higher fuel prices affect technology adoption directly by influencing willingness to pay for fuel cost savings, and indirectly by influencing market size. The results have two implications: policies promoting alternative-fuel vehicles will be less effective than previously thought; and fuel taxes have different effects on technology adoption than do fuel economy standards and feebates|No abstract is available for this item.
L62|Explaining the Evolution of Passenger Vehicle Miles Traveled in the United States|After growing steadily for several decades, passenger vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the United States unexpectedly leveled off in the 2000s. The growth rate of VMT has since rebounded, and determining the factors that explain these developments has implications for future U.S. oil consumption and vehicle pollution. We show that changes in the demographics and economic characteristics of households in the United States, rather than in driving habits, explain most of the recent dynamics. This suggests that over the next decade, VMT in the United States will continue to grow roughly at historical rates, causing substantially higher oil consumption and pollution than if persistent changes in driving habits explained the recent changes in VMT. The projected VMT growth will raise the cost of meeting energy security, climate, and local air quality objectives.
L62|Interactions between Climate and Local Air Pollution Policies: The Case of European Passenger Cars|Several studies have found that taxing vehicle purchase or ownership on the basis of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reduces CO2 emissions. In this paper I show that CO2-based vehicle taxation can raise emissions of other pollutants that harm air quality and that the magnitude of this unintended effect depends on consumer substitution across and within gasoline and diesel fuel vehicles. Using data on European vehicle registrations, fuel prices, fuel taxes, and vehicle taxes from 2002 through 2010, I estimate the relevant substitution patterns and compare the performance of several empirical strategies based on the recent vehicle tax literature. According to the preferred specification, vehicle tax reforms have increased nitrogen oxide emissions, which harm local air quality. Moreover, fuel-based CO2 taxes introduce milder trade-offs between CO2 and nitrogen oxides emissions than do vehicle taxes.
L62|Paratransit Mesoeconomy: Control Measures From The Supply Side?|The South African Minibus Taxi industry has had to various degrees been affected by government intervention, in micro, and macroeconomic forms. Transporting on average 11.9% and 15% of education trips and 26.88% and 26.18% of working trips between 2003 and 2013 respectively, the minibus sector dominates the market second to walking (Statistics South Africa, 2014; 2003). Recent transport policies seem to discourage the dominance of private cars and minibus vehicles. Meanwhile, the Department of Trade and Industry has developed an incentive package for the production of minibus vehicles. In the microeconomy, transportation policy makers tend to focus on the travel market, whilst manufacturers focus on the demand for minibus vehicles. This study proposes and tests a framework to explore the extent to which travel and production microeconomic indicators relate to dynamic macroeconomic activity over time. This paper is an experimental exploration of statistical relationships between selected macroeconomic indicators (SMIs) and the national minibus economy measured in vehicle sales and prices. Sales data is sourced from the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA) and price data from a manufacture dominating the market. Firstly, are there statistically significant macroeconomic forces at play in the minibus economy? Secondly, do these SMIs relate to minibus sales data including sales price per seat, registered vehicle population, vehicle sales, market ejections per year and cumulative forms of this data? We investigate this through correlation (a) analysis of price data, (b) sales data, (c) vehicle population in the travel market and (d) SMI data between 2002 and 2011. This is a mesoeconomic study, bridging the policy gap between macroeconomics (i.e. CPI) and microeconomics (i.e. vehicle population in the travel market). Statistically significant relationships and path dependencies are revealed within the framework developed. Therefore mesoeconomic research in the transport economic sphere is significantly viable. One shortfall of the paper is that the microeconomic analysis is narrow because travel data and vehicle utilisation data is not included. Further quantitative research is required to inform a policy agenda that enables an understanding of macroeconomic forces (national and regional level) that filter through transport economic policy. This study lays a unique avenue to equip transit and automotive decision makers, industries and planners to better forge through changes in the macroeconomy in microeconomic contexts.
L62|Gainers and Losers of Political Instability: Evidence from the Anti-Japanese Demonstration in China|This paper quantifies the Chinese consumers’ boycott of Japanese cars that immediately followed the anti-Japanese demonstration in September 2012.We decompose the total boycott effect into cancel effect and transfer effect. We find that the temporary cancellation of orders by potential buyers accounts for more than 90% of the total decline in Japanese car sales. Such results indicate that Japanese car makers lost these customers only for the short-run. European, Korean, American, and Chinese cars became the dominant substitutes for lost Japanese sales; Chinese brands benefited the least. This paper provides evidence of both negative and positive impacts of political conflicts for different market participants and includes analysis of welfare implications.
L62|Direct and indirect price discrimination in the automotive industries of the European Union|Abstract Using a panel dataset comprising of 51 models across 21 European Union member states, I estimate the effects of country-specific factors that make price discrimination profitable. Taking advantage of cross-country heterogeneities, I find that a domestic brand bias, per capita income, and income inequalities lead to significantly different prices across borders. The role of income inequalities is supported by a theoretical model of indirect price discrimination at the national level. We therefore conclude that not only direct international price discrimination, but also indirect national price discrimination is responsible for the observed price differentials across international borders, which are not likely to fully converge as long as the exclusive dealership system is in place, and significant demand-side differences still remain.
L62|Institutional support, regional trade linkages and technological capabilities in the semiconductor industry in Malaysia| This article examines the relationship between host-site institutional support and regional trade linkages on firm-level technological capabilities in the semiconductor industry in Malaysia. An evolutionary perspective was used to measure technological capabilities using knowledge embodied in machinery, organization, processes and products. The results show that host-site institutional support and regional trade linkages were correlated with technological upgrading. The relationship between host-site institutional support and technological upgrading was stronger than that between regional trade linkages and technological upgrading. The results show that host-site institutional support is more important than regional integration in influencing firms' capacity to upgrade their technological capabilities.
L62|Institutional support, technological capabilities and domestic linkages in the semiconductor industry in Singapore| This article examines the relationships between host-site institutional support and firm-level technological upgrading, and between technological upgrading and domestic production linkages in the semiconductor industry in Singapore. An evolutionary perspective was used to measure technological capabilities using knowledge embodied in machinery, organization, processes and products. The results show that host-site institutional support is important for technological upgrading, and technological capabilities are positively correlated with domestic linkages. Also, domestic linkages rather than regional linkages were correlated with technological upgrading, which is a consequence of Singapore's sophisticated infrastructure compared to its neighbours in South-east Asia.
L62|Host-site support, foreign ownership, regional linkages and technological capabilities: evidence from automotive firms in Indonesia| This study analyses the influence of host-site institutional support, foreign ownership and regional production linkages on firm-level technological capabilities using data from automotive firms in Indonesia. The results show that host-site institutional support and foreign ownership are positively correlated with technological capabilities. In addition, regional linkages show a significant and positive link on technological capabilities. However, regional linkages and foreign ownership explain more strongly technological capabilities than host-site institutional support in automotive firms in Indonesia. This evidence suggests that the supporting high-tech environment require further strengthening to stimulate higher technological capabilities in the automotive industry in Indonesia.
L62|Estimating light-vehicle sales in Turkey|This paper is motivated by the surprising rapid growth of new light-vehicle sales in Turkey in 2015. Domestic sales grew 25%, dramatically surpassing the industry estimates of around 8%. Our approach is to inform the sales trend estimate with the information obtained from the light-vehicle stock (the number of cars and light trucks officially registered in the country), and the scrappage data. More specifically, we improve the sales trend estimate by estimating the trend of its stock. Using household data, we show that an important reason for the rapid sales growth is that an increasing share of household budgets is spent on automobile purchases. The elasticity of light-vehicle sales to cyclical changes in aggregate demand is high and robust; its estimates are around 6 with a standard deviation of about 0.5. The price elasticity of light-vehicle sales is estimated to be about 0.8, but the estimates are imprecise and not robust. We estimate the trend level of light-vehicle sales to be roughly 7 percent of the existing stock. A remarkable out-of-sample forecast performance is obtained for horizons up to nearly a decade by a regression equation using only a cyclical gap measure, the time trend and obvious policy dummies. Various specifications suggest that the strong 2015 growth of light-vehicle sales was predictable in late 2014.
L62|Fiscal Policy and CO2 Emissions of New Passenger Cars in the EU|T o what extent have national fiscal policies contributed to the decarbonisation of newly sold passenger cars? We construct a simple model that generates predictions regarding the effect of fiscal policies on average CO2 emissions of new cars, and then test the model empirically. Our empirical strategy combines a diverse series of data. First, we use a large database of vehicle-specific taxes in 15 EU countries over 2001-2010 to construct a measure for the vehicle registration and annual road tax levels, and separately, for the CO2 sensitivity of these taxes. We find that for many countries the fiscal policies have become more sensitive to CO2 emissions of new cars. We then use these constructed measures to estimate the effect of fiscal policies on the CO2 emissions of the new car fleet. The increased CO2-sensitivity of registration taxes have reduced the CO2 emission intensity of the average new car by 1,3 percent, partly through an induced increase of the share of diesel-fuelled cars by 6,5 percentage points. Higher fuel taxes lead to the purchase of more fuel efficient cars, but higher annual road taxes have no or an adverse effect.
L62|The Relationship between Market Structure and Innovation in Industry Equilibrium: A Case Study of the Global Automobile Industry|We specify and estimate a dynamic game to study the equilibrium relationship between market structure and innovation in the automobile industry. The quality of each firm’s product for the average consumer, the key state variable, is modeled as stochastically increasing in innovation, the dynamic control, which is proxied by patent applications. Equilibrium innovation is a function of market structure, the vector of quality levels of all active firms, and the cost of R&D. Our main findings are as follows: (a) optimal innovation has an inverted-U shape in own quality; (b) holding own quality constant, innovation is declining in average rival quality but increasing in quality dispersion; and (c) following entry, each incumbent’s innovation declines, but aggregate innovation increases in most market structures. These findings are broadly consistent with the Schumpeterian hypothesis that market power leads to more innovation.
L62|Changes in fuel economy: An analysis of the Spanish car market|This paper estimates the role that technological change and car characteristics have played in the rate of fuel consumption of vehicles over time. Using data from the Spanish car market from 1988 to 2013, we estimate a reduced form equation that relates fuel consumption with a set of car characteristics. The results for the sales-weighted sample of vehicles show that energy efficiency would have improved by 32% and 40% for petrol and diesel cars respectively had car characteristics been held constant at 1988 values. However, the shift to bigger and more fuel-consuming cars reduced the gains from technological progress. Additionally, using the results of the fuel equation we show that, besides a natural growth rate of 1.1%, technological progress is affected by both the international price of oil and the adoption of mandatory emission standards. Moreover, according to our estimations, a 1% growth in GDP would modify car characteristics in such a way that fuel consumption would increase by around 0.23% for petrol cars and 0.35% for diesel cars.
L62|Carbon Taxes, Path Dependency, and Directed Technical Change: Evidence from the Auto Industry|"Can directed technical change be used to combat climate change? We construct new firm-level panel data on auto industry innovation distinguishing between ""dirty"" (internal combustion engine) and ""clean"" (e.g., electric, hybrid, and hydrogen) patents across 80 countries over several decades. We show that firms tend to innovate more in clean (and less in dirty) technologies when they face higher tax-inclusive fuel prices. Furthermore, there is path dependence in the type of innovation (clean/dirty) both from aggregate spillovers and from the firm's own innovation history. We simulate the increases in carbon taxes needed to allow clean technologies to overtake dirty technologies."

Die damit verbundene Vernetzung öffnet die Autoindustrie auch für potenzielle Neueinsteiger aus der Elektronikindustrie und der Internet-Technologie, die in diesem Bereich hohe Kompetenzen besitzen. Für etablierte Anbieter stellt eine mögliche disruptive Veränderung eine Bedrohung bestehender Märkte dar. Aber auch eine schrittweise Einführung der neuen Technologien ver­stärkt den Wettbewerb. Gleichwohl sind deutsche Autounternehmen aufgrund ihrer Marktpositionierung im Premiumsegment, besonders aber auch wegen der hohen Forschungsleistung gut aufgestellt, um die Herausforderungen erfolgreich anzunehmen.
L62|Technologie, Qualifikationen und internationale Arbeitsteilung: Anmerkungen zu der Diskussion über Industrie 4.0|"Welche Chancen bieten neue Produktionstechnologien im Kontext der Industrie 4.0 für Hochlohnstandorte, um gegenüber Niedriglohnstandorten wettbewerbsfähiger zu werden und unter Umständen sogar verlagerte Produktion zurückzuholen? Dies wird im vorliegenden Discussion Paper anhand einer Analyse der Arbeitsteilung zwischen deutschen und mittelosteuropäischen Standorten von Automobilzulieferunternehmen untersucht. Dabei werden drei Fragen verfolgt: Wie verändert sich das Technologiegefälle zwischen Hochlohn- und Niedriglohnstandorten? Welche Kriterien bestimmen die Wahl der Prozesstechnologie an Hochlohn- und Niedriglohnstandorten? Welche Bedeutung haben insbesondere Qualifikationsstrukturen auf dem Shopfloor für den Einsatz moderner Produktionstechnologien? Die Analyse zeigt, dass es ein Technologiegefälle zwischen Hochlohn- und Niedriglohnstandorten nur noch begrenzt gibt. Die Kombination von Kostendruck und hohen Qualitätsanforderungen führt dazu, dass neue Technologien sehr schnell global eingesetzt werden. Zugleich übernehmen aber deutsche Standorte im Vergleich zu Mittelosteuropa immer noch deutlich häufiger die Leitrolle bei der Einführung neuer Produktionstechnologien. Dies liegt vor allem an der Nähe zur Produktentwicklung der Automobilhersteller und der Zulieferer selbst sowie zu den Anlagenherstellern, die Kooperation erleichtert. Diese Leitrolle deutscher Werke führt auch zu unterschiedlichen Qualifikationsstrukturen auf dem Shopfloor im Vergleich mit Mittelosteuropa. Auch wenn wir Werke mit gleichem Technologie- bzw. Automatisierungsniveau vergleichen, zeichnen sich die deutschen Standorte durch einen geringeren Einsatz angelernter Arbeitskräfte und eine stärkere Nutzung beruflich-fachlicher Qualifikationen aus. Der Grund für diesen Unterschied sind die Kompetenzen, die bei der Kooperation mit der Produktentwicklung, Planung oder den Anlagenherstellern auf dem Shopfloor benötigt werden. Durch diese Leitrolle und die entsprechenden Qualifikationsstrukturen verfügen die deutschen Standorte gegenüber Niedriglohnwerken über einen Vorteil, den sie auch im Hinblick auf Industrie-4.0-Konzepte nutzen können. Die hier diskutierten Daten und Befunde stammen aus dem von der Hans-Böckler-Stiftung geförderten Forschungsprojekt ""Standortperspektiven in der Automobilzulieferindustrie"", das von Martin Krzywdzinski (WZB) und Axel Schröder (WZB) gemeinsam mit Martin Schwarz- Kocher und Heinz Pfäfflin (IMU Institut) sowie Inger Korflür und Ralf Löckener (Sustain Consult) durchgeführt wurde.

L62|Are There Environmental Benefits from Driving Electric Vehicles? The Importance of Local Factors|We combine a theoretical discrete-choice model of vehicle purchases, an econometric analysis of electricity emissions, and the AP2 air pollution model to estimate the geographic variation in the environmental benefits from driving electric vehicles. The second-best electric vehicle purchase subsidy ranges from $2,785 in California to -$4,964 in North Dakota, with a mean of -$1,095. Ninety percent of local environmental externalities from driving electric vehicles in one state are exported to others, implying they may be subsidized locally, even when the environmental benefits are negative overall. Geographically differentiated subsidies can reduce deadweight loss, but only modestly.
L62|Bid Takers or Market Makers? The Effect of Auctioneers on Auction Outcome|Auction design has been studied extensively; however, within a given design, does the process of how an auction is conducted matter as well? We address this question by looking for heterogeneity in the performance of auctioneers in English auctions. We analyze over 850,000 wholesale used car auctions and find significant differences across auctioneers in outcomes for otherwise similar cars. The performance heterogeneities are stable across time and correlate with subjective evaluations by the auction house. We discuss the mechanisms driving differential performance and find evidence suggesting a role for tactics that generate bidder excitement or urgency.
L62|Reserve Price Effects In Auctions: Estimates From Multiple Regression-Discontinuity Designs|" type=""main"" xml:id=""ecin12226-abs-0001""> We present evidence from 260,000 online auctions of second-hand cars to identify the impact of public reserve prices on auction outcomes. We exploit multiple discontinuities in the relationship between reserve prices and vehicle characteristics to present causal regression-discontinuity estimates of reserve price impacts. We find an increase in reserve price decreases the number of bidders, increases the likelihood the object remains unsold, and increases expected revenue conditional on sale. We then combine these estimates to calibrate the reserve price effect on the auctioneer's ex ante expected revenue. This reveals the auctioneer's reserve price policy to be locally optimal.

It echoes the literature on connected products, Internet of things and ?big data?. The specificity of this paper is to propose an original interpretation in terms of ?augmented market strategy?. The latter refers to a strategy of expanding the boundaries of a market through the networking of industries that mobilize concomitantly a same intangible (knowledge, information, etc.) or physical (infrastructure, technology, etc.) basis, at various levels of the value chain. The aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, it aims to contribute to the exploratory analysis of such strategies, to characterize them, to identify their key determinants and to illustrate their contemporary forms. On the other hand, we seek to evaluate the theoretical scope of our concepts and to position them in the field of industrial convergence. JEL Codes: L11, L16, L22, L25, L62, L90

L62|Network Structure and Industrial Clustering Dynamics in the Aerospace Industry|We use a new firm level dataset to study the network of formal firm linkages within and across 52 aerospace clusters in North America and Europe over the period 2002-2014. Applying community structure detection techniques, we find that the structure of the overall network has changed over time. We organize sub-networks by linkage type and find two important trends in their evolution. First, new linkages in the vertical buyer-supplier sub-network are generally formed in a hierarchical hub-and-spoke fashion, whereas new links in the horizontal partnership sub-network are generated in a more decentralized and cohesive manner. Second, the geographical scope of new linkages is different, with vertical buyer-supplier and investment linkages moving increasingly trans-local and partnership linkages becoming more localized. Taken together, our findings suggest that the overall network is evolving from a geographically partitioned community structure to a hierarchical community structure that is stratified along value chain stages.
L62|Indirect Inference with Endogenously Missing Exogenous Variables|We consider consistent estimation of parameters in a structural model by Indirect Inference (II) when the exogenous variables can be missing at random (MAR) endogenously. We demonstrate that II procedures which simply discard sample units with missing observations can yield inconsistent estimates of the true structural parameters. By inverse probability weighting (IPW) the “complete case” observations, i.e., sample units with no missing variables for the observed and simulated samples, we propose a new method of II to consistently estimate the structural parameters of interest. Asymptotic properties of the new estimator are discussed. An illustration is provided based on a multinomial probit model. A small scale Monte-Carlo study in this model demonstrates the severe bias incurred by existing II estimators, and its subsequent correction by our new II estimator.
L62|Social Results of Domestic and Foreign Firms: Case Manufacture of Transport Equipment in Russia|The article studies the impact of creation of foreign enterprises on social indicators in the developing countries. We compare social results of foreign and joint enterprises foreign and joint ownership (FJO) and domestic enterprises Russian ownership (RO) in manufacturing of transport equipment in various regions of Russia. The multivariate statistical analysis is applied to compare the social results. Using the variance analysis, we find that the level of the average salary and growth rates of employment and payroll of FJO enterprises are higher compared to the RO enterprises. At the same time, FJO enterprises are characterized by a lower labor intensity and payroll-output ratio. The clustering into three pairs of factorial indicators of Russian regions is performed separately for RO and FJO enterprises. The clustering displayed statistically significant differences in the social results among the groups of regions.
L62|Comparison of Investment Activity of the Russian and Foreign Manufacturers: Case from Manufacturing of Transportation Vehicles|The purpose of this paper is to study the indices of investment activity of subsection DM “manufacturing of transportation vehicles and equipment” enterprises under Russian, foreign and joint ownership (JO). Multivariate statistical analysis of the investment activity was performed at the Russian regional level. Using analysis of variance we identified statistically significant differences of the investment to shipped products ratio and investment structure in fixed capital between Russian, foreign and JO enterprises. Using methods of hierarchical classification, two models of clustering of regions were performed for each form of ownership. The clustering demonstrated that during the years of 2010-2013 the process of intensive creation of enterprises under foreign ownership in certain regions of Russia continued. In regions with enterprises under Russian and JO a low intensity of investment processes was identified. Some region clusters with enterprises under JO have high share of investment into foreign machinery and equipment.
L62|Scrapping subsidies during the financial crisis — Evidence from Europe|We study the effects of car scrapping subsidies in Europe during the financial crisis. We make use of a rich data set of all car models sold in eight European countries, observed at a monthly level during 1998–2011. We employ a difference-in-differences approach, exploiting the fact that different countries adopted their programs at different points in time. We find that the scrapping schemes played a strong role in stabilizing total car sales in 2009: they prevented a total car sales reduction of 30.5% in countries with schemes targeted to low emission vehicles, and a 29.0% sales reduction in countries with non-targeted schemes. We find evidence of crowding out due to substitution from non-eligible to eligible cars in France and Spain. Because eligible cars tend to be more fuel efficient, targeted scrapping schemes had significant environmental benefits in the form of improved fuel consumption: without the schemes, the average fuel consumption of new purchased cars would have been 3.6% higher. Those benefits did not materialize under non-targeted schemes, in which the fuel consumption would have been only 0.7% higher absent the scheme. Finally, we find some evidence that domestically produced cars benefited at the expense of foreign competitors especially in countries where the schemes were not targeted.
L62|Disentangling sources of vehicle emissions reduction in France: 2003–2008|We analyze the evolution of CO2 emissions of new vehicles sold in France between 2003 and 2008. We investigate in particular the effect of two policies introduced during that time: the energy label requirement, which went into effect in the end of 2005, and a feebate based on CO2 emissions of new vehicles in 2008. We estimate a flexible model of demand for automobiles that incorporates consumers’ heterogeneity and valuation of vehicle CO2 emissions. Our results show that there has been a shift in preferences towards low-emitting cars. Moreover, the timing of these changes is consistent with the introduction of the two policies. This suggests that the feebate had a crowding-in effect in addition to its price effect. Overall, the change in preferences accounts for 40% of the overall decrease in average CO2 emissions of new cars in the period.
L62|The determinants of dealership structure: Empirical analysis of the Chinese auto market|This paper investigates the factors that affect manufacturers’ decisions to grant local monopoly to a dealer and the factors that determine the dealer’s status of sole dealership in the Chinese automobile market. Our empirical findings suggest that manufacturer decisions depend on dealers’ retail network: manufacturers are inclined to choose a sole dealer for their brands if that dealer also has retail outlets for substitute brands in the local market and to choose multiple dealers otherwise. These findings can be explained by the theory proposed by [Mathewson, G. F., Winter, R. A., 1994. Territorial restrictions in franchise contracts. Economic Inquiry 32 (2), 181–192.], who suggest that manufacturers transfer the exclusive right of resale from themselves to dealers only if dealers’ contribution is crucial to the vertical relationship. When dealers also have extensive retail channels for other brands, their retail efforts and experience become crucial to brand success, and thus manufacturers are more likely to offer them sole resale rights. Moreover, our empirical findings suggest that manufacturers also consider product quality and market conditions when making their decisions.
L62|The effect of vehicle fuel economy standards on technology adoption|Many countries are tightening passenger vehicle fuel economy standards. This paper provides the first empirical evidence on the effects of fuel economy standards on technology adoption. We investigate changes in the rate and direction of technology adoption, that is, the extent to which technology is used to increase fuel economy at the expense of other vehicle attributes. We find that recent changes in U.S. and European standards have both increased the rate of technology adoption and affected the direction of technology adoption. Producers reduced horsepower and torque compared to a counterfactual in which fuel economy standards remained unchanged. We estimate opportunity costs from reduced horsepower and torque to be economically significant relative to the gains from fuel savings.
L62|The employment impact of motor vehicle assembly plant openings|Local governments often offer motor vehicle assembly plants large subsidies to locate in their jurisdiction. A frequent justification is that an assembly plant will attract upstream parts suppliers to locate nearby and provide manufacturing jobs. Using propensity score matching, I find that an assembly plant brings an average of 500 additional parts supplier jobs beyond the employment gains the region would have experienced without the assembly plant. This increase is far less than predicted by the input–output models that state development agencies often employ.
L62|The role of diversification profiles and dyadic characteristics in the formation of technological alliances: Differences between exploitation and exploration in a low-tech industry|This paper posits that corporate and technological diversification of firms and their relatedness in terms of products and technologies will impact their propensity to form technological alliances. It argues that both higher levels of diversification and greater relatedness signal superior capabilities and available resources to prospective partners that will facilitate exploration and exploitation of technological assets in an alliance. These theoretical conjectures are tested using a dataset of all tire producers worldwide between 1985 and 1996 that combines detailed firm data on establishment, patenting, and alliance activities. The results indicate that complementarity in terms of corporate and technological diversification strategies, as well as partner characteristics (e.g., size, age, and technological capabilities) drive exploitation alliances. Moreover, firms with similar product portfolios are more likely to engage in exploitative interactions. In contrast, exploration alliances exhibit strong partner similarity across all firm characteristics. Both corporate and technological diversification have positive effects on firms’ propensity to engage in exploration, while technological distance has a negative nonlinear one.
L62|Towards a liberalised European rail transport: Analysing and modelling the impact of competition on productive efficiency|This paper contributes to the railway benchmarking literature in three ways. Firstly, we used the stochastic distance function to measure productive efficiency and productivity change while considering multiple outputs in the railway sector. This method is less used among the studies that compare the performance of railway. Secondly, we calculate the evolution and decomposition of the total factor productivity for European railway. The average rate of productivity showed a slight annual improvement of 27% and the core engine of this was a 25% increase in technical progress. Results by country identify those needing improvement, to be more attractive. Finally, we use a limited dependent variable model to test the impact of rail liberalization process on productive efficiency. Results show that competition tendering improves productive efficiency, whereas free entry delivers the opposite result. Our results also show that competition and the overall liberalization have no impact on productive efficiency. It seems that liberalization process in not the key success factor for the railway industry. Our suggestion is that, in Europe, instead of focusing on rail liberalization process, policy maker should give priority to productivity gains.
L62|Economic integration, product cycles and regime effects|By adopting the modified north–south product cycle model of Grossman and Helpman (G&H, hereafter) (1991a) and adding “two-way” FDIs to form a complete economic integration, we obtain the opposite conclusion for such regime effects from that of both Krugman (1979) and G&H (1991b) in different frameworks, while G&H (1991a) have similar results in the same oligopolistic framework (without FDIs) we adopt. This demonstrates that the relative wage rate between the north and south will not be affected by the size of labor markets and that there are no regime effects on relative wage rate, regardless of their existing FDIs.
L62|Cash flow sensitivities during normal and crisis times: Evidence from shipping|Using a system of equations model, we analyze how cash flow shocks influence the investment and financing decisions of shipping firms in different economic environments. Even financially healthy shipping firms felt strong negative effects on their financing activities during the recent crisis. These firms were nevertheless able to increase long-term debt. Banks internalized the impact of foreclosure decisions on vessel prices and avoided an industry-wide collateral channel effect. Even during benign economic conditions, financially weak shipping firms underinvest because of their inability to raise sufficient external capital. The substitution between long- and short-term debt during the pre-2008 crisis periods shows that the composition of financing sources is more indicative of whether firms face financial constraints than the pure size of the financing-cash flow sensitivities. An analysis of firms’ excess cash holdings confirms the importance of financial flexibility.
L62|Evaluation of subsidies programs to sell green cars: Impact on prices, quantities and efficiency|During the recent period of economic crisis, many countries have introduced scrappage schemes to boost the sale and production of vehicles, particularly of vehicles designed to pollute less. In this paper, the authors analyze the impact of a particular scheme in Spain (Plan2000E) on vehicle prices and sales figures as well as on the reduction of polluting emissions from vehicles on the road. They considered the introduction of this scheme an exogenous policy change and because they could distinguish a control group (both non-subsidized vehicles and the same vehicles in Slovenia) and a treatment group (subsidized vehicles), before and after the introduction of the Plan, the authors were able to carry out their analysis as a quasi-natural experiment. The study reveals that manufacturers increased vehicle prices by 600 € on average. In terms of sales, econometric estimations revealed that the Plan would not cause any increase in sales. With regard to environmental efficiency, comparing the costs (invested quantity of money) and the benefits of the program (reductions in polluting emissions and additional fiscal revenues) and it has been found that the Plan would only be beneficial if it boosted demand by at least 30%.
L62|Determinants of Outsourcing in the Automobile Sector in India|This study involves the determination of outsourcing based on the market structure technology imports and technical efficiency for the automotive sector in India. An important characteristic of this study is that it divides the automotive sector into two sub-sectors (1) the automobile ancillaries sectors, which provides the parts and are the upstream firms and (2) the automobile assemblers who assemble the automobile and sell them to the consumers. Our analysis confirms the fact that when the data is segregated in the two sectors, factors like technical efficiency of firms have opposite effect on the outsourcing tendencies.
L62|The Effect of Registration Taxes on New Car Sales and Emissions: Evidence from Switzerland|In Switzerland, the annual circulation taxes on road vehicles are set by and paid to the cantons (not to the federal government). We exploit the 26 different circulation tax rules and their variation over time, which we interpret as a natural experiment, to see if linking them to a vehicle’s CO2 emissions rate has helped shift new car sales towards cleaner, lower-emitting vehicles. We find that even when the penalty associated with a highly polluting vehicle is high, the effect is relatively small. For example, in canton Zurich, imposing a 50% “malus” on the annual registration fee for cars that emit 200 or more grams of CO2 per kilometer reduces the average CO2 emissions rate from new cars by only 0.46 gram per kilometer, bringing it to 158.11 grams per kilometer in 2011. A similar effect would be attained with a modest increase in fuel taxes.
L62|The impact of emissions-based taxes on the retirement of used and inefficient vehicles: The case of Switzerland|Previous evaluations of emissions-based car taxes have estimated their impact on the shares or sales of new vehicles. In contrast, we ask whether taxes that penalize high emitters induce changes in the retirement of existing and inefficient vehicles. We exploit natural experiment conditions in Switzerland to analyze the impact of three different “bonus”/“malus” annual registration fee schemes implemented at the cantonal level. In the three schemes, the bonus rewards new, fuel-efficient vehicles. The malus is retroactive in canton Obwalden, i.e. it is charged on both new and existing high-emitting cars, but prospective in Geneva and Ticino. We use a difference-in-difference design within a survival analysis framework to assess direct treatment effects and spillover effects. While the bonus/malus in Obwalden hastens the retirement of existing high-emitting vehicles (by around 5%), the scheme in Geneva postpones retirement (by some 3%). We find no statistically significant effects in Ticino. These findings have important implications about the desirability of bonus/malus schemes and on their design, as well as on old car scrappage programs.
L62|Evidence on the Within-Industry Agglomeration of R&D, Production, and Administrative Occupations|To date, most empirical studies of industrial agglomeration rely on data where observations are assigned an industry code based on classification systems such as NAICS in North America and NACE in Europe. This study combines industry data with occupation data to show that there are important differences in the spatial patterns of occupation groups within the widely used industry definitions. We focus on workers in manufacturing industries, whose occupations almost always fit into three groups: production, administrative, or R&D. We then employ two approaches to document the spatial distributions of each group within an industry. First, we calculate the distribution of employment shares across local labor markets and second, we calculate a version of the Duranton and Overman (2005) agglomeration index. Both approaches reveal appreciable differences in the spatial distribution of occupation groups within most manufacturing industries. These differences have important implications for our understanding of the sources of industrial agglomeration, the spatial agglomeration of innovation, the effectiveness of local economic development initiatives, and the spatial properties of particular industries.
L62|Emergence of an automotive cluster in Tangier (Morocco)|The paper analyses the emergence of new automobile cluster in the region of Tangier (Morocco) associated to the location of a Renault assembly plant in 2012. It is based on a survey realized by a team of French and Moroccan researchers. It discusses the conditions of the location of the French carmaker, at the crossroads of its internationalisation strategy and of the industrialization policy of the Moroccan government for the Northern country. It studies the impact of this location on the supplier industry and on local employment, underlining the limits in terms of industrial development. Presently, it is more an agglomeration of automotive activities rather than a true integrated industrial cluster.
L62|From the Logan to the Kwid. \r\nAmbidexterity, reverse and fractal innovation, design-to-cost: recipes from Renault\'s Entry strategy|"A detailed comparative analysis of two \""low cost\"" car projects at Renault (Logan and Kwid) illustrates how the Entry strategy has fundamentally transformed the French carmaker. An increasingly explicit reverse innovation approach has emerged, along with systematic adoption of design-to-cost methods, which are at the heart of fractal innovation. The first part of the paper analyses the conditions under which this strategy has been progressively adopted and the second part explains its implementation throughout the management of these two projects."
L62|Is the Fuel Cell Vehicle’s Technological Innovation System built at a global or national scale? An analysis of carmakers' co-patents’ portfolios|This paper wishes to contribute to the Technological Innovation System (TIS) literature. More precisely, we study the geographic delineation issue of a focal TIS. In a first part, we discuss the geographic delineation debate in TIS framework, and we explain why co-patents are a good tool for mapping a TIS. Then considering the Fuel Cell Vehicle (FCV) as a focal TIS, we analyse 10 carmakers’ co-patent networks in FCV technologies between 2000 and 2013. Our database includes 3,250 co-patents. First, we build the networks corresponding to the three periods 2000-2004, 2000-2009, and 2000-2013. Second, we measure the nationalization index of their networks. Third, we study with whom they have established formal collaborations. The results show: 1) the internationalization increased slowly during the time span. We observe an extension of the network until 2009 and then, a consolidation trend; 2) the nationalization index is rather strong for 5 carmakers, and very weak for 3 others; 3) carmakers call upon different kinds of partners, located, moreover, in different places. The final section learns the lessons from the empirical study.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L62|Asymmetric Information in Auctions: Are Resellers Better Appraisers?|This paper shows that in online car auctions, resellers are better at appraising the value of the cars they are bidding on than are consumers. Using a unique data set of online car auctions, I show that differences in bidding behavior between resellers and consumers can be explained by heterogeneity in the accuracy of bidders’ private signals and heterogeneity in the dispersion of private value components. I use the asymmetric ascending auction model of Hong and Shum (2003) to quantify the differences between resellers and consumers, finding that the dispersion of reseller value signals is roughly half that of consumers and simulate three different counterfactual scenarios - one in which consumers are provided with more information, one in which consumers are subsidized and one in which consumers are allowed into all-reseller auctions. Finally, I argue that the asymmetry in signal precision stems not from asymmetric information regarding the technical characteristics of a car but rather from uncertainty about the car’s resale value.
L62|Integration And Competitiveness Of The Automotive Industry In The State Of Puebla, Integracion Y Competitividad De La Industria Automotriz En El Estado De Puebla|"This paper analyzes the Mexican automotive industry, with emphasis on a conglomerate industry located in the State of Puebla. The objective is to analyze the conditions and perspectives of the production chains in the cluster, recent investments, as well as competitiveness. The ""Five forces Porter"" tool, is used for the analysis that examines the threats from competitors, the power of negotiations of the suppliers and customers, as well as government policies negotiations and the threat of substitute products. However the most significant issue is to visualize the level of competitiveness and the possibility to identify threats and opportunities for the automotive local industry, considering the importance of the industry as premises and as the axes of uncertainty in technological innovation and the competitiveness of support companies. We examine the cluster led by the German company Volkswagen, and the recent branch of luxury cars from Audi installed in the State of Puebla and its surroundings, the guidelines are obtained through the technique known as ""Delphi Method"", concluding with the assumptions and uncertainties of the industry."
L62|Changes in fuel economy: An analysis of the Spanish car market|This paper estimates the role that technological change and car characteristics have played in the rate of fuel consumption of vehicles over time. Using data from the Spanish car market from 1988 to 2013, we estimate a reduced form equation that relates fuel consumption with a set of car characteristics. The results for the sales-weighted sample of vehicles show that energy efficiency would have improved by 30% and 42% for petrol and diesel cars respectively had car characteristics been held constant at 1988 values. However, the shift to bigger and more fuelconsuming cars reduced the gains from technological progress. Additionally, using the results of the fuel equation we show that, besides a natural growth rate of 1.1%, technological progress is affected by both the international price of oil and the adoption of mandatory emission standards. Moreover, according to our estimations, a 1% growth in GDP would modify car characteristics in such a way that fuel consumption would increase by around 0.23% for petrol cars and 0.35% for diesel cars.
L62|The effect of a specialized versus a general upper secondary school curriculum on students’ performance and inequality. A difference-in-differences cross country country comparison|Countries differ in their upper secondary school systems in a way that some require their students to choose a specialization from a set of areas - typically natural sciences, economic sciences, humanities or arts - and follow that specialization for the course of their upper secondary education years (e.g. Portugal, Spain, Sweden) whereas by contrast, others including Finland, Denmark or the U.S. follow a general curriculum where students, albeit being able to choose between different classes in distinct areas, are not required to follow a single specialization and thus, receive a more general education. Because countries only follow one system or the other, a cross-country analysis is required to estimate the possible effects of these institutional differences. An international differences-in-differences approach is chosen to account for country heterogeneity and unobserved factors influencing student outcomes, by using both PISA and PIAAC data for 20 different countries. The regression results suggest that the choice of one system or the other does not account for differences across countries in either the mean performance or the inequality of students’ test scores.
L62|Evolution Of The World Motor Vehicle Fleet In 2010-2014 And Prospects For 2020|This paper examines the evolution of the global vehicle fleet in the period 2010-2014 (thelatest year for which data are currently available). It reveals aspects regarding the evolution of theauto fleet, in general, and of cars and commercial vehicles fleet, in particular, as well as the rate ofmotorization worldwide, and by different countries and regions. It also provides a forecast for 2020.The analysis shows that the global automotive market has seen a gradual recovery after the 2007-2009 crisis, but recorded a somewhat lower pace of growth than before the crisis in terms of therelevant indicators.
L62|The Global Automotive Market. Developments In 2015 And Medium-Term Prospects|This paper examines the evolution of the main indicators of the international automotive market in 2015, compared with the previous year. It highlights several aspects related to production, registrations and international trade in vehicles as a whole, and by country and geographic regions, depending on available data. It also presents the major manufacturing and exporting companies, as well as the medium-term outlook (2018-2021) for this market. The analysis shows that 2015 has not been a favourable year for the global automotive industry, mainly due to lower sales in emerging markets, but there are premises for its revival in the coming years.
L62|The Growth Prospects for the World Tire Market in the Short and Medium-Term|The paper addresses the main aspects of the short and medium-term developments in the world market for motor vehicles tires, an industry which is related to the machine building industry, with the latter being seen as a barometer for the health of an economy. It analyzes the main trends in motor vehicles production worldwide during the years 2011-2014, and highlights the ranking of the ten largest tire manufacturing companies, as well as the outlook until 2025. The article contains also forecasts on the growth of this industry by regions.
L62|Estimating matching games with transfers|I explore the estimation of transferable utility matching games, encompassing manyâ€ toâ€ many matching, marriage, and matching with trading networks (trades). Computational issues are paramount. I introduce a matching maximum score estimator that does not suffer from a computational curse of dimensionality in the number of agents in a matching market. I apply the estimator to data on the car parts supplied by automotive suppliers to estimate the valuations from different portfolios of parts to suppliers and automotive assemblers.
L62|The incidence of Cash for Clunkers: Evidence from the 2009 car scrappage scheme in Germany|Abstract This paper investigates the German car scrappage program, focusing on the incidence of the premium. We ask how much of the €2500 ($3500) buyer subsidy is actually captured by the demand side. More precisely, we analyze the program’s impact on different car segments, allowing for heterogeneity in incidence at different points in the vehicle price distribution. Using a unique microtransaction data set, we find that the incidence of the subsidy strongly and significantly varies across price segments. Subsidized buyers of cheap cars paid a little more than comparable buyers who did not receive the subsidy, indicating incidence amounts slightly below 100 %. For more expensive vehicles, subsidized buyers were granted large extra discounts on top of the government premium, translating into incidence amounts considerably greater than 100 %. Taken together, this results in an aggregate incidence amount of up to plus €350 million, suggesting that the positive effect for expensive cars overcompensates the negative effect for small cars.
L62|Who is exposed to gas prices? How gasoline prices affect automobile manufacturers and dealerships|Abstract Many consumers are keenly aware of gasoline prices, and consumer responses to gasoline prices have been well studied. In this paper, by contrast, we investigate how gasoline prices affect the automobile industry: manufacturers and dealerships. We estimate how changes in gasoline prices affect equilibrium prices and sales of both new and used vehicles of different fuel economies. We investigate the implications of these effects for individual auto manufacturers, taking into account differences in manufacturers’ vehicle portfolios. We also investigate effects on manufacturers’ affiliated dealership networks, including effects implied by the changes in used vehicle market outcomes.
L62|Do battery-switching systems accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles? A stated preference study|We estimate willingness-to-pay (WTP) for building refueling stations for battery-switching electric vehicles (SEVs) and battery-recharging electric vehicles (REVs) by using a choice experiment. Our results show that consumers prefer a REV to a SEV even if the recharging rate of the REV is 30 minutes when assuming that the levels of the other properties, such as cruising range and number of refueling stations, are equal. Furthermore, the results imply that to promote the use of electric vehicles, it is important to build the infrastructure as well as introduce in parallel a price policy such as subsidies and tax cuts.

L62|Green Supply Chain Management - Motivation, Methods and Expectations - in Hungarian Automotive Oems|The aim of the paper is to analyse the green supply chain management (GSCM) practices of Hungarian automotive OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) – three car manufacturers and a truck manufacturer. For the analysis I performed a questionnaire survey that included the topics of motivation and barriers of GSCM, the methods applied, cooperation in the supply chain and green performance. The results show the importance of GSCM in Hungarian automotive OEM operation, the most improved fields and the most popular methods. We will see what the strongest motivation factors for green practices are, and what improvements the companies experience in theirperformance.
L62|The Real Effects of Liquidity During the Financial Crisis: Evidence from Automobiles|Illiquidity in short-term credit markets during the financial crisis might have severely curtailed the supply of nonbank consumer credit. Using a new data set linking every car sold in the United States to the credit supplier involved in each transaction, we find that the collapse of the asset-backed commercial paper market reduced the financing capacity of such nonbank lenders as captive leasing companies in the automobile industry. As a result, car sales in counties that traditionally depended on nonbank lenders declined sharply. Although other lenders increased their supply of credit, the net aggregate effect of illiquidity on car sales is large and negative. We conclude that the decline in auto sales during the financial crisis was caused in part by a credit supply shock driven by the illiquidity of the most important providers of consumer finance in the auto loan market. These results also imply that interventions aimed at arresting illiquidity in short-term credit markets might have helped contain the real effects of the crisis.
L62|An Economic Analysis of U.S Airline Fuel Economy Dynamics from 1991 to 2015|Airline transport generates a growing share of global greenhouse gas emissions but as of late 2016, this sector has not faced U.S. fuel economy or emissions regulation. At any point in time, airlines own and lease a set of durable vehicles and have invested in human and physical capital and an inventory of parts to maintain these vehicles. Each airline chooses whether to scrap and replace airplanes in their fleet and how to utilize and operate their fleet of aircraft. We model these choices as a function of real jet fuel prices. When jet fuel prices are higher, airlines fly fuel inefficient planes slower, scrap older fuel inefficient planes earlier and substitute miles flown to their more fuel efficient planes.
L62|Exclusive Dealing as a Barrier to Entry? Evidence from Automobiles|Exclusive dealing contracts between manufacturers and retailers force new entrants to set up their own costly dealer networks to enter the market. We ask whether such contracts may act as an entry barrier, and provide an empirical analysis of the European car market. We first estimate a demand model with product and spatial differentiation, and quantify consumers' valuations for dealer proximity and dealer exclusivity. We then perform policy counterfactuals to assess the profit incentives and possible entry-deterring effects of exclusive dealing. We find that there are no unilateral incentives to maintain exclusive dealing, but there is a collective incentive for the industry as a whole. Furthermore, a ban on exclusive dealing would raise the smaller entrants' market share. But more importantly, consumers would gain, not so much because of increased price competition, but rather because of the increased spatial availability, which compensates for the demand inefficiency from a loss of dealer exclusivity.
L62|Vehicle Scrappage and Gasoline Policy|"We estimate the sensitivity of scrap decisions to changes in used car values and show how this ""scrap elasticity"" produces emissions leakage under fuel efficiency standards, a process known as the Gruenspecht effect. We first estimate the effect of gasoline prices on used vehicle values and scrappage of vehicles with different fuel economies. We then estimate the scrap elasticity itself, which we find to be -0.7. When applied in a model of fuel economy standards, 13-16 percent of the expected fuel savings leak away through the used vehicle market. This effect rivals or exceeds the importance of the often-cited mileage rebound effect. (JEL H23, L62, L78, Q35, Q38, Q48, Q58)"
L62|Cyber-Shilling in Automobile Auctions: Evidence from a Field Experiment|"We run a large field experiment with an online company specializing in selling used automobiles via ascending auctions. We manipulate experimentally the ""price grid,"" or the possible amounts that bidders can bid above the current standing price. Using two diverse auction sites, one in New York and one in Texas, we find that buyer and seller behavior differs strikingly across the two sites. Specifically, in Texas we find peculiar patterns of bidding among a small but prominent group of buyers suggesting that they are ""cyber-shills"" working on behalf of sellers. These patterns do not appear in the New York auctions. (JEL C93, D12, D44, L62, L81)"
L62|Using Taxes to Reduce Carbon Dioxide Emissions Rates of New Passenger Vehicles: Evidence from France, Germany, and Sweden|France, Germany, and Sweden link taxes to passenger vehicles' carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions rates. Based on new vehicle registration data from 2005 to 2010, we find that CO2 taxes reduce registrations. The effect is larger in France than in either Germany or Sweden, and the French results are robust to alternative estimation models. Compared with those of France, the German results vary somewhat more, and the Swedish estimates are the least robust. We find some evidence that the French tax affected the mix of new vehicles that vehicle manufacturers offered in the French market. (JEL H23, L62, Q54, Q58)
L62|New Estimates of the Value of a Statistical Life Using Air Bag Regulations as a Quasi-experiment|Due to federal regulations, automobile air bag availability was a model-specific discontinuous function of model year for used vehicles in the 1990s and early 2000s. We use the discontinuities and the gradual increase in the supply of air bags to trace out the demand curve for air bags and the implied distribution of the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) across consumers. Although imprecise, our preferred point estimates indicate that the median VSL is between $9 million and $11 million and that a sizable portion of consumers placed negative values on air bags, probably due to distrust of the technology.

L62|A Retrospective Look at Rescuing and Restructuring General Motors and Chrysler|The rescue of the US automobile industry amid the 2008-2009 recession and financial crisis was a consequential, controversial, and difficult decision made at a fraught moment for the US economy. Both of us were involved in the decision process at the time, but since have moved back to academia. More than five years have passed since the bailout began, and it is timely to look back at this unusual episode of economic policymaking to consider what we got right, what we got wrong, and why. In this article, we describe the events that brought two of the largest industrial companies in the world to seek a bailout from the US government, the analysis that was used to evaluate the decision (including what the alternatives were and whether a rescue would even work), the steps that were taken to rescue and restructure General Motors and Chrysler, and the performance of the US auto industry since the bailout. We close with general lessons to be learned from the episode.
L62|An Integrated Approach Of The Process Improvement Philosophy Within The Supplier Network: The Automotive Industry Case|The present study aims to analyze the functioning of an integrated system comprising the essence of contemporary operations management, namely the methods of process improving in a representative and essential industry. The priorities of local management practices follows subjects such as the savings, efficiency, optimizing the resources usage, remove of dissipation, total quality etc. We analyze the challenges accompanying the efforts of some entrepreneurs to assimilate the principles of improving and to acquiring the lean organization status. This work deals with the processes improvements, respectively the applying of lean manufacturing tools and principles within the automotive industry in Craiova and in adjacent area. The immediate utility of the processes improvement principles comes from their contribution to profit growth (cost reduction) and also to improve the competitive position. The research is a directed investigation on the optimization programs and processes applied by a dozen of organizations working around the great producer operating in or near Craiova, and by analyzing the directions promoted on their own or under the coordination of the driver-company. The implementation of process improvements principles at Ford's supplier’s network is one of the biggest objectives. The conclusions highlight the intentions and the achievements smoothing the philosophy of continuous improvement processes, the incumbent potential of these initiatives to eliminate the waste, but also some failures.
L62|Identification of Insurance Models with Multidimensional Screening|We study the identification of an insurance model with multidimensional screening, where insurees are characterized by risk and risk aversion. The model is solved using the concept of certainty equivalence under constant absolute risk aversion and an unspecified joint distribution of risk and risk aversion. The paper then analyzes how data availability constraints identification under four data scenarios from the ideal situation to a more realistic one. The observed number of accidents for each insuree plays a key role to identify the model. In a first part, we consider the case of a continuum of coverages offered to each insuree whether the damage distribution is fully observed or truncated. Truncation arises from that an insuree files a claim only when the accident involves a damage above the deductible. Despite bunching due to multidimensional screening, we show that the joint distribution of risk and risk aversion is identified. In a second part, we consider the case of a finite number of coverages offered to each insuree. When the full damage distribution is observed, we show that despite additional pooling due to the finite number of contracts, the joint distribution of risk and risk aversion is identified under a full support assumption and a conditional independence assumption involving the car characteristics. When the damage distribution is truncated, the joint distribution is identified up to the probability that the damage is above the deductible. In a third part, we derive the restrictions imposed by the model on observables for the fourth scenario. We also propose several identification strategies for the damage probability at the deductible. These identification results are further exploited in a companion paper developing an estimation method with an application to insurance data
L62|Chinese Automobile Enterprise Strategy Analysis|China's auto industry also had a golden decade of explosive growth. In 2009, China's auto market has exceeded the United States, the wo rld's largest car market, and in 2013, China's auto production both breaks t hrough twenty million. However, through the presentation of China's auto m arket booming, we should be acutely aware that the status of China's automobile industry in the global automotive industry value chain is still very low, this paper did analysis regarding the current situation, and also Japan, Ger many, America oversea R&D development experience could also a good kn owledge to know, and also the oversea M&A strategy should be considered Meanwhile by analysis Romania experience to learn from each other.
L62|Romanian Automotive Industry - Analysis Made From The Intellectual Capital Perspective|Starting from the fact that nowadays, automotive companies have bigger revenues due to their investments in technology and innovation, as well as hiring high-skilled labor force, the aim of this research is to analyze the Romanian automotive industry from the perspective of intellectual capital and economic performance. After presenting its latest evolution, this paper carries out an analysis made from three different perspectives: human capital, infrastructure assets and market and intellectual property assets. Based on the results, in the last part of this article, a SWOT analysis of intellectual capital on Romanian automotive industry is sketched out.
L62|Trust, Competition and Innovation: Theory and Evidence from German Car Manufacturers|We develop a simple theoretical model of a long term buyer-supplier relationship with non-contractible buyer specific R&D investment, and derive predictions on the effects of trust and competition on suppliers’ investment and buyers’ procurement strategies. We address these issues empirically using unique survey data on individual buyer-supplier relationships in the German automotive industry. Consistent with the model’s predictions, higher levels of trust are associated with higher investment levels - but also with more competitive procurement: trust and rents from reduced supplier competition in the procurement process emerge as substitutes both in theory and in the data.
L62|Competition and Innovation in Automobile Markets|Using data from the U.S. automobile market, we empirically examine the link between competition and innovation. Consistent with a large literature, we use patent counts as a measure of innovation. The combination of the U.S. market’s economic importance, market dynamics, and the significant intertemporal fluctuations in firms’ market shares and patents make this an interesting market to examine the link between competition and innovation. We use firm-level time-series data over a long horizon (1969-2012) for nine well established firms selling in the U.S. market (GM, Ford, Chrysler, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Volkswagen, BMW, and Daimler). Some of our key findings are: (1) increase in firms’ market shares result in higher patenting, and the relationship is reasonably non-linear; (2) higher market-wide competition results in an increase in patenting, and the relationship is weakly non-linear; (3) the (absolute) quantitative impact on patents is larger for firms’ market share effect as compared to market-wide competition; (4) there is relatively strong path-dependence in firms’ patenting behavior; and (5) we find interesting results linking patents to GM’s bankruptcy, the Daimler-Chrysler merger, environmental regulations, voluntary export restraints, and firms’ patenting over business cycles.
L62|Fehlender rechtlicher Rahmen verschafft den USA Zeitvorsprung beim Zukunftsmarkt »individuelle Mobilität«|In ihrem Kommentar weisen Ferdinand Dudenhöffer und Wolfgang Schneider, CAR-Center Automotive Research an der Universität Duisburg-Essen, auf den Wettbewerbsvorsprung der USA beim »automatisiertes Fahren« hin. Die branchenspezifischen Voraussetzungen, um in Deutschland beim neuen Markt für individuelle Mobilität einen komparativen Wettbewerbsvorteil aufzubauen, sind vorhanden, die Hindernisse liegen im Rechtsbereich.
L62|Warum die Sonderabschreibung für Elektroautos ein Strohfeuer werden könnte|Am 15. und 16. Juni plant die Bundesregierung eine Konferenz, auf der voraussichtlich eine Sonderabschreibung für Elektroautos vorgestellt wird. Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, Universität Duisburg-Essen, kommentiert dieses Vorhaben.
L62|Droht China das Ende des Wachstums im Automarkt?|Das Wachstum in China ist ins Straucheln geraten. Für das Jahr 2016 rechnet die OECD mit einem realen BIP-Wachstum von 6,7%. Im Zeitraum von 2002 bis 2011 hatte China noch ein jährliches BIP-Wachstum von 10,6% erzielt. Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, Universität Duisburg-Essen, geht für die Zukunft von einem neuen Wachstumsmuster für China aus, das nicht mehr entlang der Trendgeraden verläuft. Deshalb ist zukünftig der Autobauer in China erfolgreich, der die Kunst der Zyklenanpassung beherrscht.
L62|Der VW-Abgasskandal und die ifo Konjunkturumfragen|Anfang September deckte die US-Umweltbehörde eine unerlaubte Manipulation an der Motorsteuerungssoftware von VW-Dieselfahrzeugen auf. Ziel war es, die Abgasemissionswerte im Prüfverfahren künstlich niedrig zu halten, um Umweltstandards gerecht zu werden. Insgesamt lässt sich bisher aus den Ergebnissen des ifo Konjunkturtests kein negativer Effekt durch den Abgasskandal auf die gesamte Automobilbranche nachweisen. Die Situation stellt sich sowohl für die gesamte Automobilbranche als auch für den Fahrzeugbau und die Zulieferer einheitlich dar. Die aggregierten Ergebnisse zeigen aber nicht, ob und wie ein Substitutionseffekt von Volkswagen auf andere Hersteller stattgefunden hat.
L62|The Evolution Of The World’S Largest Automakers In The Period 2013-2014|The automotive industry has always represented an economic engine for many countries. It is dealing with the design, development, manufacture, marketing, and sale of the motor vehicles. Nowadays, this industry is full of intense competition between big auto groups fighting for higher profits and larger market shares. The key players in the automotive market are operating at a global scale in a highly competitive environment. In the last years, Toyota Motor and Volkswagen Group have proved to be the main competitors. The aim of our paper is to analyze the evolution of the world’s largest automakers in the period 2013-2014. The research type is literature review.
L62|Análisis Competitivo por parte de los talleres de servicio automotriz, mediante el uso del valor percibido por el cliente|Este artículo trata del uso del Valor Percibido por el Cliente (VPC) como herramienta para el análisis competitivo por parte de talleres de reparación y mantenimiento automotriz. Se muestra cómo se determinan tanto la importancia relativa de los atributos que los compradores tienen en cuenta para evaluar el desempeño de un taller automotriz, como la evaluación de desempeño, realizada por los compradores de los “Talleres de los concesionarios” y de aquellos que son propiedad de individuos. Posteriormente, se ilustra la manera como unos y otros visualizan su posición competitiva. También muestra la brecha entre los valores ideales esperados y los percibidos por el mercado, la cual se constituye en una especie de “mapa” de oportunidades para las firmas actualmente presentes en el mercado y para nuevos participantes.
L62|Un análisis en perspectiva histórica del comercio exterior de las autopartes argentinas|La industria automotriz argentina es uno de los sectores más estudiados por la historia económica. Sus límites se atribuyen a la mayor o menor intervención del Estado, al legado del neoliberalismo o a las estrategias de las multinacionales. A nuestro entender, estas aproximaciones dejan de lado el análisis de las condiciones de producción tanto internas como en el mercado mundial. Como un paso para ampliar estas explicaciones, analizamos la balanza comercial de autopartes argentinas en perspectiva histórica, con el objeto de entender los problemas históricos del complejo en Argentina.
L62|Reserve price effects in auctions: estimates from multiple RD designs|We present evidence from 260,000 online auctions of second-hand cars to identify the impact of public reserve prices on auction outcomes. To establish causality, we exploit multiple discontinuities in the relationship between reserve prices and vehicle characteristics to present RD estimates of reserve price effects on auction outcomes. Our first set of results show that, in line with the robust predictions of auction theory, an increase in reserve price decreases the number of bidders, increases the likelihood the object remains unsold, and increases expected revenue conditional on sale. Reserve price effects are found to be larger when there are more entrants, and when the reserve price is lower to begin with. Our second set of results then combine these estimates to calibrate the reserve price effect on the auctioneer's expected revenue. This reveals the auctioneer's reserve price policy to be locally optimal. Our final set of results provide novel evidence on reserve price effects on the composition of bidders. We find that an increase in reserve price: (i) decreases the number of potential bidders as identified through individual web browsing histories; (ii) leads to only more experienced and historically successful bidders still entering the auction; (iii) the characteristics of actual winners are less sensitive to the reserve price than those of the average bidder, suggesting auction winners are not the marginal entrant.
L62|Innovation, Emissions Policy, and Competitive Advantage in the Diffusion of European Diesel Automobiles|Spurred by Volkswagen's introduction of the TDI diesel engine in 1989, market penetration of diesel cars in Europe increased from 10% in 1990 to over 50% in 2000. Using Spanish automobile registration data, we estimate an equilibrium discrete choice, oligopoly model of horizontally differentiated products. We find that changing product characteristics and the increasing popularity of diesels leads to correlation between observed and unobserved (to the researcher) product characteristics, an aspect we allow for in the estimation. Despite widespread imitation by its rivals, Volkswagen was able to capture 32% of the potential innovation rents and diesels accounted for approximately 60% of the firm's profits. Moreover, diesels amounted to an important competitive advantage for European auto makers over foreign imports. We provide evidence that the greenhouse emissions policy enacted by European regulators, and not preferential fuel taxes, enabled the adoption of diesels. In so doing, this non-tariff policy was equivalent to a 20% import tariff; effectively cutting imports in half.
L62|Investigating the impacts of technological position and European environmental regulation on green automotive patent activity|Using patents data on environmental road transport technologies filed by 355 assignees over the period 1999–2010, the paper investigates under what conditions the European environmental transport policy portfolio and the intrinsic characteristics of assignees' knowledge boost worldwide green patent production. The findings suggest that post-tax fuel prices, environmental vehicle taxes, CO2 standards and European emission standards, introduced into the empirical model through an innovative methodology based on Self-Organising Maps (SOM) (Kohonen, 1990, 2001), positively influence the creation of environmental inventions. Most importantly, the paper highlights that assignees anticipate the introduction of regulatory instruments (i.e. European emission standards and CO2 targets) by filing patents before the effective implementation of regulations when legislation is announced. Furthermore, the paper provides evidence that in a technological space (which measures the applicants' technological proximity), closely located assignees enhance their patent output through the exploitation of technological knowledge produced by others. This means that the greater the proximity between assignees, the higher their likelihood of gaining advantage from this potential spillover pool. Finally, the paper observes that dynamic changes in assignees' patent portfolios spur inventive performances.
L62|The impact of fixed and variable cost on automobile demand: Evidence from Denmark|Many car characteristics, for instance cabin space and engine power, have a positive impact on fixed and variable costs. We extend the hedonic model, that considers only one type of cost, to the situation in which fixed as well as variable costs depend on the characteristics of the durable and derive an expression for the full willingness to pay for characteristics that takes into account the impact on fixed as well as variable costs. We apply the model to the demand for automobiles using rich Danish register data. Estimation reveals considerable heterogeneity and a non-negligible contribution of the variable costs in total willingness to pay. Next we show that under suitable assumptions a structural interpretation of our estimates is possible. We show that the willingness to pay per kilometer driven can be interpreted as a parameter of the utility function and study how it is related to household characteristics. Finally, we illustrate the model by computing how consumers change car quality in response to an increase in the fuel price.
L62|Dynamic interaction between markets for leasing and selling automobiles|We develop a model of dynamic interactions between price variations in leasing and selling markets for automobiles. Our framework assumes a differential game between multiple Bertrand-type competing firms which offer differentiated products to forward-looking agents. Empirical analysis of our model using monthly US data from 2002 to 2011 shows that variations in selling (cash) market prices lead rapidly dissipating changes of leasing market prices in the opposite direction. We discuss the practical implications of these results by augmenting a standard leasing valuation formula. The additional terms represent the leased asset value changes that can be expected on the basis of past variations in automobile selling market prices.
L62|Negotiating cultures in corporate procurement|In a repeated procurement problem, the incumbent can undertake a relationship-specific investment that generates opportunity costs of switching for the buyer. We investigate the impact of the negotiating culture on investment incentives, favoritism in the procurement contract allocation, and buyer profit. We compare a stylized competitive negotiating culture with a stylized protective culture. The cultures differ in the way the buyer uses the entrance threat to exert pressure on the incumbent. Our main result is that the relative performance of the cultures depends non-monotonically on the expensiveness of the investment.
L62|Forecasting German car sales using Google data and multivariate models|Long-term forecasts are of key importance for the car industry due to the lengthy period of time required for the development and production processes. With this in mind, this paper proposes new multivariate models to forecast monthly car sales data using economic variables and Google online search data. An out-of-sample forecasting comparison with forecast horizons up to 2 years ahead was implemented using the monthly sales of ten car brands in Germany for the period from 2001M1 to 2014M6. Models including Google search data statistically outperformed the competing models for most of the car brands and forecast horizons. These results also hold after several robustness checks which consider nonlinear models, different out-of-sample forecasts, directional accuracy, the variability of Google data and additional car brands.
L62|Compact organizational space and technological catch-up: Comparison of China's three leading automotive groups|This study examines why compact organizational space may matter for technological catch-up, through a comparison of China's leading automotive groups. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) surpasses its two local rivals in terms of technological capabilities partly because the firm has managed its organizational space in close connection with intensive growth strategies at the group level. SAIC has greatly benefited from compact organizational space in building technological capabilities, as it encourages the mobilization and integration of internal resources and promotes group-wide synergy for an effective internalization of acquired assets.
L62|Benefits and costs of electric vehicles for the public finances: An integrated valuation model based on input–output analysis, with application to France|The development of electro-mobility, with electric vehicles (EVs) replacing conventional vehicles (CVs), raises issues relating to the environment, energy and industry. Within a given country, it would have an economic impact in many areas, in particular on governments. Our objective is to quantify the respective impacts on the public finances of an electrically powered or petrol fuelled private car.
L62|Comparison of plug-in electric vehicle adoption in the United States: A state by state approach|This paper examines the correlation between social, economic, geographic, and policy factors on plug-in electric vehicle adoption across U.S. states for the purpose of understanding: which factors are significantly correlated to variations in battery electric vehicle (BEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) market shares, how those factors vary between BEV and PHEV markets, and how those factors compare with those identified as influential in driving early hybrid (HEV) markets. Our methodology includes a statistical analysis of new vehicle registration data from calendar year 2013 to test the relationship between PHEV and BEV market shares against statewide variables. Several of the factors that existing studies find to be important in earlier HEV markets are also correlated with 2013 PHEV or BEV market shares. We also find different sets of variables to be significantly correlated with PHEV and BEV market shares, respectively, which suggests that these markets are distinct. The differences between the factors that are correlated with PHEV and BEV market shares highlight the possibility that strategies for promoting the overall adoption of plug-in vehicles may not affect the two vehicle types equally. However, further analysis should be undertaken prior to developing policies and approaches based on these findings.
L62|Industrial Upgrading in Global Production Networks: The Case of the Chinese Automotive Industry|This article examines the development of China’s automotive industry. The evidence shows that integration in global production networks has stimulated upgrading of technological capabilities among automotive firms. However, the competitiveness and intra-industry analyses show mixed results. Although intraindustry trade in automotive products has improved since 2000, the trade competitiveness of completely built up vehicles has largely remained in low value added activities. Nevertheless, firm-level evidence shows that the industry has undergone considerable upgrading, albeit in low value added activities. Trade integration and host-country institutional support have been the prime driving forces of technological upgrading in the automotive industry in China.
L62|Auto and Car Parts Production: Can the Philippines Catch Up with Asia?|The Philippines pioneered the establishment of automotive assembly in Southeast Asia in the 1950s. But Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia lead the region since the 1990s. The foremost reasons for the decline are policy incoherence and unchecked inflows of smuggled cars, which is reflected in the erosion of the domestic automotive components supply base. Japanese assemblers are increasingly sourcing them from abroad through global production networks (GPNs, which has also made the Philippines a global producer of selected auto parts. Institutional support is necessary for the Philippines to take advantage of GPNs to catching up with the leading countries.
L62|Host-site institutions, regional production linkages and technological upgrading: a study of automotive firms in vietnam| Using technological capabilities as embodied in machinery, organization, processes and products, this study examines the links with host-site institutions and regional production linkages. The statistical results show no relationship between these variables. In-depth interviews complement the quantitative findings. Overall, the result shows that the government’s localization efforts failed because too many joint-venture assemblers were approved in the 1990s when the domestic market was small. The lack of economies of scale also affected the growth of national suppliers. Hence, national producers are confined to low value added segments and lack the quality to compete in export markets.
L62|The Transformation of the Clothing Industry in China|This article examines the transformation of clothing manufacturing in China with a focus on institutional support, technological upgrading and global production chains. The evidence shows that reforms and integration into global production chains has rapidly expanded China’s exports but it has also driven the relocation abroad of Chinese clothing firms. Global integration has motivated clothing firms to upgrade through learning, adoption and innovation. Hence, despite improvements in technological capabilities the share of clothing value-added in manufacturing has gradually declined. Also, China has increasingly faced industrial structural change from clothing to the capital goods, real estate and high tech sectors.
L62|The Garment Industry in Laos: Technological Capabilities, Global Production Chains and Competitiveness|This article examines the relationship between institutional support and regional production linkages, and technological capabilities and firm performance in the garment industry in Laos. The evidence shows that garment firms in Laos have achieved considerable technological upgrading, and that firm performance and technological capabilities are determined by export-intensity. Firms’ technological capabilities are determined by the quality of host-site institutional support, while foreign firms have invested little to upgrade human capital in Laos. In addition, firms of all ownership structure have invested little in R&D in Laos.
L62|Multinationals, Technology and Regional Linkages in Myanmar's Clothing Industry|Myanmar’s clothing industry has played a pivotal role in generating employment and exports. This article makes a contribution to the explication of the role of supporting institutions in the development of clothing manufacturing in Myanmar. The statistical analysis show that technological intensity is not correlated with labour productivity and export-intensity, which may be a consequence of the infancy of the industry and the use of old technologies in Myanmar. Also, the Probit estimations show that regional linkages matter in labour productivity and exportintensities but not with technological intensities in the clothing industry in Myanmar.
L62|China's Semiconductor Industry in Global Value Chains|This article examines how global production networks have benefited technological upgrading in the semiconductor industry in China. The evidence shows that trade has impacted positively on technological capabilities. The empirical evidence show that 93 percent of firms were engaged in incremental innovation activities, while 87 percent in new product development in 2012. The mean R&D intensity was 6.3 percent. State-owned enterprises showed the lowest mean of 5.3 percent. The mean share of R&D personnel in workforce was 28.2 percent. Government support (90 percent) and collaboration with universities and research institutes (87 percent) has been pertinent in firms’ participation in R&D activities.
L62|Institutional Support, Technological Capabilities and Domestic Linkages in the Semiconductor Industry in Singapore|Although Thailand’s electronics industry has been considered as one of strategic sectors, the evidence in this article shows that it is dominated by midstream and downstream activities. Despite accounting for a quarter of electronics exports, semiconductors manufacturing is confined to low value added activities. The lack of industrial policy has restricted technological upgrading in the industry. Upgrading efforts made by both public and private initiatives have so far failed. The case studies show that firms in Thailand must acquire and develop technological capabilities to stimulate the industry’s transformation from low to high value added activities.
L62|The CLMV Automobile and Auto Parts Industry|To begin, consider the general economic characteristics of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam, collectively known as the CLMV countries. These countries joined ASEAN relatively late and are economically less developed than the original members. According to the World Bank (2012), Viet Nam’s GDP stood at US$155.8 billion in 2012, Myanmar’s is estimated to be around US$50 billion, Cambodia at US$ 14.04 billion, and Lao PDR at US$9.41 billion. Therefore, these countries can be labelled as developing countries. This is also reflected in their gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. While Viet Nam and Lao PDR have roughly around US$1,500, that of Cambodia and Myanmar are below US$1,000 and therefore among the least developed countries. More than 20 years after the end of the civil war, Cambodia still has not made a lot of progress in the economic sphere. Under the military junta, Myanmar’s economy also stagnated but with the gradual democratization process, the country is receiving foreign direct investment (FDI) and appears to slowly move towards improving its economic status. However, while all these countries are on the path towards market economy and are strengthening their trade relations with Western countries, the common characteristic is that these countries’ economic relations are strongly linked to the United States, China, South Korea, and Thailand. Indeed, while the presence of the US, neighbouring countries China and Thailand, as well as Korea especially in Myanmar, Lao PDR, and Cambodia is striking, economic relations with Japan are marginal.
L62|The Indian Automotive Industry and the ASEAN Supply Chain Relations|The topic of automotive supply chains has been increasingly studied as it raises questions of economic development, especially from the perspectives of simultaneous globalisation and regionalisation, and trade. While ASEAN is a prime example of intraregional production networks, supply chains that connect ASEAN and India have not been studied indepth. Therefore, this paper investigates the Indian automotive industry, which is composed of automobile original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and parts and components producers, and other supply chain connections to the neighbouring ASEAN region. This study is structured as follows. First, we will take a look at the historic development of the automotive industry in India, as it provides the context for the development of companies and their capabilities that are crucial determinants for their ability to join supply chains. The investigation will not be limited to Indian firms because as case studies of the ASEAN region forcefully demonstrate, foreign OEMs and parts suppliers may use developing and emerging markets as specialised production bases of their global and regional supply chains. Second, against the historic background, the current condition of the automotive industry in India will be analysed by discussing industry data. Third, we will conduct case studies of automotive companies from India, Japan, and South Korea to investigate how India and ASEAN are connected through supply chains and determine which chains integrate Indian companies. We will analyse to which extent industrial and trade policies promote or hinder the extension of ASEAN supply chains to India and vice versa. As a final step, policy recommendations will be formulated based on the findings in order to improve the automotive trade between India and ASEAN.
L62|Austerity and Fuel Consumption in Greece: An Empirical Investigation|Greek economic crisis in the last years and the subsequent austerity policy measures resulted to a decline in consumersâ€™ income. This paper investigates empirically the Greek consumersâ€™ reactions to income changes regarding their consumption of different types of fuels during the period 2007-2011. The empirical findings suggest that fuel consumption elasticity of income is different among different types of fuels. Furthermore the income elasticity is different among different Greek geographic regions. More specifically, fuels with high consumption i.e. 95 RON unleaded gasoline and diesel-bio fuels are found to be income inelastic as compared to fuels with low consumption i.e. 98-100 RON unleaded gasoline and new super gasoline LRP. Furthermore, for the high consumed fuels, consumersâ€™ behavior patterns to income changes in the island are opposite to that in the rest Greek territory.
L62|Fiscal policy and CO2 emissions of new passenger cars in the EU|To what extent have national fiscal policies contributed to the decarbonisation of newly sold passenger cars? We construct a simple model that generates predictions regarding the effect of fiscal policies on average CO 2 emissions of new cars, and then test the model empirically. Our empirical strategy combines a diverse series of data. First, we use a large database of vehicleâ€ specific taxes in 15 EU countries over 2001â€ 2010 to construct a measure for the vehicle registration and annual road tax levels, and separately, for the CO 2 sensitivity of these taxes. We find that for many countries the fiscal policies have become more sensitive to CO 2 emissions of new cars. We then use these constructed measures to estimate the effect of fiscal policies on the CO 2 emissions of the new car fleet. The increased CO 2 â€ sensitivity of registration taxes have reduced the CO2 emission intensity of the average new car by 1,3 percent, partly through an induced increase of the share of dieselâ€ fuelled cars by 6,5 percentage points. Higher fuel taxes lead to the purchase of more fuel efficient cars, but higher annual road taxes have no or an adverse effect. Key Words: vehicle registration taxes, fuel taxes, CO 2 emissions
L62|The impact of implementation of a modular platform strategy in automobile manufacturing networks|This paper explores the impact of the implementation of modular platforms, to replace the standard platforms used to date, on the strategic outputs of automobile manufacturing networks. Analysis of the production network of manufacturers in Europe shows that the use of modular architecture improves the coordination of manufacturing networks by increasing manufacturing mobility and thriftiness ability. The changes resulting from this new modular strategy also allow for reorganisation of manufacturing capacity and the partial elimination of current overcapacity. From the point of view of production systems, the adaptation of processes and facilities in manufacturing plants to this new architecture should aim to increase flexibility by integrating production around a single platform, allowing for different dimensions and a large number of models in a single plant.
L62|The diversity of carmakers\' behaviors vis-a-vis the Corporate Venture Capital|This paper wishes to contribute to the literature about the industrial firms\' motivations to invest in Corporate Venture Capital programs. In a first part, we build a typology on CVC objectives based on a literature review. Then we apply this typology to carmakers’ CVC programs. We study 13 worldwide car manufacturers. Results show a poor interest of car makers vis-à-vis CVC programs. However, the existing programs show that strategic objectives are the most common objectives even if some others objectives are also pursued, like the “relational objective”. Summarizing the results, we identify four typical behaviors of carmakers vis-à-vis CVC programs. We conclude by a discussion about the automotive industry specificity, and we call upon other sectoral studies based on a qualitative method.The diversity of carmakers\' behaviors vis-a-vis the Corporate Venture Capital
L62|The persistent heterogeneity of trade patterns: A comparison of four European Automotive Global Production Networks|In this paper, we examine the structure and the evolution of international exchanges of auto parts over the 2000-2012 period for four European countries. The first part of our study reviews the literature and points out four stylized facts about the geography of automotive supply networks. In section 2 we propose an analysis of the organisation of automotive supply chains based on the global production networks framework. We give details about this approach by stating the nature of trade flows that occur in these networks, and by highlighting the importance of intra-firms flows. In the third part, we compare the structure of external GPNs of German, Spanish, British and French automotive firms located in these countries. On the basis of Chelem data about auto parts exchanges, we examine in a comparative way the evolution of intra-continental and intercontinental flows. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of situations and of trajectories in the different countries.
L62|Environmental Effects of a Vehicle Tax Reform: Empirical Evidence from Norway|In 2007, the Norwegian government reformed the vehicle registration tax in order to reduce the carbon intensity of the new car fleet by incentivizing the purchase of more fuel efficient cars. This paper identifies the impact of the new tax structure on three main dimensions: (i) the average CO2 emissions intensity of new registered vehicles, (ii) the relative change in sales between low and high polluting cars and (iii) the market share of diesel cars. A Difference in Difference approach is employed to estimate the short run effects on each outcome variable of interest. The results show that the average CO2 intensity of new vehicles was reduced in the year of the implementation of the reform by about 7.5 g of CO2/km. This reduction is the result of a 12 percentage points drop in the share of highly polluting cars and of an increase of about 20 percentage points in the market share of diesel cars.
L62|Upgrading of Hungarian subsidiaries in machinery and automotive global value chains|Global networks shape international production and trade. The main question of our paper is how Hungarian companies can improve their positions within these global value chains. The production and export of automotive and machinery industry are dominated by foreign multinational enterprises, therefore these sectors were chosen as examples. Research is based on interviews that explore local manufacturing subsidiaries' product, process and functional upgrading experience. Our findings show that there are differences among the firms in terms of extent of upgrading. This depends on one hand, on the owner’s global strategy and on the type of final products. On the other hand local capabilities are of crucial importance among the factors that influence the volume of intangible transfers. Furthermore, our interviews suggested that upgrading is not a unidirectional process: previously gained mandates can also be lost. Economic policy should support the business development and entrepreneurial learning and provide adequate conditions for suppliers and subsidiaries of leading multinational enterprises.
L62|Innovation In The European Value Chain: The Case Of The Romanian Automotive Industry|Entrepreneurs’ and regional stakeholder’s capacity to turn knowledge, skills and competencies into sustainable competitive advantage is crucial to a region' economic performance. The article attempts to reveal their synergy by gathering evidence in the particular context of the Romanian automotive industry. Based on primary data collected through structured inter¬views and experiential visits, the research is organized around three investigative themes: (1) entrepreneurs’ approach to and perception on innovation, (2) factors affecting innovation, and (3) networking and knowledge diffusion in the regional productive environment. The findings emphasize the convergent opinion of the regional stakeholders on the vital role innovation plays at the current stage of the industry and the key role entrepreneurs have in stimulating innovation in the regional context. A series of three factors underlay the innovative performance at regional and industry level, namely the presence of an innovation friendly business environment, entrepreneurs’ personality, as well as the external competitive environment.
L62|Boundaries of firms and catching up by latecomers in global production networks : the case of a Mexican auto-parts manufacturer|For manufacturing firms in developing countries, there are high barriers to entry and to catching up with competitors in their global production networks (GPNs). This paper examines the case of a Mexican auto-parts manufacturer that succeeded in catching up in the automotive GPN. The author proposes that the door to GPNs is open thanks to frequent changes in the boundaries of firms, and also stresses the importance of the necessary conditions that generate opportunities, including institutional settings that facilitate market entry and catching up, and capability building by firms hopeful of entry.
L62|Public Support to the European Car Industry: The Impact of the Financial Crisis|We provide a quantification of public support for the European car industry during the past decade. First, we identify the most relevant instruments of state aid and non-state aid public support. Second, we aim to estimate the amount of public support for European car manufacturers for each instrument and investigate its dynamics. Three factors complicate the overall quantification of public support for each instrument: (i) the Commission does not scrutinize, and hence does not quantify all public support measures; (ii) the available information depends on whether the state aid is granted to individual companies, or in the form of general schemes; and (iii) the available information depends on whether the aid is granted in the form of a grant, soft loan or guarantee. Our lower bound estimate of state aid suggests that the aid declined over the pre-crisis period, but peaked at €1.2 billion as a response to the last financial and economic crisis in 2009. Perhaps even more strikingly, this state aid was combined with an unprecedented amount of other public support: scrapping schemes of at least €4.0 billion, and loans from the European Investment Bank of €2.8 billion, or an equivalent of €400 million of “aid element” .

L62|Transformation towards overseas-oriented expansion: the evolution of Hyundai Motor Group’s production structure|In this paper, we analyze the Hyundai Motor Group’s newly evolved-production structure to illustrate the evolution of a corporate system. Specifically, we explore why Hyundai Motor Group’s domestic-oriented production structure could be maintained until the more recent history of Korea’s domestic automobile market. Our findings show that since 2012, the Hyundai Motor Group’s production structure—which has been affected by internal and external factors in the automobile market—has transformed from a domestic-oriented production structure to an overseas-oriented production structure. Our findings further demonstrate that both technical factors embedded in the Hyundai Motor Group’s production system and non-technical factors that strive to equate the production conditions in the Group’s foreign and domestic facilities support the smooth operation of the overseas-oriented production structure.

L62|Technology Import, R and D Spillover and Export: A Study of Automobile Sector in India|We examine the importance of a firm’s R and D activity, technology import and intra-sectoral R and D spillovers on the decision to export and export intensity using firm level panel data for the Indian automobile sector from 2000-2014. R and D and technology import activities are found to be important determinants of export activity. There is evidence that R and D spillovers exert positive effects on firms’ export intensity and decision to export. In addition to these results, firm age and size are nonlinearly related to export decision and export intensity. Energy efficiency plays important role in export behavior for firms that are continuously exporting and those who are exporting at least for one year.
