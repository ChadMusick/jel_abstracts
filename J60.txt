J60|Interactions between Formal and Informal Labor Dynamics: Revealing Job Flows from Household Surveys|In its characterizations of job creation and job destruction rates, the literature on labor dynamics has largely ignored informal labor markets. The interrelationships between job creation and destruction among informal and formal labor markets are therefore still generally unknown, despite recent developments in the study of labor market dynamics. These interrelationships are important, however, because much of what researchers identify as formal job creation in developing countries involves substitution of informal jobs for formal ones. In this paper, we use an original methodology to derive hires as well as job creation, separation, and destruction flows from standard household surveys. The great advantage of this technique is that it allows measurements of these labor dynamic measures for the informal labor market. We find that informal labor markets are less fluid than formal ones, mainly because informal job-to-job transitions seem to have a low incidence. In addition, we characterize the relationship between informal job destruction and formal job creation. We find that almost 50% of job creation in the formal sector is caused by job destruction in the informal sector, and identify this formalization process as countercyclical. Our findings portray the informal labor market as an inferior segment; in good economic times, it loses importance as a source of formal jobs and as a recipient of jobs from the formal sector. **** RESUMEN: En los estudios sobre creación y destrucción de trabajo, la literatura sobre dinámica laboral ha ignorado al segmento informal del mercado. En general no se sabe mucho sobre la interdependencia de la creación y destrucción de trabajo entre estos segmentos. Las relaciones entre estas variables son importantes, ya que mucho de lo que a menudo se identifica como creación de trabajo formal, en realidad implica una sustitución de trabajos informales por formales. En este artículo, se utiliza una metodología original para derivar los flujos de contrataciones, separaciones, creación y destrucción de trabajo a partir de encuestas de hogares. La ventaja de la metodología es que también permite medir estos flujos para el segmento informal. Este estudio encuentra que el mercado laboral informal es menos fluido que el formal, principalmente porque las reasignaciones de trabajadores y la rotación laboral tienen baja incidencia en el segmento informal. Adicionalmente, en este artículo se caracteriza la relación entre la destrucción de trabajo informal y la creación de trabajo formal. Se halla que al menos el 50% de la creación de trabajo formal es causada por destrucción de trabajo informal; adicionalmente, este proceso de formalización resulta ser contra-cíclico. Nuestros resultados permiten inferir que el mercado laboral informal es un segmento inferior, ya que en los periodos de expansión económica pierde relevancia en dos sentidos: en primer lugar, como fuente para la creación de trabajos formales y, en segundo lugar, como receptor de trabajos desde el segmento formal.
J60|Immigrant Entrepreneurs and Innovation in the U.S. High-Tech Sector|We estimate differences in innovation behavior between foreign versus U.S.-born entrepreneurs in high-tech industries. Our data come from the Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs, a random sample of firms with detailed information on owner characteristics and innovation activities. We find uniformly higher rates of innovation in immigrant-owned firms for 15 of 16 different innovation measures; the only exception is for copyright/trademark. The immigrant advantage holds for older firms as well as for recent start-ups and for every level of the entrepreneur’s education. The size of the estimated immigrant-native differences in product and process innovation activities rises with detailed controls for demographic and human capital characteristics but falls for R&D and patenting. Controlling for finance, motivations, and industry reduces all coefficients, but for most measures and specifications immigrants are estimated to have a sizable advantage in innovation.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J60|Did Timing Matter? Life Cycle Differences in Effects of Exposure to the Great Recession|Exposure to a recession can have persistent, negative consequences, but does the severity of those consequences depend on when in the life cycle a person is exposed? I estimate the effects of exposure to the Great Recession on employment and earnings outcomes for groups defined by year of birth over the ten years following the beginning of the recession. With the exception of the oldest workers, all groups experience reductions in earnings and employment due to local unemployment rate shocks during the recession. Younger workers experience the largest earnings losses in percent terms (up to 13 percent), in part because recession exposure makes them persistently less likely to work for high-paying employers even as their overall employment recovers more quickly than older workers’. Younger workers also experience reductions in earnings and employment due to changes in local labor market structure associated with the recession. These effects are substantially smaller in magnitude but more persistent than the effects of unemployment rate increases.
J60|Time use, unemployment, and well-being: an empirical analysis using British time-use data|We use nationally representative data from the UK Time-Use Survey 2014/2015 to investigate how a person’s employment status is related to time use and cognitive and affective dimensions of subjective well-being. We find that unemployed persons report substantially lower levels of life satisfaction than employed persons. When looking at specific types of activities, the unemployed enjoy most of the activities they engage in less than the employed. However, the employed consider working to be one of the least enjoyable activities. They also spend a large share of their time at work and with work-related activities, while the unemployed spend more time on leisure and more enjoyable activities instead. When looking at duration-weighted average affective well-being over the entire waking time of the day, our results suggest that the benefit of having to spend less time at work outweighs the negative emotional effect of unemployment during leisure episodes, such that the unemployed experience, on average, more enjoyment during the day than the employed.
J60|Social Connections and the Sorting of Workers to Firms|The literature on social networks often presumes that job search through (strong) social ties leads to increased inequality by providing privileged individuals with access to more attractive labor market opportunities. We assess this presumption in the context of sorting between AKM-style person and establishment fixed effects. Our rich Swedish register data allow us to measure connections between agents – workers to workers and workers to firms – through parents, children, siblings, spouses, former co-workers and classmates from high school/college, and current neighbors. In clear contrast with the above presumption, there is less sorting inequality among the workers hired through social networks. This outcome results from opposing factors. On the one hand, reinforcing positive sorting, high-wage job seekers are shown to have social connections to high-wage workers, and therefore to high-wage firms (because of sorting of workers over firms). Furthermore, connections have a causal impact on the allocation of workers across workplaces – employers are much more likely to hire displaced workers to whom they are connected through their employees, in particular if their social ties are strong. On the other hand, attenuating positive sorting, the (causal) impact is much stronger for low-wage firms than it is for high-wage firms, irrespective of the type of worker involved, even conditional on worker fixed effects. The lower degree of sorting among connected hires thus arises because low-wage firms use their (relatively few) connections to high-wage workers to hire workers of a type that they are unable to attract through market channels.
J60|Information, Mobile Communication, and Referral Effects|Information is a crucial ingredient in economic decision making. Yet measuring the extent of information exchange among individuals and its effect on economic outcomes is a difficult task. We use the universe of de-identified cellphone usage records from more than one million users in a Chinese city over twelve months to quantify information exchange among individuals and examine its role in urban labor markets. We present the first empirical evidence that information flow (measured by call volume) correlates strongly with worker flows, a pattern that persists at different levels of geographic aggregation. Conditional on information flow, socioeconomic diversity in the source of information (social contacts), especially that associated with the working population, is crucial and helps to predict worker flows. We supplement our phone records with auxiliary data sets on residential housing prices, job postings, and firm attributes from administrative data. Information passed on through social contacts is valuable: referred jobs are associated with higher monetary gains, a higher likelihood to transition from part-time to full-time, reduced commuting time, and a higher probability of entering desirable jobs. Referral information is more valuable for young workers, people switching jobs from suburbs to the inner city, and those changing their industrial sectors. Firms receiving referrals are more likely to have successful recruits and experience faster growth.
J60|Lowering Welfare Benefits: Intended and Unintended Consequences for Migrants and their Families|Denmark's Start Aid welfare reform reduced benefits to refugee immigrants by around 50 percent for those granted residency after the reform date. The reform led to a sharp short run increase in labor earnings and employment, but it also induced a strong female labor force withdrawal, and a large and persistent drop in disposable income for most households. Furthermore, the reform caused a sharp increase in property crime among both females and males. Moreover, children's likelihood of being enrolled in childcare or preschool, their performance in language tests, and their years of education all decreased, while teenagers' crime rates increased.

J60|The Effect of Initial Placement Restrictions on Refugees' Language Acquisition in Germany|This paper analyzes the effect of a recently introduced policy reform on participation in integration courses and on certiﬁed language proﬁciency levels among refugees in Germany. The residence rule restricts initial residence for refugees with a permanent residence permit. Given that treatment intensity varies distinctly across states, I utilize this quasi-experiment and apply a difference-in-differences approach. Using an innovative data-set, the IAB-BAMF-SOEP Survey of Refugees, I ﬁnd that stricter statutory provisions have a positive effect on the probability to complete a language course and on the level of certiﬁed language proﬁciency. The results indicate that this effect is driven partly by spatial mismatch.
J60|Experienced Well-Being and Labor Market Status: The Role of Pleasure and Meaning|This paper examines experienced well-being of employed and unemployed workers. We use the survey-adapted day reconstruction method (DRM) of the Innovation Sample of the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP-IS) to analyze the role of the employment status for well-being, incorporating complete time use. Summarizing the average share of pleasurable minutes, we generate the P-index. We show that - in contrast to evaluative life satisfaction - the average unemployed experiences more pleasurable minutes due to the absence of working episodes. Hence, we examine working episodes in depth. While working is among the activities with the highest propensities for an unpleasant experience, it is also among the most meaningful activities. We show that meaning is a central non-monetary determinant for a pleasurable work episode and find that pleasure during work and job satisfaction in general have the same association with meaning.
J60|Factors Affecting the Intention of Millennial Workers in Indonesia to Leave|Objective - This study examines the effect of mediating work pressure on the relationship between the quality of work life and the desire to leave of millennial employees. Methodology/Technique - The highest portion of the workforce in Indonesia in 2016 is the millennial generation, which comprises around 62.5 million people. Millennials possess different attitudes, characteristics and skills than the Baby Boomer generation. Millennial employees are perceived to look for the value of work to improve the quality of work life rather than financial benefits. Organizations must understand the character of millennial employees to gain the best talents. Finding - The findings of the study show that quality of work life has a negative and significant effect on work stress. Meanwhile, work stress has a positive and significant effect on intention to leave. Finally, the quality of work life has a negative and significant effect on intention to leave. Research Limitations / Implications – This study concludes that work stress mediates the relationship between the quality of work life and intention to leave. This study concludes that quality of work life is very important for low work stress and reducing the intention to leave among millennial employees. Novelty – These findings expand upon existing research related to the quality of work life, work stress and turnover intention and provides recommendations for organizations to retain millennial employees.
J60|Labor protection laws and the drain on productivity: Evidence from India|Employment protection legislation (EPL) is designed to promote security for workers by placing restrictions on firing, but it generates unintended consequences. With India as a setting, I argue that EPL shifts jobs from younger to older workers in two ways: by discouraging the hiring of unproven young workers and by preventing the firing of low-productivity workers. The identification strategy is motivated by Rajan and Zingales (1998): I assume that EPL is more binding in those manufacturing sectors where the involuntary separation rate in other countries is high. The data show that older workers are more likely to have formal jobs, and the effect is strongest in high-firing sectors, which indicates EPL shifts jobs from young to old. Additionally, EPL reduces plant-level total productivity (TFP), and this effect is seen only in plants which are large enough to fall within the purview of EPL, which provides a useful placebo test.
J60|Incentivized Resume Rating: Eliciting Employer Preferences without Deception|We introduce a new experimental paradigm to evaluate employer preferences, called Incentivized Resume Rating (IRR). Employers evaluate resumes they know to be hypothetical in order to be matched with real job seekers, preserving incentives while avoiding the deception necessary in audit studies. We deploy IRR with employers recruiting college seniors from a prestigious school, randomizing human capital characteristics and demographics of hypothetical candidates. We measure both employer preferences for candidates and employer beliefs about the likelihood candidates will accept job offers, avoiding a typical confound in audit studies. We discuss the costs, benefits, and future applications of this new methodology.
J60|Intergenerational Mobility: An Assessment for Latin American Countries|This paper aims to study the process of intergenerational income mobility in some Latin American economies (Panama and Brazil), which have been much neglected in the existing literature. Like other countries in the area, also Brazil and Panama have a stagnant economy coupled with high income inequality. Our rich and detailed dataset, the IPUMS survey data bank allows us to provide the most reliable and robust estimates of intergenerational transfer, after controlling for a number of additional control variables which were unavailable in previous studies, such as family size, literacy level of fathers, and location in rural versus urban areas. We provide estimates broken down for different genders, age, location, education of fathers in each country. Our results are robust to different specifications and suggest that previous studies significantly overrated the extent of the intergenerational transfer in the countries considered. However, our figures are still compatible with an extremely low degree of social mobility.

J60|Climbing up Ladders and Sliding down Snakes: An Empirical Assessment of the Effect of Social Mobility on Subjective Wellbeing|We examine how intergenerational mobility affects subjective wellbeing (SWB) using data from the British Cohort Study. Our SWB measures encapsulates both life satisfaction and mental health, and we consider both relative and absolute movements in income. We find that relative income mobility is a significant predictor of life satisfaction and mental health, whether people move upward or downward. For absolute income, mobility is only a consistent predictor of SWB and mental health outcomes if the person moves downwards, and in this case the impact is far larger than relative mobility. For both relative and income mobility downward movements affect SWB to a greater extent than upward movements, consistent with notions of loss aversion. Notably, we find that social class mobility does not affect SWB. We present evidence that the significant relative and absolute mobility effects we find operate partially through financial perceptions and consumption changes which can occur because of income mobility.
J60|The 2011 Break in the Part-Time Indicator and the Evolution of Wage Inequality in Germany|German social security records involve an indicator for part-time or full-time work. In 2011, the reporting procedure was changed suggesting that a fraction of worker recorded to be working full-time before the change were in fact part-time workers. This study develops a correction based on estimating the probability of being a part-time worker before and after the break. Using the correction, the paper confirms that the rise in wage inequality among full-time workers in West Germany until 2010 is not a spurious consequence of the misreporting of working time.
J60|Labour Market Flows: Accounting for the Public Sector|For the period between 2003 and 2018, we document a number of facts about worker gross flows in France, the United Kingdom, Spain and the United States, focussing on the role of the public sector. Using the French, Spanish and UK Labour Force Survey and the US Current Population Survey data, we examine the size and cyclicality of the flows and transition probabilities between private and public employment, unemployment and inactivity. We examine the stocks and flows by gender, age and education. We decompose contributions of private and public job-finding and job-separation rates to fluctuations in the unemployment rate. Public-sector employment contributes 20 percent to fluctuations in the unemployment rate in the UK, 15 percent in France and 10 percent in Spain and the US. Private-sector workers would forgo 0.5 to 2.9 percent of their wage to have the same job security as public-sector workers.
J60|Industry Fluctuations and College Major Choices: Evidence from an Energy Boom and Bust|This paper examines how college students in the United States altered their college major decisions during the energy boom and bust of the 1970s and 1980s. We focus on petroleum engineering and geology, two majors closely related to the energy industry. We find strong evidence that the energy boom increased the prevalence of these two energy-related majors and the energy bust lowered the prevalence of these majors. Effects are particularly strong for young people born in energy intensive states. Thus, college major decisions responded to industry fluctuations with important location-specific effects consistent with frictions to migration and information flows.
J60|Getting the First Job – Size and Quality of Ethnic Enclaves for Refugee Labor Market Entry|This article analyses the relationship between the size and the quality of ethnic enclaves on immigrants’ labour market integration. Using exogenously defined grid cells to delineate neighbourhoods we find robust empirical evidence that the employment rate of the respective immigrant group in the vicinity (as a measure of enclave quality) facilitates labour market integration of new immigrants. The influence of the overall employment rate and the share of co-nationals in the neighbourhood tend to be positive, but less robust. We thus conclude that the quality is more important than the size of the ethnic enclave in helping new immigrants finding jobs.
J60|Spatial variations and clustering in the rates of youth unemployment and NEET|We investigate the â€˜determinantsâ€™ of spatial variations in youth unemployment and NEET rates, and the presence of spatial clusters, for Italy, Spain and the UK. Using Labour Force Survey data for the period 1993-2011 at a â€˜regionalâ€™ level we obtain broadly consistent measures of quarterly youth unemployment and NEET rates. Our findings suggest that youths are sensitive to aggregate labour market conditions with older youths being more cyclically sensitive than are teenagers. We find a discouraged worker effect, again larger for older youths than for teenagers. In the UK and Spain, temporary jobs are preferred to part-time jobs, perhaps as a way of avoiding unemployment, whereas in Italy the opposite occurs. There is evidence of spatial clustering of youth unemployment and NEET rates. Our paper concludes with a discussion of the implications for regional and labour market policies.
J60|Short-term household income mobility before and after the Great Recession: A four-country study|This paper analyses short-term intra-generational income mobility in France, Italy, Spain and the UK by exploiting the longitudinal component of EU-SILC for the periods 2005-2008 and 2012-2015. We investigate whether and to what extent the ability of households to move along the income distribution changed after the 2008 crisis and whether heterogeneities among countries exist. For this purpose, we employ mobility indexes and transition matrices as well as estimation of a 2SLS regression and of a dynamic ordered probit with random effects. Overall, indexes and transition matrices point to a decrease of mobility in the aftermath of the crisis. The econometric analyses suggest both the existence of a convergence process of incomes and state dependence of current and lagged income in both periods. We also observe sluggish income convergence and lower upward mobility in the second period. Among the microeconomic drivers, education and employment status are positive determinants of mobility. Finally, our results confirm cross-country heterogeneity.
J60|Information, Mobile Communication, and Referral Effects|Information is a crucial ingredient in economic decision making. Yet measuring the extent of information exchange among individuals and its effect on economic outcomes is a difficult task. We use the universe of de-identified cellphone usage records from more than one million users in a Chinese city over twelve months to quantify information exchange among individuals and examine the role of referrals -- human carriers of information -- in urban labor markets. We present the first evidence that information flow (measured by call volume) correlates strongly with worker flows, a pattern that persists at different levels of geographic aggregation. Condition on information flow, socioeconomic diversity in information sources (social contacts), especially that associated with the working population, is crucial and helps to predict worker flows. We supplement our phone records with auxiliary data sets on residential housing prices, job postings, and firm attributes from administrative data. Information passed on through referrals is valuable: referred jobs are associated with higher monetary gains, a higher likelihood to transition from part-time to full-time, reduced commuting time, and a higher probability of entering desirable jobs. Referral information is more valuable for young workers, people switching jobs from suburbs to the inner city, and those changing their industrial sector. Firms receiving referrals are more likely to have successful recruits and experience faster growth.
J60|Améliorer les performances du marché du travail en France: mise en oeuvre de la Stratégie pour l’emploi de l’OCDE|Ce chapitre propose une analyse approfondie des performances du marché du travail français suivant la nouvelle Stratégie pour l’emploi de l’OCDE. Depuis 2015, les créations d’emploi ont fait refluer le chômage et les situations de sous emploi ont diminué, mais le marché du travail français reste confronté à de nombreux défis. Le taux d’emploi, bien qu’en hausse, demeure relativement faible, les compétences de la population sont inégales, et la rotation d’une partie des travailleurs sur des contrats de moins d’un mois a augmenté. Les créations d’emplois de qualité ont été insuffisantes pour permettre l’intégration économique et sociale d’un grand nombre de jeunes et des moins qualifiés. Des réformes ambitieuses ont visé à réduire l’incertitude entourant le coût des fins de contrats de travail, tout en améliorant les opportunités de formation pour les moins qualifiés et en renforçant l’accompagnement et l’orientation, de manière cohérente avec les recommandations de la nouvelle Stratégie pour l’emploi de l’OCDE. Le gouvernement a aussi restructuré le dialogue social aux niveaux des entreprises et des branches, réduit les incertitudes sur les procédures de licenciement économique et poursuit une réforme de l’assurance chômage. Afin de maximiser les gains de ces réformes, la priorité doit être de renforcer l’efficacité de la formation continue et de limiter la reproduction des inégalités et les décrochages scolaires. Simplifier l’organisation des services d’accompagnement et faciliter les mobilités professionnelles permettraient aussi un meilleur appariement entre offre et demande de travail et des gains de productivité soutenus. Le dialogue social au niveau des entreprises doit également être encouragé, tout comme l’engagement des employeurs dans la formation initiale et continue. Enfin, la réforme en cours de l’assurance chômage ainsi qu’une unification des systèmes de soutien aux bas revenus améliorerait l’efficacité et la lisibilité des prestations sociales tout en incitant plus fortement à la reprise d’emplois durables. Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l’Étude économique de l’OCDE de la France 2019 (http://www.oecd.org/fr/economie/france-en-un-coup-d-oeil/)
J60|Sorting On-line and On-time|Using proprietary data from a Chilean online job board, we find strong, positive assortative matching at the worker-position level, both along observed dimensions and on unobserved characteristics (OLS Mincer residual wages). We also find that this positive assortative matching is robustly procyclical. Then, we use the generalized deferredacceptance algorithm to simulate ex post matches to compare our results to the existing empirical literature. Under all considered scenarios of our simulations, positive assortative matching is preserved from the application stage to the realized matches. JEL Codes: E24, E32, J24, J60. Key words: Keywords: Online search, assortative matching, labor markets.
J60|A Political Economy of Social Discrimination|From burqa ban to minaret ban, from right to detain suspected illegal immigrants to restricting the help to migrants, the number of social laws specifically targeting a tiny proportion of citizens has raised in recent years across Western democracies. These symbolic policies, we show, are far from being innocuous: they can have far reaching consequences for large parts of the population. By raising the salience of certain social traits (e.g., Muslim identity) these laws can create a labour market loaded in favor of the majority (e.g., the non-Muslims), yielding higher unemployment rates and spells for minority citizens. These deleterious effects arise even absent any form of bias against, or uncertainty about, minority workers. Instead they are fully driven by social expectations about behavior and are best understood as a form of social discrimination. Importantly, we establish conditions under which a plurality of the citizenry demands the implementation of symbolic policies anticipating their labor market consequences. We further highlight that the implementation of symbolic policies is always associated with less redistribution and can be coupled with lower tax rates. We discuss several policy recommendations to limit the possibility of social discrimination arising.
J60|Learning Through Hiring: Knowledge From New Workers as an Explanation of Endogenous Growth|This paper develops an endogenous growth model in which the job-to-job transition of workers provides a channel for the spillover of knowledge between firms. Workers learn some of the productive knowledge used by their employer while working on the job. When a worker moves to another firm, they are able to adapt some of this knowledge for use at the hiring firm. Firms endogenously control their exposure to new knowledge by choosing the intensity that they post vacancies in a search-and-matching labor market. It is shown that under a set of assumptions regarding the initial distribution of firm types and the vacancy posting cost function, the competitive equilibrium leads to a balanced growth path that has a constant growth rate and stationary distribution of firm size.
J60|Employment protection reform in European labor markets: the collective bargaining regime matters|"Policy advisers repeatedly call on Western European countries to reform their employment protection legislation (EPL) by adopting layoff taxes to finance unemployment insurance (UI). This new design, partly based on the existing ""experience-rating"" (ER) system in the U.S., would induce firms to internalize layoff fiscal costs and hence reduce unemployment. Its success remains uncertain in economies with a collective wage-setting system, as in many Western European countries. Using a matching model with endogenous job destruction, we provide an ex-ante evaluation of this policy reform’s effects on labor market outcomes in a firm-level bargaining economy and a sector-level bargaining one. Using numerical exercises, we show that compared to a scenario of a simple increase in EPL stringency, the implementation of an ER system results in a decrease in unemployment under both bargaining regimes. Because of the possibility for firms to adjust most terms and conditions of employment (including wage) in decentralized negotiations, juxtaposing the ER system with the existing EPL yields the best labor market performance under a firm-level bargaining regime. The lack of internal flexibility in sector-level bargaining calls for accompanying the implementation of the ER with a relaxation of the existing EPL’s stringency. Lastly, we show that in industries with a turbulent economic environment, accompanying the introduction of ER while reducing the existing EPL’s strictness is recommended."
J60|Economic Transition, Dualism, and Informality in India|In much of the literature on economic development, sustained economic growth is expected to be accompanied by several interrelated processes of structure change, which involve a shift in economic activities from ‘traditional’ / agricultural / informal to ‘modern’ / industrial / formal sectors. Such transitions are usually accompanied by a transition in the economic dependence of households towards relatively ‘modern’ and formal segments of the economy, along with a rise in their general economic well-being. In this paper, we examine the Indian economy using the only available household-level pan-India panel data over the high growth period between 2005 and 2011-12, to analyse the patterns and natures of household-level transitions across sectors and identify factors that affected the likelihood and nature of such transitions. We categorize households based on their primary income sources into seven sectors characterised by varying degrees of formality/informality and various production structures and labour processes. We find that while substantial proportion of households have transitioned across these sectors during the period, there has been a continued reproduction of the same economic structure, including a regeneration of dependence on ‘traditional’ informal sector and casual wage employment, which are often expected to dissolve over time with high economic growth. To ascertain the nature of these transitions (‘favorable’ or ‘unfavorable’), we employ a ‘counterfactual’ analysis. Contrary to some recent influential literature, we find that, on an average, the transitions towards informal and ‘traditional’ economic spaces are ‘unfavourable’ in nature in terms of well-being of households. Further, using a multinomial logit regression framework, we find that the likelihood and nature of these transitions are largely dependent on household characteristics like levels of education and social caste, some of which are structurally given and cannot be optimally chosen by households. The results show that despite significant churning in the economy, the structure continues to remain fractured, with substantial ‘unfavourable’ transitions towards economic spaces that are continuously reshuffled and reconstituted.
J60|Migration of higher education students from North Africa Region|This paper uses both the descriptive and comparative approaches to provide overview of migration of higher education students from North Africa region. We fill the gap in the African literature and present a more comprehensive and recent analysis of migration of higher education students from North Africa region using UNESCO recent secondary data on international students mobility in tertiary education. We provide an interesting comparative analysis of migration of higher education students from North Africa region compared to South Africa. A novel element in our analysis is that we examine migration of higher education students from North Africa from both national and regional perspectives; mainly we discuss migration of higher education students for each individual country in North Africa region (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Sudan and Tunisia) and then discuss the total for the entire North Africa region. Therefore, we provide an extremely valuable contribution to the increasing debate in the international literature concerning the increasing interaction between migration and increasing internationalisation of higher education. Our findings support the first hypothesis that from national perspective, the pattern and size of migration of higher education students from the North Africa region increased substantially over the past years but the distribution showed considerable variation across North African countries. Our results corroborate the second hypothesis that the increasing trend of migration of higher education students from the North Africa region is caused by several push-pull factors (e.g. economic, social, political, cultural and educational). Our results support the third hypothesis that migration of higher education students from the North Africa region lead to mixed positive and negative impacts (e.g. transfer of knowledge, brain gain and skill acquisition for returned migrant students, but weak capacity to retain talents and brain drain for non-returned migrant students). Our findings corroborate the fourth hypothesis that skills of migrant higher education students from North Africa region can be better mobilised in their countries of origin by addressing the push-pull factors that determine migration of skills from the North Africa region.
J60|Natural rate estimates differ: By how much?|We examine the natural rate of unemployment estimates of two international organizations (OECD and European Commission) and various release dates. Since estimates differ to a large extent, empirical research results which use natural rate estimates will also vary depending on the data source chosen. We highlight the extend of these effects by focusing on Spain, but also present evidence for several other EU-countries.
J60|Intergenerational Mobility: An Assessment for Latin American Countries|This paper aims to study the process of intergenerational income mobility in some Latin American economies (Panama and Brazil), which have been much neglected in the existing literature.

Our results are robust to different specifications and suggest that previous studies significantly overrated the extent of the intergenerational transfer in the countries considered. However, our figures are still compatible with an extremely low degree of social mobility.
J60|The nexus between unemployment rate and shadow economy: A comparative analysis of developed and developing countries using a simultaneous-equation model|This paper studies the effects and causal links between the shadow economy and the unemployment rate using a dynamic simultaneous-equation panel data model for 38 developing and 40 developed countries over the 2000−2015 period. The analysis suggests that there is a unidirectional and negative causality running from the unemployment rate to the shadow economy in the developing countries. However, in the developed countries, there is a bidirectional and negative causal relationship between the shadow economy and unemployment rate. The sensitivity of the results makes the authors realize that institutional quality interacts strongly with the relationship between the shadow economy and the unemployment rate. In countries with a good institutional quality, the unemployment rate is associated with a weak informal economy, whereas in countries with low institutional quality, it strongly drives the informal economy.
J60|The 2011 break in the part-time indicator and the evolution of wage inequality in Germany|German social security records involve an indicator for part-time or full-time work. In 2011, the reporting procedure was changed suggesting that a fraction of worker recorded to be working full-time before the change were in fact part-time workers. This study develops a correction based on estimating the probability of being a part-time worker before and after the break. Using the correction, the paper confirms that the rise in wage inequality among full-time workers in West Germany until 2010 is not a spurious consequence of the misreporting of working time.
J60|Unemployment and Labour Force Participation in Italy|This paper provides an empirical investigation of the long-run relationship between unemployment and labour force participation rate in Italy. I test the “unemployment invariance hypothesis” using a macroeconomic approach and resorting to cointegration techniques. After testing for the non-stationarity of each time series, cointegration analysis results strongly suggest a clear long-run relationship between the two variables independently on gender aggregation level. In order to provide robustness to my results I replicate the analysis by age group aggregation level showing a strong “discouraged-worker effect” for the middle and old workers group.
J60|Is it the natural rate or hysteresis hypothesis for unemployment rates in Newly Industrialized Economies?|The focus of our study is on determining whether unemployment rates in 8 New Industrialized Economies conform to the natural rate hypothesis or the hysteresis hypothesis. To this end, we employ a variety of unit of unit root testing procedures to quarterly data collected between 2002:q1 and 2017:q1. In summary of our findings, conventional unit root tests which neither account for asymmetries or structural breaks produce the most inconclusive results. On the other hand, tests which incorporate structural breaks whilst ignoring asymmetries tends to favour the natural rate hypothesis for our panel of countries. However, simultaneously accounting for asymmetries and unobserved structural breaks seemingly produces the most robust findings and confirms hysteresis in all unemployment rates except for the Asian economies/countries of Thailand and the Philippines.
J60|Why Has India-UK Migration Decreased So Rapidly?|Net migration in the UK increased from less than 100,000 per year in the early 1990s to over 300,000 in 2006. However, by 2016, the net migration in the UK had dropped to 248,000. This trend is visible in India-UK migration specifically - immigration from India increased until 2012 but has since declined dramatically. Between 2012 and 2015, the number of Indians emigrating to the UK decreased from 1,500,000 to 325,000 – an average decline of 39.9% per year There are 3 primary causes that led to this decline in India-UK migration: 1. Increased British government immigration stringency 2. Improved quality of life and standard of living in India 3. Decrease of Indian students in the UK Firstly, the British government have tried to restrict immigration. They have increased the immigrant wage threshold and initiated the points based system. In this way, they have reduced the number of low skilled workers, making it virtually impossible for low skilled workers to permanently or semi-permanently immigrate. Improvements in India, both in the workplace and in general well-being, have led to a decrease in Indian emigrants migrating to the UK. Unemployment rates in India are low and phenomena such as the ‘reverse brain drain’ suggest India may be on the verge of rapid productivity and employment opportunities. Finally, the number of International students in the UK has dropped below the number of immigrant workers. This is because the government has made it more difficult for international students to study in the UK. Furthermore, the rapidly increasing range of countries that are welcoming international students has resulted in the movement of Indian students across the world rather than just the UK and US.
J60|Regional disparities and migration in member states EU|Certainly, the spatial distribution of economic activities is far from uniform in many countries European Union and significant differences at national and at regional level are still persistent. The aim of this study is to investigate and compare regional disparities in member states of European Union and estimate the effect of regional migration flows on convergence of regions. This study focuses on income and employment, these two factors are considered as major determinants of migration and on the contrary, migration can contribute to reducing income and employment disparity between regions. The econometric analysis uses panel data primarily from Eurostat Database.
J60|Accounting for Labor Gaps|We develop a balanced growth model with labor supply and search and matching frictions in the labor market to study the impact of economic policy variables on the two margins which constitute the (total) labor input: the extensive one (the rate of employment) and the intensive one (the hours worked per worker). We show that the dynamics of the taxes have an impact mainly on the hours worked while labor market institutions have a large influence on the rate of employment. However, our findings underline that there is an interaction between the two margins. The model is tested on four countries (US, France, Germany and UK) which experiment different tax and labor market dynamics since the sixties. Using this structural approach, we can then perform counterfactual experiments about the evolution of the policy variables and to compare welfare levels implied by policy changes.
J60|Learning, On-the-Job Search and Wage-Tenure Contracts|When workers have incomplete information about their ability, they can learn about this ability by searching for jobs, both while employed and unemployed. Search outcomes yield information for updating the belief about the ability which affects optimal search decisions in the future. Firms respond to updated beliefs by altering vacancy creation and optimal wage contracts. To study equilibrium interactions between learning and search, this paper integrates learning into a search equilibrium with on-the-job search and wage-tenure contracts. The model generates results that shed light on a number of empirical facts, such as wage cuts in job-to-job transition, wage growth over tenure, true duration dependence of unemployment, and frictional wage inequality. We calibrate the model to quantify the extent to which learning and on-the-job search explain these empirical facts.
J60|Non-farm employment trends and policy in rural areas of Samarkand region (Uzbekistan)|Nonfarm employment plays an important role in absorbing unemployment in rural areas of developing countries. The agricultural transition in Uzbekistan followed by structural transformations in the economy changed the rural economy. Although farm restructuring and farm optimization policies led to agricultural growth, they had a negative impact on rural employment. The government of Uzbekistan promoted many policies to create jobs within the country. A presidential decree launched the State Program on Rural Development and Well-being in 2009, which played a crucial role in developing the economic and social infrastructure of rural areas. Small business and private entrepreneurship were given priority to absorb the rising unemployment, especially in rural areas. Against this background, the paper studies non-farm employment trends in rural areas of Samarkand region. In particular, we explore the main drivers of non-farm business development and its impact on rural employment in the Samarkand region. The main employment trends in rural areas of Samarkand region are described using statistical data. We also explore migration trends in Uzbekistan and Samarkand regions. A survey was conducted with 34 mahallas' (community) chairpersons and representatives to better analyze the intersectoral and international migration of the agricultural workforce. Although remittances are crucial in poverty alleviation of Central Asian countries, including Uzbekistan, the economic crisis in 2008-2009 in Russia cast a shadow on the further prospects of migration. We show how the development of non-agricultural business in the Samarkand region increased the incomes of the rural population. The agro-processing sector plays a vital role in creating clusters based on the agro-industrial complex, which in turn will create more opportunities for employment in rural areas of the country.
J60|Fachkräfteengpass in der Krankenpflege: Wo liegt weiterer Reformbedarf?|Die Zahl der Pflegekräfte in den Krankenhäusern ist durch einen Anstieg der Teilzeitkräfte gestiegen. Parallel dazu ist die Verweildauer der Patienten gesunken und die Zahl der Patienten, die von einer Pflegekraft versorgt werden, ist ebenfalls gesunken. Dennoch bestehen in den Pflegeberufen bereits seit Jahren erhebliche Engpässe, so dass offene Stellen in Krankenhäusern nicht besetzt werden können. Der Gesetzesentwurf zum Pflegepersonal-Stärkungsgesetz (PpSG) sieht finanzielle Sofortmaßnahmen vor, damit Krankenhäuser die Möglichkeit erhalten, mehr Personal einzustellen. Da dieses Personal aufgrund von Engpässen aber schwer zu finden sein dürfte, sind weitere Maßnahmen notwendig. Deshalb ist der Blick auch auf eine Re-Organisation von Pflegeprozessen in den Häusern und auf eine vermehrte Digitalisierung zu richten. Mittel-fristig ist es hingegen sinnvoll, die Strukturen in der stationären - aber auch in der ambulanten - Versorgung zu überdenken und das Thema der Über- und Fehlversorgung konsequent anzugehen. Denn dann können auch bisher dort gebundene Pflegekräfte für Bereiche zur Verfügung stehen, in denen Personalknappheit besteht.

J60|Die alltägliche Bewältigung von Armut: Individuelle Handlungsstrategien unter der Bedingung materieller Knappheit in städtischen und ländlichen Räumen Mecklenburg-Vorpommerns|"Auf Basis einer qualitativen Analyse und Typisierung von 14 biographischen, 2013/14 durchgeführten Interviews mit von relativer Einkommensarmut betroffenen Menschen in städtischen und ländlichen Räumen Mecklenburg-Vorpommerns wird gezeigt, wie sich Armut im Alltag äußert. Weniger bedrohlich und einschränkend ist die Armutssituation für diejenigen, die es trotz Ausschluss aus dem Arbeitsmarkt und materieller Knappheit schaffen, soziale Teilhabe zu bewahren (Typ: 'angepasst und beständig"") oder aus der Teilhabe heraus Perspektiven zur Überwindung der Armutssituation zu entwickeln (Typ: 'kämpferisch und widerständig""). Voraussetzung dafür ist die Verfügbarkeit (semi-)institutioneller Gelegenheitsstrukturen wie Stadtteilzentren, Vereine, Beratungsangebote, Maßnahmen der Jobcenter oder Aus- und Weiterbildungsangebote. Durch das Engagement in solchen Zusammenhängen erhalten die Befragten Anerkennung und das Gefühl, ihren Alltag selbst bestimmen zu können. Als schwer zu ertragende Zumutung betrachten hingegen diejenigen ihre Situation, die nur sehr kleine soziale Netzwerke haben, in denen nur noch engste Freunde und Familienangehörige existieren, und die sich aus Enttäuschung und Resignation aus darüberhinausgehenden sozialen Kreisen zurückziehen bzw. zurückgezogen haben oder sich in Ermangelung geeigneter Angebote in ihrer Region nicht einbringen (Typ: 'enttäuscht und resigniert""). Schließlich enthält das Sample noch eine Gruppe jüngerer Menschen, die in Ermangelung von Vorbildern und ernstzunehmenden Handlungsoptionen in ihrer Umgebung nicht in der Lage sind, eigene Perspektiven zu entwickeln. Ihre Zukunft hängt davon ab, welche Wege ihnen durch institutionelle Akteure aufgezeigt werden - oder nicht (Typ: 'hoffnungsvoll und orientierungslos""). Im Stadt-Land-Vergleich zeigt sich, dass die Armutsbewältigung für die Befragten in ländlichen Räumen häufig schwerer fällt, da hier Angebote des öffentlichen und kulturellen Lebens seltener bzw. mit weiteren Wegen und höheren Kosten verbunden sind. Wenn die Befragten ihre Situation als eine räumliche Benachteiligung der Region, in der sie leben, interpretieren, entstehen Resignation und Frust. Enttäuschung und Resignation sind zwar kein rein ländliches Problem, jedoch befördert die Wahrnehmung einer räumlichen und strukturellen Benachteiligung das subjektive Gefühl, von der gesellschaftlichen Entwicklung abgekoppelt zu sein. Andere Befragte aus dem untersuchten ländlichen Raum, die die Sache weniger resigniert betrachten, erwägen die Region zu verlassen, da sie sich woanders bessere Chancen erhoffen. [...]"
J60|Unemployment and online labor|Online labor markets experienced a rapid growth in recent years. They allow for long-distance transactions and offer workers access to a potentially 'global' pool of labor demand. As such, they bear the potential to act as a substitute for shrinking local income opportunities. Using detailed U.S. data from a large online labor platform for microtasks, we study how local unemployment affects participation and work intensity online. We find that, at the extensive margin, an increase in commuting zone level unemployment is associated with more individuals joining the platform and becoming active in fulfilling tasks. At the intensive margin, our results show that with higher unemployment rates, online labor supply becomes more elastic. These results are driven by a decrease of the reservation wage during standard working hours. Finally, the effects are transient and do not translate to a permanent increase in platform participation by incumbent users. Our findings highlight that many workers consider online labor markets as a substitute to offline work for generating income, especially in periods of low local labor demand. However, the evidence also suggests that, despite their potential to attract workers, online markets for microtasks are currently not viable as a long run alternative for most workers.
J60|Wages and the Value of Nonemployment|Nonemployment is often posited as a worker's outside option in wage setting models such as bargaining and wage posting. The value of this state is therefore a fundamental determinant of wages and, in turn, labor supply and job creation. We measure the effect of changes in the value of nonemployment on wages in existing jobs and among job switchers. Our quasi-experimental variation in nonemployment values arises from four large reforms of unemployment insurance (UI) benefit levels in Austria. We document that wages are insensitive to UI benefit levels: point estimates imply a wage response of less than $0.01 per $1.00 UI benefit increase, and we can reject sensitivities larger than 0.03. In contrast, a calibrated Nash bargaining model predicts a sensitivity of 0.39 – more than ten times larger. The empirical insensitivity holds even among workers with a priori low bargaining power, with low labor force attachment, with high predicted unemployment duration, among job switchers and recently unemployed workers, in areas of high unemployment, in firms with flexible pay policies, and when considering firm-level bargaining. The insensitivity of wages to the nonemployment value we document presents a puzzle to widely used wage setting protocols, and implies that nonemployment may not constitute workers' relevant threat point. Our evidence supports wage-setting mechanisms that insulate wages from the value of nonemployment.
J60|Jobs and Agricultural Policy: Impact of the Common Agricultural Policy on EU Agricultural Employment|This paper investigates the relationship between EU agricultural subsidies and the outflow of labor from agriculture. We use more representative subsidy indicators and a wider coverage (panel data from 210 EU regions over the period 2004-2014) than has been used before. The data allow to better correct for sample selection bias than previous empirical studies. We find that, on average, CAP subsidies reduce the outflow of labor from agriculture, but the effect is almost entirely due to decoupled Pillar I payments and the impact of Pillar II is mixed. Coupled Pillar I payments have no impact on reducing labor outflow from agriculture, i.e. on preserving jobs in agriculture. The impact of Pillar II is mixed. Our estimates predicts that a decline of 10 percent of the CAP budget would cause an extra 16,000 people to leave EU agriculture each year. A 10 percent decoupling would save 13,000 agricultural jobs each year.
J60|Feeling useless: the effect of unemployment on mental health in the Great Recession|Abstract This article documents a strong connection between unemployment and mental distress using data from the Spanish National Health Survey. We exploit the collapse of the construction sector to identify the causal effect of job losses in different segments of the Spanish labor market. Our results suggest that an increase of the unemployment rate by 10 percentage points due to the breakdown in construction raised reported poor health and mental disorders in the affected population by 3 percentage points, respectively. We argue that the size of this effect responds to the fact that the construction sector was at the center of the economic recession. As a result, workers exposed to the negative labor demand shock faced very low chances of re-entering employment. We show that this led to long unemployment spells, stress, hopelessness, and feelings of uselessness. These effects point towards a potential channel for unemployment hysteresis.
J60|The Impact of Minimum Wages on Well-Being: Evidence from a Quasi-Experiment in Germany|To analyze well-being effects of minimum wages, the introduction of a minimum wage in Germany in 2015 is used as a quasi-experiment. Based on the representative SOEP data, a difference-in-differences design compares the development of life, job, and pay satisfaction between those who are affected by the reform according to their pre-intervention wages and those who already have marginally higher wages so that they are not directly affected. The results show that the minimum wage has significantly positive effects on all considered dimensions of well-being, on average, with an increase in life satisfaction by 0.10 standard deviations (0.15 points on a ten-point Likert scale). Positive effects last at least until one year after the reform. Life satisfaction tends to increase particularly in the region that is overall economically less developed (East Germany). The results hold if those who are not employed anymore after the reform are included in the analysis.
J60|The best of the two worlds: assessing the use of administrative data for the study of employment|Social security administrative data are increasingly becoming available in many countries. These are very attractive data as they have a long panel structure (large N, large T) and allow to measure many different variables with higher precision. Because of their nature they can capture short, frictional unemployment which is usually hidden in survey data, due to design or timing of interviews. However, the definition of unemployment is also different in both datasets. As a result, the gap between total unemployment and registered unemployment is not constant neither across workers characteristics nor time. In this paper I augment the Spanish Social Security administrative data by adding missing unemployment spells using the institutional framework and the Labour Force Survey as a benchmark. I compare the resulting unemployment rate to that of the Labour Force Survey, showing that both are comparable and thus the administrative dataset is useful for labour market research. Administrative data can also be used to overcome some of the problems of the Labour Force survey such as changes in the structure of the survey. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive guide on how to adapt administrative datasets to make them useful for studying unemployment.
J60|The State, Determinants, and Consequences of Skills Mismatch in the Ethiopian Labour Market|The study analyses the incidence of labour market mismatch, identifies the correlates of skills mismatch that shed light on the causes of the problem, and investigates its consequences on well-being. It is the first attempt to formally study skills mismatch in the urban labour market in Ethiopia. Using several indicators of qualification mismatch, we find that about a quarter of employees are mismatched with over-qualification being the more prevalent problem. In comport with findings for developed countries, our analysis reveals overqualified worker report lower job satisfaction compared to the well-matched. We also find that skill-mismatch, particularly over education lowers wages; while education is positively and significantly associated with wage, overeducated workers earn less than those well-matched for their level of education. This implies a wage penalty associated with over-qualification even in a developing country context. Our study highlights that labour market mismatch is not only a phenomenon of the developed world but also the developing countries. Hence, skills mismatch needs to be a key aspect of labour market policy making along with issues of decent and productive work.
J60|Do Workers Make Good Neighbours? The Impact of Local Employment on Young Male and Female Entrants to the Labour Market|This paper investigates the social endogenous effect linking the employment probability of young workers entering the labour market to the local employment rate. We focus on the transition from school to work, using a representative sample of youths leaving the French educational system in 1998 and 2004. We identify the causal effect of local employment rate using a neighbourhood fixed-effect strategy (Bayer et al, 2007). We provide evidence that the within-neighbourhood random allocation assumption is likely to hold. The results show that an individual's own employment is strongly affected by the share of working people in their neighbourhood, estimates being higher for high-school dropouts. Results also reveal gender differences, suggesting that young people are more sensitive to same-sex neighbours.
J60|State Dependence and Labor Market Transitions in the European Union|This article proposes an empirical analysis of labor market mobility in the European Union based on EU-SILC data. It uses conditional dynamic multinomial logit models that allow state dependence and unobserved heterogeneity to be disentangled. The article investigates state dependence in quarterly labor market transitions among fulltime employment, part-time employment, unemployment and inactivity, comparing across five country groups (the UK, continental, eastern, nordic and southern). It shows that state dependence in unemployment or inactivity is generally lower in the UK than in other country groups except the nordic group. The persistence of part-time employment appears higher than in the UK for all groups, especially in continental countries. Differences by social group (according to age, sex and education) are also found at the European level and vary across country groups.
J60|Refugee immigrants, occupational sorting and wage gaps|This paper analyzes wage income differences between native born workers and refugee immigrants in Sweden within occupations delineated in accordance with the augmented canonical model of occupational assignment. The identification strategy is based on a control group of matched native born persons with similar characteristics as the refugees and by using panel data methods capturing unobserved heterogeneity. The econometric results from a Swedish employer-employee panel data set document a narrowed wage gap over time, showing that the remaining difference can be explained to a large extent by the sorting into different types of occupations. Based on an Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition, we find a persistent wage gap in cognitive non-routine occupations but also, surprisingly, task categories where refugees have higher earning than natives.
J60|Wage subsidies, job-displacement and Swedish firms: A comparison between policy systems|This paper studies how New Start Jobs (Nystartsjobb) and Employment Subsidies Anställningsstöd) affect Swedish firms. We study effects on the number of employees, firm performance and other firm level outcomes. We use Swedish administrative data from the period 1998-2008. One result is that treated firms substantially outperform other recruiting firms after hiring through subsidies, both in terms of the number of employees and in terms of various production measures, despite having identical pre-match trajectories. This pattern is clear for the period with Employment Subsidies, but less clear for the period with New Start Jobs. For New Starts Jobs we instead see that they have a clear positive effect on firms' survival rates. Overall, our results suggest that targeted employment subsidies can have large positive effects on post-match outcomes of the hiring firms.
J60|Does Job Security Hamper Employment Prospects?|We investigate the effect of employment protection legislation (EPL) on the propensity to hire workers from unemployment and active labor market programs (ALMPs), utilizing a reform that decreased dismissal costs for small firms only. Using administrative data from Sweden, we find that less stringent EPL increased the share of workers hired from unemployment and some ALMPs. Our results suggest that there was less screening of new hires after the reform, and that liberalization of EPL mitigates the stigma associated with unemployment and participation in ALMPs.
J60|Sorting on Unobserved Skills into New Firms|Human capital features prominently in theoretical work on post-entry performance of new firms. Empirical analysis has, however, to a large extent overlooked the unobserved component of human capital focusing on years of education or labor market experience. This paper adds to the literature on worker characteristics and post-entry firm performance by putting the unobserved quality of workers in the center of analysis. I find strong evidence that new firms on average employ workers of lower unobserved quality relative to incumbent firms. Among new firms workers of higher unobserved quality are overrepresented in spin-offs and incorporated new firms. I further show that unobserved quality of workers is important for the post-entry performance of firms as it is a strong predictor of new firm survival.
J60|Job Displacement, Unemployment, and Crime: Evidence from Danish Microdata and Reforms|This paper estimates the individual impact of a worker’s job loss on his/her criminal activity. Using a matched employer-employee longitudinal data set on unemployment, crime, and taxes for all residents in Denmark, the paper builds each worker’s timeline of job separation, unemployment, and crime. The paper focuses on displaced workers: high-tenure workers who lose employment during a mass-layoff event at any point between 1990 and 1994 (inclusive). Initial local industrial specialization suggests that the growth of manufacturing imports and the Nordic financial crisis in the early 1990s explain a significant share of mass layoffs. Placebo tests display no evidence of trends in crime prior to worker separation. Using Denmark’s introduction of the Act on an Active Labor Market at the end of 1993, we estimate the impacts of activation and of a reduction in benefit duration on crime: crime is lower during active benefits than during passive benefits and spikes at the end of benefit eligibility. We use policy-induced shifts in the kink formula relating prior earnings to unemployment benefits to estimate the separate impacts of labor income and unemployment benefits on crime: the results suggest that unemployment benefits do not significantly offset the impact of labor income losses on crime.
J60|Sibling Correlation in Risk Attitudes: Evidence from Burkina Faso|This study uses sibling correlation to investigate the importance of parental and household characteristics on three different risk domains collected in a nationally representative survey from Burkina Faso. Sibling correlations are between 0.51 and 0.83. The correlations are higher in the general risk domain compared to risk taking in financial matters and traffic. Moreover, the sibling correlation is higher for the younger generation of siblings than the older generation, and for sisters than brothers. We also explore which factors drive these correlations; parents’ risk attitudes help explain these correlations, whereas socioeconomic outcomes, family structure, parental health and residential zone have only a limited contribution. We also find that gender is important in explaining the variation in sibling correlations. Mother’s have a stronger contribution on daughter’s correlation than fathers, whereas fathers help to explain the son’s correlation to a larger extent.
J60|Experienced and Inherited Disadvantage: A Longitudinal Study of Early Adulthood Neighbourhood Careers of Siblings|"Longer term exposure to high poverty neighbourhoods can affect individual socio-economic outcomes later in life. Previous research has shown strong path dependence in individual neighbourhood histories. A growing literature shows that the neighbourhood histories of people is linked to the neighbourhoods of their childhood and parental characteristics. To better understand intergenerational transmission of living in deprived neighbourhoods it is important to distinguish between inherited disadvantage (socio-economic position) and contextual disadvantage (environmental context in which children grow up). The objective of this paper is to come to a better understanding of the effects of inherited and contextual disadvantage on the neighbourhood careers of children once they have left the parental home. We use a quasi-experimental family design exploiting sibling relationships, including real sibling pairs, and ""synthetic siblings"" who are used as a control group. Using rich register data from Sweden we find that real siblings live more similar lives in terms of neighbourhood experiences during their independent residential career than synthetic sibling pairs. This difference reduces over time. Real siblings are still less different than synthetic pairs but the difference gets smaller with time, indicating a quicker attenuation of the family effect on residential outcomes than the neighbourhood effect."
J60|The Temporal Dynamics of Neighborhood Disadvantage in Childhood and Subsequent Problem Behavior in Adolescence|Research on neighborhood effects has increasingly focused on how long children have lived in a deprived neighborhood during childhood (duration), but has typically ignored when in childhood the exposure occurred (timing) and whether circumstances were improving or deteriorating (sequencing). Using Dutch register data, we applied sequence analysis to simultaneously capture duration, timing, and sequencing of exposure to neighborhood (dis)advantage in childhood. Compared to children who lived in a deprived neighborhood throughout childhood, we found that children who were exposed to neighborhood deprivation only during adolescence were equally likely to become a teenage parent and were more likely to drop out of school. Unexpectedly, children who lived in an affluent neighbor-hood throughout childhood were most likely to engage in delinquent behavior.
J60|Freedom from the Tyranny of Neighbourhood: Rethinking Socio-Spatial Context Effects|Theory behind neighbourhood effects suggests that different geographies and scales affect individual outcomes. We argue that neighbourhood effects research needs to break away from the tyranny of neighbourhood and consider alternative ways to measure the wider socio-spatial context of people, placing individuals at the centre of the approach. We review theoretical and empirical approaches to place and space from a multitude of disciplines and the geographical scopes of neighbourhood effects mechanisms. Ultimately, we suggest ways in which micro-geographic data can be used to operationalise socio-spatial context for neighbourhood effects, where data pragmatism should be supplanted by a theory-driven data exploration.
J60|Job mismatches and career mobility| Does over-education assist or hinder occupational advancement? Career mobility theory hypothesizes that over-education leads to a higher level of occupational advancement and wage growth over time, with mixed international empirical evidence. This paper re-tests career mobility theory directly using a rich Australian longitudinal data set. A dynamic random effects probit model is employed to examine upward occupational mobility, considering two-digit occupational rank advancement and wage growth over three-year intervals. The ‘Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia’ data across nine years are employed, and a Mundlak correction model is adopted to adjust for unobserved heterogeneity effects and potential endogeneity, both of which are important to over-education analysis. Contrary to career theory, the results point to job mismatch as an economic concern rather than a passing phase, regardless of whether or not workers are skill-matched. Results further show the importance of adjusting for endogeneity.

J60|Do Businessmen Make Good Governors?|This paper evaluates the economic performance of U.S. state governors with a business background (chief executive officer [CEO] governors). Applying a matching method, I find, first, that businesspeople tend to take office in times of economic and fiscal strain. Second, the tenures of CEO governors are associated with a 0.5 percentage points (pp.) higher annual income growth rate, a 0.4 pp. higher growth rate of the private capital stock, and a 0.6 pp. lower unemployment rate than are the tenures of non‐CEO governors. State‐level income inequality is not affected by CEO governors holding office, indicating that low‐income households benefit from the economic upswing. (JEL C21, E24, O47)
J60|Is it the natural rate or hysteresis hypothesis for unemployment in Newly Industrialized Economies?|The focus of our study is on determining whether unemployment rates in 8 New Industrialized Economies conform to the natural rate hypothesis or the hysteresis hypothesis. To this end, we employ a variety of unit of unit root testing procedures to quarterly data collected between 2002:q1 and 2017:q1. In summary of our findings, conventional unit root tests which neither account for asymmetries or structural breaks produce the most inconclusive results. On the other hand, tests which incorporate structural breaks whilst ignoring asymmetries tends to favour the natural rate hypothesis for our panel of countries. However, simultaneously accounting for asymmetries and unobserved structural breaks seemingly produces the most robust findings and confirms hysteresis in all unemployment rates except for the Asian economies/countries of Thailand and the Philippines.
J60|Whom Do Employers Want? The Role of Recent Employment and Unemployment Status and Age|We use a resume audit study to better understand the role of employment and unemployment histories in affecting callbacks to job applications. We focus on how the effect of career history varies by age, partly in an attempt to reconcile disparate findings in prior studies. While we cannot reconcile earlier findings on the effect of unemployment duration, the findings solidify an emerging consensus on the role of age and employment on callback. First, among applicants across a broad age range, we find that applicants with 52 weeks of unemployment have a lower callback rate than do applicants with shorter unemployment spells. However, regardless of an applicant's age, there is no relationship between spell length and callback among applicants with shorter spells. Second, we find a hump-shaped relationship between age and callback, with both younger and older applicants having a lower probability of callback relative to prime-aged applicants. Finally, we find that those applicants who are employed at the time of application have a lower callback rate than do unemployed applicants, regardless of whether the interim job is of lower or comparable quality relative to the applied-for job. This may reflect a perception among employers that it is harder or more expensive to attract an applicant who is currently employed.
J60|When Work Moves: Job Suburbanization and Black Employment|This paper presents evidence that job suburbanization caused significant declines in black employment from 1970 to 2000. I document that, conditional on detailed job characteristics, blacks are less likely than whites to work in suburban establishments, and this spatial segregation is stable over time despite widespread decentralization of population and jobs. This stable segregation suggests job suburbanization may have increased black-white labor market inequality. Exploiting variation across metropolitan areas, I find that job suburbanization is associated with substantial declines in black employment rates relative to white employment rates. Evidence from nationally planned highway infrastructure corroborates a causal interpretation.

In this article, traders who are no longer available but who left tracks on the market are called phantoms. We examine a dynamic matching market in which phantoms are a by-product of search activity, no coordination frictions are assumed, and non-phantom traders may lose time trying to match with phantoms. The resulting aggregate matching technology features increasing returns to scale in the short run, but has constant returns to scale in the long run. We embed a generalized version of this matching function in the canonical continuous-time equilibrium search unemployment model. Long-run constant returns to scale imply there is a unique steady state, whereas short-run increasing returns generate excess volatility in the short run and endogenous fluctuations based on self-fulfilling prophecies.
J60|Diversity and Employment Prospects: Neighbors Matter!|Using recent data from the French Labor Force Survey, this paper explores how diversity affects individuals’ employment prospects at various geographic levels. Employment correlates positively with local labor market diversity, but negatively with neighborhood diversity. Using several approaches to deal with the endogeneity of local labor market diversity, we do not find any robust evidence of a causal impact of diversity on employment at this rather aggregate level, suggesting that immigrants actually tend to self-select into more economically dynamic areas. However, taking advantage of the very precise localization of the data in order to correct biases related to residential sorting, we confirm a negative effect of neighborhood diversity. We also show that diversity in terms of nationalities matters more than diversity based on parents’ origins, giving insights on the underlying mechanisms.
J60|Directed Search with Phantom Vacancies|Information persistence about already filled vacancies implies that old vacancies are likely to be obsolete or phantom vacancies. When ads for jobs stipulate the vacancy creation date, job-seekers apply for the different jobs so as to equalize matching odds across vacancy age. This search behavior leads them to over-apply to young vacancies. Finding a job of a given age creates phantom vacancy and a negative informational externality that affects all cohorts of vacancies after this age. Thus the magnitude of the externality decreases with the age of the vacancy filled. We calibrate the model on US labor market data. The magnitude of the externality is small, despite the fact that the contribution of phantom vacancies to overall frictions is large.
J60|Parental Job Loss, Secondary School Completion and Home Environment|This study examines the effect of parental job loss on children’s completion of secondary school and the mediating role of home environment in that effect. It uses rich survey data from Hungary on adolescents age 14 through 21, with detailed measures of parental employment and home environment. The study replicates the average negative effect found in the literature. No effect is found for families with a history of providing a cognitively stimulating home environment, but the negative effect is strong for other families. Home environment matters more than initial income in mediating the effect. The results highlight the protective nature of a cognitively stimulating home environment.
J60|The Causal Impact of Social Connections on Firms' Outcomes|The paper studies how social connections affect firm-level hiring decisions and performance. We use register data to characterize the social connections of firms' employees. For causal identification, we use displacements which create directed supply shocks towards the firms of the displaced workers' social connections. We make sure that our results are fully driven by these directed supply shocks. Results show that firms appear to prefer employed workers they are connected to over unconnected or unemployed workers when hiring. The employed and connected mostly go to high-productivity firms whereas the unemployed and unconnected tend to go to low-productivity firms. Strong connections - family, recent, durable, formed in small groups, between socially similar agents - matter the most. Displacements shocks cause connected firms, in particular low-productivity ones, to hire those workers they are connected to. Unconnected hires and separations are essentially unaffected. These supply shocks therefore cause the creation of additional jobs which increase firms' employment. In addition, we use these shocks to show that hiring connected workers has a positive causal impact on firm performance. These results are consistent with a stylized framework where connections reduce hiring frictions and where the firm-level possibility to hire connected workers is a function of changing outside options of these workers.
J60|How Credit Constraints Impact Job Finding Rates, Sorting & Aggregate Output|We empirically and theoretically examine how consumer credit access affects dis- placed workers. Empirically, we link administrative employment histories to credit reports. We show that an increase in credit limits worth 10% of prior annual earnings allows individuals to take .15 to 3 weeks longer to find a job. Conditional on finding a job, they earn more and work at more productive firms. We develop a labor sorting model with credit to provide structural estimates of the impact of credit on employ- ment outcomes, which we find are similar to our empirical estimates. We use the model to understand the impact of consumer credit on the macroeconomy. We find that if credit limits tighten during a downturn, employment recovers quicker, but output and productivity remain depressed. This is because when limits tighten, low-asset, low- productivity job losers cannot self-insure. Therefore, they search less thoroughly and take more accessible jobs at less productive firms.
J60|Outside Options (Now) More Important than Race in Explaining Tipping Points in US Neighborhoods|I develop a revealed-preference method for estimating neighborhood tipping points. I find that census tract tipping points have increased from 15% (1970) to 42% (2010). The corresponding MSA tipping points have also increased from 13% (1970) to 35% (2010). While tipping points are traditionally associated with the racial attitudes of white households, I find that cross-sectional differences in MSA tipping points, going from 1970-2010, depend less on differences in the racial attitudes of white households and more on the outside options faced by white households. These results support a continued role for place-based policies in mitigating residential segregation.
J60|Duration Dependence as an Unemployment Stigma: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Germany|Based on a correspondence experiment covering 3,124 fictitious job applications, the paper identifies and quantifies duration dependence in Germany, with a particular emphasis on company and vacancy characteristics as potential determinants. The experiment reveals that duration dependence manifests itself in a sharp decline of 26% to 35% in callbacks when an individual has been unemployed for 10 months, pointing to the existence of an unemployment stigma for Germany. The results are driven by labor market tightness, companies' access to applicants and screening behavior related to company size, with no evidence for an unemployment stigma determined by the contract type.
J60|Vulnerability to Poverty: Tajikistan During and After the Global Financial Crisis|Abstract We use a new formal, practical, and easily decomposable measure to examine vulnerability to poverty in Tajikistan during the global financial crisis. Our strategy is to estimate a first-order Markov model of household expenditure with the aim of identifying the vulnerability of households to poverty. We use Bayesian methods which allow us to estimate the limiting expenditure distribution. Importantly, by introducing the index of vulnerability as the weighted probability of a household falling into poverty over a given time horizon, we can use the estimated dynamics to assess short, medium and long-run vulnerability. We find that during the “recession transition” almost all households were vulnerable to poverty while almost none were during the “recovery period”. Overall, urban households, more educated households and households receiving remittances from international labor migrants were less vulnerable to poverty. While households with a current or very recent migrant did not have a significantly lower measured vulnerability to poverty, those households receiving remittances from migrants had a lower vulnerability to poverty. Our findings stress that the international labor migration from Tajikistan may not be a reliable means of welfare security for households because external economic shocks and internal political decisions can negatively affect the Russian economy and lead to a reduction of remittance flows to Tajikistan.
J60|Decision to Emigrate Amongst the Youth in Lebanon|This paper studies the determinants of youth emigration decisions, which is considered to be one of the main causes of ‘Brain Drain’ in Arab Mediterranean Countries (AMCs). We focus on the case of Lebanon using a unique dataset covering young people aged 15 to 29 from the year 2016. The aim of the paper is to identify the profile of youth’s propensity to emigrate from Lebanon. The empirical results indicate that youth from non-wealthy backgrounds living in smaller dwellings have a higher propensity to emigrate. It is also found that being male and unemployed has a positive incidence on migration. Moreover, university education promotes the willingness to emigrate; while residents of poor regions are more likely to express such willingness. Finally, the paper provides some insights for policymakers.
J60|Parents and Peers: Parental Neighbourhood- and School-Level Variation in Individual Neighbourhood Outcomes over Time|There is a link between the socio-economic outcomes of parents and their children over the life course. Intergenerational transmissions were repeatedly shown for socioeconomic characteristics and (dis)advantage, but recently also for residential neighbourhood status. Previous research from the Netherlands, Sweden, and the US shows that children from disadvantaged parental neighbourhoods experience long-term exposure to similar neighbourhoods as adults. However, there are multiple parallel socio-spatial contexts besides the residential space to which individuals are exposed on a daily basis, such as households, schools, and places of work and leisure, which may also influence their outcomes. For children and adolescents, the school environment may be especially important. This study contributes to the literature by examining the joint influence of the parental background, the parental neighbourhood, and a compositional measure of the school environment, on the neighbourhood trajectories of Dutch adolescents after leaving the parental home. We use longitudinal register data from the Netherlands to study a complete cohort of school-going home-leavers, who were followed from 1999 to 2012. We fit cross-classified multilevel models, in order to split up the variance components of schools and parental residential neighbourhoods over time. We find that poverty concentration in the parental neighbourhood plays an important role in determining their children's residential outcomes later in life. Some variation in individual neighbourhood outcomes at the level of the secondary school remains unexplained.
J60|Performance Pay and Applicant Screening|Using German establishment data, we show that the relationship between intensity of individual‐based performance pay and intensity of applicant screening depends on the nature of production. In establishments with increased multitasking, performance pay is positively associated with applicant screening. By contrast, in establishments without increased multitasking, performance pay is negatively associated with applicant screening. We do not find a similar pattern of results for group‐based performance pay or profit‐sharing. Our findings fit the hypothesis that individual‐based performance pay induces a positive self‐sorting of employees if jobs are less multifaceted. In this case, employers with a high intensity of performance pay do not need intensive applicant screening to ensure a high quality of matches between workers and jobs. However, if jobs are more multifaceted, individual‐based performance pay can entail problems of adverse self‐sorting. In order to mitigate or overcome these problems, employers making intensive use of performance pay also screen applicants more intensively.
J60|Incorporating Neighbourhood Choice in a Model of Neighbourhood Effects on Income|Studies of neighbourhood effects often attempt to identify causal effects of neighbourhood characteristics on individual outcomes, such as income, education, employment, and health. However, selection looms large in this line of research and it has been repeatedly argued that estimates of neighbourhood effects are biased as people non-randomly select into neighbourhoods based on their preferences, income, and the availability of alternative housing. We propose a two-step framework to help disentangle selection processes in the relationship between neighbourhood deprivation and earnings. We first model neighbourhood selection using a discrete choice framework and derive correction components to adjust parameter estimates in a subsequent neighbourhood effects model for the unequal probability that an individual 'chooses' to live in a particular area. Applying this technique to administrative data from the Netherlands, we find significant interactions between personal and neighbourhood characteristics in the selection model. This confirms individual differences in neighbourhood preferences; individuals non-randomly select into neighbourhoods. The baseline neighbourhood effects model reveals a significant effect of average neighbourhood income on individual income. When we include correction components for the differential sorting of individuals into specific neighbourhoods, the effect of neighbourhood income diminishes, but remains significant. These results suggest that researchers need to be attuned to the role of selection bias when assessing the role of neighbourhood effects on individual outcomes. Perhaps more importantly, the strong, persistent effect of neighbourhood deprivation on subsequent earnings suggests that neighbourhood effects reflect more than the shared characteristics of neighbourhood residents; place of residence partially determines economic well-being.
J60|The Difficult School-to-Work Transition of High School Dropouts: Evidence from a field experiment|This paper investigates the effects of the labor market experience of high school dropouts four years after leaving school by sending fictitious resumes to real job postings in France. Compared to those who have stayed unemployed since leaving school, the callback rate is not raised for those with employment experience, whether it is subsidized or non-subsidized, in the market or non-market sector, if there is no training accompanied by skill certification. In particular, we find no stigma effect associated with subsidized or non-market sector work experience. Moreover, training accompanied by skill certification improves youth prospects only when the local unemployment rate is sufficiently low, which occurs in one fifth of the commuting zones only.
J60|Towards an East German wage curve - NUTS boundaries, labour market regions and unemployment spillovers|The relevance of spatial effects in the wage curve can be rationalized by the model of monopsonistic competition in regional labour markets. However, distortions in extracting the regional unemployment effects arise for administrative boundaries at the district level as they fail to adequately capture spatial processes. In addition, the nonstationarity of wages and unemployment is often ignored. Both issues are particularly important in high unemployment regimes like East Germany where a wage curve is difficult to establish. In this paper, labour market regions defined by economic criteria are used to examine the existence of an East German wage curve. Due to the nonstationarity of spatial data, a global panel cointegration approach is adopted. By specifying a spatial error correction model (SpECM), equilibrium adjustments are investigated in time and space. The analysis gives evidence on a locally but not a spatially cointegrated wage curve for East Germany.
J60|Skills Training and Employment Outcomes in Rural Bihar|In a number of countries, youth unemployment is a pressing economic and political concern. In India, 54 percent of the country's population of 1.21 billion is below the age of 25 and faces a high rate of (disguised) unemployment. To augment youth employment, the Government of India has launched a number of skills training programs. This paper deals with participation in and the impact of one of these programs (DDUJKY) located in rural Bihar, one of India's poorest states. The analysis is based on data collected in mid-2016 and compares training participants with non-participants who applied for the scheme but eventually did not attend. We find that the training program squarely reaches the intended target group - rural poor youth. Initially, the program leads to a 29 percentage point increase in the employment rate of the trained graduates. However, two to six months after the training, the employment effect of the program drops to zero. A third of the placed graduates leave their jobs due to caste-based discrimination and another third leave due to a mismatch between the salaries offered and their living costs. The upshot is that while the training program enhances job market prospects, other labor market factors undo the positive effects.
J60|Ethnic Differences in Duration and Timing of Exposure to Neighbourhood Disadvantage during Childhood|This paper examines ethnic differences in childhood neighborhood disadvantage among children living in the Netherlands. In contrast to more conventional approaches for assessing children's exposure to neighborhood poverty and affluence (e.g., point-in-time and cumulative measures of exposure), we apply sequence analysis to simultaneously capture the timing and duration of exposure to poor and nonpoor neighborhoods during childhood. Rich administrative microdata offered a unique opportunity to follow the entire 1999 birth cohort of the Turkish, Moroccan, Surinamese, and Antillean second generation and a native Dutch comparison group from birth up until age 15 (N=24,212). Results indicate that especially Turkish and Moroccan children were more likely than native Dutch children to live in a poor neighborhood at any specific stage within childhood, but particularly throughout childhood. Although differences became substantially smaller after adjusting for parental and household characteristics, ethnic differences remained large and statistically significant. In addition, the impact of household income on children's neighborhood income trajectories was found to be weaker for ethnic minority children than for native Dutch children. Our findings are discussed in relation to theories on spatial assimilation, place stratification, and residential preferences.
J60|'Rational Overeating' in a Feast-or-Famine World: Economic Insecurity and the Obesity Epidemic|Obesity rates have risen dramatically in the US since the 1980s, but well-identified studies have struggled to explain the magnitude of the observed changes. In this paper, we estimate the causal impact of economic insecurity on obesity rates. Specifically, we construct a synthetic panel of demographic groups over the period 1988 to 2012 by combining the newly developed Economic Security Index (ESI) with data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). According to our estimates, increased economic insecurity over this time period explains 50% of the overall population-level increase in obesity.
J60|Job Search Behavior among the Employed and Unemployed|This paper uses a new and exhaustive dataset on the labor market outcomes of roughly 1,400 household heads surveyed through the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations. We use the data to examine the job search behavior of both employed and nonâ€ employed individuals. The data have detailed information on several aspects of job search, including the duration and intensity of search, the offers received, the reservation wage of the jobseeker, and the relative values of various nonâ€ wage job benefits. The survey is unique in that it includes information on the job search outcomes of those employed and nonâ€ employed, including those who report not actively searching for work (e.g., we have information on job referrals and unsolicited offers). It is also unique in that it has the same information on the job search outcomes that led to the job of those currently employed. The data allow us to examine several aspects of job search. First, we study the relationship between job search effort and the realized outcomes of that effort, conditional on employment status. Second, we examine the role the reservation wage plays in job search effort and offer acceptance decisions, again, conditional on employment status. Third, we examine to what extent non-wage amenities are important to the job acceptance decision. Finally, we can quantify the role of alternative margins in the job search process, such as referrals and unsolicited job offers, and their effect on employment outcomes.
J60|Educational Attainment and Neighbourhood Outcomes: Differences between Highly-Educated Natives and Non-Western Ethnic Minorities in the Netherlands|In the Netherlands, obtaining a higher education increases the chance to move to a better neighbourhood for native Dutch adults who grew up in a deprived parental neighbourhood. For non-Western minorities, education does not have this positive effect on socio-spatial mobility. In this study we investigate potential explanations for these ethnic differences in the relationship between educational attainment and neighbourhood outcomes over time. We use longitudinal register data from the Netherlands to study a complete cohort of parental home leavers who attained a higher education by the end of the measurement period (1999 to 2012). We supplemented this data with information gathered in the WoON-survey. We examined differences in income trajectories for highly-educated native Dutch and non-Western ethnic minorities; investigated the strength of intergenerational transmission of income for both groups; and assessed individual neighbourhood experiences and contentment. We find that the highly-educated native Dutch in our subpopulation have a substantially higher average income over time, and a weaker association to the income of their parents compared to the non-Western ethnic minorities. Additionally, for ethnic minorities, our results show that the level of contentment with their neighbourhood is highest in deprived neighbourhoods compared to more affluent residential environments, and they more often reside in close proximity to their parents compared to the native Dutch, both suggesting an element of choice in neighbourhood selection.
J60|Informality, public employment and employment protection in developing countries|This paper proposes an equilibrium matching model for developing countries’ labor markets where the interaction between public, formal private and informal private sectors are taken into account. Theoretical analysis shows that gains from reforms aiming at liberalizing formal labor markets can be annulled by shifts in the public sector employment and wage policies. Since the public sector accounts for a substantial share of employment in developing countries, this approach is crucial to understand the main labor market outcomes of such economies. Wages offered by the public sector increase the outside option value of the workers during the bargaining processes in the formal and informal sectors. It becomes more profitable for workers to search on-the-job, in order to move to these more attractive and more stable types of jobs. The public sector therefore acts as an additional tax for the formal private firms. Using data on workers’ flows from Egypt, we show empirically and theoretically that the liberalization of labor markets plays against informal employment by increasing the profitability, and hence job creations, of formal jobs. The latter effect is however dampened or even sometimes nullified by the increase of the offered wages in the public sector observed at the same time.
J60|Rising wage inequality in Germany: Increasing heterogeneity and changing selection into full-time work|This study revisits the increase in wage inequality in Germany. Accounting for changes in various sets of observables, composition changes explain a large part of the increase in wage inequality among full-time workers. The composition effects are larger for females than for males, and increasingly heterogenous labor market histories play an important role. Furthermore, we find strong effects of education for males and strong effects of age and experience for females. Changes in industry and occupation explain fairly little. Extending the analysis to total employment confirms the basic findings, while revealing substantial negative selection into part-time work.
J60|Sorting out Neighbourhood Effects Using Sibling Data|Previous research has reported evidence of intergenerational transmission of both neighbourhood status and social and economic outcomes later in life; parents influence where their children live as adults and how well they do later in life in terms of their income. However, interactions between the individual, the childhood family and neighbourhood context and the neighbourhood experiences after leaving the parental home are often overlooked which might bias estimates of neighbourhood effects. It is likely that part of the effects attributed to neighbourhoods, are actually effects of the family in which someone was brought up. This study uses a sibling design to disentangle family and neighbourhood effects on income, and synthetic sibling pairs are used as a control group. The sibling design allows us to separate the effects of childhood family and neighbourhood contexts, but also between childhood neighbourhood effects and effects of the adult neighbourhood experiences. Using data from Swedish registers we show that the neighbourhood effect from both childhood and adult neighbourhood exposure is biased upwards by the influence of the family context. This leads to the conclusion that part of what appeared to be a neighbourhood effect was in fact a lasting family effect. Interestingly, we find that there is a long lasting effect of the family context on income later in life, and that this effect is strong regardless the individual neighbourhood pathway later in life.
J60|Three Generations of Intergenerational Transmission of Neighbourhood Context|"The literature on intergenerational contextual mobility has shown that neighbourhood status is partly ""inherited"" from parents to children where children who spend their childhood in deprived neighbourhoods are more likely to live in such neighbourhoods also as adults. It has been suggested that such transmission of neighbourhood status also is relevant from multiple generation approach. To our knowledge, however, this has only been confirmed by simulations and not empirical research. This study uses actual empirical data covering 25 years and the full Swedish population to investigate intergenerational similarities in neighbourhood status of three generations of Swedish women. Findings suggest that the neighbourhood environments of Swedish women are correlated with the neighbourhood statuses of their mothers and, to some extent, grandmothers. We also find an effect of distance where intergenerational transmission is stronger for those remaining close. Whereas women whose mothers and grandmothers live in high-income areas benefit from staying close, women whose mothers and grandmothers live in low-income areas do better if they live further away. These results are robust over two different analytical strategies – comparing neighbourhood status of the three generations at similar ages and at the same point in time – and two different spatial scales. We argue that the finding of such effects in (relatively egalitarian) Sweden implies that similar, and possibly stronger, patterns are likely to exist in other countries as well."
J60|Boom, slump, sudden stops, recovery, and policy options. Portugal and the Euro|Abstract Over the past 20 years, Portugal has gone through a boom, a slump, a sudden stop, and now a recovery. Unemployment has decreased, but remains high, and output is still far below potential. Competitiveness has improved, but more is needed to keep the current account in check as the economy recovers. Private and public debt are high, both legacies of the boom, the slump and the sudden stop. Productivity growth remains low. Because of high debt and low growth, the recovery remains fragile. We review the history and the main mechanisms at work. We then review a number of policy options, from fiscal consolidation to fiscal expansion, cleaning up of non-performing loans, labor market reforms, product market reforms, and euro exit. We argue that at this point, the main focus of macroeconomic policy should be twofold. The first is the treatment of non-performing loans, the second is product market reforms and reforms aimed at increasing micro-flexibility in the labor market. Symmetrically, we also argue that at this point, some policies would be undesirable, among them faster fiscal consolidation, measures aimed at decreasing nominal wages and prices, and euro exit.
J60|Social Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election|Following the 2016 U.S. presidential election, many have expressed concern about the effects of false stories (“fake news”), circulated largely through social media. We discuss the economics of fake news and present new data on its consumption prior to the election. Drawing on web browsing data, archives of fact-checking websites, and results from a new online survey, we find: (i) social media was an important but not dominant source of election news, with 14 percent of Americans calling social media their “most important” source; (ii) of the known false news stories that appeared in the three months before the election, those favoring Trump were shared a total of 30 million times on Facebook, while those favoring Clinton were shared 8 million times; (iii) the average American adult saw on the order of one or perhaps several fake news stories in the months around the election, with just over half of those who recalled seeing them believing them; and (iv) people are much more likely to believe stories that favor their preferred candidate, especially if they have ideologically segregated social media networks.
J60|Estimating the Recession-Mortality Relationship when Migration Matters|A large literature following Ruhm (2000) suggests that mortality falls during recessions and rises during booms. The panel-data approach used to generate these results assumes that either there is no substantial migration response to temporary changes in local economic conditions, or that any such response is accurately captured by intercensal population estimates. To assess the importance of these assumptions, we examine two natural experiments: the recession in cotton textile-producing districts of Britain during the U.S. Civil War, and the coal boom in Appalachian counties of the U.S. that followed the OPEC oil embargo in the 1970s. In both settings, we find evidence of a substantial migratory response. Moreover, we show that estimates of the relationship between business cycles and mortality are highly sensitive to assumptions related to migration. After adjusting for migration, we find that mortality increased during the cotton recession, but was largely unaffected by the coal boom. Overall, our results suggest that migration can meaningfully bias estimates of the impact of business-cycle fluctuations on mortality.
J60|Reforms for more and better quality jobs in Spain|The Spanish economy is growing strongly, but there is a risk that many people are being left behind. Unemployment, especially among young people and the low-skilled, remains very high. About half of all the unemployed have been unemployed for over a year and one third for more than two years. A quarter of all those who are employed are on temporary jobs. Since the global economic crisis, poverty and inequality have increased. An immediate priority is to ensure adequate income support for those most in need. Getting more people into better jobs is crucial to raise living standards and to reduce poverty. In terms of structural policies, this requires continuing to improve activation policies, such as training and job placement, re-skilling and up-skilling the unemployed, preventing youth from leaving the education system under-qualified and better on-the-job-training. More can be done to foster the creation of better quality jobs by reducing barriers to hiring and addressing labour market duality.
J60|Crisis in the East of Ukraine: end or beginning of regional labour market development?|Research background: Armed conflict and political crisis in Ukraine resulted in significant economy decline, caused migration inside the country and unemployment, changed Ukrainian labour markets. The questions arise, if these changes bring only negative effects and if there is a chance for economy revival. Purpose of the article: The purpose of the article is to examine changes in economy structure, present state of labour market in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, changes in demography situation; reveal the main tendencies and give recommendations concerning further development of labour market of the regions. Methodology/methods: The statistical information from the State Statistics Service of Ukraine, reports of International and other organizations have been analysed. Such methods as statistical and economic analysis, abstract-logical analysis, classification and systematization have been used. Findings & Value added: The population of the Eastern regions of Ukraine decreased under the influence of natural decrease and internal migrations. The internally displaced persons lost their jobs, and now they are suffering hard to survive. Many of them have to change their professions and acquire brand new skills and knowledge to become competitive. The majority of internally displaced persons are young people aged less than 30 years old. Their survival and survival of the regions are possible only on condition of existing desire of people to self-develop and self-organize. Thus small and medium enterprises and entrepreneurs start to appear in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. They substitute the existing huge industrial plants and become the main direction for labour market development in the East of Ukraine. Creation of small businesses is fully supported not only by government bodies, but also by International organizations. Assistance of international organizations should give the impetus for the search of new areas for growth and forms of interaction with the existing government and business.
J60|Crises and mortality: Does the level of unemployment matter?|The relationship between mortality and economic fluctuations has been a topic of long interest, which intensified following the 2008 global financial crisis. We study whether mortality responds non-linearly and asymmetrically to unemployment in the context of national economic crises. Although these assumptions have been challenged in other domains, they have been neglected in the mortality literature. Greece offers an ideal setting as unemployment was decreasing until mid-2008, but then it was sharply increased as a result of a severe economic crisis. We use quarterly data on regional unemployment and mortality from 1999 to 2013, giving a balanced panel of 780 observations. We find evidence of a countercyclical total mortality, especially for the older groups, and a further deteriorating crisis effect. We provide evidence that the relationship is non-linear and asymmetric, suggesting that the effect on death rates changes for very high values of unemployment and depends on its direction. Both non-linearity and asymmetry are mainly driven by those above 65 years old. The results suggest that the mechanisms explaining these effects are likely to vary across age groups. Our findings have important methodological implications and suggest that empirical investigations on fluctuations, recessions and mortality should not ignore possible non-linear and asymmetric behaviours, especially during turbulent times.
J60|Eine keynesianische Analyse der Beschäftigungswirkung einer Arbeitszeitverkürzung<BR>[A Keynesian analysis of the employment effects of a working time reduction]|Recently, the debate about the employment effects of a working time reduction regained the public attention in Germany. Heiner Flassbeck and Friederike Spiecker commented that such a reduction of working-time leads to a falling household consumption due to the lower income of the employees while new men are not employed instantly. In the end, the creation of new jobs becomes obsolete as the sales of the companies shrink. Fritz Helmedag criticizes their analysis. He instead comes to the conclusion that it is necessary not only to adjust the wages to the productivity growth but also to reduce the working time by the same amount the productivity grows; otherwise a higher unemployment is implied under stagnating demand. In this paper it is shown that Helmedag´s analysis suffers from serious analytical inconsistencies. Firstly, his model can be identified as a Keynesian textbook model. For this reason, the relevance for policy conclusions can be seriously doubted. Secondly, the key elements of Flassbeck and Spiecker`s argumentation can be implemented in the model easily. Therefore even within Helmedag´s model the results can differ. Some results can also be attributed to an implicit price stability. Thirdly, the model´s assumptions are highly unrealistic. Furthermore, even basic accounting rules are disregarded as the balance of the primary incomes is missing. This appears to be especially paradox when the core element of Helmedag´s approach is stock-flow consistency. After this examination of Helmedags work, an alternative Keynesian analysis – although heuristic – is provided. It turns out that a working time reduction can lead to significant positive employment effects. Nevertheless, it depends on the concrete shape of the conduction. Considering the current political landscape, heading towards more fiscal stimulus should be preferred to a reduction of working time.
J60|Interpreting sufficiency in fsQCA: A reply to Marques and Salavisa (2017)|Marques and Salavisa (2017) use fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to analyze age-based labour market dualization in Southern European, Anglo-Saxon and a few Nordic countries. They argue that segmentation at the expense of young outsiders is driven by several factors in non-linear ways: different configurations of deindustrialization, labour market coordination, employment protection, and liberalization can lead to youth outsiderness. We question the validity of their empirical analysis and argue that a more complete interpretation of fsQCA measures of fit does not confirm their conclusions. We use the occasion for a hands-on discussion of how the consistency and PRI scores of the sufficiency solution terms are calculated. A good understanding of these allows the researcher to understand which cases and configurations drive high or low scores, and thus facilitates a better understanding of the results.
J60|Inter-Regional Migration In Cz And Sk: The Empirical Study Of Panel Data At Nuts3 Level|The aim of this paper is to define the relationship between migration, income, and unemployment rates, and therefore estimate these relationships using vector autoregression and the Granger causality test. This study focused on inter-regional migration at NUTS3 level in the Czech and Slovak Republics. The analysed period is from the year 2004 to 2013, and the final panel data is set for one variable, and therefore contains a total of 220 observations. According to the results, the regional migration in the Czech and Slovak Republics was determined by income differences and it is in accordance with the neoclassical theory. The causal relation was not confirmed for differences in unemployment rate. The changes of income and unemployment rates in the Czech Republic and Slovakia were not caused by migration. These results do not support conclusions of the neoclassical model of migration.
J60|The determinants of entrepreneurship for migrants in Italy. Do Italian migrants become entrepreneurs by “opportunity” or through “necessity”?|This research aims to contribute to the literature on migrants’ entrepreneurship by investigating the determinants of self-employment for migrants in Italy. The analysis is carried out using a data set by the National Observatory for the Financial Inclusion of Migrants in Italy, developed and managed by the Centre of International Political Studies (CeSPI).Controlling for the macroeconomic context and for the migration plan, we find out that the main determinants of migrant entrepreneurship in Italy are related to migrants’ nationality, length of stay, ownership of a current account, gender, proximity of partner, and education. Moreover, our data show that, despite the aftermath of the crisis, the decision of starting a business is for men a matter of opportunity and not of necessity, and that being married increases the negative effect of being a woman on the probability of being an entrepreneur. Furthermore, data shows that the causal relation between risk taking and being an entrepreneur holds true for migrant entrepreneurs in Italy and that the difficulties faced in having qualifications and competences recognised push migrants into self-entrepreneurship.
J60|The wage curve before and during the Greek economic crisis|Abstract Using cross-sectional data from the Labour Force Survey, we investigate whether a wage curve, i.e. a negative relationship between real wages and regional unemployment, could be estimated in the Greek labour market and in the period 1999–2014. Adopting individual static and regional dynamic specifications, our results do not support the existence of such a relationship despite the extensive macroeconomic adjustment of real wages after 2009. However, allowing for period-specific heterogeneous slopes, we find that a negative relationship between wages and regional unemployment emerged in the period 2010Q2–2011Q4 which however was short-lived. This relationship appears to be exclusively due to the restructuring of the collective bargaining regime and the reduction in the national minimum wages, both of which were implemented in the private sector.
J60|Social mobility during South Africa’s industrial take-off|In the absence of historical income or education data, the change in occupations over time can be used as a measure of social mobility. This paper investigates intergenerational occupational mobility using a novel genealogical dataset for settler South Africa, spanning its transition from an agricultural to an early industrialized society (1800–1909). We identify fathers and sons for whom we have complete information on occupational attainment. We follow a two-generation discrete approach to measure changes in both absolute and relative mobility over time. Consistent with qualitative evidence of a shift away from agriculture as the economy’s dominant sector, we see the farming class shrinking and the skilled and professional classes growing. Controlling for changes in the structure of the labor market over time, we find increasing social mobility, becoming significant after the discovery of minerals in 1868. We find this mobility particularly for semi-skilled workers but virtually no improved mobility for sons of farmers. We also test hypotheses related to the mobility prospects for first-born sons and sons of immigrants.

J60|Duration Dependence as an Unemployment Stigma: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Germany|Based on a correspondence experiment covering 3,124 fictitious job applications, the paper identifies and quantifies duration dependence in Germany, with a particular emphasis on company and vacancy characteristics as potential determinants. The experiment reveals that duration dependence manifests itself in a sharp decline of 26% to 35% in callbacks when an individual has been unemployed for 10 months, pointing to the existence of an unemployment stigma for Germany. The results are driven by labor market tightness, companies' access to applicants and screening behavior related to company size, with no evidence for an unemployment stigma determined by the contract type.
J60|Влияние Несельскохозяйственного Бизнеса На Уровень Занятости В Сельской Местности Южно-Казахстанской Области<BR>[Impact of non-agricultural businesses on rural employment in south Kazakhstan province]|В условиях развития глобального экономического кризиса проблемы занятости населения, безработицы и мобильности трудовых ресурсов в Казахстане приобретают все большую актуальность и всегда находятся в центре внимания научной, общественной, политической и хозяйственной деятельности соответствующих ведомств, организаций и предприятий. В кризисный период в целях защиты граждан от безработицы государством была разработана стратегия, которую можно условно охарактеризовать, как «стратегия выживания». Данная стратегия направлена на реализацию государственных программ: создания социальных рабочих мест, переобучения и переподготовки специалистов, и организации молодежной практики. В исследовании проводилось интервью с работниками акиматов, сельскохозяйственных ведомств, сельскими предпринимателями и представителями несельскохозяйственного бизнеса в Южно-Казахстанской области (ЮКО). Основными направлениями развития несельскохозяйственного бизнеса в сельской местности ЮКО являются переработка сельскохозяйственного сырья и продукции, торгово-закупочная деятельность, общественное питание в сельских населенных пунктах (придорожные магазины и кафе) и их бытовое обслуживание, строительство жилых и производственных построек, производство товаров народных промыслов, транспортные услуги. Развитие несельскохозяйственного бизнеса на селе будет содействовать диверсификации хозяйственной деятельности в сельской экономике, расширению источников формирования доходной базы местных бюджетов, повышению устойчивости развития сельских территорий в части расширения масштабов занятости и развития самозанятости сельского населения, а также повышению уровня его жизни.
J60|Change in self-efficacy as a source of state dependence in labor market dynamics?|Using the PASS survey, I analyze the relationship between employment and self-efficacy. Estimating a dynamic model which takes into account reverse causality and selection on unobservables, I show that employment positively affects self-efficacy and vice versa. Hence, changes in the personal trait self-efficacy may be a source of state dependence in labor market dynamics. Hence, reverse causality should be taken into account when estimating the effect of self-efficacy on labor market outcomes.
J60|Trade issues affecting disaster response|The frequency, severity and economic impact of natural disasters are growing. Import surges resulting from disaster-response efforts can highlight underlying structural failings in the border clearance regimes of disaster-affected countries. Relief supplies, specialized personnel and agencies often face regulatory barriers affecting their entry and practice in disaster-affected environments. Against that background, the purpose of this working paper is twofold: it sets out to explore trade issues that can undermine effective disaster response, and then outlines how these trade issues might be addressed, including through implementation of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement as well as through technology-enabled services and the expansion of disaster risk insurance. The merits of further discussion of trade and natural disasters are also discussed.
J60|Economic downturn and volunteering: Do economic crises affect content generation on Wikipedia?|In this paper, we address the impact of surging unemployment on online public good provision. Specifically, we ask how drastically increased unemployment affects voluntary contributions of content to the online encyclopedia Wikipedia. We put together a monthly country-level data set, which combines country specific economic outcomes with data on contributions to the online encyclopedia. As a source of exogenous variation in the economic state we use the fact that European countries were affected by the financial crisis in the US in September 2008 with different intensity. For European countries, we find that the economic downturn is associated with more viewership, which channels higher participation of volunteers in Wikipedia expressed in editing activity and content growth. We provide evidence for increased information search online or online learning as a potential channel of the change in public goods provision, which is a potentially important side effect of economic downturn.
J60|Does Wikipedia matter? The effect of Wikipedia on tourist choices|We document a causal influence of online user-generated information on realworld economic outcomes. In particular, we conduct a randomized field experiment to test whether additional information on Wikipedia about cities affects tourists' choices of overnight visits. Our treatment of adding information to Wikipedia increases overnight visits by 9% during the tourist season. The impact comes mostly from improving the shorter and incomplete pages in Wikipedia.
J60|Rising Wage Inequality in Germany: Increasing Heterogeneity and Changing Selection into Full-Time Work|This study revisits the increase in wage inequality in Germany. Accounting for changes in various sets of observables, composition changes explain a large part of the increase in wage inequality among full-time workers. The composition effects are larger for females than for males, and increasingly heterogenous labor market histories play an important role. Furthermore, we find strong effects of education for males and strong effects of age and experience for females. Changes in industry and occupation explain fairly little. Extending the analysis to total employment confirms the basic findings, while revealing substantial negative selection into part-time work.
J60|Economic Factors and the Electoral Success of Far-right and Far-left Parties in the EU Countries|The recent electoral success of far-right and far-left parties is often considered to be a side-effect of the economic crisis. This article aims to determine the degree to which the downturn in economic performance helped to increase the vote share of these parties. The research includes a set of 23 EU member states from the period 1995 to 2012, and finds that poor economic performance significantly determined the vote share of the far-left. Among the indicators influencing the far-left electorate were mainly changes in the GDP and unemployment rate. The research does not find any correlation between the far-rights vote share and the development of macroeconomic indicators.
J60|The consequences of public employment: evidence from Italian municipalities|We investigate the consequences of public employment on local economies. We start by presenting a spatial-equilibrium framework, to highlight that the housing market is an important channel through which a variation in public employment affects private employment. We then provide empirical evidence from Italian municipalities, focusing on the strong contraction in the public sector workforce that occurred between the last two Censuses (2001-2011). We use an IV identification strategy that exploits the fact that variations in local public employment were strongly influenced by central government decisions, with little reference to the economic conditions of the municipalities. Our results suggest that exogenous contractions in public employment lead to an increase of private jobs, and that competition in the housing market seems to be a relevant explanation for this finding.
J60|Estimating Vacancies from Firms’ Hiring behavior: The Case of a Developing Economy|Vacancies are the center of any job creation process. In this paper, we study firms’ hiring behavior in a way that is directly related to vacancies. To understand the dynamic relationship between hires and vacancies, we estimate what we called a hiring function. Even though we cannot observe vacancies in our data, we propose an original procedure that allows recovering an estimate of vacancies. For this purpose we use firms’ standard information on hires and separations. Monte Carlo experiments show that the prediction of vacancies from this procedure is consistent. Using this prediction, we analyze the firm and aggregated level behavior of vacancies for the Colombian labor market. We find that 73% of all vacancies are created by large firms but, relatively, small firms create more new positions. The method we propose may be useful in developing economies, where there are no good sources of information on vacancies.
J60|Decision to Emigrate Amongst the Youth in Lebanon|This paper studies the determinants of youth emigration decisions, which is considered to be one of the main causes of 'Brain Drain' in Arab Mediterranean Countries (AMCs). We focus on the case of Lebanon using a unique dataset covering young people aged 15 to 29 from the year 2016. The aim of the paper is to identify the profile of youth's propensity to emigrate from Lebanon. The empirical results indicate that youth from non-wealthy backgrounds living in smaller dwellings have a higher propensity to emigrate. It is also found that being male and unemployed has a positive incidence on migration. Moreover, university education promotes the willingness to emigrate; while residents of poor regions are more likely to express such willingness. Finally, the paper provides some insights for policymakers.
J60|Tendencias del empleo temporal en la industria boyacense, 2000-2013|La transición del modelo tecnoproductivo fordista al posfordista ha traído consigo una notoria flexibilización laboral de la que se deriva la tercerización. De este fenómeno no escapa la industria periférica como la colombiana, que involucionó a finales del siglo pasado. El presente artículo busca establecer la dinámica del empleo a término fijo en la industria manufacturera, y para ello utiliza la información de la Encuesta Anual Manufacturera (EAM) del Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística (DANE). El análisis encontró que la utilización del empleo temporal desde la década del noventa se acrecentó a expensas del empleo permanente, hasta representar en 2013 el 41,4%; en Boyacá, aunque creció aceleradamente desde comienzos de este siglo, solo bordea el 30%. La contratación directa superó a la indirecta, lo que no contradice la persistencia de esta tendencia, que predominó en las categorías ocupacionales más relevantes del sector industrial.******The transition from the Fordist to post-Fordist techno-productive model has brought with it a noticeable labor flexibilization from which outsourcing is derived. Peripheral industry, such as the Colombian one that suffered a regression at the end of the last century, does not escape from this phenomenon. The present article seeks to establish the dynamics of fixed-term employment in the manufacturing industry, using information from the Annual Manufacturing Survey (AMS). The analysis found that the use of temporary employmentsince the 1990s increased at the expense of permanent employment, until reaching 41.4% in 2013; in the Boyacá region, although it has grown rapidly since the beginning of this century, temporary employment is only about 30%. Direct contracting exceeded indirect hiring, which does not contradict the persistence of the above mentioned trend that has predominated in the most relevant occupational categories of the industrial sector.******A transição do modelo tecnoprodutivo do fordismo ao pós-fordismo vem trazendo consigo uma notável flexibilização trabalhista da qual se deriva a terceirização. A indústria periférica como a colombiana, que regrediu no final do século passado, não escapa desse fenômeno. Este artigo procura estabelecer a dinâmica do emprego com contrato a prazo definido na manufatura e, para isso, utiliza a informação da Pesquisa Anual Manufatureira do Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estatística da Colômbia. A análise constatou que a utilização do emprego temporário desde a década de 1990 aumentou à custa do emprego permanente, até representar, em 2013, 41,4%; em Boyacá, embora tenha crescido de forma acelerada desde o início deste século, só atinge 30%. A contratação direta superou a indireta, o que não contradiz a persistência dessa tendência, que predominou nas categorias ocupacionais mais relevantes do setor industrial.
J60|The Difficult School-To-Work Transition of High School Dropouts: Evidence from a Field Experiment|This paper investigates the effects of the labor market experience of high school dropouts four years after leaving school by sending fictitious résumés to real job postings in France. Compared to those who have stayed unemployed since leaving school, the callback rate is not raised for those with employment experience, whether it is subsidized or non-subsidized, in the market or non-market sector, if there is no training accompanied by skill certification. In particular, we find no stigma effect associated with subsidized or non-market sector work experience. Moreover, training accompanied by skill certification improves youth prospects only when the local unemployment rate is sufficiently low, which occurs in one fifth of the commuting zones only.
J60|The causal impact of social Connections on firms' outcomes|The paper studies how social connections affect firm-level hiring decisions and performance. We characterize the social connections of firms’ employees using register data and for causal identification we use job displacements, which create directed positive shocks towards connected firms by increasing these firms’ available supply of connected labor. We ascertain that our results are fully driven by these directed supply shocks. Our results show that firms appear to prefer to hire employed workers to whom they are connected over unconnected or unemployed workers. Employed and connected workers mostly go to high-productivity firms, whereas unemployed and unconnected workers tend to go to low-productivity firms. Strong connections – family, recent, durable, formed in small groups, between socially similar agents – matter the most. A displacement shock causes connected firms, in particular low-productive ones, to hire more of the connected workers, while leaving unconnected hires and separations essentially unaffected. Increases in the supply of connected labor, therefore, cause the creation of additional jobs at the firm level. By using these shocks, we can also show that hiring connected workers has a positive causal impact on firm performance. Our results are consistent with a stylized framework where connections reduce hiring frictions and where the firms’ ability to hire connected workers is a function of these workers’ outside options.
J60|Intégration européenne et politiques du marché du travail : quel consensus entre parlementaires français et allemands ?|This paper presents the results of a survey on the future of European integration conducted in the national parliaments of both France and Germany. In particular, we collected the opinions of members of national parliaments on more involvement of the European Union in labor market policies of Member States. We also asked them about their views on the creation of a common unemployment insurance and whether more flexibility is needed in national labor markets. After reporting descriptive and summary statistics, we show that for the majority of questions the answers reflect more of an ideological (left/right) division than a French/German one.
J60|Pitfall in labour market flows modeling: a Reappraisal|We discuss the relevance of the methodology adopted internationally to compare labor market flexibility, which is based on a two-state labor market model and uses stock data to derive transition rates. This model neglects inactivity, and thus it may crucially affect the results. Therefore, we compare these results with transition rates derived by using a three-state labor market model for France, Italy, Spain and the UK. These countries represent, respectively, the continental Europe and the Anglo-Saxon institutional settings. The implied transition rates are much higher even in continental Europe when inactivity is explicitly considered, thus suggesting that conclusions derived using an incomplete representation of the labor market are flawed.
J60|The Unemployment Invariant Hypothesis: Heterogenous Panel Cointegration Evidence From U.S. State Level Data|We explore the long-run relationship between the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rates for U.S. over the period of 1976-2015. We use U.S. state level data and panel cointegration techniques that are robust to cross-sectional heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependency, omitted variable bias and endogeniety issues. We find evidence that on average these two variables are cointegrated and are inversely related. Similar to studies that employ U.S. country level data, this study further questions the empirical relevance of the unemployment invariant hypothesis for the case of the U.S.
J60|Changes in Japan’s labor market during the Lost Decade and the role of demographics|We study the changes that took place in the Japanese labor market due to the decade-long stagnation of the 1990s. Using the Labor Force Survey micro-data from 1983 to 2008 we construct worker flows and study the effects of the so-called Lost Decade on unemployment, employment and participation. We perform the analysis both at the aggregate level and disaggregated by age and gender to understand the type of worker that was most affected by the long recession. We also perform counterfactual experiments to study the importance of demographic factors in such changes. We find that the decade-long recession significantly altered the state of the labor market, although not all workers were affected equally. We find that while almost all changes observed in the unemployment rate can be attributed to the recession, part of the evolution of the employment to population ratio and a large extent of the decline in the participation rate can be accounted for by the aging of the population. We also find that the aging effects are stronger for female workers than for their male counterparts.
J60|Labor Fluidity and Performance of Labor Outcomes in Colombia: Evidence from Employer-Employee Linked Panel|In this paper, we compute standard measures of fluidity for the Colombian urban labor market: worker and job reallocation rates and the excess of worker reallocation over job reallocation. We analyze the period between the second semester of 2008 and the second semester of 2014, finding evidence of an increase of fluidity in the labor market, especially after 2010. We test the hypothesis of a positive effect of fluidity on different employment and occupation indexes using instrumental variables regression models that exploit the variation of labor results and fluidity measures between metropolitan areas and over time. We find robust and positive effects of fluidity on some labor market result indexes related to employment and occupation. To the best of our knowledge, a positive causal effect of fluidity on the performance of the labor market has not been documented for a developing economy.
J60|Understanding Declining Fluidity in the U.S. Labor Market|We document a clear downward trend in labor market fluidity that is common across a variety of measures of worker and job turnover. This trend dates to at least the early 1980s if not somewhat earlier. Next we pull together evidence on a variety of hypotheses that might explain this downward trend. It is only partly related to population demographics and is not due to the secular shift in industrial composition. Moreover, the decline in labor market fluidity seems unlikely to have been caused by an improvement in worker-firm matching, the formalization of hiring practices, or an increase in land use regulation or other regulations. Plausible avenues for further exploration include changes in the worker-firm relationship, particularly with regard to compensation adjustment; changes in firm characteristics such as firm size and age; and a decline in social trust, which may have increased the cost of job search or made both parties in the hiring process more risk averse.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

J60|Neighbourhood choice and neighbourhood reproduction|Although we know a lot about why households choose certain dwellings, we know relatively little about the mechanisms behind their choice of neighbourhood. Most studies of neighbourhood choice focus only on one or two dimensions of neighbourhoods: typically poverty and ethnicity. In this paper we argue that neighbourhoods have multiple dimensions and that models of neighbourhood choice should take these dimensions into account. We propose the use of a conditional logit model. From this approach we can gain insight into the interaction between individual and neighbourhood characteristics which lead to the choice of a particular neighbourhood over alternative destinations. We use Swedish register data to model neighbourhood choice for all households which moved in the city of Uppsala between 1997 and 2006. Our results show that neighbourhood sorting is a highly structured process where households are very likely to choose neighbourhoods where the neighbourhood population matches their own characteristics. We find that income is the most important driver of the sorting process, although ethnicity and other demographic and socioeconomic characteristics play important roles as well.

Con este fin, se estiman varios modelos DSGE con distintas combinaciones de rigideces nominales y reales usando métodos bayesianos. Los resultados indican que el ajuste empírico del modelo está determinado, en orden de importancia, por la rigidez de salarios, la rigidez de los precios domésticos, los costos de ajuste a la inversión, el tipo de indexación que se tenga y la rigidez de los precios importados. Con respecto a la dinámica de corto plazo del modelo, la sensibilidad ante un choque de política monetaria depende en mayor medida de las rigideces de salarios, del tipo de indexación de precios y salarios y de los costos de ajuste de la inversión.
J60|Proximity to Labour Markets: Revisiting Indigenous Employment Through an Analysis of Census Place of Work Data|One of the six targets as part of the current ‘Closing the Gap’ agenda is to halve the gap in employment outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians within a decade (by 2018). Much of the focus around meeting this target has been the availability of jobs in remote Australia. However, given that the majority of the Indigenous population lives in cities and regional Australia where employment gaps are still quite high, most of the additional jobs required to meet CoAG’s target will need to be found in our major cities and large regional towns. Across Australia, there are important labour demand issues resulting from uneven geographic access to labour markets. Utilising place of work and place of usual residence data from the 2006 Census, the analysis presented in this paper considers the proximity of Indigenous Australians to various urban labour markets and the likely impact on entrenching Indigenous socioeconomic disadvantage.

J60|Vulnerabilidad en el empleo, género y etnicidad en el Perú|El objetivo de esta investigación es analizar la vulnerabilidad en el empleo de la fuerza laboral urbana, por etnicidad y por género, para el período 2004-2006. Definimos vulnerabilidad en el empleo como la probabilidad de que la situación laboral de un trabajador empeore respecto a su situación inicial. Empleando los datos del panel urbano 2004-2006 de las ENAHO (INEI), encontramos que las mujeres, los trabajadores indígenas, los jóvenes, los trabajadores mayores de 45 años, y aquellos con menor educación son los grupos con mayor probabilidad tanto de dejar la fuerza laboral como de ver reducida la calidad en su empleo. La educación de calidad es importante para reducir estos tipos de vulnerabilidad.
J60|Evolution of social inequalities in health in Quebec?|This paper, based on data from the National Population Health Surveys (NPHS) from 1994 to 2007, analyzes the evolution of social inequalities in health in Quebec since the mid-1990s using two health measures namely self-assessed health (SAH) and health utility index (HUI). Two methods are used. The first is based on concentration indices and their decompositions while the second is based on the income-health matrices. The results confirm the existence of persistent health gradients, but with some variations over time. The findings also suggest an increase, on average, in health inequalities during the period with a peak during the years 2002/2003. These variations appear especially stronger for low-income individuals.
J60|Centralized Wage Setting and Active Labor Market Policies in Frictional Labor Markets: The Nordic Case|We adopt a standard search and matching model with endogenous job destruction to investigate two issues. First, we use a simplified version of Boeri-Burda to show that at sufficiently low levels of wage share, centralized wage bargaining performs better than decentralized bargaining in terms of average productivity, unemployment, and income inequality. Second, we incorporate active labor market policies in the model and establish that they are more effective in reducing unemployment when wage setting is centralized. Finally, numerical analysis suggests that the difference in effectiveness is sizeable.
J60|EU labour market behaviour during the Great Recession|This paper provides an analysis of the labour market adjustment to the 2008-2009 recession in terms of employment, unemployment, hours worked and wages. It highlights differences in the response of employment and unemployment across countries and different socioeconomic groups. For all EU Member States, it provides evidence of the developments during the crisis of the monthly job finding and separation rates. This helps to assess whether the increase in unemployment is due to an increase of job separation or to a decline in the job finding rate. The paper discusses the risks of jobless growth and compares the dynamics of unemployment and employment across different periods. It provides evidence of an asymmetric response over the cycle, with recessions being characterised by more job destruction than by job creation in the following recoveries. The analysis of the wage dynamics during the recession suggests that there has been an adjustment in the compensation per employee led by the variable component; yet, this has not been sufficient to avoid the increase in the nominal unit labour costs due to labour hoarding.
J60|On economic growth and minimum wages|We offer an analysis of the existence of a positive relationship between minimum wages and economic growth in a fairly standard general equilibrium, one-sector, two-period overlapping generations model, where the usual Romer-typed knowledge spill-over mechanism in production represents the engine of endogenous growth. It is shown that - contrary to the conventional view which has failed to pay due attention to dynamic contexts with labour market rigidities - the minimum-wage economy may grow faster than the competitive-wage economy in spite of a reduced employment rate and, in particular, a growth-maximising minimum wage does exist. A straightforward message is therefore that policymakers may appropriately use minimum wage policies to promote economic growth and individuals' welfare.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J60|From Training to Labour Market. Holocletic Model|The desired professional insertion (placement) after training is under the influence of personal and exogenous variables. In the present paper we identify the constraints and devices that, in an interactive way, can shape and affect the professional insertion. This paper is a result of a subchapter of the author’s PhD dissertation. The helpfulness of the meanings and definitions is clearly reliant on the study framework. We aim to provide to the reader a set of elements that help to distinguish, to compare and turn out accessible the eclectic dominant mainstream, in order to standardized, to clarify and to apply concepts in future research works and studies. We also suggest a study model with a different point of view.
J60|Darbaspēka migrācijas ietekme uz darba tirgu Latvijā<BR>[Influence of Labor Migration on Labor Market in Latvia]|After entering the European Union (EU) Latvia faced new possibilities in international labor market. In 2004 several member states opened their labor markets to workers from Latvia. The largest amount of labor force went to Ireland, Great Britain and Sweden. In these countries salaries were substantially higher than in Latvia, which contributed to labor migration from Latvia. The migration process has a significant influence on the labor market in Latvia: on the one hand it reduced the amount of unemployed, but, on the other hand, it caused workforce deficit in certain professions, as well as substantially influenced the level of salaries in the whole economy. These processes will also influence the future development of Latvia; therefore the research of these issues is very topical for Latvia. It is also important internationally, because in other countries, especially in the new EU member states, similar processes take place, and it is possible to elaborate a common EU labor force migration model by consolidating migration data of particular member states. Common EU labor force migration model would also be suitable for developed EU member states, in order to estimate the incoming flow of labor force and its influence on the development of national economy. Aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of labor migration on the labor market in Latvia. In order to reach the aim, several tasks are set: to determine and to investigate the factors influencing labor market and labor migration; to consolidate influencing factors in a common system and to form labor market and labor migration system dynamic explanatory and forecasting model, based on it; to forecast the most important parameters of labor migration and labor market in Latvia. This paper shows system dynamic model of labor market and labor migration in Latvia. The hypothesis of the research is: labor migration is determined primarily by the payment level in the countries under consideration and the indicator derived from it – payment differences in the countries compared; as well as employment level, unemployment level, number of work places (market capacity) and number of vacant work places. Secondary factors influencing migration may be costs connected with labor migration, formal legal barriers to migration and personal propensity to migrate. Statistics on the labor market in Latvia are not complete; there is also no common view of experts on determinant processes. In such circumstances market forecasting with quantitative methods is problematic. One approach is to simulate indicators and to estimate their influence on national economy. The model has three parts: growth (expansion) of labor force, division and migration sub models. The sub model for growth of labor force is based on division of population in various categories during transition to a working age population. Division by level of education is further used in labor market analysis in which worker groups are formed according to the education level. The paper represents mutual interaction of groups of workers as well as labor migration. The results show sensitivity of the model factors to propensity of personnel for labor migration. The elaborated model and the results represented in this paper show that separate processes in national economy such as employment, unemployment and wages can be connected not with economic situation, but with the equalization processes in the EU. Under these circumstances it could be inefficient to fight with the increase of wages in Latvia, also to decrease wages, because in the long-term it can cause more severe problems in the development of national economy.
J60|L’economia italiana e la crisi globale: crescita, disoccupazione e debito pubblico<BR>[The Italian economy and the global crisis: growth,unemployment and public debt]|The paper analyzes the problems of low growth, unemployment, especially youth unemployment, and high public debt afflicting the Italian economy even before the global financial crisis. These problems certainly have worsened as a result of the crisis itself. The aim of the present work is to formulate some economic policy proposals to try to overcome this difficult situation of crisis where the Italian economy now stands.
J60|The Effects of Rural Electrification on Employment: New Evidence from South Africa| This paper estimates the impact of electrification on employment growth by analyzing South Africa's mass roll-out of electricity to rural households. Using several new data sources and two different identification strategies (an instrumental variables strategy and a fixed effects approach), I find that electrification significantly raises female employment within five years. This new infrastructure appears to increase hours of work for men and women, while reducing female wages and increasing male earnings. Several pieces of evidence suggest that household electrification raises employment by releasing women from home production and enabling microenterprises. Migration behavior may also be affected.

J60|Macroeconomic Evolution in Romania’s Development Regions within the Current Economic- Financial Crisis|Development disparities between regions and within Romania have existed both in the period before Romania joined the European Union and after January 1, 2007. This phenomenon has gained momentum because of the impact of economic restructuring, particularly in mono-industrial areas, whose population has been affected by unemployment due to closure of unprofitable state enterprises. Financial crisis and economic impact of accession on growth in the eight development regions of Romania in 2007 produced no changes in their rankings as the index of regional disparity, even though for some, its value has increased from 2006. This paper presents a comparative analysis of developments in macroeconomic indicators in developing regions of Romania.
J60|Efecto del ciclo económico en la incidencia de la informalidad Evidencia para México, 1987-1999|Con datos de la Encuesta Nacional de Empleo Urbano se calculan aproximaciones a las probabilidades de transición entre distintos estados laborales en México para el periodo 1987-1999 a través de cadenas de Markov. Se encuentra que los niveles de informalidad están vinculados al ciclo económico. La subcontratación informal se ha convertido en una alternativa creciente de empleo siendo utilizada como refugio anticrisis. Además, mucha de la microempresarialidad informal podría ser considerada desempleo disfrazado siguiendo una visión dualista; no obstante un pequeño subconjunto de aquellos, tiene un comportamiento inverso, desarrollando empresarialidad de forma voluntaria y afín con la visión legalista. Es posible que este grupo sea el que tenga mayor potencialidad de formalización.
J60|The Strategic Use of Temporary Agency Work – Functional Change of a Non-standard Form of Employment|Using data from the German case, the paper examines a new form of client firms’ utilization of temporary agency work that is distinctly different from traditional forms responding to production problems. Client firms, particularly from manufacturing, increasingly use temporary agency workers as a quasi-permanent component of their workforce. Management’s primary aim is to establish a “security net” for the short-term-profits by bypassing German statutory dismissal protection. However, since client firms’ regular employees and the temporary agency workers tend to perform the same tasks, a secondary effect of the strategic use of temporary agency work can be observed: the disciplinary effects associated with precarious work are tangibly amplified and expanded.
J60|Warum Vaeter ihre Erwerbstaetigkeit (nicht) unterbrechen. Mikrooekonomische versus in der Persoenlichkeit des Vaters begruendete Determinanten der Inanspruchnahme von Elternzeit durch Vaeter (Why Fathers (Don’t) Take Parental Leave. Microeconomic vs. Personality Based Determinants)|Der Beitrag untersucht die Determinanten der Inanspruchnahme von Elternzeit durch Vaeter in Deutschland. Zwar stieg der Anteil der Vaeter in Elternzeit seit der Elterngeldreform im Jahr 2007 kontinuierlich an, doch stellen Vaeter immer noch die Minderheit der Elternzeit-Beansprucher. Im theoretischen Teil des Beitrags werden mikrooekonomische und an der Persoenlichkeit des Vaters anknuepfende Determinanten fuer und wider die Inanspruchnahme der Elternzeit durch Vaeter einander gegenuebergestellt. Die empirische UEberpruefung der Hypothesen erfolgt anhand eines originaeren Datensatzes, welcher im Rahmen einer Online-Befragung unter berufstaetigen Vaetern in Deutschland, deren Kind(er) nach dem 01.01.2001 geboren wurde(n), erhoben wurde. Die Stichprobe umfasst 1.290 Vaeter, von denen 484 Elternzeiterfahrung haben. Eine logistische Regressionsanalyse mit der abhaengigen Variable „Inanspruchnahme von Elternzeit durch den Vater: ja – nein“ zeigt, dass die Entscheidung des Vaters staerker von oekonomischen Determinanten bestimmt wird als von seiner Persoenlichkeit. Ein weiterer bedeutsamer Faktor ist das Geschlechterrollenverstaendnis des Vaters. (This paper explores the determinants of a father’s decision to take parental leave. While the number of fathers in Germany taking parental leave has substantially increased since the recent reform in 2007, fathers still represent the minority when it comes to the total number of parental leave takers. From a theoretical perspective we distinguish microeconomic and personality based determinants of a father’s decision to take parental leave. Our empirical analysis is based on an original data set collected in an online survey of working fathers in Germany with children born after January 1st, 2001. Our sample contains 1,290 fathers, 484 of whom have taken parental leave. The econometric analysis reveals that a father’s decision to take parental leave is more strongly influenced by economic determinants than by the father’s personality. Furthermore, the father’s perception of gender roles is of significant importance.)
J60|Involuntary unemployment and the business cycle|We propose a monetary model in which the unemployed satisfy the official US definition of unemployment: they are people without jobs who are (i) currently making concrete efforts to find work and (ii) willing and able to work. In addition, our model has the property that people searching for jobs are better off if they find a job than if they do not (i.e., unemployment is ‘involuntary’). We integrate our model of involuntary unemployment into the simple New Keynesian framework with no capital and use the resulting model to discuss the concept of the ‘non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment’. We then integrate the model into a medium sized DSGE model with capital and show that the resulting model does as well as existing models at accounting for the response of standard macroeconomic variables to monetary policy shocks and two technology shocks. In addition, the model does well at accounting for the response of the labor force and unemployment rate to the three shocks. JEL Classification: E2, E3, E5, J2, J6
J60|Competitive On-the-job Search|The paper proposes a model of on-the-job search and industry dynamics in which search is directed. Firms permanently differ in productivity levels, their production function features constant returns to scale, and search costs are convex in search intensity. Wages are determined in a competitive manner, as firms advertise wage contracts (expected discounted incomes) so as to balance wage costs and search costs (queue length). Firms are assumed to sort out their coordination problems with their employees in such a way that the on-the-job search behavior of workers maximizes the match surplus. Our model has several novel features. First, it is close in spirit to the competitive model, with a tractable and unique equilibrium, and is therefore useful for empirical testing. Second, on-the-job search is an efficient response to firm heterogeneities and convex search costs. Third, the equilibrium leans towards a job ladder, where unemployed workers apply to low-productivity firms offering low wages, and then gradually move on to more productive, higher-paying firms. With a continuum of firm types, the job ladder is strict, in the sense that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the productivity of the current employer and that of the firms she searches for. The paper also contributes methodologically, as the existence proof requires a version of Schauder's fixed point theorem that is not commonly used by economists. Finally, our model offers different implications for the dynamics of job-to-job transitions than existing models of random search. (Copyright: Elsevier)
J60|Overeducation and job mobility: Evidence from young recent graduates in Catalonia|This paper focuses on how job mobility affects the likelihood of over-education among recent higher education graduates in Catalonia at the early stage of their working life. To this end, we use cross-sectional survey data provided by the Quality Assurance Agency for the University System in Catalonia (AQU), covering all those individuals who graduated in the 1997-1998 academic year from one of the seven public Catalan universities. The results show that job mobility, measured as the number of jobs held by the individual, increases the likelihood of over-education. However, the incidence of over-education falls in relation to the proportion of permanent contracts prior to the current employment. Finally, we find that the effects of job mobility on over-education hold for both male and female graduates.
J60|Inter- and intraindustrial Job-to-Job Flows. A Linkage Analysis of Regional Vacancy Chains in Austria|Nine Austrian NUTS 2 inter- and intraindustrial job-to-job worker flows for 33 indus- tries are analysed by means of input-output techniques, with these job-to-job flows being an intermediate input in the production of filled vacancies. A new dataset on individual labour market episodes allows for the tracing of individual careers. A linkage analysis of the Leontief multiplier shows that business services, wholesale&retail and the metal- industry are 'key' industries in for- and backwarding employment, whereas construction and tourism exert an impact on other regional industries by absorbing workers upon aggregate external shocks. These findings can be incorporated in industrial employment forecasts or utilized in regional labour market impact studies.
J60|The Evolution Of Romanian Demographic Phenomena In Terms Of Globalization|Globalisation and demography are the main forces modelling the development of societies at large and of each nation in particular.The paper aims to identify and synthetically present some factors of influence which triggered by the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century a series of characteristics defining the changes of the demographic model and structure of population on age brackets.The paper presents the results obtained by using the Markov-type model, for studying the development of demographic indicators in Romania, and their forecasting as well.
J60|Reginal Mismatch Tendencies In Romania-Evidence From Beveridge Curve|As a benefit of the recent data improvement regarding the data on job vacancies (by ISCO-88 groups and by CANE Rev.1 section) in Romania provides an opportunity for the examination on short term shifts (between 2005-2008) of the labour markets at NUTS 1 (4 Macroregions) and NUTS 2 (8 development regions) by using the Beveridge curve. In such literature it is noted that “the Beveridge curve depicts the empirical relationship between job vacancies and unemployment, which in turn reflects the underlying efficiency of the job matching process.” (Robert G. Valletta.) Such a regional mismatch can occur as a consequence of uneven regional employment growth or in other words when unemployment with job vacancies, coexists, including the localisation of paring of the unemployment rate and vacancies rate, there could be the beginning of a spatial analysis.
J60|Centralized wage setting and labor market policies: the nordic model case|It is often argued that rigid labour market and centralized bargaining are harmful employment and growth. This paper looks at the case of Nordic countries as a counter-example pointing to some weaknesses of this view. Rigid labour markets, while reducing the offer of low quality jobs, increase average labor productivity by favoring job relocation in high quality jobs. Moene and Wallerstein (1997) adopted a vintage-capital model to compare centralized and decentralized bargaining: they show that centralized bargaining systems yield higher labor productivity and higher structural unemployment. By introducing a frictional labor market in the vintage-capital framework , we show that the negative effects on employment characterizing centralized bargaining can be reduced by adopting active labor market policy.
J60|It’s wages, it’s hours, it’s the Italian wage curve|Using data from the Bank of Italy’s Household Survey we find that a wage curve exists in Italy after the 1992-93 wage reforms for annual and monthly wages but not for hourly wages. Consistently, after the reforms we find a negative elasticity of annual hours and months worked with respect to the unemployment rate.
J60|The State of Knowledge on the Role and Impact of Labour Market Information: A Survey of the Canadian Evidence|This report provides a critical assessment of recent Canadian efforts to measure and evaluate the impacts of labour market information (LMI). The purpose of this exercise is to provide a summary of the current state of knowledge on the role and impact of LMI in Canada, to assess the contribution of recent research to that knowledge, and to outline areas in which further research is required. The report finds that we know very little about the impact of LMI per se on labour market outcomes. The Canadian LMI literature does demonstrate that employers and individuals consider LMI to be useful in decision-making, and that LMI and LMI-related programs can have a positive impact on individuals' labour market knowledge and career decision-making.
J60|The State of Knowledge on the Role and Impact of Labour Market Information: A Survey of the International Evidence|This report provides a critical examination of the international literature on the role and impact of labour market information (LMI). The purpose of this exercise is to assess the current state of knowledge on the role and impact of LMI and to identify gaps in our knowledge. The report finds that we know very little about the impact of LMI per se on labour market outcomes. What knowledge we do possess must be inferred from evaluations of labour market programs or technologies that are related to LMI, such as job-search assistance programs, career counseling, and internet-based LMI. The literature on each of these topics reveals some beneficial impacts on labour market outcomes, but the precise role of LMI in driving these relationships is never specified.

Para tal sugerimos um modelo de estudo e uma outra visão sobre a tipologia dos dispositivos.
J60|The Cyclical Volatility of Labor Markets under Frictional Financial Markets|We provide a dynamic extension of an economy with search on credit and labor markets (Wasmer and Weil 2004). Financial frictions create volatility. They add an additional, almost acyclical, entry cost to procyclical job creation costs, thus increasing the elasticity of labor market tightness to productivity shocks by a factor of five to eight, compared to a matching economy with perfect financial markets. We characterize a dynamic financial multiplier that is increasing in total financial costs and minimized under a credit market Hosios- Pissarides rule. Financial frictions are an element of the solution to the volatility puzzle. (JEL C78, E24, E32, E44, G21, J63)
J60|The added worker effect and the discouraged worker effect for married women in Australia|This paper investigates both the added worker effect (the labour supply responses of women to their partners’ job losses) and the discouraged worker effect (workers withdrawing from the labour market because of failed searches) for married women in Australia, with the emphasis on the former. We focus on the partners’ involuntary job loss experiences, and analyse women’s labour market activities in the periods before and after their partners’ job loss.
J60|Differences in Labor Supply to Monopsonistic Firms and the Gender Pay Gap: An Empirical Analysis Using Linked Employer-Employee Data from Germany| This article investigates women's and men's labor supply to the firm within a semistructural approach based on a dynamic model of new monopsony. Using methods of survival analysis and a large linked employer-employee data set for Germany, we find that labor supply elasticities are small (1.9-3.7) and that women's labor supply to the firm is less elastic than men's (which is the reverse of gender differences in labor supply usually found at the level of the market). Our results imply that at least one-third of the gender pay gap might be wage discrimination by profit-maximizing monopsonistic employers. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago.
J60|IHRM and Effective Global Staffing Systems in the Iranian Context|“The creation of global HR systems remains a real challenge for organizations fighting to stay competitive in a globalized marketplace” (Wiechmann & et al, 2003, p.71). In addressing this ongoing “challenge,” in this paper we first examine important global staffing issues and the practices that should be implemented to create a successful international global staffing strategy. Second, we paint a picture of the economic and labor conditions of Iran within a broader global marketplace. Finally, we specifically review Iranian HR managers' challenges in staffing, as well as identify the core and unique competencies necessary for carrying out effective Iranian domestic and international staffing strategies within an increasingly globalized economy.
J60|Low-wage careers: are there dead-end firms and dead-end jobs?|Using representative linked employer-employee data of the German Federal Employment Agency, this paper shows that just one out of seven full-time employees who earned low wages (i.e. less than two-thirds of the median wage) in 1998/99 was able to earn wages above the low-wage threshold in 2003. Bivariate probit estimations with endogenous selection indicate that upward wage mobility is higher for younger and better qualified low-wage earners, whereas women are substantially less successful. We show that the characteristics of the employing firm also matter for low-wage earners' probability of escaping low-paid work. In particular small plants and plants with a high share of low-wage earners often seem to be dead ends for low-wage earners. The likelihood of leaving the low-wage sector is also low when staying in unskilled and skilled service occupations and in unskilled commercial and administrational occupations. Consequently, leaving these dead-end plants and occupations appears to be an important instrument for achieving wages above the low-wage threshold.
J60|On-the-job search in italian labour markets: an empirical analysis|This paper analyses the determinants of on-the-job search activities of Italian workers. Using several waves of the Bank of Italy Survey on Household Income and Wealth (SHIW) we estimate with a Probit model how individual socio-demographic characteristics and economic variables affect the probability of on-the-job search. We find that the probability of being engaged in job-search activities is higher for low-wage earners, for workers with low tenure and higher levels of education, for males and for residents in large cities. Moreover, we find significant differences in the determinants of on-the-job search activities across sectors. Public sector employees show a considerable lower probability of on-the-job search compared to private sector workers; White-collars and teachers search much less than blue-collars (both in private and public sectors). Results suggest that the attractiveness of jobs varies considerably, even controlling for wage levels and that notwithstanding the high degree of centralization Italian markets are reactive to job-search determinants.
J60|Accesibilidad al régimen contributivo de salud en Colombia: caso de la población rural migrante|El objetivo de este documento es analizar los determinantes que influyeron en la probabilidad de que la población migrante rural colombiana accediera al régimen contributivo de salud en el año 2006. Para ello, se estimó un modelo logit y se emplearon datos de la Encuesta Continua de Hogares aplicada por el Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística (DANE). En el modelo se incluyeron regresores tales como: sexo, edad, estado civil, jefe de hogar, educación, educación del jefe y razón de la migración. Todas las variables incluidas en el modelo resultaron ser significativas. De acuerdo con los resultados, tener más años de educación aprobados, ser hombre, y estar casado o en unión libre genera un efecto positivo sobre la probabilidad de estar afiliado al régimen de salud contributivo. Por otro lado, un incremento en la edad, ser jefe de hogar o haber migrado por razones involuntarias afecta negativamente la probabilidad de que los migrantes de la zona rural accedan al régimen contributivo.
J60|Will without War?|While congress debates the merits of a stimulus package of around 900 hundred billion dollars, a historical approach to the current situation suggests that the stimulus packages currently being discussed are actually far less generous than may be needed. The Congressional Budget Office projects that we are in “a recession that will probably be the longest and the deepest since World War II.” It is often suggested that the massive spending necessitated by the nation’s involvement in World War II helped end the Great Depression. Without a comparably ambitious unifying cause, however, I am afraid that the spending required to pull us out of a decline will be considered politically unpalatable, leading to an inadequate response to the crisis. An examination of spending patterns during the nineteen-­‐thirties and nineteen-­‐forties and their application to the current scenario suggest the true extent of the stimulus that may be needed.
J60|University-Educated Specialists, the Demand for Them and Their Standing on the Czech Labour Market|"The paper deals with one of the biggest problems currently faced by the Czech labour market: namely, a shortage of labour with regard to specialists who have completed tertiary education. The introduction stresses the importance of knowledge capital both in contemporary society and in a knowledge-based economy. The need for universityeducated labour on the Czech labour market was ascertained from the results of a Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs grant project entitled ""Risk of a Brain Drain in the Czech Republic"". The monitoring took place from the 2nd quarter of 2004 to the 2nd quarter of 2008. The results are based on an analysis of quantitative data (classified advertisements for job vacancies on web portals and in the media and statistics on vacancies provided by labour offices) and repeated qualitative surveys (standardised interviews with recruitment agency personnel). Based on these sources, a shortage of specialists with tertiary education in the Czech Republic was identified in terms of sectoral and professional structure and specialisation. The paper goes on to present university-educated workers as subjects of international competition and the reader is briefly introduced to the approaches of different countries to attracting specialists from abroad."
J60|Aging Nations And The Future Of Cities|ABSTRACT We investigate whether an aging population may challenge the supremacy of large working cities. To this end, we develop an economic geography model with two types of individuals (workers and retirees) and two sectors (local services and manufacturing). Workers produce and consume; the elderly consume only. As a result, the mobility decision of workers is driven by both the wage gap and the cost‐of‐living gap, unlike the elderly who react to the differences in the cost of living only. We show that the return of pre‐industrial urban system dominated by rentier cities does not seem to be on the agenda. Quite the opposite, the future of large working cities is still bright, the reason being that today's urban costs act as a strong force that prevents a large share of local services and manufacturing firms from following the rentiers in the elderly cities, while the supply of differentiated b2c services impede their complete separation.
J60|Have European Unemployment Rates Converged?|Using di¤erent unit root statistics and the approach of Tomljanovich and Vogelsang (2002), we test for the existence of stochastic and beta-convergence in the unemployment rates of a set of thirteen European countries. Using quarterly data for the period 1984:1-2005:4, we observe that there has taken place a convergence process in the majority of European unemployment rates. This process has become more intense since 1993.
J60|Discrimination And Employment Protection| We study a search model with employment protection legislation. We show that if the output from the match is uncertain at the hiring stage, a discriminatory equilibrium may exist in which workers with the same productive characteristics are subject to different hiring standards. If a bad match takes place, discriminated workers will take longer to find another job, prolonging the costly period for the firm. This makes it less profitable for firms to hire discriminated workers, thus sustaining the discrimination. In contrast to Becker's model, the existence of employers with a taste for discrimination may make it more profitable to discriminate, even for firms without discriminatory preferences.
J60|Identifying Sorting--In Theory| Assortative matching between workers and firms provides evidence of the complementarities or substitutes in production. The presence of complementarities is important for policies that aim to achieve the optimal allocation of resources, e.g. unemployment insurance. We argue that using wage data alone, it is virtually impossible to identify whether assortative matching is positive or negative. Even though we cannot identify the sign of the sorting, we can identify the strength, i.e. the magnitude of the cross-partial and the associated welfare loss. We first show that the wage for a given worker is non-monotonic in the type of his employer. This is due to the fact that in a sorting model, wages reflect the opportunity cost of mismatch. We analytically show that this non-monotonicity prevents standard firm fixed effects to correlate with the true type of the firm. We then propose an alternative procedure that measures the strength of sorting in the presence of search frictions. Knowing the strength of sorting facilitates the measurement of the output loss due to mismatch. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.
J60|Duración del desempleo y canales de búsqueda de empleo en Colombia|This paper studies the duration of unemployment in Colombia as an indicator of the effectivity of search methods. This work is based on the Continuing Survey of Households (ECH), carried out in Colombia in the second quarter of 2006. Parametric (Weibull proportional risk) and nonparametric (Kaplan-Meier) duration models are estimated. The findings suggest that the duration of unemployment is strongly influenced by the search methods used by employees and the unemployed. Formal methods are the most effective.
J60|Työmarkkinoiden kehityksen kokonaistaloudellinen tausta ja lähivuosien sopeutuminen|Tässä raportissa käsitellään aluksi kahta Suomen taloutta ja työmarkkinoita kohtaavaa tekijää, jotka ovat peräisin kansainvälisestä taloudesta : globalisaatiokehitystä ja kansainvälistä talouskriisiä. Tutkimme niiden vaikutusta Suomen talouteen käyttäen työmarkkinoiden kokonaismalleja. Globalisaatiokehitys johtaa sekä positiivisiin että negatiivisiin vaikutuksiin työmarkkinoilla, joihin on kyettävä sopeutumaan. Ajankohtainen talouskriisi vaatii työmarkkinoilta huomattavaa sopeutumista, mutta laman jälkeen on mahdollista palata alenevan työttömyyden uralle, jos sopeutumiskyky on hyvä ja sopeutuminen aloitetaan pian. Tuottavuuden näköaloissa kiinnitetään huomio sen todennäköiseen hidastumiseen jatkossa. Palkanmuodostuksen ja verotuksen yhteydestä voidaan todeta verotuksen tarjoavan keinoja saavuttaa parempi tasapaino taloudessa ja työmarkkinoilla.

J60|Monetary and Implicit Incentives of Patent Examiners|Patent examiners, who are often accused of granting questionable patents, might lack proper incentives to carefully scrutinize applications. Furthermore, they have outside options and leave the patent office. It is thus interesting to investigate whether their granting behavior is affected by career concerns. In a simple setting, we analyze different incentive schemes that reward examiners on the basis of rejected and/or accepted patents. We then study the effect of career concerns on the granting behavior of examiners. We find that a reward based on rejection gives more incentives to search for relevant information, and career concerns increase these incentives. Besides, the information provided by the applicant has an impact on the examiners incentive to search for information.
J60|The unemployment challenge : Labour market policies for the recession|Over the next year another 50,000 people will become unemployed. The number of unemployed will surpass that of the last recession of 1997-98. To address the unemployment challenge New Zealand needs to supplement existing job search assistance with investment in training and business capital to push long term productivity growth. Subsidies to prop up jobs and firms should be avoided.
J60|Cox Regression Models for Unemployment Duration in Romania, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, and Macedonia|This paper applies the semi-parametric Cox regression approach to model unemployment duration in five Central and Eastern European countries. The Cox proportional hazards models and the Cox regression models with a time-dependent covariate are developed, and the results are interpreted and compared. The impact of the variables age, gender, education level, and region on the hazard ratio is discussed. The results for the time-dependent variable age imply that the longer the unemployment spell lasts, the less pronounced the differences between various age groups are.
J60|Centralized Wage Determination and Regional Unemployment Differences: The Case of Italy|This paper addresses the problem of the dualism of the Italian economy, particularly of its labor market. Although the Italian labor market is considered to be the most highly regulated among OECD countries, the unemployment rate in the North, which represents two thirds of the whole economy, is one of the lowest in Europe. In contrast, the South faces an unemployment rate between two to five times higher than the North. GDP per capita is also twice in the North than in the South, while nominal wages do not differ substantially across regions. Finally internal migration is the lowest among European countries since the middle seventies. This paper argues that the uniform wage is the result of the centralized wage setting carried on by unions, and that the absence of migration is the result of the proactive role of the government, which in the seventies stopped the mass internal migration from the South to the North and since then is acting to prevent the reappearance of such phenomenon. Uniform wage across regions, the active role of the government to prevent internal mass migration and a structural productivity divide between North and South are the institutional features that, within a general equilibrium matching model, explain the high unemployment rate in the South and, perhaps more interestingly, the low unemployment rate accompanied by low wages in the North even when compared to other western European countries.
J60|Best Practices In Labour Market Information: Reccomendations for Canada's LMI System|The objective of this report for the LMI High-Level Advisory Panel is to provide advice on best practices in LMI and policy suggestions to improve the Canadian LMI system. Based on a thorough analysis, it presents 20 recommendations to improve the operation of LMI in Canada in the areas of LMI data, LMI analysis and forecasting, and LMI dissemination. For these recommendations to have traction, two conditions are needed. First, it is crucial that senior policy makers, that is those at the Deputy Minister and Ministerial level, recognize the important on an effective LMI system for a high-performance economy. Second, it is extremely important that jurisdictional issues do not become a barrier to the provision of high-quality LMI to the public.

J60|The dynamics of job creation and destruction for university graduates: why a rising unemployment rate can be misleading| A large matched employer-employee data set on the Portuguese economy is used to analyse gross job creation and job destruction for university graduates, compared to other groups of workers. Standard measures of gross job flows are computed, and variance decomposition is used to check whether idiosyncratic shocks or aggregate and sectoral shocks can account for the time variation in gross job flows, for schooling groups separately. Results indicate that the market for university graduates has expanded much more than that for undergraduates, and that idiosyncratic shocks are more relevant driving job flows for university graduates than for nongraduates. No support is therefore found for the pessimistic view that states that the expansion of higher education may have gone too far.
J60|Unemployment and Firm Entry and Exit: An Update on a Controversial Relationship| Santarelli E., Carree M. and Verheul I. Unemployment and firm entry and exit: an update on a controversial relationship, Regional Studies. The present study explores the relationship between unemployment and subsequent firm entry and exit for 103 Italian provinces for the period 1997-2003. Two models are estimated. The first model concentrates on unemployed individuals starting or closing a business in the province in which they live. The second model incorporate cross-border effects by taking into account possible start-ups by unemployed individuals from adjacent provinces. Findings show that a positive effect of unemployment on net entry is not due to a positive 'push' effect on entry, but rather to a negative effect of unemployment on firm exit. This indicates a lack of dynamics in the Italian labour market. [image omitted] Santarelli E., Carree M. et Verheul I. Le chomage et l'entree et la sortie des entreprises: une mise a jour d'un rapport controverse, Regional Studies. La presente etude cherche a examiner le rapport entre le chomage et l'entree et la sortie ulterieures des entreprises pour 103 provinces italiennes pendant la periode allant de 1997 jusqu'a 2003. On estime deux modeles. Quant au premier modele, on se concentre sur les chomeurs qui creent ou qui ferment une entreprise dans la province ou ils habitent. Pour ce qui est du deuxieme modele, on y inclut des effets transfrontaliers, en tenant compte des creations d'entreprise eventuelles par les chomeurs qui habitent les provinces limitrophes. Il s'avere que l'effet positif du chomage sur l'entree nette ne s'explique pas par un effet 'moteur' positif au moment de l'entree mais plutot par l'effet negatif du chomage sur la sortie des entreprises. Ceci indique un manque de dynamique sur le marche du travail italien. Chomage Entree et sortie des entreprises Provinces italiennes Santarelli E., Carree M. und Verheul I. Arbeitslosigkeit und Betriebsgrundungen bzw.-schliessungen: aktuelle Informationen zu einer kontroversen Beziehung, Regional Studies. In dieser Studie wird die Beziehung zwischen Arbeitslosigkeit und anschliessenden Betriebsgrundungen bzw.-schliessungen in 103 italienischen Provinzen im Zeitraum von 1997 bis 2003 untersucht. Wir stellen Schatzungen anhand von zwei Modellen auf. Im ersten Modell konzentrieren wir uns auf arbeitslose Einzelpersonen, die in der Provinz, in der sie leben, einen Betrieb grunden oder schliessen. Im zweiten Modell integrieren wir grenzubergreifende Auswirkungen, indem wir mogliche Neugrundungen durch arbeitslose Einzelpersonen aus angrenzenden Provinzen berucksichtigen. Aus den Ergebnissen geht hervor, dass eine positive Auswirkung der Arbeitslosigkeit auf die Nettozahl der Firmengrundungen nicht auf einen positiven 'Push'-Effekt auf die Betriebsgrundungen zuruckzufuhren ist, sondern vielmehr auf einen negativen Effekt der Arbeitslosigkeit auf die Betriebsschliessungen. Dies weist auf eine mangelnde Dynamik des italienischen Arbeitsmarkts hin. Arbeitslosigkeit Betriebsgrundungen und -schliessungen Italienische Provinzen Santarelli E., Carree M. y Verheul I. Desempleo y entrada y salida de empresas: actualizacion de una relacion controvertida, Regional Studies. En el presente estudio analizamos la relacion entre el desempleo y la posterior entrada y salida de empresas para 103 provincias italianas durante el periodo de 1997 a 2003. Evaluamos dos modelos. En el primer modelo nos centramos en personas desempleadas, que empiezan o cierran un negocio en la provincia en la que viven. En el segundo modelo incorporamos los efectos transfronterizos teniendo en cuenta posibles empresas emergentes por parte de personas en paro de provincias adyacentes. Los resultados indican que un efecto positivo del desempleo en la entrada neta no se debe a un efecto positivo de 'empuje' sino a un efecto negativo del desempleo al cerrar las empresas. Esto indica una falta de dinamica en el mercado laboral italiano. Desempleo Entrada y salida de empresas Provincias italianas
J60|Economic Change and Worker Displacement in Canada: Consequences and Policy Responses|Change is an enduring feature of the economy and the labour market, even in normal times. The importance of adjusting to change, and of policies that promote adjustment, has been a recurring theme throughout David Dodgeâ€™s distinguished career. This paper deals with â€œdisplaced workers,â€ those who permanently lose their jobs because of changing economic circumstances. I examine what we know about displacement and its consequences, and assess policies designed to assist workers adversely affected by economic change. A central finding of research on displacement is that long tenure displaced workers -- those who have held their jobs for an extended period of time -- suffer much more from losing their jobs than do others. Canadaâ€™s Employment Insurance does not take into account this salient feature of the consequences of job loss. The paper discusses ways of addressing this deficiency in our primary social insurance program for job losers.
J60|The ins and outs of unemployment: An analysis conditional on technology shocks|We analyze how unemployment, job finding and job separation rates react to neutral and investment-specific technology shocks. Neutral shocks increase unemployment and explain a substantial portion of it volatility; investment-specific shocks expand employment and hours worked and contribute to hours worked volatility. Movements in the job separation rates are responsible for the impact response of unemployment while job finding rates for movements along its adjustment path. The evidence warns against using models with exogenous separation rates and challenges the conventional way of modelling technology shocks in search and sticky price models.
J60|Unemployment and Worker-Firm Matching Theory and Evidence from East and West Europe|The paper tests three hypotheses about the causes of unemployment in the Central-East European transition economies and in a benchmark market economy (Western part of Germany). The first hypothesis (H1) is that unemployment is caused by inefficient matching. Hypothesis 2 (H2) is that unemployment is caused by low demand. Hypothesis 3 (H3) is that restructuring is at work. Our estimates suggest that the west and east German parts of Germany, Czech Republic and Slovakia are consistent with H2 and H3. Hungary provides limited support to all three hypotheses. Poland is consistent with H1. The economies in question hence contain one broad group of countries and one or two special cases. The group comprises the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovak Republic and (possibly) East Germany. These countries resemble West Germany in that they display increasing returns to scale in matching and unemployment appears to be driven by restructuring and low demand. The East German case is complex because of its major active labor market policies and a negative trend in efficiency in matching. In some sense, East Germany resembles more Poland, which in addition to restructuring and low demand for labor appears to suffer from a structural mismatch reflected in relatively low returns to scale in matching. Finally, our data provide evidence that goes counter to one of the main predictions of the theories of transition, namely that the turnover (inflow) rate in the transition countries would rise dramatically at the start of the transition, be temporarily very high and gradually decline and approach the level observed in otherwise similar market economies such as West Germany.
J60|The Importance of Labour Mobility for Spillovers across Industries|This paper addresses the link between productivity and labour mobility. The hypothesis tested in the paper is that technology is transmitted across industries through the movement of skilled workers embodying human capital. The embodied knowledge is then diffused within the new environment creating spillovers and leading to productivity improvements. A theoretical framework is presented wherein productivity growth is modelled through knowledge acquisition with respect to labour mobility. The empirical estimates confirm the existence of positive cross-sectoral knowledge spillovers and indicate that labour mobility has beneficial effects on industry productivity. Due to the fact that labour mobility is closely linked to input-output relations this finding provides evidence suggesting that part of the estimated productivity effects of domestic rent spillovers are in fact due to knowledge spillovers resulting from labour mobility.
