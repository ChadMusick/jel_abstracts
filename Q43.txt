Q43|The asymmetric role of shadow economy in the energy-growth nexus in Bolivia|This paper estimates the energy demand function to examine the asymmetric relationship between the shadow economy and energy consumption in the case of Bolivia during the period of 1960–2015. The ambiguous empirical findings on shadow economy-energy demand nexus has inclined us to apply the nonlinear ARDL cointegration approach developed by Shin et al. (2014) and the Hatemi-J (2012) asymmetric causality test. The empirical evidence confirms the presence of an asymmetric relationship between the variables of interest. Positive and negative shocks to official GDP (true GDP) and the shadow economy have positive impacts on energy consumption. Energy consumption is positively and negatively affected by positive and negative shocks in financial development, respectively. A positive (negative) shock to capital decreases energy consumption. Another important finding concerns the complex causal direction between economic growth and energy consumption. This study provides new insights regarding to the use of official GDP (true GDP) and the shadow economy as economic tools to maintain energy demand for sustainable economic development.
Q43|Inflation target and (a)symmetries in the oil price pass-through to inflation|In this paper we employ state-space models to estimate the pass-through of oil price changes to consumer prices for a large sample of countries from 1970 to 2017. By controlling for self-selection bias and endogeneity and allowing for different responses to positive and negative price changes, we asses the differences between explicit inflation targeting (IT) countries and a control group. Surprisingly perhaps, our results suggest that the pass-through is higher for IT countries. Our main contribution is to show that these is mainly due to IT countries having a significant higher pass-through than non-IT countries when the oil price decreases: a 10% drop in oil price leads about a 0.11% drop in inflation in ITers (of which 4pp are explained by the monetary regime). Importantly, we show that adopting IT reduces the asymmetry of the pass-through. We run several robustness checks and conclude that falling oil prices are more welcomed by the central banks with an IT framework, in particular during deflationary episodes or when inflation is above the target.
Q43|Policies to Overcome Barriers for Renewable Energy Distributed Generation: A Case Study of Utility Structure and Regulatory Regimes in Michigan|Because of its environmental damage and now often being the most expensive source for electricity production, coal use is declining throughout the United States. Michigan has no active coal mining and seemingly supportive legislation for distributed generation (DG) and renewable energy (RE) technologies. However, Michigan still derives approximately half of its power production from large centralized coal plants, despite the availability of much lower cost RE DG technologies. To understand this conundrum, this study reviews how Michigan investor owned utilities utilize their political power to perpetuate utility structures that work toward the financial interests of the utilities rather than the best interests of the state’s electricity consumers, including other firms and residents. Background is provided covering the concept of DG, the cost savings associated with DG, and utility regulatory regimes at the national, regional, state, and local levels. Recent case studies from specific utility strategies are provided in order to illustrate how Michigan utilities manipulate regulatory regimes via policy misinterpretation to deter or hinder the proliferation of DG in favor of maintaining the existing interests in centralized, fossil fuel-based electrical energy production. The results of this study demonstrate how DG proliferation is hindered by Michigan regulated utilities via the exercise of political power within existing legal and regulatory regimes. This highlights the need to think about how utilities may interpret and implement rules when designing energy legislation and policy to maximize the benefits for consumers and society. Policy recommendations and alternate strategies are provided to help enhance the role of energy policy to improve rather than limit the utilization of RE DG.
Q43|New Evidence on the Relationship Between Crude Oil Consumption and Economic Growth in the US: A Quantile Causality and Cointegration Approach|Abstract This paper investigates the long-run and short-run relationship between WTI crude oil consumption and economic growth, covering the US economy for the period from 1955Q1 to 2016Q4. The Quantile ARDL approach developed by Cho et al. (2015) is applied to examine the long-run cointegrating relationship between the variables. Additionally, a quantile Granger causality test developed by Troster (2017) is also applied to examine the causal association between crude oil consumption and economic growth. The empirical evidence underscores the presence of nonlinearities and locational asymmetries. The growth hypothesis holds for the smallest quantiles, suggesting a unidirectional causality relationship running from oil consumption to economic growth. A feedback effect between oil consumption and economic growth is found for the medium quantiles. This empirical evidence has concrete implications for economists and energy policy makers.
Q43|Non-linear relationship between real commodity price volatility and real effective exchange rate: The case of commodity-exporting countries|The aim of this paper is to contribute to the existing literature by exploring the relationship between the real commodity price volatilities and the real effective exchange rate (REER) of commodity-exporting countries, taking into account the transition variable of financial market integration. To this end, we consider a sample of 42 commodity-exporting countries subdivided into 4 panels: food and beverages, energy, metals, and raw materials. Our results highlight that the relationship between real commodity price volatility and REER is non-linear and depends on the degree of financialization of the commodity market. Specifically, when a country is poorly integrated financially, the volatility of the real commodity price has a strong and negative impact on the variation in REER. However, for periods when a country is better integrated financially, we observe a decrease in the impact of real commodity price volatility on REER, especially for the two panels of food and beverages as well as energy. Our findings also highlight the growth of financialization of commodities post-2000, particularly in the case of the energy sector.
Q43|Transitory and Permanent Shocks in the Global Market for Crude Oil|This paper documents the determinants of real oil price in the global market based on SVAR model embedding transitory and permanent shocks on oil demand and supply as well as speculative disturbances. We find evidence of significant differences in the propagation mechanisms of transitory versus permanent shocks, pointing to the importance of disentangling their distinct effects. Permanent supply disruptions turn out to be a bigger factor in historical oil price movements during the most recent decades, while speculative shocks became less influential.
Q43|High Wages or Wages For Energy? An Alternative View of The British Case (1645-1700)|Energy was one of the keys to the remarkable increase in English GDP between 1650 and 1700. Increased per head physical activity and basal metabolic rate led to increased energy consumption. In response, subsistence wages, productivity, wages and incomes increased. Malthusian adjustment explains only 50 per cent of the increase in calorie intake, the other 50 per cent is associated with higher energy consumption. Non-agricultural wages began to differ from agricultural wages. British economic development occurred everywhere, in the city and in the countryside. This approach opens new perspectives to the debate between enclosures and open fields and why underemployment became common among the philosophers' British debates.
Q43|The Consequences of Uncertainty: Climate Sensitivity and Economic Sensitivity to the Climate|"We construct an integrated assessment model with multiple energy sources-two fossil fuels and “green energy"" - and use it to evaluate ranges of plausible estimates for the climate sensitivity as well as for the sensitivity of the economy to climate change. Rather than focusing on uncertainty explicitly, we look at extreme scenarios defined by the upper and lower limits given in available studies in the literature. We compare optimal policy with laissez faire and we point to the possible policy errors that could arise. By far the largest policy error arises when the climate policy is “overly passive""; “overly zealous"" climate policy (i.e., a high carbon tax applied when climate change and its negative on the economy are very limited) does not hurt the economy much as there is considerable substitutability between fossil and non-fossil energy sources."
Q43|How are oil supply shocks transmitted to the U.S. economy?|We investigate how oil supply shocks are transmitted to U.S. economic activity, consumer prices, and interest rates. Using a structural VAR approach with a combination of sign and zero restrictions, we distinguish between supply and demand channels in the transmission of exogenous changes in crude oil production. We nd that the adverse e ects of negative oil supply shocks are transmitted mainly through the demand side, as both output and interest rates react more strongly to oil supply shocks that shift the U.S. aggregate demand curve, while the supply side matters in transmitting oil supply shocks to consumer prices.
Q43|Financing a Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff with a Tax on Carbon Dioxide Emissions: A Dynamic Multi-Sector General Equilibrium Analysis for Portugal|Renewable energy production subsidies alleviate the pressure on electricity prices associated with carbon and energy pricing policies in the process of decarbonization and electrification of the Portuguese economy. Our simulation results show that a feed in tariffs financed by a carbon tax leads to adverse macroeconomic as well as adverse and regressive distributional welfare effects. On the flip side, however, we show that use of the carbon tax revenues to finance a feed in tariff is an improvement over the simple carbon tax case along all the relevant policy dimensions. The feed in tariff mechanism when added to the carbon tax leads to better environmental outcomes at lower costs both in terms of the economic and social justice implications. The policy implications are clear. First, because of its adverse economic and distributional effects a carbon tax should not be used in isolation. The use of the revenues to finance a feed in tariff dominates the simple carbon tax case in all dimensions. Second, the search for the appropriate recycling mechanisms in addition to feed in tariffs is an issue as relevant as the carbon tax itself as it pertains to the potential reversal of the adverse effects of such a tax.
Q43|Regulated Early Closures of Coal-Fired Power Plants and Tougher Energy Taxation on Electricity Production: Synergy or Rivalry?|This article examines the economic, budgetary, distributional and environmental impacts of the interaction between regulated early closure of coal-fired power plants and new energy taxation rules on fossil fuel-operated power plants using a multi-sector and multi-household dynamic general equilibrium model of the Portuguese economy. Simulation results show first that regulated early closures will lead to meaningful reductions in emissions. They will also induce significant detrimental macroeconomic and distributional effects. Second, when the new energy taxation rules are applied to the coal-operated power plants no significant environmental gains or macroeconomic or distributional losses are observed in addition to what already induced by the forced closures. Only the public sector seems to benefit in the form of additional tax revenues. A different situation occurs, however, if the operators of the coal-fired power plants react to the new energy taxes levied on them by unilaterally deciding to decommission their installations. In this case, although the environmental effects will improve, the adverse macroeconomic and distributional effects will substantially deteriorate. Noticeably, the adverse budgetary effects will also be substantially larger. Overall, we find no synergies between the two policies and, actually, the potential for the opposite to be true.
Q43|Picking Our Environmental Battles: Removal of Harmful Subsidies or Carbon Taxation?|In this paper, we compare the effects of removing harmful fossil fuel subsidies with the replacement of the energy taxation by a carbon tax in Portugal. Since energy taxes focus on the energy content of the different energy products eliminating these provisions only brings their prices in line with their energy content. On the other hand, replacing the energy tax system with a tax on the emissions content of the energy products aligns the fossil fuel prices with their emissions content. We show that while replacing the energy with a carbon tax is a policy of a magnitude about eight times as large as the removal of the harmful subsidies, the effects of emissions are twenty times larger and the adverse economic and distributional effects only about twice as large. Accordingly, replacing the energy tax with a carbon tax is a much more cost-effective way of reducing emissions. This may suggest that focusing on the removal of harmful fossil fuel subsidies may be an environmental red herring.
Q43|Financing Future Feed-in Tariffs from Currently Installed RES-E Generating Capacity|In this paper, we address the issue of how to finance the excess costs of electricity generation from currently installed renewable energy production capacity. We do so using a multi-sector and multi-household dynamic computable general equilibrium model of the Portuguese economy. We consider three issues: the effects of the existence of these excess-costs; the effects of annuitizing such costs; and, the effects of different financing mechanisms. Following the logic of the tariff deficit, we recommend the annuitizing of these excess costs. This strategy can be justified on distributional grounds. We also find that financing through carbon taxation is a better alternative than passing these excess costs through to electricity consumers in the form of higher future electricity prices. This is consistent with the idea that renewable electricity production is not an issue pertaining exclusively to the electricity market but rather a part of the national quest for decarbonization. Finally, we show that there is little reason from an environmental perspective to extend such preferential financing mechanisms to any future renewable capacity installation.
Q43|Economic growth, Environmental degradation and business cycles in Eswatini|This study investigates the impact of the business cycle on the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) for the Eswatini Kingdom over the period 1970 – 2014. To this end, we employ the nonlinear autoregressive distributive lag (NARDL) model to capture the long-run and short-run cointegration effects between economic activity and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over different phases of the business cycle. Our findings reveal that economic activity only degrades the environment during upswing of the economic cycle whilst this relationship is insignificant during downswing of the cycle. We specifically compute a value of $3.57 worth of output been gained at the cost of a metric unit of emissions during economic expansionary phases. Altogether, these results insinuate much needed government intervention in the market for emissions via environmental tax reforms (ETR) which should be designed with countercyclical bias towards upswing the business cycle.
Q43|A sectoral approach to the electricity-growth nexus in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa|This paper takes a sectoral, panel approach to investigating the electricity-growth nexus for the Eastern Cape province of South Africa between the period of 2003 and 2017. The empirical investigation was carried out using the Pooled Mean Group (PMG) panel estimators applied to an augmented dynamic growth model whilst the caulisty tests between electricity consumption and growth where performed using the Dumitrescu-Hurlin (2012) panel non-causality tests. The findings confirm the absence of significant long-run relationship between electricity and growth whilst finding a significant and positive effect over the short-run. Moreover, our causality tests provide strong evidence of causality running from electricity consumption to economic growth hence supporting the “growth hypothesis”. In a nutshell, our results not only demonstrate the importance of performing the electricity-growth analysis at provincial level as opposed to relying on national aggregated estimates but also provides important provincial-specific policy implications and recommendations.
Q43|Granger Predictability of Oil prices after the Great Recession|Real oil prices surged from 2009 through 2014, comparable to the 1970s oil shock period. Standard explanations based on monopoly markup fall short since ination remained low after 2009. This paper contributes strong evidence of Granger (1969) predictability of nominal factors to oil prices, using one adjustment to monetary aggregates. This adjustment is the subtraction from the monetary aggregates of the 2008-2009 Federal Reserve borrowing of reserves from other Central Banks (Swaps), made after US reserves turned negative. This adjustment is key in that Granger predictability from standard monetary aggregates is found only with the Swaps subtracted.
Q43|Power Industry Disruptors and Prospects of the Electricity Demand in the Greater Metro-Manila Area|The power industry is being severely disrupted globally and local industry stakeholders have every reason to be worried. The question is how stakeholder capital should henceforth be deployed to reduce the risk of stranded assets. This study is undertaken to assess the impact of power industry disruptors on the near-term prospect of the electricity demand in the most important submarket of the Philippine power market, the greater Metro-Manila area. The emphasis is on the impact of technology disruptors, especially of solar photovoltaic generation and storage, on top of and in conjunction with policy disruptors. Part One tackles firstly the risks to sustained economic and income growth which will, in turn, impact on the demand for electricity?the macro-economic risks, the global risks, and the policy risks; secondly the risks internal to the electricity industry itself?the technology disruptors especially coming from growing adoption of rooftop and mini-grid solar photovoltaic installations and battery storage. The challenge of solar distributed generation counsels a more sober outlook and a more inclusive portfolio diversification by centralized power generation capitalists. Part Two employs an error correction model to forecast the growth of aggregate and disaggregate (by customer types) demand in a distribution utility franchise, in this case, the Meralco franchise, over the next five years. This model can be adopted as benchmark and adapted by industry stakeholders especially other distribution utility franchises for their own forecasts which should inform the rate setting exercise between the distribution utilities and the regulator, the Energy Regulatory Commission.
Q43|Energy Efficiency and Directed Technical Change: Implications for Climate Change Mitigation|I build a quantitative model of economic growth that can be used to evaluate the impact of environmental policy interventions on final-use energy consumption, an important driver of carbon emissions. In the model, energy demand is driven by endogenous and directed technical change (DTC). Energy supply is subject to increasing extraction costs. Unlike existing DTC models, I consider the case where multiple technological characteristics are embodied in each capital good, a formulation conducive to studying final-use energy. The model is consistent with aggregate evidence on energy use, efficiency, and prices in the United States. I examine the impact of new energy taxes and compare the results to the standard Cobb-Douglas approach used in the environmental macroeconomics literature, which is not consistent with data. When examining a realistic and identical path of energy taxes in both models, the DTC model predicts 22% greater cumulative energy use over the next century. I also use the model to study the macroeconomic consequences of R & D subsidies for new energy efficient technologies. I find large rebound effects that undo short-term reductions in energy use.
Q43|The rebound effect and its representation in energy and climate models|In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art and common practice of energy and climate modeling vis-à-vis the rebound literature, in particular regarding how macroeconomic energy and climate models quantify and include energy and greenhouse gas rebound effects. First, we focus on rebound effects in models of costless energy efficiency improvement that hold other attributes constant (zero-cost breakthrough), and an energy efficiency policy that may be bundled with other product changes that affect energy use (policy-induced efficiency improvement) (Gillingham et al. 2015). Second, we examine macroeconomic studies focusing on energy efficiency both in industry and in private households. Third, we go through a general theoretical revision from micro- to macroeconomic levels (the aggregation level) to include a review of the so-called meso-level studies (focused on the analysis of the production side). From 118 recent studies along the aggregation level, out of which 25 compute rebound calculations, we find that the average energy rebound effect is 58% with a standard deviation of 58%, and when we include green house gas rebound calculations, the magnitude is of the order of 43% with a standard deviation of 55%. Finally, we argue that the rebound effect is a phenomenon that requires a sound understanding of the complex interactions from different dimensions (e.g. aggregation level, heterogeneity, climate, energy conservation and economic growth), and we provide some ideas and motivations for future research.
Q43|What drives total real unit energy costs globally? A novel LMDI decomposition approach|This paper presents a novel logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition framework that is tailor-made for unit cost indicators. It adds four new models to the existing LMDI model family. The main novelty of the new framework lies in the separation of quantity and price effects captured in unit cost indicators, while retaining the same desirable properties of traditional models. Four case studies apply the novel LMDI framework to the total real unit energy costs (total RUEC) indicator. Total RUEC represents the sum of direct energy costs (for energy products) and indirect energy costs (energy costs embedded in intermediate inputs and passed on along global value chains) as a fraction of value added. This yardstick allows for monitoring shifts in the burden of energy costs on industries. The first three case studies, based on the World Input-Output Database, cover the period between 1995 and 2009. For an up-to-date analysis, a fourth case study collects additional data for 2009-2016 from energy and economic statistics' institutions. Globally, up until 2009, rising costs for crude petroleum/natural gas and the rise of China in the global economy were the largest drivers of total RUEC. In general, increases of indirect energy costs were more substantial than were those of direct energy costs. The total RUEC of Chinese car manufacturers increased much more strongly than did that of American car manufacturers. After 2009 (until 2016), prices for crude petroleum/natural gas and value added generation were major decelerating factors of global direct RUEC, while increases in energy consumption had offsetting effects. This paper provides a suitable tool to scientists who want to build on unit cost indicators in their research in general and to all policy-oriented institutions concerned with monitoring and analysing the energy transition in particular.
Q43|Technological change, energy, environment and economic growth in Japan|A considerable amount of research has shown that that carbon tax combined with research subsidy may be regarded as an optimal policy in view of diffusing low carbon technologies for the benefit of the society. The paper exploits the macro economic approach of the endogenous growth models with technological change for a comparative assessment of these policy measures on the economic growth in the US and Japan in the medium and the long run. The results of our micro estimates reveal several important differences across the Japanese and US energy firms: lower elasticity of innovation production function in R&D expenditure, lower probability of a radical innovation, and larger advances of dirty technologies in Japan. This may explain our quantitative findings of stronger reliance on carbon tax than on research subsidies in Japan relative to the US.
Q43|Switching to Hydropower renewable energy to mitigate the effects of the carbon emissions in South and East Asian economies|Energy is the most essential tool for production and distribution of economic goods. It is also considered as crucial input of economic development. The World Energy Committee states that there are several environmental risks linked to energy production from non-renewable sources such as coal, gas, and petroleum etc. One of the associated risks is high per capita carbon emissions. To reduce such risk economy should switch to the renewable energy sources that characterize less or no carbon emission. This paper investigated the dynamics of coal, gas and hydroelectric energy within the framework of the environmental Kuznets curve. The study used the Arellano and Bond (1991) dynamic panel model using the GMM framework developed by the Hansen (1982). The empirical results of the study confirm the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis and that coal and gas are significant contributors to carbon. Results suggest that the hydel energy can play an essential role in mitigating the carbon emissions and improving climate emissions in case of South and East Asian Countries.
Q43|Applying Tax Rate of 33,33% on Primary Energy in Indonesia|High fuel consumption has a negative impact not only on the environment, but also can have wider impact on the country's economic conditions. Thus, steps need to be taken regarding the use of fuel in order to reduce the negative impact that results. The aims of this study is to analyze the impact that occurred on the industry and the Indonesian economy when a tax of 33,33% was determined on the use of primary energy, that is coal and petroleum products, through three simulations. By using a model from GTAP-E, the region is aggregated into 7 regions and the industrial sector will be aggregated into 11 industries. The result shows that simulation C has a significant impact on the industry and the Indonesian economy. In addition, this simulation is also able to reduce carbon dioxide gas emissions which derive from coal and petroleum.
Q43|Using Value-at-Risk for effective energy portfolio risk management|It is evident that the prediction of future variance through advanced GARCH type models is essential for an effective energy portfolio risk management. Still it fails to provide a clear view on the specific amount of capital that is at risk on behalf of the investor or any party directly affected by the price fluctuations of specific or multiple energy commodities. Thus, it is necessary for risk managers to make one further step, determining the most robust and effective approach that will enable them to precisely monitor and accurately estimate the portfolio’s Value-at-Risk, which by definition provides a good measure of the total actual amount at stake. Nevertheless, despite the variety of the variance models that have been developed and the relative VaR methodologies, the vast majority of the researchers conclude that there is no model or specific methodology that outperforms all the others. On the contrary, the best approach to minimize risk and accurately forecast the future potential losses is to adopt that specific methodology that will be able to take into consideration the particular characteristic features regarding the trade of energy products.
Q43|Non-Renewable Resources and the Possibility of Sustainable Economic Development in a Positive or Negative Population Growth Economy|The purpose of this study is to investigate how the long-run growth rate of per capita output is determined when an economy is subject to non-renewable resource constraints and the population growth is negative by using a theoretical model. From this, we can examine the effect of population decline and the effect of depletion of natural resources on economic growth. Our results show that irrespective of whether the population growth rate is positive or negative, the long-run growth rate of per capita output can be positive depending on conditions. This result suggests that even an economy with non-renewable resources and declining population can obtain sustainable economic growth.
Q43|The Impact of Natural Gas Consumption on Industry Value Added in the Mediterranean Region|The current paper assesses the link between natural gas consumption (NGC) and macroeconomic variables for the period between 1980 and 2018 in the Mediterranean region. Analyses accounts for assessing the significance of the natural gas consumption on the industry value added (IVA) using fixed-effects panel data regression. In addition to that, this contribution evaluates the causal link between the variables cited above. Empirical findings indicate that there is a significant relationship between IVA and NGC. Furthermore, these two latter variables showcase a mutual causality in a sense that an increase in each of these variables will lead to the increase of the other one. Results also indicate that GDP causes the increase in natural gas consumption
Q43|A sectoral approach to the electricity-growth nexus in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa|This paper takes a sectoral, panel approach to investigating the electricity-growth nexus for the Eastern Cape province of South Africa between the period of 2003 and 2017.

Moreover, our causality tests provide strong evidence of causality running from electricity consumption to economic growth hence supporting the “growth hypothesis”. In a nutshell, our results not only demonstrate the importance of performing the electricity-growth analysis at provincial level as opposed to relying on national aggregated estimates but also provides important provincial-specific policy implications and recommendations.
Q43|Dynamics between Financial development, Energy consumption and Economic growth in Sub-Saharan African countries: Evidence from an asymmetrical and nonlinear analysis|This paper analyzes the asymmetrical relationship between financial development, energy consumption and economic growth in twenty-one (21) sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries from 1990Q1 to 2014Q4. We used the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) framework and asymmetrical causality tests to examine the relationship between the variables. First, the country-level analysis reveals that there is asymmetrical cointegration between the variables in some countries and mixed results of the causal effects of financial development and energy consumption on economic growth across countries. Second, the results of the panel data analysis confirm the asymmetrical cointegration in the SSA region, especially in lower-middle-income countries than in upper-middle-income countries. We find that positive changes in energy consumption significantly reduce economic growth, contrary to the negative changes in the long-term. Besides, positive shocks to financial development favor more economic growth than the adverse shocks in the long-term in the SSA region. However, financial development hurts economic growth, contrary to energy consumption in the short-term. Finally, the results show bidirectional causality between positive changes in energy consumption and economic growth, but unidirectional causality running from negative changes in energy consumption to economic growth in the SSA region. There is also bidirectional causality between positive and negative shocks to financial development and economic growth in SSA region, but mixed results across lower-income countries and upper-middle-income countries. Therefore, our study suggests that energy-saving policies such as renewable energies can be implemented in the SSA region to promote sustainable development. In addition, policy-makers should adopt an efficient allocation of the credits to the private sector supporting productive investments. They should also pay attention to the asymmetrical relationship between financial development, energy consumption and economic growth in most SSA countries in the conduct of economic policies.
Q43|Long-run dynamics of sulphur dioxide emissions, economic growth and energy efficiency in China|This paper estimates the linkages among total Sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions, total GDP and energy efficiency using China’s provincial panel data from 2002 to 2015. We investigate total emissions rather than per capita emissions or ambient concentrations, since it is total emissions that the environment cares about. Energy efficiency is estimated using stochastic frontier analysis and decomposed into both persistent and transient efficiency. We then investigate the long-run dynamics among SO2 emissions, economic growth and energy efficiency by employing the panel-based error correction model and taking the effects of cyclical variations into account. Our analysis shows that GDP has a positive impact on total SO2 emissions in the short run and gains in energy efficiency have a significant negative effect on emissions in the long run. By controlling the effects of business cycle, the effects of GDP on emissions remain positive in both short and long run. Cross-sectional analysis provides similar insights. We argue that economic growth itself is an emission generator. Therefore, the government needs to establish a long-run strategy to curb the emissions by improving energy efficiency.
Q43|Dynamic Impact of the U.S. Monetary Policy on Oil Market Returns and Volatility|In this paper, we assess the dynamic impact of the U.S. monetary policy announcements on oil market futures returns and volatility. We use intra-day data together with a time-varying modeling approach to study the nature of this dynamic impact. In addition, we also control for macroeconomic news shocks and separately study the response of good and bad realized volatility. Evidence suggests that there is a significant time variation in the response of oil returns as well as its volatility to the Federal Reserve policy announcements. Furthermore, we find that higher (lower) uncertainty about Federal Reserve policy actions weakens (strengthens) the impact of the announcements on oil returns and volatility.
Q43|The interplay of economic, social and political fragmentation|We develop a model of the social fragmentation along communitarian vs. individualistic values. The endogenous adoption of social values hinges on whether people choose to derive more utility from comparisons with others (materialistic but universalist values) or derive relatively more utility from membership of a group with its distinguishing characteristics (communitarian but exclusive values). Those more well-off, socioeconomically, gravitate towards individualism while those of lower status gravitate towards communitarianism. Crucially, those at the lower end of the middle classes are predicted to align more and more with communitarian values when the status advantage of those at the top increases, holding their own income constant (i.e. rising socioeconomic inequality). Conversely, those at the higher end of the middle classes are predicted to align more and more with individualist values, polarising society. These shifts also increase size of the political constituency for enacting protectionist policies, which act as a stabilising force against socioeconomic polarisation. The model therefore predicts political realignments from the incidence of income growth and the importance of status-oriented (conspicuous) consumption.
Q43|Oil Prices, Exchange Rates and Interest Rates|There has been much interest in the relationship between the price of crude oil, the value of the U.S. dollar, and the U.S. interest rate since the 1980s. For example, the sustained surge in the real price of oil in the 2000s is often attributed to the declining real value of the U.S. dollar as well as low U.S. real interest rates, along with a surge in global real economic activity. Quantifying these effects one at a time is difficult not only because of the close relationship between the interest rate and the exchange rate, but also because demand and supply shocks in the oil market in turn may affect the real value of the dollar and real interest rates. We propose a novel identification strategy for disentangling the causal effects of oil demand and oil supply shocks from the effects of exogenous shocks to the U.S. real interest rate and exogenous shocks to the real value of the U.S. dollar. We empirically evaluate popular views about the role of exogenous real exchange rate shocks in driving the real price of oil, and we examine the extent to which shocks in the global oil market drive the U.S. real exchange rate and U.S. real interest rates. Our evidence for the first time provides direct empirical support for theoretical models of the link between oil prices, exchange rates, and interest rates.
Q43|Commodity Price Uncertainty as a Leading Indicator of Economic Activity|In this paper we examine the impact of commodity price uncertainty on US economic activity. Our empirical analysis indicates that uncertainty in agricultural, metals and energy markets depresses US economic activity and acts as an early warning signal for US recessions with a forecasting horizon ranging from one to twelve months. The results reveal that uncertainty shocks in agricultural and metals markets are more significant for the US macroeconomy when compared to oil price uncertainty shocks. Finally, we show that when accounting for the effects of macroeconomic and monetary factors, the negative dynamic response of economic activity to agricultural and metals price uncertainty shocks remains unaltered, while the response to energy uncertainty shocks is significantly reduced due to either systematic policy reactions or random shocks in monetary policy.
Q43|Oil price shocks, monetary policy and current account imbalances within a currency union|For more than two decades now, current-account imbalances are a crucial issue in the international policy debate as they threaten the stability of the world economy. More recently, the government debt crisis of the European Union shows that internal current account imbalances inside a currency union may also add to these risks. Oil price fluctuations and a contracting monetary policy that reacts on oil prices, previously discussed to affect the current account may also be a threat to the currency union by changing internal imbalances. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the impact of oil price shocks on current account imbalances within a currency union. Differences in institutions, especially labor market institutions and trade result in an asymmetric reaction to an otherwise symmetric shock. In this context, we show that oil price shocks can have a long-lasting impact on internal balances, as the exchange rate adjustment mechanism is not available. The common monetary policy authority, however, can reduce such effects by specifying an optimum monetary policy target. Nevertheless, we also show that there is no single best solution. CPI, core CPI or an asymmetric CPI target all come at a cost either regarding an increase in unemployment or increasing imbalances.
Q43|Economic and environmental impacts of UK offshore wind development to 2029: the importance of local content|The continuing development of the offshore wind sector is an important element of UK energy and industrial policy since it holds the potential of substantial emissions reductions while simultaneously boosting economic activity. A central idea here is that the economic impact of the offshore wind sector can be enhanced by increasing the local content of its inputs. We explore, through simulation of a purpose-built Input-Output model of the UK, the economic and emissions impacts of the likely future development of the UKâ€™s offshore wind sector, with a particular emphasis on the importance of local content. We explore six scenarios all of which embed the capacity expansion anticipated by the Sector Deal, but differ in terms of local content â€“ including a set of illustrative simulations considering the possible impact of Brexit on local content. We find that future offshore wind development does indeed generate a â€œdouble dividendâ€ in the form of simultaneous and substantial reductions in emissions and improvements in economic activity. It is also the case that, as anticipated, the scale of the economic stimulus arising from offshore wind development is directly and strongly related to the extent of local content.
Q43|An analysis of the global oil market using SVARMA models|The paper analyses the importance of supply versus demand shocks on the global oil market from 1974 to 2017, using a parsimonious structural vector autoregressive moving average (SVARMA) model. The superior out-of-sample forecasting performance of the reduced form VARMA compared to VAR alternatives advocates the suitability of this framework. We specifically account for the changes in the oil market over three distinctive sub-periods - pre moderation, great moderation and post moderation periods, to provide a means of identifying the changing nature of shock transmission mechanism across times. The findings shed some light on the effects of supply versus demand related oil shocks under different economic environment. Oil supply shocks explain large fraction of the movements in the global oil market in the pre and post moderation periods, i.e. during the slower economic growth periods. The importance of global activity shock on oil price movements is obvious during the 2003-2008 boom period. The oil specific shock has an interesting transmission path on the global economic activity, where the global activity responded positively and negatively during the global economic expansion and contraction respectively, emphasising the precautionary nature of the shock.
Q43|An Axiomatic Characterization of a Generalized Ecological Footprint|The purpose of this paper is to propose an axiomatic characterization of ecological footprint indices. Using an axiomatic approach, we de?ne a set of axioms to represent the properties considered appropriate to ecological footprint measures in general. It can be shown that there exists a generalized index which is unique up to a strictly increasing function of the world land area appropriated to satisfy human needs. As an implication, the well-known compound-based footprint index used by the Global Footprint Network can be characterized as a speci?cation of the generalized index, only if proportionality in world land area use is additionally assumed and the norm is arbitrarily ?xed, in terms of global hectares. Instead, we ?nd that the applied methodology of normalization and standardization in the aggregation procedure of footprint indices is completely dispensible. In this respect, the proposition of generalized and axiomatically characterized indices for the measurement of the ecological footprint of human activity may be considered as the main contribution of the paper.
Q43|Azerbaijan and its Oil Resources: Curse or Blessing?|We examine the relationship between oil price fluctuations and economic activity in Azerbaijan using vector autoregressive models for the period 2002Q1-2018Q4. Our key results are as follows. First, quarterly GDP growth decreases after oil price innovations in both, the oil and gas sector and in the remaining economy. Downturns (upswings) in the oil and gas sector also prompt downturns (upswings) in the non-oil sector as fluctuations in oil revenues affect the government's capacity to subsidize the remaining economy. Second, oil price innovations also lead to higher inflation in Azerbaijan. In response to the required tightening of monetary policy, the manat appreciates against the US dollar. Finally, GDP effects are primarily documented after oil price increases, whereas the interest rate and the exchange rate mainly react to decreases. Inflation increases after both types of shocks, either due to the accommodative monetary policy stance in the case of oil price decreases or due to the shock itself in the case of increases.
Q43|Energy Conversion Rate Improvements, Pollution Abatement Efforts and Energy Mix: The Transition toward the Green Economy under a Pollution Stock Constraint|To prevent climate change, three options are currently considered: improve the energy conversion efficiency of primary energy sources, develop carbon free alternatives to polluting fossil fuels and abate potential emissions before they are released inside the atmosphere. We study the optimal mix and timing of these three mitigation options in a stylized dynamic model. Useful energy can come from two sources: a non-renewable fossil fuel resource and a carbon free renewable resource. The conversion efficiency rate of fossil energy into useful energy is open to choice but higher conversion rates are also more costly. The economy can abate some fraction of its potential emissions and a higher abatement rate incurs higher costs. The society objective is to maintain below some mandated level, or carbon cap, the atmospheric carbon concentration. In the empirically relevant case where the economy is actually constrained by the cap, at least temporarily, we show that the optimal path is a sequence of four regimes: a ’pre-ceiling’ regime before the economy is actually constrained by the cap, a ’ceiling’ regime at the cap, a ’post-ceiling’ regime below the cap and a final regime of exclusive exploitation of renewable resources. If the abatement option has ever to be used, it should be started before the beginning of the ceiling regime, first at an increasing rate and at a decreasing rate once the cap constraint binds. The efficiency performance from any source steadily improves with the exception of a time phase under the ceiling regime when it is constant. Renewables take progressively a larger share of the energy mix but their exploitation may be delayed significantly. Absolute levels of carbon emissions drop down continuously but follow a non monotonic pattern in per useful energy unit relative terms.To prevent climate change, three options are currently considered: improve the energy conversion efficiency of primary energy sources, develop carbon free alternatives to polluting fossil fuels and abate potential emissions before they are released inside the atmosphere.

Q43|Capital Accumulation, Green Paradox, and Stranded Assets: An Endogenous Growth Perspective|The existing studies on Green Paradox and stranded assets focus on dirty exhaustible assets (fossil fuel reserves) and show that environmental regulations, by changing the costs of dirty inputs relative to clean ones, lead to replacements of the former by the latter and stranding of dirty assets due to perfect substitution. It, in turn, induces acceleration of dirty resource extractions and pollution emissions for fear of dirty assets becoming stranded - the Green Paradox effect. This paper uses an endogenous growth framework to revisit the problem of Green Paradox and stranded assets by taking a new perspective that focuses on capital accumulation with investment irreversibility. We show that if 1) direct irreversibility of investment does not rule out the indirect channel of converting dirty capital goods into clean ones through final goods allocations, and 2) interactions between dirty and clean capital as imperfect substitutes can generate reciprocal effects, then environmental regulation, through directing investment towards clean capital, does not necessarily leads to asset stranding of dirty capital. Accumulation of clean capital with a pollution-saving effect offsets the polluting impact of dirty one and leads to reversed Green Paradox. We further propose an endogenous growth mechanism through which the accumulation of both dirty and clean capital, as well as environmental improvement, can be sustained in the long run without converging to the steady state.
Q43|Does China Fall into Poverty-Environment Traps? Evidence from Long-term Income Dynamics and Urban Air Pollution|This paper examines the long-run relationship between income and urban air pollution using a joint distribution dynamics approach. This approach enables to estimate the transition process and long-run distribution and to examine the mechanisms behind the evolution process. The approach is applied to a unique panel data of CO2, SO2 and PM2.5 (particulate matter smaller than 2.5µm) for 286 Chinese cities over the period 2002-2014. Strong persistence in the transition dynamics suggests that this convergence process may require a long time. The distribution dynamics analyses indicate that multiple equilibria are the major characteristics in the long-run relationship between income and urban air pollution in China, which implies that inter-regional technology spillover may be an important way to accelerate convergence. Our results further support the existence of poverty-environmental trap in PM2.5 concentrations. Thus, new environmental models are expected to be developed to explain this new stylized fact. The findings provide strong support for taking more aggressive measures that consider income and urban environment simultaneously to reduce poverty and air pollutions together in the Chinese cities.
Q43|Transitory and Permanent Shocks in the Global Market for Crude Oil|This paper documents the determinants of real oil price in the global market based on SVAR model embedding transitory and permanent shocks on oil demand and supply as well as speculative disturbances. We find evidence of significant differences in the propagation mechanisms of transitory versus permanent shocks, pointing to the importance of disentangling their distinct effects. Permanent supply disruptions turn out to be a bigger factor in historical oil price movements during the most recent decades, while speculative shocks became less influential.
Q43|How Oil Supply Shocks Affect the Global Economy: Evidence from Local Projections|We provide empirical evidence on the impact of oil supply shocks on global aggregates. To do this, we first extract structural oil supply shocks from a standard oil-price determination model found in the literature. Impulse response functions are then estimated using local projections. This technique has recently been used to estimate the effect of monetary policy and government spending shocks. To our knowledge, however, this is the first time it is used to analyze the effect of oil supply shocks on global aggregates. While there is a high level of uncertainty around our estimates, results can be summarized with three main takeaways. Following a supply-driven decline in oil prices: (1) US business investment usually decreases, highlighting the importance of the shale oil industry, while the reaction of US gross domestic product (GDP) is often not statistically significant; (2) domestic demand in the euro area usually increases strongly; and (3) GDP among commodity exporters declines in the short term, reflecting the importance of the terms-of-trade channel, but increases in the longer term, reflecting the aggregate benefits of increased oil production.
Q43|The Simple Economics of Global Fuel Consumption|This paper presents a structural framework of the global oil market that relies on information on global fuel consumption to identify flow demand for oil. We show that under mild identifying assumptions, data on global fuel consumption help to provide comparatively sharp insights on elasticities and other key structural parameters of the global oil market. The estimated elasticity of global fuel demand in the short run with respect to crude oil prices is around -2 percent, which is considerably more inelastic than estimates of local fuel demand elasticities based on disaggregated data. Our framework is particularly suitable for understanding the evolution of quantities in the global oil market and provides new evidence on the magnitude of different types of oil price shocks and their macroeconomic and environmental impacts.
Q43|A Structural Model of the Global Oil Market|This note presents a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model of the global oil market. The model identifies four types of shocks with different economic interpretations: oil supply shocks, oil-market-specific demand shocks, storage demand shocks and shocks to global economic growth. The historical decomposition of oil price fluctuations suggests that oil supply shocks were the dominant force during the 2014–15 oil price decline. Several examples illustrate the model’s usefulness for conditional forecasts of oil market variables under different scenarios for global GDP growth and oil consumption.
Q43|Risk premium in the era of shale oil|The boom in the production of shale oil in the United States has triggered a structural transformation of the oil market. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that this process has significant consequences for oil risk premium. We construct a model based on shale producers interacting with financial speculators in the futures market. Compared to conventional oil, shale oil technology is more flexible, but producers have higher risk aversion and face additional costs due to their reliance on external finance. Our model helps to explain the observed pattern of aggregate hedging by US oil companies in the last decade. The empirical analysis shows that the hedging pressure of shale producers has become more important than that of conventional producers in explaining the oil futures risk premium.
Q43|The Shale Oil Boom and the U.S. Economy: Spillovers and Time-Varying Effects|We analyze if the transmission of oil price shocks on the U.S. economy has changed as a result of the shale oil boom. To do so we allow for spillovers at the state level, as well as aggregate country level effects. We identify and quantify these spillovers using a factor-augmented vector autoregressive (VAR) model, allowing for time-varying changes. In contrast to previous results, we find considerable changes in the way oil price shocks are transmitted: there are now positive spillovers to non-oil investment, employment and production in many U.S. states from an increase in the oil price - effects that were not present before the shale oil boom.
Q43|Assessing reliability of aggregated inflation views in the European Commission consumer survey|Using a novel approach based on micro-level survey responses, we assess the reliability of aggregated inflation expectations estimates in the European Commission Consumer Survey. We identify the share of consumers, whose qualitative and quantitative views on expected increase of prices do not match each other. Then we consider the impact of inconsistent survey responses on balance statistics and mean values of quantitative inflation expectations. We also analyze expectations’ formation estimating the sticky-information models. The results, based on Finnish and Polish data, suggest that even if the fraction of inconsistent survey responses is non-negligible, it matters neither for the aggregated figures of inflation views, nor for understanding of the formation of inflation expectations by consumers. We conclude that micro-level inconsistencies do not reduce the reliability of the current EC Consumer Survey dataset. Our results also indicate that inconsistent responses are not important drivers of the inflation overestimation bias displayed in the data.
Q43|European Gas Markets, Trading Hubs, and Price Formation: A Network Perspective|We apply network theory to analyse the interactions of trading hub prices, and to assess the harmonisation of the European gas market. We construct dynamic networks, where the nodes correspond to the twelve EU trading hubs, and where the edges weight the causality between the variations of the respective gas prices. Network density dynamically calculates the aggregate quantity of causal interactions recorded within the system, which provides information pertaining to the integration of the European gas network. We document a number of spikes in network density, suggesting short periods of improved connectivity of European gas markets. We argue that these results appear to be driven by exogenous factors, such as unseasonal weather patterns, seismic activity and pipeline capacity reductions or outages. The findings elucidate the time varying nature of European gas market dynamics, and the importance of continual monitoring of market evolution.
Q43|Measuring global real economic activity: Do recent critiques hold up to scrutiny?|Hamilton (2018) suggests that the Kilian (2009) index of global real economic activity is misleading and calls for alternative measures. The problems documented by Hamilton are a consequence of a coding mistake in the computation of the original index. Specifically, the nominal freight rates underlying the Kilian index were accidentally logged twice. Once this coding error is corrected by removing one of the log transformations, none of the concerns raised by Hamilton remains valid and the index may be used as originally intended. Moreover, it can be shown that the corrected index differs only slightly from the original index and that the key empirical results in Kilian (2009) and related studies remain unchanged when replacing the index.
Q43|Oil prices, exchange rates, and interest rates|There has been much interest in the relationship between the price of crude oil, the value of the U.S. dollar, and the U.S. interest rate since the 1980s. For example, the sustained surge in the real price of oil in the 2000s is often attributed to the declining real value of the U.S. dollar as well as low U.S. real interest rates, along with a surge in global real economic activity. Quantifying these effects one at a time is difficult not only because of the close relationship between the interest rate and the exchange rate, but also because demand and supply shocks in the oil market in turn may affect the real value of the dollar and real interest rates. We propose a novel identification strategy for disentangling the causal effects of oil demand and oil supply shocks from the effects of exogenous shocks to the U.S. real interest rate and exogenous shocks to the real value of the U.S. dollar. We empirically evaluate popular views about the role of exogenous real exchange rate shocks in driving the real price of oil, and we examine the extent to which shocks in the global oil market drive the U.S. real exchange rate and U.S. real interest rates. Our evidence for the first time provides direct empirical support for theoretical models of the link between oil prices, exchange rates, and interest rates.
Q43|CO2 embedded in trade: trends and fossil fuel drivers|The amount of CO2 embedded in trade has substantially increased since 1990. We study the trends and some drivers over the period 1995-2009. We find that traded goods tend to have higher emission-intensities compared to average final demand. The second finding is that independently of sector structure, dirty countries tend to specialize in emissionintensive sectors. This finding suggests a comparative advantage mechanism for CO2 and lends support to the hypothesis that trade liberalization tends to increase global emissions. The third finding is that, on average, emission-intensive countries have shifted from trade deficits to surpluses, so a larger share of goods is now produced in emission-intensive countries, consequently increasing global emissions. Finally, our analysis points to coal abundance as an important driver for high levels of both domestic emissions per value added and Sector specialization into emission-intensive sectors. Hence coal abundance is an important driver of net CO2 exports.
Q43|Does Drawing Down the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve Help Stabilize Oil Prices?|We study the efficacy of releases from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) within the context of fully specified models of the global oil market that explicitly allow for storage demand as well as unanticipated changes in the SPR. Using novel identifying strategies and evaluation methods, we examine seven questions. First, how much have exogenous shocks to the SPR contributed to the variability in the real price of oil? Second, how much would a one-time exogenous reduction in the SPR lower the real price of oil? Third, are exogenous SPR releases partially or fully offset by increases in private sector oil inventories and how does this response affect the transmission of SPR policy shocks? Fourth, how effective were actual SPR policy interventions, consisting of sequences of exogenous changes in the SPR, at lowering the real price of oil? Fifth, are there differences in the effectiveness of SPR emergency drawdowns and SPR exchanges? Sixth, how much did the creation and expansion of the SPR contribute to higher real oil prices? Finally, how much would selling half of the oil in the SPR, as recently proposed by the White House, lower the global price of oil (and hence the U.S. price of motor gasoline) and how much fiscal revenue would it generate?
Q43|Total, asymmetric and frequency connectedness between oil and forex markets|We analyze total, asymmetric and frequency connectedness between oil and forex markets using high-frequency, intra-day data over the period 2007 -- 2017. By employing variance decompositions and their spectral representation in combination with realized semivariances to account for asymmetric and frequency connectedness, we obtain interesting results. We show that divergence in monetary policy regimes affects forex volatility spillovers but that adding oil to a forex portfolio decreases the total connectedness of the mixed portfolio. Asymmetries in connectedness are relatively small. While negative shocks dominate forex volatility connectedness, positive shocks prevail when oil and forex markets are assessed jointly. Frequency connectedness is largely driven by uncertainty shocks and to a lesser extent by liquidity shocks, which impact long-term connectedness the most and lead to its dramatic increase during periods of distress.
Q43|Impacto de la implementación del canal de atención a clientes mineros de la ANM sobre la inversión minera en Colombia|El presente estudio busca medir el impacto de la implementación del Canal de Atención a Clientes Mineros del Grupo de Promoción de la Agencia Nacional de Minería (ANM) sobre la inversión en el sector minero colombiano. Teniendo en cuenta que el uso del canal es voluntario y libre, se optó por aplicar la metodología de emparejamiento PSM, con el fin de corregir el posible sesgo de autoselección causado por la diferencia de las empresas participantes y no participantes. Se encuentra que el canal de atención tiene impacto sobre las inversiones en el sector minero colombiano, toda vez que las empresas con presencia en el país que lo usan invierten en promedio $1.3 millones de pesos más que aquellas empresas que no se benefician de estos canales de atención. Como parte de las recomendaciones derivadas de este ejercicio, se considera que, si la ANM está interesada en determinar la eficacia de otras estrategias de promoción, se debe contar con el listado de las empresas beneficiadas por otro tipo de intervenciones.

Finally, how much would selling half of the oil in the SPR, as recently proposed by the White House, lower the global price of oil (and hence the U.S. price of motor gasoline) and how much fiscal revenue would it generate.
Q43|Economic Growth, Energy Intensity and the Energy Mix|This paper explores how changes in energy intensity and the switch to renewables can boost economic growth. To do so, we implement a dynamic panel data approach on a sample of 134 countries over the period 1960 to 2010. We incorporate a set of control variables, related to human and physical capital, socio-economic conditions, policies and institutions, which have been widely used in the literature on economic growth. Given the current state of technology, improving energy intensity is growth enhancing at the worldwide level. Moreover, conditional to energy intensity, moving from fossil fuels to frontier renewables (wind, solar, wave or geothermic) is also positively correlated with growth. Our results are robust to the specification of the dynamic panel with respect to alternative approaches (pooled OLS, within group or system GMM), and to alternative specifications (accounting for heterogeneity across countries, a set of institutional factors, and other technical aspects).
Q43|Forecasting crude oil prices with DSGE models|We run an oil prices forecasting competition among a set of structural models, includ- ing vector autoregressions and dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models. Our results highlights two principles. First, forecasts should exploit the mean reversion of the real oil price over long horizons. Second, models should not replicate the high volatility of oil prices observed in sample. Abiding by these principles, we show that a small scale DSGE model performs much better in real oil price forecasting than the random walk as well as vector autoregressions.
Q43|The Impact of Population, Affluence, Technology, and Urbanization on CO2 Emissions across Income Groups|This paper analyzes the impact of urbanization on CO2 emissions within the STIRPAT framework over the period 1971 to 2014 for a panel of 76 countries clustered into income groups. Using dynamic panel estimations techniques, the empirical results robustly show an inverted N-shaped relationship between urbanization and CO2 emissions in the long-term associated with the ecological modernization theory in particular for the lower- and middle-income panel: increasing levels of urbanization tend to reduce CO2 emissions in the long-term. The estimated turning point for the urbanization ratio after which CO2 emissions decline is almost identical and around 54% both for the lower- and middle-income panel. The long-term relationship for CO2 emissions and its relevant impact factors tends to be similar across groups. The impact of population determines CO2 emissions significantly only in the long-term within any panel. Different from previous studies, the results robustly indicate that GDP per capita does impact CO2 emissions greater than population in any panel. This suggests, that it is rather the growth in consumption than the number of people leading CO2 emissions to increase. Energy efficiency reductions most harmfully effect CO2 emissions within the high-income panel in the long- and short-run.
Q43|The Heat is on: a framework for measuring financial stress under disruptive energy transition scenarios|This paper presents a comprehensive framework for analyzing financial stress under scenarios with a disruptive transition to a low-carbon economy. This stress testing framework is designed to be readily applied by macroprudential supervisors or financial institutions. First, we construct stress scenarios using two dimensions: climate policy and energy technology. Then, we rely on various modeling approaches to derive macroeconomic and industry-specific implications. These approaches include a novel methodology for capturing industry-specific transition risks. Third, we disaggregate EUR 2.3 trillion in assets of more than 80 Dutch financial institutions by industry. Finally, our calculations show that financial losses can be sizeable, as portfolio values can decline by up to 11%. These outcomes suggest that climate-transition risks warrant close and timely attention from a financial stability perspective.
Q43|Forecasting daily electricity prices with monthly macroeconomic variables|We analyse the importance of macroeconomic information, such as industrial production index and oil price, for forecasting daily electricity prices in two of the main European markets, Germany and Italy. We do that by means of mixed-frequency models, introducing a Bayesian approach to reverse unrestricted MIDAS models (RU-MIDAS). We study the forecasting accuracy for different horizons (from 1 day ahead to 28 days ahead) and by considering different specifications of the models. We find gains around 20% at short horizons and around 10% at long horizons. Therefore, it turns out that the macroeconomic low frequency variables are more important for short horizons than for longer horizons. The benchmark is almost never included in the model confidence set. JEL Classification: C11, C53, Q43, Q47
Q43|Much ado about nothing? The shale oil revolution and the global supply curve|We focus on the implications of the shale oil boom for the global supply of oil. We begin with a stylized model with two producers, one facing low production costs and one higher production costs but potentially lower adjustment costs, competing à la Stackelberg. We find that the supply function is flatter for the high cost producer, and that the supply function for shale oil producers becomes more responsive to demand shocks when adjustment costs decline. On the empirical side, we apply an instrumental variable approach using estimates of demand-driven oil price changes derived from a standard structural VAR of the oil market. A main finding is that global oil supply is rather vertical, practically all the time. Moreover, for the global oil market as a whole, we do not find evidence of a major shift to a more price elastic supply as a result of the shale oil boom. JEL Classification: Q33, Q41, Q43, C32
Q43|Does China Fall into Poverty-Environment Traps? Evidence from Long-term Income Dynamics and Urban Air Pollution| This paper examines the long-run relationship between income and urban air pollution using a joint distribution dynamics approach. This approach enables to estimate the transition process and long-run distribution and to examine the mechanisms behind the evolution process. The approach is applied to a unique panel data of CO2, SO2 and PM2.5 (particulate matter smaller than 2.5μm) for 286 Chinese cities over the period 2002-2014. Strong persistence in the transition dynamics suggests that this convergence process may require a long time. The distribution dynamics analyses indicate that multiple equilibria are the major characteristics in the long-run relationship between income and urban air pollution in China, which implies that inter-regional technology spillover may be an important way to accelerate convergence. Our results further support the existence of poverty-environmental trap in PM2.5 concentrations. Thus, new environmental models are expected to be developed to explain this new stylized fact. The findings provide strong support for taking more aggressive measures that consider income and urban environment simultaneously to reduce poverty and air pollutions together in the Chinese cities.
Q43|Assessing the Techno-economic Effects of the Delayed Deployment of CCS Power Plants|Meeting the targets of climate change mitigation set by the Paris Agreement entails a huge transformation of the energy sector, as low- or no-carbon technologies must gradually substitute traditional, fossil-based technologies. In this perspective, the vast majority of energy analyses and scenarios project a fundamental role of Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS). However, uncertainty remains on the actual techno-economic feasibility of this technology: despite the considerable investment over the recent past, commercial maturity is yet to come. The main aim of this work is to evaluate the impacts of a progressively delayed deployment of CCS plants from a climate, energy, and economic perspective, focusing in particular on the power sector. This is carried out with the Integrated Assessment Model WITCH, exploring a wide set of long-term scenarios over mitigation targets ranging from 1.5°C to 4°C in terms of global temperature increase in 2100 with respect to the pre-industrial levels. The analysis shows that CCS will be a key mitigation option at a global level for carbon mitigation, achieving about 30% of the electricity mix in 2100 (with a homogeneous distribution across coal, gas, and biomass) if its deployment is unconstrained. If CCS deployment is delayed or forbidden, penetration cannot reach the optimal unconstrained level, resulting in a mix rearrangement, with a strong increase in renewables and, to a lesser extent, nuclear. The mitigation targets can be met, but policy costs without the implementation of CCS are from 35% to 72% higher than in the corresponding unconstrained scenarios.
Q43|Facts and Fiction in Oil Market Modeling|Baumeister and Hamilton (2019a) assert that every critique of their work on oil markets by Kilian and Zhou (2019a) is without merit. In addition, they make the case that key aspects of the economic and econometric analysis in the widely used oil market model of Kilian and Murphy (2014) and its precursors are incorrect. Their critiques are also directed at other researchers who have worked in this area and, more generally, extend to research using structural VAR models outside of energy economics. The purpose of this paper is to help the reader understand what the real issues are in this debate. The focus is not only on correcting important misunderstandings in the recent literature, but on the substantive and methodological insights generated by this exchange, which are of broader interest to applied researchers.
Q43|The Propagation of Regional Shocks in Housing Markets: Evidence from Oil Price Shocks in Canada|Shocks to the demand for housing that originate in one region may seem important only for that regional housing market. We provide evidence that such shocks can also affect housing markets in other regions. Our analysis focuses on the response of Canadian housing markets to oil price shocks. Oil price shocks constitute an important source of exogenous regional variation in income in Canada because oil production is highly geographically concentrated. We document that, at the national level, real oil price shocks account for 11% of the variability in real house price growth over time. At the regional level, we find that unexpected increases in the real price of oil raise housing demand and real house prices not only in oil-producing regions, but also in other regions. We develop a theoretical model of the propagation of real oil price shocks across regions that helps understand this finding. The model differentiates between oil-producing and non-oil-producing regions and incorporates multiple sectors, trade between provinces, government redistribution, and consumer spending on fuel. We empirically confirm the model prediction that oil price shocks are propagated to housing markets in non-oil-producing regions by the government redistribution of oil revenue and by increased interprovincial trade.
Q43|Estimating the impacts of financing support policies towards photovoltaic market in Indonesia: A social-energy-economy-environment (SE3) model simulation|This study estimates the impacts of four solar energy policy interventions on the photovoltaic (PV) market potential, government expenditure, economic growth, and the environment. An agent-based model is developed to capture the specific economic and institutional features of developing economies, citing Indonesia as a specific case study. We undertake a novel approach to energy modelling by combining energy system analysis, input-output analysis, life-cycle analysis, and socio-economic analysis to obtain a comprehensive and integrated impact assessment. Our results, after sensitivity analysis, call for abolishing the existing PV grant policy in the Indonesian rural electrification programs. The government, instead, should encourage the PV industry to improve production efficiency and to provide after-sales service. A 100-watt peak (Wp) PV under this policy is affordable for 33.2 percent of rural households without electricity access in 2010. Rural PV market size potentially increases to 82.4 percent with rural financing institutions lending 70 percent of capital cost for five years at 12 percent annual interest rate. Additional 30 percent capital subsidy and 5 percent interest subsidy slightly increase the rural PV market potential to 89.6 percent of PV adopters. However, the subsidies are crucial for creating PV demands by urban households but the most effective policy for promoting PV to urban households is the net metering scheme. Several policy proposals are discussed in response to these findings.
Q43|Global economic and environmental outcomes of the Paris Agreement|In this paper, we use a multi-region model of the world economy to analyze the economic and environmental outcomes that are likely to result from Paris Climate Agreement. To construct the modeling scenario, we convert the disparate emission targets for each country or region in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) formulations into estimated reductions in CO2 emissions relative to a baseline scenario with no new climate policies. We then solve for the tax rate path on CO2 in each region that achieves the NDC-consistent emissions reductions in the target year, 2030 for most regions. We find that if all regions achieve their NDCs, the Paris Agreement significantly reduces CO2 emissions relative to baseline. However, the Paris policy scenario suggests that global CO2 emissions would not decline in absolute terms relative to 2015 levels, let alone follow a path consistent with a 2°C stabilization scenario. Comparing projected 2030 CO2 tax rates to the same year’s percent emissions abatement relative to baseline, we find that declines in CO2 emissions do not necessarily correlate with the CO2 tax rate. We find the climate policies result in significant macroeconomic spillovers across the global economy, meaning that macroeconomic outcomes across countries depend not only on their own commitments but also on those of the rest of the world. We also explore how outcomes could change if select countries (United States, China and Australia) unilaterally withdraw from the agreement and undertake no new climate policies. We find that non-participation leads to economic gains (in terms of GDP) for these countries relative to participating, illustrating the challenge of forging an international agreement with participation by all major emitters and fossil fuel producers. However, we also find that if we account for the monetized climate and domestic cobenefits of emissions reductions, those countries, including Australia, are worse off if they unilaterally withdraw from the Paris Agreement than if they participate. Thus, although we find there are gross costs to participating, doing so generates net benefits for the individual country participants.
Q43|Macroeconomic time-series evidence that energy efficiency improvements do not save energy|The size of the economy-wide rebound effect is crucial for estimating the contribution that energy efficiency improvements can make to reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. We provide the first empirical general equilibrium estimate of the economy-wide rebound effect. We use a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model that is estimated using search methods developed in machine learning. We apply the SVAR to U.S. monthly and quarterly data, finding that after four years rebound is around 100%. This implies that policies to encourage cost-reducing energy efficiency innovation are not likely to significantly reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.
Q43|An analysis of the global oil market using SVARMA models|The paper analyses the importance of supply versus demand shocks on the global oil market from 1974 to 2017, using a parsimonious structural vector autoregressive mov- ing average (SVARMA) model. The superior out-of-sample forecasting performance of the reduced form VARMA compared to VAR alternatives advocates the suitabil- ity of this framework. We specifically account for the changes in the oil market over three distinctive sub-periods - pre moderation, great moderation and post moderation periods, to provide a means of identifying the changing nature of shock transmission mechanism across times. The findings shed some light on the effects of supply versus demand related oil shocks under different economic environment. Oil supply shocks explain large fraction of the movements in the global oil market in the pre and post moderation periods, i.e. during the slower economic growth periods. The importance of global activity shock on oil price movements is obvious during the 2003-2008 boom period. The oil specific shock has an interesting transmission path on the global eco- nomic activity, where the global activity responded positively and negatively during the global economic expansion and contraction respectively, emphasising the precautionary nature of the shock.
Q43|Energy Consumption and Economic Growth: Evidence from Vietnam|The importance of non-renewable, renewable and sustainable energy sources and energy consumption in the economic development strategy of a country is undeniable. The purpose of the paper is to investigate the impacts of energy consumption on the economic growth of Vietnam during the 1980-2014 period. By applying the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model of Pesaran et al. (2001), and the Granger causality test of Toda and Yamamoto (1995), the empirical results provide evidence that electricity consumption has positive impacts on Vietnam’s economic growth in both the short run and long run. For public policy prescriptions, the empirical evidence suggests that an exploration of new sources of renewable and sustainable energy is essential for long run economic development.
Q43|CO2 Emissions, Energy Consumption and Economic Growth|The paper investigates the role of consumption of both renewable and sustainable energy, as well as alternative and nuclear energy, in mitigating the effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, based on the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). The papers introduces a novel variable to capture trade openness, which appears to be a crucial factor in inter-regional co-operation and development, in order to evaluate its effect on the environment, The empirical analysis is based on a sample of nine signatories to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) for the period 1971-2014, which is based on data availability. The empirical analysis is based on several time series econometric methods, such as the cointegration test, two long run estimators, namely the fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) methods, as well as the Granger causality test. There are several noteworthy empirical findings: it is possible to confirm the U-shaped EKC hypothesis for six countries, namely Australia, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, Peru and Vietnam; there is no evidence of the EKC for Mexico; a reverse-shaped EKC is observed for Japan and Malaysia, there are long run relationships among the variables, the adoption of either renewable energy, or alternative energy and nuclear energy, mitigates CO2 emissions, trade openness leads to more beneficial than harmful impacts in the long run, the Granger causality tests show more bi-directional-relationships between the variables in the long run, and the Granger causality tests show more uni-directional-relationships between the variables in the short run.
Q43|Fed’s Unconventional Monetary Policy and Risk Spillover in the US Financial Markets|This study examines volatility spillover dynamics among the S&P 500 index, the US 10-year Treasury yield, the US dollar index futures and the commodity price index. The focus of the study is to analyze effects of Fed’s unconventional monetary policy on the US financial markets. We use realized volatility measures based on daily data covering the period from December 29, 1996 to November 12, 2018. To address nonlinear and asymmetric spillover dynamics in low and high volatility states, we propose a new regime-dependent spillover index based on a smooth transition vector autoregressive (STVAR) model, extending the study of Diebold and Yilmaz (2009,2012) to regime switching models. When applied to US financial data, we find strong evidence that the US financial market risk structure changes after the announcement of quantitively easing (QE) through the portfolio balance channel. The risk spillover moves from purchased assets to non-purchased assets after the QE announcements.
Q43|Malthus in the Light of Climate Change|To reconsider the Malthusian predictions of natural limits to economic development, the paper develops a multi-sector growth model with exhaustible resource extraction, investments in physical and knowledge capital, climate change, and endogenous fertility. Economic growth is driven by endogenous innovations which increase in the availability and productivity of research labour. Poor substitution of natural resources triggers sectoral change. Climate change is the result of polluting resource use which is, like consumption and investments, based on the intertemporal optimization of the households. Highlighting the importance of bounded resource supply and of rational extraction decisions I show that climate change is independent of population growth in steady state and there is no causal relationship between climate and population during transition to steady state. The consumption per capita growth rate rises in the innovation rate and the output elasticities of labour and capital in the different sectors. Unlike climate policy, population policy is not warranted; it may be counterproductive because labour is crucial for the research sector.
Q43|The Fossil Energy Interlude: Optimal Building, Maintaining and Scraping a Dedicated Capital, and the Hotelling Rule|It is well known that the price and consumption paths of most nonrenewable resources, including the fossil primary energies, do not follow the paths predicted by the standard Hotelling rule (Krautkraemer,1998, Gaudet, 2007). We develop a model in which a dedicated capital together with the fossil fuel are both required to produce useful energy. Starting from a state of the economy in which the fossil fuel is not yet exploited, we characterize the optimal path of the double transition: The first transition from the initial renewable energy regime to a mixed or full fossil fuel regime and later the second transition from the fossil fuel regime back to a renewable energy regime when the available stock of the fossil fuel becomes more and more rare. We show that, absent any technical progress, the useful energy price must first decrease, next be constant during the phase of maximum expansion of the fossil fuel energy consumption before entering the phase of decreasing use of the fossil energy. Only this third phase of decreasing fossil fuel consumption looks like a standard Hotelling path.
Q43|Energy Conversion Rate Improvements, Pollution Abatement Efforts and Energy Mix: The Transition toward the Green Economy under a Pollution Stock constraint|To prevent climate change, three options are currently considered: improve the energy conversion efficiency of primary energy sources, develop carbon free alternatives to polluting fossil fuels and abate potential emissions before they are released inside the atmosphere. We study the optimal mix and timing of these three mitigation options in a stylized dynamic model. Useful energy can come from two sources: a non-renewable fossil fuel resource and a carbon free renewable resource. The conversion efficiency rate of fossil energy into useful energy is open to choice but higher conversion rates are also more costly. The economy can abate some fraction of its potential emissions and a higher abatement rate incurs higher costs. The society objective is to maintain below some mandated level, or carbon cap, the atmospheric carbon concentration. In the empirically relevant case where the economy is actually constrained by the cap, at least temporarily, we show that the optimal path is a sequence of four regimes: a 'pre-ceiling' regime before the economy is actually constrained by the cap, a 'ceiling' regime at the cap, a 'post-ceiling' regime below the cap and a final regime of exclusive exploitation of renewable resources. If the abatement option has ever to be used, it should be started before the beginning of the ceiling regime, first at an increasing rate and at a decreasing rate once the cap constraint binds. The efficiency performance from any source steadily improves with the exception of a time phase under the ceiling regime when it is constant. Renewables take progressively a larger share of the energy mix but their exploitation may be delayed significantly. Absolute levels of carbon emissions drop down continuously but follow a non monotonic pattern in per useful energy unit relative terms.
Q43|Export competitiveness - Fuel Price nexus in Developing Countries: Real or False Concern?|This paper investigates the impact of domestic fuel price increases on export growth in a sample of 77 developing countries over the period 2000-2014. Using a fixed-effect estimator and the local projection approach, we find that an increase in domestic gasoline or diesel price adversely affects real non-fuel export growth, but only in the short run as the impact phases out within two years after the shock. The results also suggest that the negative effect of fuel price increase on exports is mainly noticeable in countries with a high-energy dependency ratio and countries where access to an alternative source of energy, such as electricity, is constrained, thus preventing producers from altering energy consumption mix in response to fuel price changes.

Q43|Closing the evidence gap: Energy consumption, real output and pollutant emissions in a developing mountainous economy|This study examines the inter relationships between energy consumption, output and carbon emissions in a mountainous economy using an augmented Vector Autoregression model. Time-series data over the period 1975-2013 is studied applying a multivariate framework using population and gross fixed capital formation as additional variables for Nepal. We control for the presence of structural breaks, autoregressive conditional heterosdeacticity and serial correlation in our analysis. Testing for Granger causality between integrated variables based on asymptotic theory reveals a long-run unidirectional Granger causality running from GDP to energy consumption, and a unidirectional Granger causality running from carbon emissions to GDP. The results indicate that energy consumption does not lead to economic growth while income leads to energy consumption. We suggest that the government of Nepal can adopt energy conservation policies and energy efficiency improvements to narrow the energy supply-demand gap. However, environmental policies aimed at reducing air pollution may have adverse effects on the growth of the Nepalese economy, which calls for a gradual approach towards decarbonisation. Our results remain robust to different estimators and contributes to an emerging literature on the nexus relationships between energy consumption, income and carbon emissions in developing economies.
Q43|Fuel prices and road deaths in Australia|After years of general progress in reducing Australia’s road death toll, road deaths increased in 2015 and 2016, reaching 1,293 per annum. These were also years of relatively cheap fuel following the dramatic decline in the world oil price in late 2014. This study uses monthly data to model the number of road deaths in Australia. Our estimates suggest that low fuel prices have contributed to knocking Australia off track for meeting its 2020 road safety target. The paper also provides a discussion of other factors that may have contributed to the rise in Australia’s road death toll.
Q43|Replication and robustness analysis of 'energy and economic growth in the USA: a multivariate approach'|We replicate Stern (1993, Energy Economics), who argues and empirically demonstrates that it is necessary (i) to use quality-adjusted energy use and (ii) to include capital and labor as control variables in order to find Granger causality from energy use to GDP. Though we could not access the original dataset, we can verify the main original inferences using data that are as close as possible to the original. We analyze the robustness of the original findings to alternative definitions of variables, model specifications, and estimation approach for both the (almost) original time span (1949- 1990) and an extended time span (1949-2015). p-values tend to be substantially smaller if energy use is quality adjusted rather than measured by total joules and if capital is included. Including labor has mixed results. These findings tend to largely support Stern’s (1993) two main conclusions and emphasize the importance of accounting for changes in the energy mix in time series modeling of the energy-GDP relationship and controlling for other factors of production. We also discuss how the inclusion of the original author in designing the replication study using a pre-analysis plan can help to counterbalance the incentive of replicating authors to disconfirm major findings of the original article to increase the probability of getting published.
Q43|Electricity availability: A precondition for faster economic growth?|We investigate if greater electricity availability helps countries ascend to faster economic growth trajectories. This is an important question for many developing countries that are currently prioritizing infrastructure investments. Using cross-sectional and panel regressions with national-level decadal data, we find some evidence that electricity availability has a significant effect on subsequent economic growth. However, much of the effect disappears once suitable controls are included. We examine various dimensions of electricity availability, including electricity consumption quantity, generation capacity, residential access rate, and quality of electricity supply. It appears that electricity availability is best viewed as something that can be scaled up as economies grow rather than something that imposes binding constraints on subsequent economic growth.
Q43|Energy intensity, growth and technical change|World and U.S. energy intensities have declined over the past century, falling at an average rate of approximately 1.2–1.5 percent a year. The decline has persisted through periods of stagnating or even falling energy prices, suggesting the decline is driven in large part by autonomous factors, independent of price changes. In this paper, we use directed technical change theory to understand the autonomous decline in energy intensity and investigate whether the decline will continue. We show in an economy with no state-dependence, where existing knowledge does not make R&D more profitable, energy intensity continues to decline, albeit at a slower rate than output growth, due to energy-augmenting innovation. However, in an economy with extreme state-dependence, energy intensity eventually stops declining because labor-augmenting innovation crowds out energy-augmenting innovation. Our empirical analysis of energy intensity in 100 countries between 1970 and 2010 suggests a scenario without extreme state dependence where energy intensity continues to decline; in either case, energy intensity never declines faster than output grows, and so energy use always increases, as long as the extraction cost of energy stays constant.
Q43|The Impact of China’s Electricity Deregulation on Coal and Power Industries: Two-stage Game Modeling Approach|The regulated price mechanism in China’s power industry has attracted much criticism because of its incapability to optimize the allocation of resources. To build an “open, orderly, competitive and complete” power market system, the Chinese government launched an unprecedented marketization reform in 2015 to deregulate the electricity price. This paper examines the impact of the electricity price deregulation in the industry level. We first construct two-stage dynamic game models by taking the coal and coal-fired power industries as the players. Using the models, we compare analytically the equilibriums with and without electricity regulation, and examine the changes in electricity price, electricity generation, coal price and coal traded quantity. The theoretical analyses show that there are three intervals of the regulated electricity sales prices which influence the impact of electricity price deregulation. Next, we collect empirical data to estimate the parameters in the game models, and simulate the influence of electricity deregulation on the two industries in terms of market outcome and industrial profitability. Our results suggest that the actual regulated electricity price falls within the medium interval of the theoretical results, which means the price deregulation will result in higher electricity sales price but lower coal price, less coal traded amount and less electricity generation amount. The robustness analysis shows that our results hold with respect to the electricity generation efficiency and price elasticity of electricity demand.
Q43|Energy Price Reform in China| The Chinese leadership has determined to assign the market a decisive role in allocating resources. To have the market to play that role, getting the energy prices right is crucial because this sends clear signals to both producers and consumers of energy. While the overall trend of China’s energy pricing reform since 1984 has been moving away from the prices set by the central government in the centrally planned economy and towards a more market-oriented pricing mechanism, the pace and scale of the reform differ across energy types. This article discusses the evolution of price reforms for coal, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity and renewable power in China, and provides some analysis of these energy price reforms, in order to have the market to play a decisive role in allocating resources and help China’s transition to a low-carbon economy.
Q43|Achieving China's energy and climate policy targets in 2030 under multiple uncertainties|The stringency of China's energy and climate targets in 2030 and the policy needed to realize these targets are full of controversy, mainly as a result of multiple future uncertainties. This study has developed a stochastic energy-economy-environment integrated model, to assess China's energy and climate targets in 2030, with a particular focus on the carbon intensity reduction, carbon emission peaking, and non-fossil energy development. The probabilities of realizing the targets are obtained, and the nexus among different targets is explored. It's argued that carbon emission management and policy-making should be implemented from the perspective of risk management, and policy makers can take corresponding policy measures based on the degree of confidence required under multiple future uncertainties. It is found that the probabilities of realizing carbon emission-peaking target and non-fossil energy target are low, with the business-as-usual efforts, and additional policies may still be needed. More specific, carbon pricing plays a major role in curbing and peaking carbon emissions, while the policy mix of carbon pricing and non-fossil energy subsidies can peak the carbon emission with relatively low cost compared to the single carbon pricing policy. It is also found that the carbon intensity reduction target is most likely to be attained, followed by the carbon-peaking target, and then the non-fossil energy target, given the same policy efforts. This indicates that, China may not deliberately increase carbon emissions rapidly over the next decade to make the carbon emission peak as high as possible; otherwise, it may be difficult to achieve the non-fossil energy target.
Q43|Spillover Dynamics Across Price Inflation and Selected Agricultural Commodity Prices|This article contributes to the existing empirical literature by examining the spillovers across price inflation and agricultural commodity prices in the case of Nigeria. To achieve this objective, we employ the Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) spillover index. Subsequently, we examine the directional spillover, total spillover, and net spillover indexes. Further analysis to capture cyclical and secular movements were addressed with 40 months of subsamples via the rolling window analysis. Our empirical results, based on the monthly frequency data from January 2006 to July 2016 show that the total spillover effect was about 75%. This suggests a high interconnectedness of the selected agricultural commodity prices and inflation. Our study further reveal that inflation, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat were net receivers while cocoa, barley, groundnut, maize, rice were net givers. We find a negative net spillover for price inflation, implying a net positive spillover from commodity prices to price inflation These outcomes have inherent policy implications for the government administrators, farmers, investors and all stakeholders.
Q43|Dynamic return and volatility spillovers among S&P 500, crude oil and gold|This paper examines the return and volatility spillover effects among S&P 500, crude oil and gold by employing the spillover index of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012). Monthly realized volatility and return series covering the period from January 1986 to August 2018 are used to examine the return and volatility spillovers. Our findings indicate a bi-directional return and volatility spillover among these assets. The full sample empirical evidence is consistent with the structure in which oil plays a central role in the information transmission mechanism. The role of oil and gold as a safe haven has changed over time in financial and non-financial economic turbulence time-span. Commodity market financialization has decreased the effectiveness of adding commodities to portfolios after 2002.
Q43|Objective vs. Subjective Fuel Poverty and Self-Assessed Health|Policies towards fuel poverty often use relative or absolute measures. The effectiveness of the official indicators in identifying fuel poor households and assessing its impact on health is an emerging social policy issue. In this paper we analyse objective and perceived fuel poverty as determinants of self-assessed health in Spain. In 2014, 5.1 million of her population could not afford to heat their homes to an adequate temperature. We propose a latent class ordered probit model to analyse the influence of fuel poverty on self-reported health in a sample of 25,000 individuals in 11,000 households for the 2011-2014 period. This original approach allows us to include a ‘subjective’ measure of fuel poverty in the class membership probabilities and purge the influence of the ‘objective’ measure of fuel poverty on self-assessed health. The results show that poor housing conditions, fuel poverty, and material deprivation have a negative impact on health. Also, individuals who rate themselves as fuel poor tend to report poorer health status. The effect of objective fuel poverty on health is stronger when unobserved heterogeneity of individuals is controlled for. Since objective measures alone may not fully capture the adverse effect of fuel poverty on health, we advocate the use of approaches that allow a combination of objective and subjective measures and its application by policy-makers. Moreover, it is important that policies to tackle fuel poverty take into account the different energy vectors and the prospects of a future smart and integrated energy system.
Q43|The Intergenerational Incidence Of Green Tax Reform|We examine the lifetime incidence and intergenerational distributional effects of an economy-wide carbon tax swap using a numerical dynamic general equilibrium model with overlapping generations of the U.S. economy. We highlight various fundamental choices in policy design including (1) the level of the initial carbon tax, (2) the growth rate of the carbon tax trajectory of over time, and (3) alternative ways for revenue recycling. Without revenue recycling, we find that generations born before the tax is introduced experience smaller welfare losses, or even gain, relative to future generations. For sufficiently low growth rates of the tax trajectory, the impacts for distant future generations decrease over time. For future generations born after the introduction of the tax, the negative welfare impacts are the smallest (largest) when revenues are recycled through lowering pre-existing capital income taxes (through per-capita lump-sum rebates). For generations born before the tax is introduced, we find that lump-sum rebates favor very old generations and labor (capital) income tax recycling favors very young generations (generations of intermediate age).
Q43|Economics of Climate Change: Introducing the Basic Climate Economic (BCE) Model|The paper develops the Basic Climate Economic (BCE) model featuring the core elements of climate economics and climate policy. The BCE model incorpo- rates fossil stock depletion, pollution stock accumulation, endogenous growth, and climate-induced capital depreciation. We first use graphical analysis to show the effects of climate change and climate policy on economic growth. In- tuition for the different model mechanisms, the functional forms, and the effects of different climate policies is provided. We then show the model equations in mathematical terms to derive closed-form solutions and to run model simula- tions relating to the graphical part. Finally, we compare our setup to other models of climate economics.
Q43|Does Higher Energy Efficiency Lower Economy-Wide Energy Use?|We develop a general equilibrium growth model with capital and energy use to examine the hypothesis that economy-wide energy use increases with energy efficiency. To obtain energy use that would have occurred in the absence of energy efficiency changes, chosen energy efficiency is induced by technological change. Viewing technological change in form of changes in the cost of capital and energy producing energy services enables us to control for the sources of energy efficiency improvements in a counterfactual setting. Calibrating the model to the post-WWII U.S. economy, we find that higher energy efficiency increased rather than reduced energy use, because lower capital cost enhanced energy use by more than the increase in energy cost reduced it. This casts strong doubts on the view that energy-saving technological change has lowered fossil energy use.
Q43|The impact of green preferences on the relevance of history versus expectations|In an OLG model with multiple steady states we analyse the impact of endogenous environmental policies on the relevance of history and expectations for the equilibrium selection. In a polluting regime environmental preferences cause an increasing energy tax which raises the risk that the economy transits to the inferior equilibrium under pessimistic expectations. However, higher environmental preferences imply an earlier switch to the clean energy regime. Then, the conflict between production and environmental preferences is resolved and the prospects to select the superior equilibrium improve, since positive expectations become more relevant. In an empirical analysis we find that people with environmental preferences tend to have more optimistic expectations about economic development. Using these findings to analyse the steady state dynamics implies that agents with environmental preferences support higher energy taxes and switch faster to clean production. Due to their optimism, the likelihood to reach the superior stable steady state increases.
Q43|Carbon Pricing, Technology Transition, and Skill-Based Development|We derive the optimal contributions to global climate policy when countries differ with respect to income level and pollution intensity. Countries's growth rates are determined endogenously, and abatement effciency is improved by technical progress. We show that country heterogeneity has a crucial impact on optimal policy contributions: more developed countries have to make a larger effort while less developed countries are allowed to graduate under a less stringent environmental regime. The optimal allocation of pollution per- mits depends on international trade. In the absence of international permit trade, more developed countries should receive more permits than the less developed countries but permit prices are higher in the rich countries. With international permit trade, more developed countries receive less permits than the less developed. When global distribution of physical capital is uneven and the aggregate pollution ceiling is low, poor countries receive all the permits and incomes do not converge, even with free trade.
Q43|Carbon Pricing, Technology Transition, and Skill-Based Development|We analyze the impact of carbon prices on human capital accumulation, sectoral change, and economic growth. In our framework output is produced with dirty and/or clean technologies using skilled and unskilled labor as inputs. Carbon policy affects technology selection which transmits incentives for human capital formation. We show that a temporary policy may be sufficient for a transition to a clean economy and that such a policy also stimulates economic growth. Moreover, in the presence of inter-country knowledge spillovers, a carbon policy in the North helps human capital formation in the South and induces South’s transition to the clean steady state.
Q43|From residential energy demand to fuel poverty: income-induced non-linearities in the reactions of households to energy price fluctuations|The residential energy demand is growing steadily and the trend is expected to continue in the near future. At the same time, under the impulse of economic crises and environmental and energy policies, many households have experienced reductions in real income and higher energy prices. In the residential sector, the number of fuel-poor households is thus expected to rise. A better understanding of the determinants of residential energy demand, in particular of the role of income and the sensitivity of households to changes in energy prices, is crucial in the context of recurrent debates on energy efficiency and fuel poverty. We propose a panel threshold regression (PTR) model to empirically test the sensitivity of French households to energy price fluctuations Ð as measured by the elasticity of residential heating energy prices Ð and to analyze the overlap between their income and fuel poverty profiles. The PTR model allows to test for the non-linear effect of income on the reactions of households to fluctuations in energy prices. Thus, it can identify specific regimes differing by their level of estimated price elasticities. Each regime represents an elasticity-homogeneous group of households. The number of these regimes is determined based on an endogenously PTR-fixed income threshold. Thereafter, we analyze the composition of the regimes (i.e. groups) to locate the dominant proportion of fuel-poor households and analyse their monetary poverty characteristics. Results show that, depending on the income level, we can identify two groups of households that react differently to residential energy price fluctuations and that fuel-poor households belong mostly to the group of households with the highest elasticity. By extension, results also show that income poverty does not necessarily mean fuel poverty. In terms of public policy, we suggest focusing on income heterogeneity by considering different groups of households separately when defining energy efficiency measures. We also suggest paying particular attention to targeting fuel-poor households by examining the overlap between fuel and income poverty.

Q43|How shifting investment towards low-carbon sectors impacts employment: Three determinants under scrutiny|The threat of climate change requires redirecting investment towards low-carbon sectors, and this shift generates heated debates about its impact on employment. Many studies exist, most of which use CGE or Input-Output (IO) models. However, the economic mechanisms at play remain unclear. This paper disentangles the channels of job creation and studies to what extent the results of simpler IO models diverge from CGE results.
Q43|Modelling Electric Vehicles as an Abatement Technology in a Hybrid CGE Model|We present a novel methodology to quantify the social costs and benefits (net social costs) of electric vehicles as an endogenous, demand-driven abatement technology in a general equilibrium framework. This new costing approach relates general equilibrium effects resulting from an increased market penetration of electric vehicles to the external environmental and health effects of the corresponding change in emissions. To this end, we develop a hybrid model combining a computable general equilibrium (CGE) with a discrete choice (DC) model that is capable of depicting an endogenous demand-driven uptake of alternative fuel vehicles. The discrete choice model of the consumer purchase decision between conventional, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles is directly integrated into the CGE model. This hybrid CGE-DC model features a detailed accounting of vehicle fleet development, including yearly numbers of vehicle purchases and cohort depreciation. It depicts nine households differentiated by the degree of urbanization and education, accounts for detailed consumer preferences for the purchase of a passenger vehicle and mode choice decisions. The hybrid CGE-DC model is additionally hard-linked to a bottom-up module for elektricity production by several technologies to provide input for an established impact pathway analysis to quantify the external costs relating to the changed composition of the vehicle fleet and technologies to generate electricity. We apply this methodology to Austria as an empirical example, considering current measures and trends for the uptake of electric vehicles into the vehicle fleet. In particular, we quantify the net social costs of additional measures to foster the introduction of electromobility that are part of the current policy discussion in Austria, and thus provide a blueprint for further application in different national contexts.
Q43|Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform in the Developing World: Who Wins, Who Loses, and Why?|Fossil fuel subsidies are widespread in developing countries, where reform efforts are often derailed by disputes over the likely distribution of gains and losses. The impacts of subsidy reform are transmitted to households through changes in energy prices and prices of other goods and services, as well as through factor earnings. Most empirical studies focus on consumer expenditures alone, and computable general equilibrium analyses typically report only total effects without decomposing them by source. Meanwhile, analytical models neglect important open-economy characteristics relevant to developing countries. In this paper, we develop an analytical model of a small open economy with a preexisting fossil fuel subsidy and identify direct and indirect impacts of subsidy reform on real household incomes. Our results, illustrated with data from Viet Nam, highlight two important drivers of distributional change: (i) the mix of tradable and nontradable goods, reflecting the structure of a trade-dependent economy; and (ii) household heterogeneity in sources of factor income.
Q43|Energy Market Integration and Electricity Trade: A gravity model|This paper explores energy trade in the electrical market by proving a solid theoretical model along with a comprehensive empirical analysis. The model rests on standard goods trade gravity models, which we adapt to energy trade in the electrical market. We derive a tractable gravity equation, which we then estimate with standard gravity techniques. We use energy trade ows between European countries to quantify the effect of economic, structural, cultural and institutional variables on energy ows. The results reveal that energy trade determinants are similar to trade in goods, and that standard notion of international economics like comparative advantage emerge in energy economics. However, we observe some distinctive traits. Our results suggest that energy trade ows are mainly driven by demand at the importer due to an increase in economic activity and institutional agreements in the context of energy integration.
Q43|Energy price reform in China|China has determined to assign the market a decisive role in allocating resources. To that end, getting energy prices right is crucial because this sends clear signals to both producers and consumers of energy. While the overall trend of China’s energy pricing reform since 1984 has been moving away from the prices set by the central government in the centrally planned economy and towards a more market-oriented pricing mechanism, the pace and scale of the reform differ across energy types. This article discusses the evolution of price reforms for coal, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity and renewable power in China, and provides some analysis of these energy price reforms, in order to allow the market to play a decisive role in resource allocation and help China’s transition to a low-carbon economy.
Q43|Interpreting the Oil Risk Premium: do Oil Price Shocks Matter?|This paper provides an analysis of the link between the global market for crude oil and oil futures risk premium at the aggregate level. It offers empirical evidence on whether the compensation for risk required by the speculators depends on the type of the structural shock of interest. Understanding the response of the risk premium to unexpected changes in the price of oil can be useful to address some research questions, among which: what is the relationship between crude oil risk premium and unexpected rise in the price of oil? On average, what should speculators expect to receive as a compensation for the risk they are taking on? This work is based on a Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) model of the crude oil market. Two main results emerge. First, the impulse response analysis provides evidence of a negative relationship between the risk premium and the changes in the price of oil triggered by shocks to economic fundamentals. Second, this analysis shows that the historical decline of the risk premium can be modelled as a part of endogenous effect of the oil market driven shocks.
Q43|Investment-Uncertainty Relationship in the Oil and Gas Industry|Recent studies on oil market demonstrate endogeneity of oil price by modeling it as a function of consumption and precautionary demands and producersâ€™ supply. However, studies analysing the effect of oil price uncertainty on investment, do not disentangle uncertainties raised by underlying components playing a role in oil market. Accordingly, this study investigates the relationship between investment and uncertainty for a panel of U.S. firms operating in oil and gas industry with a new approach. We decompose oil price volatility to be driven by structural shocks that are recognized in oil market literature, over and above other determinants, to study whether investment uncertainty relationship depends on the drivers of uncertainty. Our findings suggest that oil market uncertainty lowers investment only when it is caused by global consumption demand shocks. Stock market uncertainty is found to have a negative effect on investment with a year of delay. The results suggest no positive relation between irreversible investment and uncertainty, but interestingly, positive relation exists for reversible investment. This finding is in line with the option theory of investment and implies that irreversibility effect of increased uncertainty dominates the traditional convexity effect.
Q43|“Unbiased estimation of autoregressive models for bounded stochastic processes”|The paper investigates the estimation bias of autoregressive models for bounded stochastic processes and the performance of the standard procedures in the literature that aim to correcting the estimation bias. It is shown that, in some cases, the bounded nature of the stochastic processes worsen the estimation bias effect, which suggests the design of bound-specific bias correction methods. The paper focuses on two popular autoregressive estimation bias correction procedures which are extended to cover bounded stochastic processes. Finite sample performance analysis of the new proposal is carried out using Monte Carlo simulations which reveal that accounting for the bounded nature of the stochastic processes leads to improvements in the estimation of autoregressive models. Finally, an illustration is given using the current account balance of some developed countries, whose shocks persistence measures are computed.
Q43|How Does Stock Market Volatility React To Oil Price Shocks?|We study the impact of oil price shocks on the U.S. stock market volatility. We jointly analyze three different structural oil market shocks (i.e., aggregate demand, oil supply, and oil-specific demand shocks) and stock market volatility using a structural vector autoregressive model. Identification is achieved by assuming that the price of crude oil reacts to stock market volatility only with delay. This implies that innovations to the price of crude oil are not strictly exogenous, but predetermined with respect to the stock market. We show that volatility responds significantly to oil price shocks caused by unexpected changes in aggregate and oil-specific demand, whereas the impact of supply-side shocks is negligible.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q43|Oil volatility, oil and gas firms and portfolio diversification|This paper investigates the volatility spillovers and co-movements among oil prices and stock prices of major oil and gas corporations over the period between 18th June 2001 and 1st February 2016. To do so, we use the spillover index approach by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012, 2014, 2015) and the dynamic correlation coefficient model of Engle (2002) so as to identify the transmission mechanisms of volatility shocks and the contagion of volatility among oil prices and stock prices of oil and gas companies, respectively. Given that volatility transmission across oil and major oil and gas corporations is important for portfolio diversification and risk management, we also examine optimal weights and hedge ratios among the aforementioned series. Our results point to the existence of significant volatility spillover effects among oil and oil and gas companies' stock volatility. However, the spillover is usually unidirectional from oil and gas companies' stock volatility to oil volatility, with BP, CHEVRON, EXXON, SHELL and TOTAL being the major net transmitters of volatility to oil markets. Conditional correlations are positive and time-varying, with those between each of the aforementioned companies and oil being the highest. Finally, the diversification benefits and hedging effectiveness based on our results are discussed.
Q43|Did U.S. Consumers Respond to the 2014–2015 Oil Price Shock? Evidence from the Consumer Expenditure Survey|The impact of oil price shocks on the U.S. economy is a topic of considerable debate. In this paper, we examine the response of U.S. consumers to the 2014–2015 negative oil price shock using representative survey data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey. We propose a difference-in-difference identification strategy based on two factors, vehicle ownership and gasoline reliance, which generate variation in exposure to oil price shocks across consumers. Our findings suggest that exposed consumers significantly increased their spending relative to non-exposed consumers when oil prices fell, and that the average marginal propensity to consume out of gasoline savings was above 1. Across products, we find that consumers increased spending especially on transportation goods and non-essential items.
Q43|The propagation of regional shocks in housing markets: Evidence from oil price shocks in Canada|Shocks to the demand for housing that originate in one region may seem important only for that regional housing market. We provide evidence that such shocks can also affect housing markets in other regions. Our analysis focuses on the response of Canadian housing markets to oil price shocks. Oil price shocks constitute an important source of exogenous regional variation in income in Canada because oil production is highly geographically concentrated. We document that, at the national level, real oil price shocks account for 11% of the variability in real house price growth over time. At the regional level, we find that unexpected increases in the real price of oil raise housing demand and real house prices not only in oil-producing regions, but also in other regions. We develop a theoretical model of the propagation of real oil price shocks across regions that helps understand this finding. The model differentiates between oil-producing and non-oil-producing regions and incorporates multiple sectors, trade between provinces, government redistribution, and consumer spending on fuel. We empirically confirm the model prediction that oil price shocks are propagated to housing markets in non-oil-producing regions by the government redistribution of oil revenue and by increased interprovincial trade.
Q43|Decoupling of C02 Emissions and GDP: A Time-Varying Cointegration Approach|The relationship between CO2 emissions, the main gas responsible for global warming, and economic growth is among the most studied themes of environmental economics. Reducing overall emissions while keeping a high pace of economic development is at the heart of the notion of sustainable development. Economists refer to the case when emissions increase (resp. decrease) less rapidly than the pace of economic growth as relative (resp. absolute) decoupling. This requires the empirical analysis of the emissions-GDP relationship. The study of this relationship has special importance for developed countries, since they have been historically the main contributors of the global warming. Unlike the bulk of the literature, in this paper we allow the income elasticity of emissions – a critical metrics for the study of decoupling – to vary over time. The reason is that the elasticity might change through the time due to the factors affecting the drivers of the CO2 emissions. We use a time-varying coefficients cointegration approach to investigate the CO2 emissions-GDP relationship for 12 Western European countries over a long period ranging from 1861 to 2015. The main finding is that the income elasticities of CO2 emissions are found to be positive in all investigated countries. In addition, we find evidence in favor of relative decoupling – emissions increasing more slowly than GDP – in 8 out of the 12 European countries. The remaining 4 cases the income elasticity of CO2 emissions are in excess of unity. In nearly half of cases the analysis confirms a statistically significant time-varying pattern for the income elasticities.
Q43|The Impact of Economic Growth on CO2 Emissions in Azerbaijan|This paper examines the relationship between the economic growth and CO2 emissions in Azerbaijan.A cointegration analysis is conducted over the period 1992-2013. For getting more robust results, Johansen, ARDLBT, DOLS, FMOLS and CCR methods to explore cointegration and estimate longrun coefficients are employed. We use cubic, quadratic and linear specifications and conclude that the last one is an adequate representation for the impact of the economic growth on CO2 emissions in Azerbaijan. The results from the different cointegration methods are consistent with each other and show that the economic growth has positive and significant impact on the emissions in the long-run implying that the EKC hypothesis does not hold for Azerbaijan. Moreover, we find that any short-run disequilibrium can be corrected towards the long-run equilibrium path within less than one year. The paper concludes that increasing the energy efficiency can be considered as a relevant environmental policy in order to reduce the carbon emissions.
Q43|Do heterogeneous countries respond differently to oil price shocks?|The article studies the macroeconomic impact of oil price changes in 17 highly heterogeneous countries classified in six groups: advanced, emerging, oil producer, non-oil producers, with energy price controls and without energy price controls. The results show that despite analyzed countries differ in several dimensions, most differences regarding oil price shocks impacts can be captured comparing two groups: advanced vs. emerging. Moreover, most of the differences in the way countries react to oil price shocks come from the source of the shock rather than by the group which the countries belong to. Remarkably, there are no significant differences in the response of industrial production between oil and non-oil producer countries. We posit, as potential explanations of the later finding the decline in the energy intensity of the global economy and the degree of trade openness.
Q43|A well-timed raise in inflation targets|A raise in inflation targets would be viable if implemented strategically, that is, at the time of a pickup in demand. Policy interest rates would not be constrained by the zero-bound as the result of a balance between two forces: first, policy interest rates must drop under a raise in the inflation target; and second, policy interest rates must rise under a pickup in demand. We use a simple new-Keynesian, semi-structural model to find the natural rate as well as other non observables, including inflation expectations, for a group of advanced economies. We also use the model to explain the role of demand and monetary policy in the evolution of inflation and the output gap. The document shows how a sizable drop in the natural rate pushed policy interest rates against the zero-bound. **** Un aumento en las metas de inflación es viable, si se implementa estratégicamente, es decir, durante un repunte de la demanda. Las tasas de interés no estarían restringidas por el límite cero como resultado de un balance entre dos fuerzas: primero, las tasas de política deben caer bajo un aumento en la meta de inflación; y segundo, deben aumentar ante un aumento en la demanda. Utilizamos un modelo sencillo, neo keynesiano y semi estructural para encontrar la tasa natural así como otros no observables, incluidas las expectativas de inflación, para un grupo de economías avanzadas. También utilizamos el modelo para estudiar el papel de la demanda y la política monetaria en la evolución de la inflación y la brecha del producto. El documento muestra cómo una considerable caída en la tasa natural empujó las tasas de interés de política contra el límite cero.
Q43|Central Bank Reputation and Inflation-Unemployment Performance: Empirical Evidence from an Executive Survey of 62 Countries|Although there is a well-established theoretical literature that links central bank (CB) reputation with inflation performance following Barro and Gordon, there is little empirical work testing the relationship rigorously. This paper empirically tests the impact of reputation on inflation-unemployment performance using a novel set of data on CB reputation--an annual local business manager survey on central bank policy covering 62 countries during 1995-2016. This paper finds that CB reputation is a significant determinant of inflation: the results of an FE panel and Arellano-Bond difference GMM model show that high-reputation CBs have achieved better inflation performances over the past 20 years with lower levels of inflation than others, holding the output gap and unemployment rate constant. This result remains robust to various control variables including money growth, past inflation levels, exchange rates, and financial crisis dummies. This paper also finds that high CB reputation is associated with a tight anchoring of inflation expectations to inflation targets in inflation-targeting countries. The effects of reputation on the volatility of inflation and unemployment rates are found to be not robust. This paper offers evidence of the opposite-direction causality as well that goes from high inflation to decreased CB reputation.
Q43|How the Financial Market Can Dampen the Effects of Commodity Price Shocks|Commodities have begun to function as an asset class during the past decade, as trading in commodity derivatives has increased massively since the 2000s. This paper studies the role of commodities as an asset class in accounting for the recently lessened impacts of commodity price shocks on the economy, by constructing a model with financial frictions and with financial intermediaries that own two assets ? tied to commodities as well as to capital. Simulation results of the model show that financial intermediaries¡¯ holdings of commodities as assets have contributed to the recent reduction in the effects of commodity price shocks.
Q43|Transmission of U.S. Monetary Policy to Commodity Exporters and Importers|This paper studies international transmission of U.S. monetary policy shocks to commodity exporters and importers. After first showing empirically that the shocks have stronger effects on commodity exporters than on importers, I then augment a standard three-country model to include commodities. Consistent with the empirical evidence, the model indicates that an expansionary monetary policy shock to the U.S. increases the aggregate output of commodity exporters by more than that of importers. This is because the increased U.S. aggregate demand triggered by the shock leads to greater U.S. demand for commodities and higher real commodity prices, and thus the exports of commodity exporters increase relative to those of commodity importers. Furthermore, I show that if commodity exporters¡¯ currencies are pegged to the U.S. dollar, then the U.S. monetary policy shocks have stronger spillovers to commodity exporters and importers. In the event that the U.S. becomes a net energy exporter, the shocks will have weaker effects on commodity exporters and stronger impacts on importers.
Q43|Objective vs. Subjective Fuel Poverty and Self-Assessed Health|Policies towards fuel poverty often use relative or absolute measures. The effectiveness of the official indicators in identifying fuel poor households and assessing its impact on health is an emerging social policy issue. In this paper we analyse objective and perceived fuel poverty as determinants of self-assessed health in Spain. In 2014, 5.1 million of her population could not afford to heat their homes to an adequate temperature. We propose a latent class ordered probit model to analyse the influence of fuel poverty on self-reported health in a sample of 25,000 individuals in 11,000 households for the 2011-2014 period. This original approach allows us to include a ‘subjective’ measure of fuel poverty in the class membership probabilities and purge the influence of the ‘objective’ measure of fuel poverty on self-assessed health. The results show that poor housing conditions, fuel poverty, and material deprivation have a negative impact on health. Also, individuals who rate themselves as fuel poor tend to report poorer health status. The effect of objective fuel poverty on health is stronger when unobserved heterogeneity of individuals is controlled for. Since objective measures alone may not fully capture the adverse effect of fuel poverty on health, we advocate the use of approaches that allow a combination of objective and subjective measures and its application by policy-makers. Moreover, it is important that policies to tackle fuel poverty take into account the different energy vectors and the prospects of a future smart and integrated energy system.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q43|Oil Prices and GCC Stock Markets: New Evidence from Smooth Transition Models|Our paper examines the effect of oil price changes on Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) stock markets using nonlinear smooth transition regression (STR) models. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our empirical results reveal that GCC stock markets do not have similar sensitivities to oil price changes. We document the presence of stock market returns’ asymmetric reactions in some GCC countries, but not for others. In Kuwait’s case, negative oil price changes exert larger impacts on stock returns than positive oil price changes. When considering the asymmetry with respect to the magnitude of oil price variation, we find that Oman’s and Qatar’s stock markets are more sensitive to large oil price changes than to small ones. Our results highlight the importance of economic stabilization and reform policies that can potentially reduce the sensitivity of stock returns to oil price changes, especially with regard to the existence of asymmetric behavior.
Q43|The energy efficiency rebound effect in general equilibrium|We develop a stylized general equilibrium model to decompose the rebound effect of energy efficiency improvements into its partial and general equilibrium components. In our theoretical analysis, we identify key drivers of the general equilibrium rebound effect, including a composition channel, an energy price channel, a labor supply channel, and a growth channel. Based on numerical simulations with both the stylized model as well as a large-scale computable general equilibrium model of the global economy, we show that both general and partial equilibrium components of the rebound effect can be substantial. Our benchmark parameterization suggests a total rebound effect due to an exogenous energy efficiency improvement in the US manufacturing sector of 67% with roughly two-thirds occurring through the partial equilibrium rebound channel and the remaining one-third occurring through the general equilibrium rebound channel
Q43|Structural Interpretation of Vector Autoregressions with Incomplete Identification: Revisiting the Role of Oil Supply and Demand Shocks: Comment|Recently, Baumeister and Hamilton (henceforth: BH) have argued that existing studies of the global oil market fail to account for uncertainty about their identifying assumptions. They recommend an alternative econometric approach intended to address this concern by formulating priors on the structural model parameters. We demonstrate that in practice BH are unable to parameterize identification uncertainty without falling back on ad hoc prior specifications. They are also unable to show that earlier studies did not impose all relevant identifying information. In fact, to the extent that BH’s substantive conclusions differ from earlier studies, these differences do not reflect their use of a superior econometric methodology, but mainly the imposition of a highly unrealistic prior for the global impact price elasticity of oil supply. Once identification uncertainty about the global price elasticity of oil supply is accounted for by specifying a prior more in line with extraneous evidence and economic theory, the substantive results of earlier oil market studies are reaffirmed. We also refute BH’s claim that existing oil market studies are invalid or not robust. Finally, we explain why the BH method is not a strict generalization of existing methods. It is, in fact, not designed to be applied to state-or-the-art oil market models because key assumptions of the proposed approach are not met in these models.
Q43|Oil Price Fluctuations and Exchange Rate Dynamics in the MENA Region: Evidence from Non-Causality-in- Variance and Asymmetric Non-Causality Tests|The aim of this paper is to investigate the exchange rate consequences of oil-price fluctuations and to test for the dynamics of oil price volatility by examining interactions between oil market and exchange rate in selected MENA countries (Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and UAE). Using daily time series data covering the period from January 1, 2001 to December 29, 2017, we implement the test for asymmetric non-causality of Hatemi-J (2012), the asymmetric generalized impulse response functions of Hatemi-J (2014), and the test for noncausality-in-variance of Hafner and Herwartz (2006) to examine the presence of volatility spillover between oil prices and exchange rates return series. The econometric investigation reveals in particular that i) when prices are rising in Tunisia and Saudi Arabia, oil prices cause change in exchange rates, and ii) there is significant evidence of volatility spillovers from oil markets to exchange rate markets in the selected MENA countries. These findings have important implications both from the investor's and from the policy-maker's perspective.
Q43|Mercado eléctrico en Colombia: transición hacia una arquitectura descentralizada|El sector eléctrico de Colombia se transformó profunda y positivamente con la reforma de las Leyes 142 y 143 de 1994. La liberalización del mercado, la introducción de formación de precios competitiva en generación, la regulación por incentivos en transmisión y distribución, los avances institucionales en regulación (creación de la CREG) y en supervisión de las firmas reguladas (SSPD) sirvieron de inspiración internacional por lo menos durante cinco años. Con el tiempo se han acumulado problemas y han aparecido oportunidades de mejora del mercado. Hay que aumentar la competencia, diversificar el portafolio de generación, ayudar a monetizar los recursos locales embebidos en las redes de distribución y modernizar la arquitectura de mercado y la regulación. El trabajo consta de cinco capítulos, además de este resumen. El capítulo 1 presenta las características de la electricidad como bien económico y compara la evolución del mercado eléctrico del Reino Unido (la experiencia original) con el de Colombia. El capítulo 2 discute los problemas centrales del modelo colombiano. El capítulo 3 identifica oportunidades. El capítulo 4 compila las propuestas. El capítulo 5 concluye. Los mensajes centrales del trabajo son: • Los precios de generación son crecientes y la competencia es baja. • El portafolio de generación está alejado de la frontera eficiente de costos y riesgos. • El mecanismo de entrada (cargo por confiabilidad) es ineficaz para tecnologías que pueden reducir el riesgo de suministro y los costos de generación. • La arquitectura de mercado y la regulación están desactualizadas. • Las energías renovables, los recursos energéticos descentralizados y el impulso a la generación con gas licuado solucionarán problemas y crearán opciones.
Q43|Costo económico de la inestabilidad y debilidad institucional de la gestión socio-ambiental de los proyectos de inversión en los sectores de minería energía e infraestructura en Colombia|Foro de un grupo de empresas que analizan el entorno de las inversiones con el propósito de hacer diagnósticos y recomendaciones para la remoción de los obstáculos al buen funcionamiento de los mercados y su regulación. Encomiendan un estudio a Fedesarrollo para determinar el impacto de la debilidad institucional y de la inestabilidad normativa en la gestión socio ambiental de los grandes proyectos de inversión de Colombia. Aquí presentamos únicamente los mineros y de hidrocarburos.
Q43|Mercado eléctrico en Colombia: Transición hacia una arquitectura descentralizada|El sector eléctrico de Colombia avanzó notablemente con la reforma de las Leyes 142 y 143 de 1994. Se introdujeron mecanismos de mercado en generación, se regularon las actividades de transmisión y distribución, y se llegó a la solvencia económica de las empresas sectoriales. Por lo menos durante cinco años, el mercado eléctrico sirvió de modelo para reformas internacionales. Con el paso del tiempo, los mercados y la regulación eléctrica han avanzado en Colombia con menos velocidad que en muchos otros países y se han acumulado problemas. Se debe aumentar la competencia en generación, se debe promover la configuración de un portafolio de generación más diversificado, se deben promover con mayor vigor las energías renovables no convencionales y preparar el camino para una arquitectura de mercado en que convivan el sistema de potencia centralizado y descentralizados, sin restricciones a la comercialización de excedentes de recursos distribuidos. El trabajo consta de cinco capítulos, además de este resumen. El capítulo 1 presenta las características de la electricidad como bien económico y compara la evolución del mercado eléctrico del Reino Unido (la experiencia original) con el de Colombia. El capítulo 2 discute los problemas centrales del modelo colombiano. El capítulo 3 identifica oportunidades. El capítulo 4 compila las propuestas. El capítulo 5 concluye. Las medidas específicas más importantes que surgen del presente trabajo son: (i) la introducción de un mercado de contratos estandarizados y anónimos, (ii) la introducción de planificación integrada de recur-sos, con un enfoque de portafolio, (iii) la construcción de una planta regasificadora en la Costa Pacífica, (iv) introducción de medidas habilitantes para la adopción de recursos energéticos descentralizados, que incluye la introducción de medidores inteligentes, precios nodales, entre otras; y (v) realización de pilotos con operadores de distribución y con agregadores de recursos descentralizados.

Q43|Shale oil revolution: Implications for oil dependent countries|The International Energy Agency (IEA) recently announces that the explosive increases in the United States oil output, particularly from shale oil, would make the country become worldâ€™s top oil producer and eventually exporter ahead of Saudi Arabia and Asia in the coming years. Motivated by this projection, we therefore examine the implications of the US shale oil on oil exports of OPEC and selected non-OPEC countries using the Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) approach. Our results reveal that the US oil supply shocks particularly those due to shale oil are critical in the output and supply decisions of OPEC and major non-OPEC oil exporters. Underestimating the potential consequences of US overtaken the current world oil giants and failure to put in place critical structural shifts by these countries, especially alternative revenue sources, pose a potential threat to their growth prospects.
Q43|Forecasting GDP of OPEC: The role of oil price|In this paper, we examine the role of oil in GDP forecast of selected OPEC member countries using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag Mixed Data Sampling (ADL-MIDAS) approach. Both the in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts of this approach are evaluated and compared with some competing models namely AR(1), ARFIMA, ARIMA and ARDL models. We find that allowing for high frequency oil price data in the predictive model of GDP will enhance its forecast performance. The ADL-MIDAS is found to out-perform all the competing models for both the in-sample and out-of-sample forecast. In addition, we find that the higher the data frequency of oil price, the better the forecast performance. These results are robust to different data frequencies, multiple forecast horizons, and alternative proxies for oil price and measures of forecast performance.
Q43|Dollar canadien et prix du pétrole : quelle causalité ?|The aim of this paper is to study the relationship between the real price of oil and the real effective exchange rate of the Canadian dollar. Using co-integration techniques, the results suggest that there is a stable long-run relationship between the series and a mean-reverting process of the Canadian exchange rate to its long-term target. In the short term, the change in the Canadian exchange rate is positively determined by its one-period lagged value and the change in the price of oil. Finally, using Granger causality tests, the results show that causality runs from exchange rate to oil price. An appreciation of the Canadian exchange rate results in an increase in the relative demand for oil - the price of oil produced in Canada being relatively more expensive - which in turn generates upward pressure on its price.
Q43|Interpreting the Oil Risk Premium: do Oil Price Shocks Matter?| This paper provides an analysis of the link between the global market for crude oil and oil futures risk premium at the aggregate level. It offers empirical evidence on whether the compensation for risk required by the speculators depends on the type of the structural shock of interest. Understanding the response of the risk premium to unexpected changes in the price of oil can be useful to address some research questions, among which: what is the relationship between crude oil risk premium and unexpected rise in the price of oil? On average, what should speculators expect to receive as a compensation for the risk they are taking on? This work is based on a Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) model of the crude oil market. Two main results emerge. First, the impulse response analysis provides evidence of a negative relationship between the risk premium and the changes in the price of oil triggered by shocks to economic fundamentals. Second, this analysis shows that the historical decline of the risk premium can be modelled as a part of endogenous effect of the oil market driven shocks.
Q43|Modelling the Global Price of Oil: Is there any Role for the Oil Futures-spot Spread?|In this work, we propose an analysis of the global market for crude oil based on a revised version of the Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) model introduced by Kilian and Murphy (2014). On this respect, we replace the global proxy for above-ground crude oil inventories with the oil futures-spot spread. The latter is defined as the percent deviation of the oil futures price from the spot price of oil and it represents a measure of the convenience yield but expressed with an opposite sign. The following model provides an economic interpretation of the residual structural shock, namely the financial market shock. This new shock is designed to capture an unanticipated change in the benefit of holding crude oil inventories that is driven by financial incentives. We find evidence that financial market shocks have played an important role in explaining the rises in the price of oil during the period 2003-2008.
Q43|Climate Change and Kuznets Curve: Portuguese Experience|The climate change has inspired the interest of the academic community in the most diverse areas of knowledge. This study tests and revisited the environmental Kuznets curve assumptions for Portugal. The econometric strategy used in this research is time series (ARIMA model, OLS estimator, ARCH regression, VAR model, and Granger causality) for the time period 1980-2013.The econometric results show that the income per capita and squared income per capita are according to the expected signs, i.e. a positive impact of income per capita on carbon dioxide emissions, and a negative effect of squared income per capita on carbon dioxide emissions. The empirical study also demonstrates that Portugal presents a dependence on energy consumption. The openness trade and foreign direct investment are negatively correlated with carbon dioxide emissions.
Q43|The Impact of China’s Electricity Deregulation on Coal and Power Industries: Two-stage Game Modeling Approach| The regulated price mechanism in China’s power industry has attracted much criticism because of its incapability to optimize the allocation of resources. To build an “open, orderly, competitive and complete” power market system, the Chinese government launched an unprecedented marketization reform in 2015 to deregulate the electricity price. This paper examines the impact of the electricity price deregulation in the industry level. We first construct two-stage dynamic game models by taking the coal and coal-fired power industries as the players. Using the models, we compare analytically the equilibriums with and without electricity regulation, and examine the changes in electricity price, electricity generation, coal price and coal traded quantity. The theoretical analyses show that there are three intervals of the regulated electricity sales prices which influence the impact of electricity price deregulation. Next, we collect empirical data to estimate the parameters in the game models, and simulate the influence of electricity deregulation on the two industries in terms of market outcome and industrial profitability. Our results suggest that the actual regulated electricity price falls within the medium interval of the theoretical results, which means the price deregulation will result in higher electricity sales price but lower coal price, less coal traded amount and less electricity generation amount. The robustness analysis shows that our results hold with respect to the electricity generation efficiency and price elasticity of electricity demand.
Q43|Oil Price Shocks and Economic Growth: The Volatility Link|This paper shows that oil shocks primarily impact economic growth through the conditional variance of growth. We move beyond the literature that focuses on conditional mean point forecasts and compare models based on density forecasts. Over a range of dynamic models, oil shock measures and data we find a robust link between oil shocks and the volatility of economic growth. A new measure of oil shocks is developed and shown to be superior to existing measures and indicates that the conditional variance of growth increases in response to an indicator of local maximum oil price exceedance. The empirical results uncover a large pronounced asymmetric response of growth volatility to oil price changes. Uncertainty about future growth is considerably lower compared to a benchmark AR(1) model when no oil shocks are present.
Q43|An Overwiew of Economic Impacts of Shale Gas on EU Energy Security|This paper analyzes the possible shale gas development in the EU in context with raising problem of energy security. Based on the experience of shale revolution in the USA the transfer of US model to the EU is discussed. The results show that shale production affects the price negatively and that US model is successful due to multiple reasons, primarily presence of experienced companies, geological structure and strong regulation rules. This paper shows the unsuitability of the US model for the EU market. After the first enthusiasm for shale plays research in late 2000s the multiple barriers for drilling have risen up; the most significant are the environmental worries; both on governmental and public levels. US companies have lost interest in the EU and moved to other parts of the world. The shale gas development is not able to affect the energy security of the EU on European, international level.
Q43|An Overwiew of Economic Impacts of U.S. Shale Gas Revolution|This paper aims to analyze the possible shale gas development in context of energy security as based on the experience of shale revolution in the USA. It focuses on updating research on shale gas, explaining its specifics, discussing the US model of shale gas development and possible impacts on the EU energy market. It provides a literature review, an overview of the worldwide shale gas development and discusses the most relevant related environmental issues connected with shale gas.
Q43|Revisiting the Environmental Kuznets Curve and the Role of Energy Consumption: The Case of Namibia|The study investigated the dynamic relationship between CO2 emissions, economic growth, and energy consumption for the period 1991:q1-2016:q4 in Namibia. The study applied the ARDL and Granger causality analysis to investigate the long run and causal relationships among these variables, respectively. The study confirmed a long run relationship between CO2 emissions, economic growth, and energy consumption. The results showed that the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) is found in both long and short runs in Namibia and that all the variables Granger cause each other. These results imply that economic growth can be a remedy for environmental degradation which means that the exploitation of natural resources to realize economic growth can be accepted until the turning point of the EKC curve is reached. The study recommends that actions to slow down the release of CO2 emissions and the raising of awareness about environmental concerns should wait until the economy reaches high-income levels.
Q43|Advances in Green Economy and Sustainability: Introduction|The environment is changing in a dynamic way. Sustainable development consists of both natural environmental changes as well as changes caused by humans. Nowadays environmental changes occur more often and much quicker and these changes challenge ecosystems and human societies. The aim of this special issue is to address the achievement of sustainable development by addressing the current issues of concern. Specifically, the green economy concept is an important term in international agendas. Together with the current economic crisis and the view that policies to attain sustainability cannot be put into operation efficiently, policy makers anticipate a solution from the greening of the economy. Green growth, more energy efficiency, cleaner energy technologies and sustainable development are regularly considered as harmonizing goals by international policy makers.
Q43|Natural Gas and the US Economy: Some Preliminary Rules of Thumb|I estimate the response of real US GDP to changes in the natural gas price. A 10% increase in the natural gas price due to an unexpected fall in supply leads to a 0.15% decrease in GDP when using data after 2005. I also find that price increases driven by export demand became a net positive for GDP between 2006 and 2017—an interesting result that requires further research. Finally, the response of GDP to an increase in natural gas production is small and positive since 2005.
Q43|Economic growth, energy consumption and government expenditure:evidence from a nonlinear ARDL analysis|This study investigates the nonlinear asymmetric relationship between energy consumption and economic growth by incorporating government expenditure and oil prices into a production function using Nigerian economy from 1980-2014. The nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag bounds testing approach is applied to examine the asymmetric cointegration between the variables. An asymmetric causality test is also employed to examine the causal association between the considered variables. The results indicate cointegration between the variables in the presence of asymmetries. The asymmetric causality results show that negative shocks to energy consumption have impacts on economic growth. Likewise, negative shocks to government expenditure have impacts on economic growth. The implications of these results for growth policies in Nigeria are also examined.
Q43|Is the oil price pass-through to domestic inflation symmetric or asymmetric? new evidence from India based on NARDL|With 80% oil dependence, which is expected to further increase in coming years due to rapid expansion, and the reforms initiated to deregulate domestic oil market, the association between global oil prices and inflation in India has increased. Using the autoregressive distribution lag (ARDL) and the nonlinear and asymmetric autoregressive distribution lag (NARDL) framework, we investigate the association between global oil prices and inflation. The ARDL results indicate no association between the two, whereas NARDL findings not only point to long term association but also indicates asymmetric pass-through. Precisely, domestic prices increase with the increase in global oil prices but the decrease in global oil prices has no significant association with the domestic prices. These results are robust to the inclusion of additional variables, different proxy of oil prices (WTI crude) and different time period (January 2003 to January 2018). The contrasting results obtained from the ARDL and the NARDL modelling highlight the importance of using non-linear framework, especially in high oil dependence country with non-competitive market structure. The results have implications for welfare assessment and the effectiveness of monetary policy.
Q43|Output, renewable and non-renewable energy production, and international trade: Evidence from EU-15 countries|This research presents first empirical evidence on the dynamic relationship between output, renewable and non-renewable energy production, international trade, capital and labour in the case of the EU-15 countries over the period of 1980–2015 for individual countries as well as a group. A simple production function of capital and labour is extended as such that it incorporates the impact of renewable and nonrenewable energy inputs, and international trade on output level. Econometric estimations of the extended production equations are carried out via ARDL approach to cointegration for individual country cases and panel GMM econometric technique for the entire EU-15. The ARDL empirical results indicate the existence of cointegration relationships amongst the variables in the case of seven countries of the EU-15, in addition to the GMM based, long-run relationship for the entire EU-15 as a panel. The ARDL procedure suggests that the relative impact of renewable and nonrenewable energy inputs on output levels vary considerably for individual countries. The GMM results demonstrate the existence of the relative importance of renewable and non-renewable energy inputs along with international trade on output in the EU-15 countries. This paper also discusses policy implications of the empirical results, as well as offering policy recommendations.
Q43|Income-FDI-Environmental degradation nexus for developing countries: A panel analysis of America continent|The study attempts to find out relationships among income, FDI and environmental degradation for developing countries of America continent. Moreover, study examines existence of environmental Kuznets curve and pollution haven hypothesis for developing countries of America continent. The study uses panel data from 1990 to 2014 for America continent and employs four techniques i-e pooled OLS, fixed effects (FEM), random effects (REM) and two stages least square (2SLS). Findings of the study do not confirm existence of both EKC and PHH for America continent. The study also concludes that energy use, population density, globalization and human capital have significant impact on environmental degradation in America continent. The study recommends that policies should target CO2 emissions reduction either by setting threshold or by penalizing pollution intensive industries. Further, cleaner energy and technological developments should be promoted.
Q43|The dynamic relationship between Financial Development and the Energy Demand in North Cyprus: Evidence from ARDL Bounds and Combine Cointegration Tests|This paper investigates the dynamic relationship between financial development, energy demands, economic growth and total trade with the ARDL Bounds and Combined cointegration approaches in North Cyprus for the period of 1977Q1 – 2016Q4. The empirical results provide evidences for the long-run and short-run relationship between the concern variables. All the techniques such as cointegration and innovation accounting method supporting the relationship between variables. Positive innovation in GDP is connected with increase in financial development and energy demands. Energy demands response positively for the shocks from GDP and Financial development, and financial development responses just only GDP and itself.
Q43|Futures risk premia in the era of shale oil|The advent of shale oil in the United States triggered a structural transformation in the oil market. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that this process has relevant consequences on oil risk premia. We construct a consumption-based model with shale producers interacting with financial speculators in the futures market. Compared to conventionals, shale producers have a more flexible technology, but higher risk aversion and additional costs due to their reliance on external finance. Our model helps to explain the observed pattern of aggregate hedging by US firms in the last decade. The empirical analysis shows that the hedging pressure of shale producers has become more relevant than that of conventional producers in explaining the oil futures risk premium.
Q43|Development of a two-sector model with an extended energy sector and application to Portugal (1960-2014)|In basic economic growth models, energy is neglected as a production factor, and output is generated from capital and labor in a single-sector process, with most of growth attributed to an exogenous residual. However, alternative approaches argue for a multi-sector system in which the major contribution to growth comes from increased efficiency in the conversion of energy to more productive forms. In this work we develop a two-sector model for the economy, featuring an extended energy sector, including all primary-to-final (energy industries) and final-to-useful (end-use devices) exergy conversion processes. Exergy is a thermodynamics concept, accounting for the potential of energy to perform work. Empirical application of the model for a single country (Portugal) requires decomposition and reclassification of national accounts and energy balances, to match empirical data with the model’s variables. Obtained estimates for the price of useful exergy (an intermediate product) facilitate the construction of gross output measures for more accurate growth accounting. Evidence suggests that declining useful exergy prices act as an engine of growth, as previously suggested in the literature. Additionally, useful exergy and capital inputs to non-energy related production act as complements while capital productivity in useful exergy generation declines slightly in the past decade.
Q43|Effect of negative shocks to electricity consumption on negative shocks to economic growth in Benin|The current study used an asymmetric approach to establish that negative shocks to electricity consumption have caused negative shocks to economic growth in Benin over the period 1971-2014. In so doing, it has ascertained the conclusion of the national policy framework for electricity which stipulated that shortages of electricity have impeded economic growth. Benin has encountered several electricity shortages in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. Although the share of electricity consumption in total energy consumption is very low in the country, electricity consumption remains essential for of economic growth because shortages of electricity cause reduction in economic growth. This result has some important policy implications in terms of electricity security in Benin.
Q43|The effect of electricity losses on GDP in Benin|The current study has assessed the losses of GDP caused by electricity losses in Benin over the period 1980-2014. The technique used was the Autoregressive Distributive Lags (ARDL). Results showed that in the long run Benin loses 0.16% of its GDP on average because of electricity losses. Benin is a country which faces important losses of electricity. A financing mechanism of the cost associated with reduction of electricity losses has been proposed in the national policy framework for electricity. By investigating the gain in GDP resulting from a reduction in electricity losses, the current study has assessed the feasibility of such mechanism, and thus contributes to the advancement of energy efficiency policy in Benin.
Q43|Renewable energy-economic growth nexus in South Africa: Linear, nonlinear or non-existent?|With escalating fears of climate change reaching irreversible levels, much emphasis has been recently placed on shifting to renewable sources of energy in supporting future economic livelihood. Focusing on South Africa, as Africa’s largest energy consumer and producer, our study investigates the short-run and long-run effects of renewable energy on economic growth using linear and nonlinear autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) models. Working with data availability, our empirical analysis is carried out over the period of 1991 to 2016, and our results unanimously fail to confirm any linear or nonlinear cointegration effects of the consumption and production of renewable energy on South African economic growth. We view the absence of cointergation relations as an indication of inefficient usage of renewable energy in supporting sustainable growth in South Africa and hence advise policymakers to accelerate the establishment of necessary renewable infrastructure in supporting future energy requirements.
Q43|Econometric modelling of the link between investment and electricity consumption in Ghana|The study examines the long run effect of investment (proxied by gross fixed capital formation) on electricity consumption for Ghana, for the period 1971-2011, by employing annual time series secondary data from World Bank database (World development indicator). The Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) and Kwiatkowski-Philips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) tests were used to analyse the stationarity features of the data used in levels and in their first differences. The empirical verification was done using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag model (ARDL). The findings of the study indicate the data used are non-stationary in levels, however, stationary in their first difference. Investment and electricity consumption are cointegrated according to the cointegration test performed. There are both stable short run and long run relationship between investment and electricity consumption. Investment is an appropriate policy tool for electricity consumption management in both short run and long run. Further studies in the area of stationarity with structural breaks, cointegration with structural breaks, causality analysis, and multivariate modelling of investment-electricity consumption link is worth doing since the current study did not consider these issues.
Q43|Re-examining the Foreign direct investment, Renewable energy consumption and Economic growth nexus: Evidence from a new Bootstrap ARDL test for Cointegration|This study re-examines the long-run relationship among foreign direct investment (FDI), renewable energy consumption (RE) and economic growth (GDP) for 9 Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries over the period 1990–2015 using a newly developed cointegration test by McNown et al. (2018), the bootstrap autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) which allows us to generate critical values for ARDL tests that are valid and appropriate for the specific data sets used and allow for endogeneity and feedback that may exist among the variables. In the long run analysis, we found evidence of cointegraion: (i) for Algeria, Armenia, Mauritania, and Tunisia when GDP is the dependant variable; (ii) for Egypt, Iran, Israel, Tunisia and Turkey when FDI is the dependent variable; and (iii) only for Iran, Morocco, and Tunisia when RE is the dependent variable. The short run Granger-causality analysis reveals varied nature of direction of causality between all variables and that is different among countries. This confirms that uniform policy recommendation relating to the causality between these variables may not work for these selected MENA countries.
Q43|CGE Microsimulation Analysis of Electricity Tariff Increases: The Case of South Africa|This paper analyses the economy-wide and distributional impacts of the increase in electricity tariff in the South African economy. Use is made of CGE-microsimulation to this end. The paper simulates both an actual price increase experienced in the economy and an increase linked to inflation. While the macro results show a negative impact on the economy in terms of a decrease in GDP, an increase in prices and an increase in unemployment, the micro results indicate that poverty, as measured by the headcount rate and poverty incidence curves, declines. This finding is similar to the finding by Boccanfuso et al. (2009) that when a significant proportion of households is connected to the grid, electricity sector reforms in the form of increasing tariffs to expand power generation can lead to poverty reduction.
Q43|Using real options to study the impact of capacity additions and investment expenditures in renewable energies in India|We calculate the overall policy value of installed capacity additions and investment expenditures in wind and solar energies in India. Recent increases in capacity additions and investments by both the public and private sectors alongwith government support schemes have made these energies more competitive with traditional fuels like coal in generating electricity. We use a two-factor learning curve to model the decline in prices of wind and solar energies. Employing a real options approach with global coal prices as the stochastic variable we find the overall value of promotion policies in renewables to be sufficiently large. Reducing the share of coal in electricity generation is one of India’s stated goals and a high trigger price of coal suggests continued efforts of capacity additions and investment expenditures in the solar and wind sectors are needed for some time in India.
Q43|Effective energy commodities’ risk management: Econometric modeling of price volatility|The current study emphasizes on the importance of the development of an effective price risk management strategy regarding energy products, as a result of the high volatility of that particular market. The study provides a thorough investigation of the energy price volatility, through the use of GARCH type model variations and the Markov-Switching GARCH methodology, as they are presented in the most representative academic researches. A large number of GARCH type models are exhibited together with the methodology and all the econometric procedures and tests that are necessary for developing a robust and precise forecasting model regarding energy price volatility. Nevertheless, the present research moves another step forward, in an attempt to cover also the probability of potential shifts in the unconditional variance of the models due to the effect of economic crises and several unexpected geopolitical events into the energy market prices.
Q43|Enhancing Climate Finance Readiness: A Review of Selected Investment Frameworks as Tools of Multilevel Governance|The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has estimated that to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global mean temperature rise to well below 2° Celsius, new forms of low-carbon investment must be unlocked and cost-effectively doubled by 2030. This level of deployment of low-carbon solutions require doubling current investment in renewable energy to US$500 billion per year up to 2020 and tripling in the 2020s to reach US$900 billion each year up to 2030. However, the mechanisms for scaling up such investments remain constrained by high transaction costs, insufficient investment size, and limited market liquidity. We explore recent development of climate investment readiness frameworks (CIRFs) and their application in support of low-carbon development strategies. The paper focuses on two objectives driving the creation and use of such frameworks: (a) barriers to attracting large-scale private investment in climate-sensitive technologies, and (b) how these barriers can be reduced through effective capacity building mechanisms. We consider the utility of the main investment readiness (IR) frameworks with a particular focus on their contributions to developing a climate investment-friendly policy regime through appropriate governance reforms and technical capacity building measures. Important connections between the performance of climate investment readiness frameworks and broader governance issues are highlighted. Conclusions for strengthening such frameworks as tools of multilevel governance regimes are offered.
Q43|A Panel Analysis of Income Inequality and Energy Use|This paper investigates the relationship between energy consumption and income inequality in an unbalanced panel of 147 countries over the period 1990 - 2014. Using a variety of panel and dynamic panel methods and controlling for other determinants of inequality, such as education, health, investment, etc., I find a large and strong negative relationship between access to energy and income inequality. Moreover, I demonstrate that greater access reduces the share of income enjoyed by the top 20% and increases the share for the bottom 20%. Results are less robust when the sample is divided into regions and economic 'blocs', but the overall results are unchanged.
Q43|Oil price volatility spillover effects on food prices in Nigeria|Studies have been done on oil price volatility spillover effects on the prices of food in both pre-crisis and post-crisis periods. However, what has been sparingly studied is oil price volatility spillover effects on urban prices of food and rural prices of food. The disparity in the rural-urban spending in Nigeria is an area that can further be explored by evaluating the effects of oil price volatility spillover on prices of food in these areas. This study therefore adopts GARCH (1, 1)-TY model to evaluate the impulse response function and variance decomposition of these effects on prices of food in pre-crisis and post-crisis periods. Findings show that in full sample and post-crisis periods both aggregate price of food (APF) and urban average price of food (APFU) positively respond to oil price shocks while rural average price of food (APFR) responds negatively to oil price shocks. However, the response of the urban average price of food proves to be more significant in the post-crisis periods as it appears relatively most affected in this period by a greater percentage of oil price shocks.
Q43|Energy Efficiency Transitions in China: How persistent are the movements to/from the frontier?|This study examines the energy efficiency transitions in China using provincial data covering the period 2003–2015. Sustainable progress in energy efficiency achievements is beneficial to energy insecurity and the achievement of the Paris Agreement. This article combines the stochastic frontier method with the panel Markov-switching regression to model energy efficiency transitions. Estimated energy efficiency scores showed significant regional and provincial heterogeneity. Also, while human capital development, urbanization, and foreign direct investment promote energy efficiency, price and income per capita reduce it. The transition probabilities indicate that the high energy-efficient state is less sustainable, and the movement towards the frontier seems less persistent than movement from the frontier. Thus, it appears that China is not making sustainable progress in energy efficiency. The unsustainable nature of the high energy-efficient state suggests that in China, there are weak energy efficiency efforts and energy efficiency policies lack robustness.
Q43|Political Economy of Oil Resources Management in Nigeria: Lessons from Other Countries|The study focuses on the political economy of oil resources management in Nigeria with the sole purpose of showcasing how far the country has gone in effectively managing its crude oil proceeds. It presents a brief history of the excess crude account as well as the sovereign wealth fund in Nigeria and then presents the models of excess oil resource management of some other countries. This is to enable Nigeria to draw some lessons and then take steps that guarantee the sustenance of growth and development.
Q43|Removing Fossil Fuel Subsidies to Help the Poor|Phasing out energy subsidies may increase the price of energy and adversely affect the poor. However, the households may benefit from the redistribution of the revenue from this policy in the economy. Here, we investigate the impacts of phasing out energy subsidies and direct transfer of the policy revenue to households. Employing a Computable General Equilibrium model, we measure the impacts on labor-leisure choice and on labor supply. Considering the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke index and the Food Ratio Method, we construct several poverty indices: the Gini index, the ratio of none-food expenditures to food expenditure, the ratio of income of the richest decile to the poorest decile, and the ratio of income of the two richest deciles to the two poorest deciles. We analyze the effects of an increase in energy prices and direct transfer of revenues to the households in the Iranian economy. The findings suggest a considerable improvement in income distribution and a significant improvement in food to non-food ratio. The results also show an improvement in rural-urban income distribution.
Q43|Oil Price Volatility and Economic Growth: Evidence from Advanced OECD Countries using over One Century of Data|In this paper we make use of a number of different panel data estimators, including fixed effects, bias-corrected least squares dummy variables (LSDVC), generalised methods of moments (GMM), feasible generalised least squares (FGLS), and random coefficients (RC) to analyse the impact of real oil price volatility on the growth in real GDP per capita for 17 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), over a 144-year time period from 1870 to 2013. Our main findings can be summarised as follows: overall, oil price volatility has a negative and statistically significant impact on economic growth of OECD countries in our sample. In addition, when allowing for slope heterogeneity, oil producing countries are significantly negatively impacted by oil price uncertainty, most notably Norway and Canada.
Q43|Time-Varying Impact of Geopolitical Risks on Oil Prices|This paper analyses the dynamic impact of geopolitical risks (GPRs) on real oil returns for the period February 1974 to August 2017, using a time-varying parameter structural vector autoregressive (TVP-SVAR) model. Besides the two variables of concern, the model also includes growth in world oil production, global economic activity (to capture oil-demand), and world stock returns. We show that GPRs (based on a tally of newspaper articles covering geopolitical tensions), in general, has a significant negative impact on oil returns, primarily due to the decline in oil demand captured by the global economic activity. Our results, thus, highlight the risk of associating all GPRs with oil supply shocks driven by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, and hence, ending up suggesting that higher GPRs drive up oil prices.
Q43|Oil Price-Inflation Pass-Through in the United States over 1871 to 2018: A Wavelet Coherency Analysis|This paper analyzes the oil price-inflation pass-through by studying the relationship between oil prices and U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the period January 1871- June 2018, at different frequencies, using a wavelet coherency analysis. Our main results suggest that the relationship between oil prices and CPI has changed over the analyzed time period, implying a decrease in the oil price- inflation pass-through over time. Furthermore, this relationship also varies across frequencies, suggesting that the evidence of oil price-inflation pass-through with oil prices leading CPI is weaker in the short-run.
Q43|Oil prices in a general equilibrium model with precautionary demand for oil|This paper analyzes the interaction between oil prices and macroeconomic outcomes by incorporating oil as an input in production alongside a precautionary motive for holding oil in a general equilibrium model. The driving forces are factor-specific technology shocks, oil supply shocks, and news shocks about future oil supply. Storage and the zero lower bound on stored oil are crucial for the model to match observed business-cycle statistics, the relationship between oil price changes and recessions, and for generating state-dependent responses to shocks. Large oil-price increases are mainly driven by increasing precautionary/smoothing demand for oil. Most of the time, oil-related shocks are of limited importance for the business cycle, but when oil inventories are low, negative news about the future oil supply can drive the economy into a recession that is triggered by oil scarcity.

Q43|The U.S. Shale Oil Boom, the Oil Export Ban, and the Economy: A General Equilibrium Analysis|This paper examines the effects of the U.S. shale oil boom in a two-country DSGE model where countries produce crude oil, refined oil products, and a non-oil good. The model incorporates different types of crude oil that are imperfect substitutes for each other as inputs into the refining sector. The model is calibrated to match oil market and macroeconomic data for the U.S. and the rest of the world (ROW). We investigate the implications of a significant increase in U.S. light crude oil production similar to the shale oil boom. Consistent with the data, our model predicts that light oil prices decline, U.S. imports of light oil fall dramatically, and light oil crowds out the use of medium crude by U.S. refiners. In addition, fuel prices fall and U.S. GDP rises. We then use our model to examine the potential implications of the former U.S. crude oil export ban. The model predicts that the ban was a binding constraint in 2013 through 2015. We find that the distortions introduced by the policy are greatest in the refining sector. Light oil prices become artificially low in the U.S., and U.S. refineries produce inefficiently high amount of refined products, but the impact on refined product prices and GDP are negligible.
Q43|Oil Price Shocks and Economic Growth: The Volatility Link|This paper shows that oil shocks primarily impact economic growth through the conditional variance of growth. We move beyond the literature that focuses on conditional mean point forecasts and compare models based on density forecasts. Over a range of dynamic models, oil shock measures and data we find a robust link between oil shocks and the volatility of economic growth. A new measure of oil shocks is developed and shown to be superior to existing measures and indicates that the conditional variance of growth increases in response to an indicator of local maximum oil price exceedance. The empirical results uncover a large pronounced asymmetric response of growth volatility to oil price changes. Uncertainty about future growth is considerably lower compared to a benchmark AR(1) model when no oil shocks are present.
Q43|Impact of World Oil Prices on an Energy Exporting Economy Including Monetary Policy|We investigate the interrelationship between the main macroeconomic indicators of an oil exporting country and world oil prices using a vector autoregressive approach. We focus on an oil exporter that is not a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and its oil revenues, which account for a significant proportion of the country’s total export and budget revenues. We explain the oil price transition mechanisms to this economy from the export side and through the fiscal channel, taking into account the monetary policy factor. The results suggest that oil price fluctuations have a significant impact on the oil exporting country’s real gross domestic product, consumer price index inflation rate, interest rate, and exchange rate. Moreover, to estimate monetary policy rule for this energy exporter, we test the Taylor equation and associated Taylor rule, including the oil prices gap, since the latter may have a significant impact on the key policy rate. The evidence suggests that the Taylor rule describes the post-financial crisis monetary policy of this economy relatively well. Finally, we discuss future research and lessons from this economy for monetary policy makers.
Q43|The Rebound Effect and its representation in Climate and Energy models|In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art and common practice of energy and climate modeling vis-a-vis the rebound literature, in particular regarding how macroeconomic energy and climate models quantify and include energy and greenhouse gas rebound effects. First, we focus on rebound effects in models of costless energy efficiency improvement that hold other attributes constant (zero-cost breakthrough), and an energy efficiency policy that may be bundled with other product changes that affect energy use (policy-induced efficiency improvement) (Gillingham et al. 2015). Second, we examine macroeconomic studies focusing on energy efficiency both in industry and in private households. Third, we go through a general theoretical revision from micro- to macroeconomic levels (the aggregation level) to include a review of the so-called meso-level studies (focused on the analysis of the production side). From 118 recent studies along the aggregation level, out of which 25 compute rebound calculations, we find that the average energy rebound effect is 58% with a standard deviation of 58%, and when we include green house gas rebound calculations, the magnitude is of the order of 43% with a standard deviation of 55%. Finally, we argue that the rebound effect is a phenomenon that requires a sound understanding of the complex interactions from different dimensions (e.g. aggregation level, heterogeneity, climate, energy conservation and economic growth), and we provide some ideas and motivations for future research.
Q43|ECIO Model Operators Guide|The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL)/ West Virginia University (WVU) Econometric Input-Output (ECIO) model is a time-series enabled hybrid econometric input-output (IO) model that combines the capabilities of econometric modeling with the strengths of IO modeling. The model was developed and designed specifically for estimating the income and employment impacts of the development and deployment of new energy technologies over a given forecast period. The ECIO model consists of a macroeconomic econometric model of the United States (U.S.) national economy and an inter-industry model that reflects the interdependence of all the industries in the economy. These two components have three modules and several sub-modules of interrelated equations for the U.S. economy, with employment and income detail for 32 industrial sectors. This document is designed to escort a user with little computing or programing experience through the processes of setting up the ECIO model application to run on a personal computer (PC). The document will guide user through the various stages of the ECIO model with screenshots and instructions. Using this guide and standardized input data files (in .csv format) that are generated by the NETL NEMS-ECIO Translation Tool, users should be able run the model to generate estimates of deployment scenario impacts.
Q43|Capital–energy substitutability in manufacturing sectors: methodological and policy implications|Abstract The debate on the capacity of the production system to adequate to a low-carbon economy is addressed by computing the capital–energy substitution elasticities $$(\sigma_{KE} )$$ ( σ KE ) for manufacturing sectors. We estimated the $$\sigma_{KE}$$ σ KE at aggregate level for the whole manufacturing industry and for 10 distinguished sectors for 21 OECD countries (1990–2008); average substitution values are also computed at sector level comparing alternative econometric methods and for separate sub-periods to trace the time dynamics. Such methodology allows assessing how different sectors could respond to the introduction of new (energy saving) technologies, as in terms of factor productivity and substitutability opportunities. This corresponds to a dynamic evaluation of the speed of reaction of each sector in improving its energy efficiency and the capacity to be on track in a sustainable transition. Such assessment also helps policy makers to individuate sectors deserving transition support according to the speed of adjustment of elasticity values over time.
Q43|Factors influencing the spatial correlation network of energy environmental efficiency|Improving energy and environmental efficiency is an inevitable choice for developing countries to achieve sustainable economic and social development. Using VAR Granger causality test method (Granger, 1969), this study identifies the spatial correlation of energy environmental efficiency based on provincial panel data sample between 1995 and 2015 in China; further through the QAP analysis model (Liu, 2014), the factors influencing the spatial correlation network of energy environmental efficiency is empirically analyzed. The results show that the differences of economic development level, energy consumption structure, industrial structure, environmental regulation and technological innovation are significantly correlated with spatial correlation network of energy environmental efficiency; similar economic development level, technical level and industrial structure are beneficial to the formation of spatial correlation network of energy environmental efficiency while the differences of energy consumption structure and environmental regulation have little impact on this process.
Q43|Estimating The Effect Of The Great Recession On Final Energy Consumption|Evolution of total final energy consumption in the European Union (EU) exhibits a mild decreasing tendency over the last two decades. Though, it has recently become more volatile due to the economic recession that adversely and unevenly hit energy consumption in most EU countries and their energy end-use sectors. Eurostat?s data unveils the considerable differences that exist in finale energy consumption across the ?old? and post-transition EU countries as well as the major energy end-user sectors. Using random effects panel model, this paper aims to estimate the effect of the Great Recession and the membership status (?old? vs. post-transition groups) on final energy consumption in the major energy end-user sectors for the period 1998 ? 2015. The empirical evidence indicates statistically significant impact of both predictors on final energy consumption of households/services and industry. However, the impact is not uniform which raises several important questions regarding their behavior and reaction to the recession. Since the recession reduced the wealth and income of the European households, it seems that they are not prone to invest in more energy-efficient appliances, technologies and innovations in tough economic times. In contrast, such behavior is a precondition for survival and future growth of industry.
Q43|Energy in Economic Growth: Is Faster Growth Greener?|An influential theoretical hypothesis holds that if aggregate productivity growth accelerates, then so does the decline in energy intensity. Whether faster growth is greener in this sense is crucial for modeling future growth and climate change mitigation, but empirical evidence is lacking. This paper characterizes the global, long-run historical relationship between changes in energy intensity and labor productivity growth rates. Basing estimates on an unbalanced panel of 180 countries for the period 1950-2014 and the world as a whole, it captures a significantly larger historical window than previous studies. The paper finds a stylized fact whereby the rate at which energy intensity changes is constant or even increases as labor productivity accelerates. Faster growth is not greener. This provides important new information for calibrating integrated assessment models, many of which make a green growth assumption in near term projections.
Q43|Financing Green Growth|This paper surveys the current state of financing green growth in the energy sector, based on the insight that there are different qualities of finance. In past transformational changes in other sectors, public monies played a key role across the innovation landscape. Public financing was central also in a number of past national energy transitions, as reviewed here for Iceland (from fossil to geothermal energy), Norway (from mainly non-electricity energy to hydroelectricity), France (from oil to nuclear) and the United States (from conventional to shale gas). In the current transition to low-carbon energy supplies, there is much public activity, most directed and concerted in China, but also reasons to doubt it is enough and applied in the right places to be able to finance the transition to a low carbon sector on time scales consistent with current climate change mitigation targets. A discussion of opportunities and challenges to a more central role for public financing concludes, drawing also on insights from the recent mission-oriented innovation literature.
Q43|Does energy price affect energy efficiency? Cross-country panel evidence|In this paper, we analyze the relationship between energy intensity and energy price in a panel of 120 countries over 34 years, from 1980 to 2013. We use information on energy intensity and real oil price, and merge it with macroeconomic data on the countries' structural characteristics. We assess their long-run relationship and direction of causality using panel cointegration tests and dynamic panel data models. We identify a statistically significant, but weak negative effect of real oil price on energy intensity, which corresponds to a positive effect of energy price on energy efficiency. We also show significant, large regional differences in this relationship. We thus posit that a global policy aimed at increasing the price of oil would induce a limited increase in average energy efficiency through a more efficient use of energy, but this increase would differ considerably across regions around the world.
Q43|The economic impacts of UK trade-enhancing industrial policies and their spillover effects on the energy system|The wider impacts of energy policy on the macro-economy are increasingly recognised in the academic and policy-oriented literatures. Additionally, the interdependence of energy and economy implies that a (policy) change in the non-energy system impacts on the energy system. However, such spillovers on the energy system have not been extensively researched. We begin by analysing the impacts of export promotion policies - a key element of the UKâ€™s Industrial Strategy - on the energy system and energy policy goals. As the impacts of such policies are, in large part, transmitted via their effects on the economy, we adopt a computable general equilibrium model - UK-ENVI - that fully captures such interdependence. Our results suggest that an across-the-board stimulus to exports increases total energy use significantly. This does not come directly through energy exports, but indirectly through the energy sectorsâ€™ linkages to other sectors. Export led growth therefore impacts on energy use - and significantly so. This in turn is likely to have an adverse impact on emission targets. Policy makers should be aware of the fact that a successful implementation of the Industrial Strategy may create significant tensions with the UKâ€™s Clean Growth Strategy, for example, and with the goals of energy policy more generally. The importance of this effect will in practice depend upon: the mix of goods and services that are exported (an issue that we shall address once the export strategy is published); the success of low-carbon policies. Ultimately, a knowledge of the nature and scale of these spillover effects of economic policies on the energy system creates the potential for more effective and efficient policy making.
Q43|Framing policy on low emissions vehicles in terms of economic gains: might the most straightforward gain be delivered by supply chain activity to support refuelling?|A core theme of the UK GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new Industrial Strategy is exploiting opportunities for domestic supply chain development. This extends to a special Ã¢â‚¬ËœAutomotive Sector DealÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ that focuses on the shift to low emissions vehicles (LEVs). Here attention is on electric vehicle and battery production and innovation. In this paper, we argue that a more straightforward gain in terms of framing policy around potential economic benefits may be made through supply chain activity to support refuelling of battery/hydrogen vehicles. We set this in the context of LEV refuelling supply chains potentially replicating the strength of domestic upstream linkages observed in the UK electricity and/or gas industries. We use input-output multiplier analysis to deconstruct and assess the structure of these supply chains relative to that of more import-intensive petrol and diesel supply. A crucial multiplier result is that for every Ã‚Â£1million of spending on electricity (or gas), 8 full-time equivalent jobs are supported throughout the UK. This compares to less than 3 in the case of petrol/diesel supply. Moreover, the importance of service industries becomes apparent, with 67% of indirect and induced supply chain employment to support electricity generation being located in services industries. The comparable figure for GDP is 42%.
Q43|Can vehicle efficiency beat fuel efficiency in cutting fuel use|This paper demonstrates the importance of considering both energy and non-energy efficiency improvements in the provision of energy intensive household services. Using the example of private transport, we analyse whether vehicle efficiency can beat fuel efficiency in cutting fuel use. We find that this ultimately depend on the elasticity of demand for transport, the substitutability between vehicles and fuels and the initial share of fuel use in private transport. The framework also allows to identify Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmultiple benefitsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of technical progress in private transport by considering both the ability of such policy to reduce fuel demand and to increase the consumerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surplus. We extend the partial equilibrium framework by using computable general equilibrium (CGE) simulations to identify the system-wide impacts on total fuel use of the two alternative efficiency changes. Simulation results suggest that the substitution effects identified in the partial equilibrium analysis are an important element in determining the change in total fuel use resulting from these consumption efficiency changes. However, the identification of associated changes in intermediate fuel demand, plus the potential expansionary effects of the improvements in household efficiency transmitted through the labour market can generate general equilibrium effects that vary substantially from those derived using partial equilibrium analysis.
Q43|The importance of energy price stickiness and real wage inflexibility for the time paths of rebound effects|There has been some controversy over the relative sizes of the short- and long-run rebound effects associated with energy efficiency improvements. Theoretical analysis by Wei (2007) and Saunders implied that the rebound effects would always be greater in the long-run than in the short-run. However, Allan et al (2007) and Turner (2009) found evidence from Computable General Equilibrium simulations that contradicted this result. In this paper we systematically explore the impact of energy price stickiness and real wage inflexibility for the evolution of rebound effects. We find that: the degree of energy price, but not wage, stickiness is an important determinant of the time path of rebound effects and of its relative size in the short- and long-runs; and that there is considerable variation in the scale of rebound effects through time, even where short-run rebound effects are lower than in the long-run. However, the most significant finding overall is that rebound reflects the system-wide interaction between energy producing and energy using sectors.
Q43|The economic impacts of UK trade-enhancing industrial policies and their spillover effects on the energy system|The wider impacts of energy policy on the macro-economy are increasingly recognised in the academic and policy-oriented literatures. Additionally, the interdependence of energy and economy implies that a (policy) change in the non-energy system impacts on the energy system.

Q43|The characteristics of energy employment in a system-wide context|Anticipated changes in energy provision over the next decades will likely have major implications on employment within energy activities. To understand the possible consequences, many studies have considered the level and types of employment in existing energy technologies. Using the hypothetical extraction approach for the UK, we explore the employment in and supported by energy activities - including across occupations and skills categories. We show that the impact on occupation and skills across the whole economy is more evenly spread than the employment in individual sectors. From the empirical results presented here, it is evident that the system-wide demands for skills including not only the direct, but also knock-on effects across the economy can change the pattern of labour market needs, which have implications for labour market planning in the low carbon transition.
Q43|Incorporating CO2 emissions into macroeconomic models through primary energy use|Two key pillars of the energy quadrilemma (which measure the sustainability of energy policy) are a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and economic development. Recent worldwide energy policy has focused on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, which will influence, and in turn be influenced by, economic activity and energy use. As such, it is critically important to identify and incorporate emissions into macroeconomic models. Typically, emissions are linked to economic activity via the level of output, both calculated at a sectoral level. However, this approach - while consistent with linear models such as Input-Output - assumes that emissions per unit of output remains constant, which can be problematic with more complex economic systems. In this paper we detail a method for incorporating sectoral and aggregate CO2 emissions into a macroeconomic model (CGE) of the UK through the use of sectoral primary energy use.
Q43|The economic impacts of UK fiscal policies and their spillover effects on the energy system|The energy system and the economy are inextricably intertwined. While this interdependence is, of course, widely recognised, it has not featured prominently in assessing the likely impact of economic policies. In principle, broad fiscal policies are likely to have a significant influence on key elements of the energy system, the neglect of which may lead to inefficiencies in the design of appropriate energy and economic policies. The importance of this in practice depends on the strength of the spillover effects from fiscal policy instruments to energy policy goals. This is the focus of this paper. We employ a multi-sectoral computable general equilibrium (CGE) approach for the UK which allows us to track the impact of key fiscal policy interventions on key goals of economic and energy policies. Overall, our results suggest that a double dividend - a simultaneous stimulus to the economy and a reduction in emissions â€“ induced by an increase in current public spending or a hike in the income tax rate seem unlikely in the UK context. Nonetheless, there are undoubted differential spillover effects on key components of the energy system from tax and public spending interventions that may prove capable of being exploited through the coordination of fiscal and energy policies. Even if it seems doubtful that fiscal policies would be formulated with a view to improved coordination with energy policies, policymakers should at least be aware of likely direction and scale of fiscal spillover effects to the energy system.
Q43|Causal effects of PetroCaribe on sustainable development: a synthetic control analysis|We examine the causal effects of the energy subsidy programme PetroCaribe in the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic, social and environmental. We use the synthetic control method to construct a counterfactual and compare it to the outcomes of the beneficiary countries and thus estimate the magnitude and direction of the PetroCaribe effect. PetroCaribe had a positive effect on economic growth in most of the beneficiary countries without a deterioration of their environmental quality. However, this economic boost was not followed by an improvement in social development.
Q43|An Axiomatic Foundation of the Ecological Footprint|The objective of this paper is to provide an axiomatic foundation to the ecological footprint developed and refined by the authors in the Global Footprint Network, among others. For this purpose, five axioms are proposed which represent general properties any ecological footprint measure should fulfill. We show that an index exists which is unique up to a coefficient to be chosen arbitrarily. As an implication, footprints have to be measured on a ratio scale. This result supports the conventional unit of measurement (land area) which itself is represented by a ratio scale. In this respect, our index differs from the compound-based ecological footprint index in which the norm is missing and, therefore, it is implicitly set equal to one. Apart from that we find, as the most important result, that the ad-hoc design of the commonly applied ecological footprint index has been given an axiomatic foundation.
Q43|Measuring Impact of Uncertainty in a Stylized Macro-Economic Climate Model within a Dynamic Game Perspective|In this paper we try to quantify/measure the main factors that influence the equilibrium outcome and pursued strategies in a simplistic model for the use of fossil versus green energy over time. The model is derived using the standard Solow macro-economic growth model in a two-country setting within a dynamic game perspective. After calibrating the model for a setting of OECD versus non-OECD countries we study what kind of uncertainties affect the outcomes of the linearized model most, assuming both countries use Nash strategies to cope with shocks that impact the model. The main outcome of this study is that the parameters that occur in the objective of both players seem to carry the most uncertainty for both the outcome of the model and strategies.
Q43|Competing Land Uses and Fossil Fuel, Optimal Energy Conversion Rates During the Transition Toward a Green Economy Under a Pollution Stock Constraint|We study the transition to a carbon-free economy in a model with a polluting non-renewable resource and a clean renewable resource. Transforming primary energy into ready-to-use energy services is costly and more efficient energy transformation rates are more costly to achieve. Renewable energy competes with food production for land and the food productivity of land can be improved at some cost. To avoid catastrophic climate damages, the pollution stock is mandated to stay below a given cap. When the economy is not constrained by the cap, the efficiency of energy transformation increases steadily until the transition toward the ultimate green economy; when renewable energy is exploited, its land use rises at the expense of food production; food productivity increases together with the land rent but food production drops; the food and energy prices increase and renewables substitute for non-renewable energy. During the constrained phase, the economy follows a constant path of prices, quantities, efficiency rates, food productivity and land rent, a phenomenon we call the ’ceiling efficiency paradox'.
Q43|Volatility Spillovers and Systemic Risk Across Economies: Evidence from a Global Semi-Structural Model|The paper presents some evidence on the overwhelming relevance of systemic risk and the lesser importance of US interest rates in the global transmission of shocks. This evidence suggests that the literature could benefit from incorporating global confidence variables into global frameworks in the study of the global transmission of shocks. As framework, we used a global semi-structural model (GSSM) augmented with common factors for country risk and country credit. We approximated country risk with historical stock volatility, a measure that is uniform and available across countries; in addition, we measured spillovers as the share of forecast error variance explained by different volatility factors. We found that systemic risk is the main volatility factor in all systemic economies, and also accounts for the bulk of spillovers into non systemic economies. Other volatility factors such as global credit, foreign interest rates and trade-related factors rarely accounted for shares of forecast error variance above one percent.
Q43|Klimaschutz und Energiewende nach dem Sondierungspapier zur GroKo III – großer weiterer Handlungsbedarf|Für 2020 war festgelegt, dass die THG-Emissionen 40 % unter dem Wert des Jahres 1990 liegen. Angesichts eines nur leichten weiteren Rückgangs bis 2016 auf 27,7 % gegenüber dem Basisjahr und einem von den AG Energiebilanzen (2017) prognostizierten Anstieg im Jahr 2017 im Vergleich zum Vorjahr erwartet u. a. die Experten-Kommission zum Monitoring-Prozess der Energiewende (EWK 2017) nicht, dass das Klimaziel für das Jahr 2020 noch erreicht wird. Die Ursachen für die Zielverfehlung liefert die Experten-Kommission gleich mit. Der Bereich der Wärmeerzeugung und insbesondere der Verkehr sind weit von den Zielen des Energiekonzepts der Bundesregierung entfernt. Dies gilt sowohl für den Anteil der erneuerbaren Energien als auch für die Energieeffizienz. Dagegen wirkt der viel diskutierte und kritisierte Strombereich trotz schleppenden Netzausbaus wie ein Musterknabe. Was ist in der laufenden Legislaturperiode zu tun, um das Klimaschutzziel von 40 % im Jahr 2020 nicht allzu weit zu verfehlen und zumindest noch eine realistische Chance zu erhalten, im Jahr 2030 mit einer THG-Minderung von 55 % gegenüber 1990 wieder den Zielpfad zu erreichen? Das Discussion Paper fokussiert entsprechende Maßnahmen, indem es einerseits erklärt, welchen Effekt ein nationaler Mindestpreis auf alle THG-Emissionen hätte und andererseits, weshalb auch die Energieeffizienz in allen Bereichen massiv und messbar vorangetrieben werden sollte.
Q43|Ökonomische Indikatoren des Energiesystems – Methode, Abgrenzung und Ergebnisse für den Zeitraum 2000–2016|Die Energiewende in Deutschland hat das Ziel, langfristig eine umweltverträgliche, ressourcenschonende und kostengünstige Energieversorgung zu gewährleisten. Um den Fortschritt dieser Transformation adäquat und zuverlässig beurteilen zu können, bedarf es geeigneter Indikatoren. Neben physischen Indikatoren zu Energieeinsatz und Emissionen werden auch Indikatoren benötigt, die die ökonomische Dimension der Transformation der Energiewirtschaft beschreiben. Die hier vorliegende Untersuchung ermittelt und dokumentiert relevante ökonomische Indikatoren. Da die Transformation des Energiesystems ein langfristiger Prozess ist, wird angestrebt, die Indikatoren in einer langen Zeitreihe seit dem Jahr 2000 bis zum aktuellen Rand vorzulegen. Bei genauerer Betrachtung, welche Wirtschaftsbereiche dem Energiesystem zuzurechnen sind, wird deutlich, dass eine Klärung und Abgrenzung erforderlich sind. Der Schwerpunkt dieser Untersuchung wird auf die Bereitstellung von Endenergie gelegt, es werden jedoch auch erste Ansätze zur Erfassung der Entwicklung von Maßnahmen zur Steigerung der Energieeffizienz und zu effizienten Verbrauchern vorgestellt. Der Report stellt dar, welche Daten in den relevanten ökonomischen Indikatorenbereichen vorliegen und welche Daten aus welchem Grund für die hier dokumentierten Indikatoren genutzt wurden. Bei der Auswahl der verwendeten Daten wird angestrebt, immer dann, wenn es methodisch vertretbar erscheint, vorliegende amtliche oder andere öffentlich verfügbare Daten zu nutzen. Wo dies nicht möglich oder sinnvoll erscheint, sind Methoden entwickelt worden, anhand derer die erforderlichen Indikatoren abgeleitet werden können. Die dabei angewendeten Vorgehensweisen und die jeweils getroffenen Annahmen werden ausführlich dargestellt. Die Untersuchung ist daher wie folgt aufgebaut. Zunächst wird die Beschäftigung in den verschiedenen Bereichen der Energiewirtschaft ausgeführt. Wie in allen Bereichen der Wirtschaftstätigkeit lösen diese Aktivitäten die Nachfrage nach weiteren Gütern aus und führen auch indirekt zu Beschäftigung in den vorgelagerten Wirtschaftszweigen. Daher sind die indirekten Effekte unabdingbar, um den gesamten ökonomischen Effekt der Energiewirtschaft abzuschätzen. Das folgende Kapitel geht ausführlich auf die Investitionstätigkeit in der Energiewirtschaft ein und stellt erstmals in der Literatur umfassend Investitionen in allen Bereichen zusammen. Anschließend wird der Bogen zurück zur Beschäftigung geschlagen. Hier wird die zur Bereitstellung der entsprechenden Güter notwendige Bruttoproduktion abgeleitet, auf deren Basis die Beschäftigungsermittlung fußt. Die hierzu notwendigen Überlegungen zum Außenhandel mit den jeweiligen Gütern werden ebenfalls angestellt. Der Bericht schließt mit verschiedenen konzeptionellen Ansätzen in der Literatur zum Thema Energieeffizienz und gibt Beispiele für eine entsprechende Umsetzung.
Q43|Erneuerbar beschäftigt in den Bundesländern – Bericht zur aktualisierten Abschätzung der Bruttobeschäftigung 2016 in den Bundesländern|Der Ausbau erneuerbarer Energien (EE) ist von einem umfangreichen Monitoringprozess begleitet, bei dem jährlich technisch-ökonomische Daten ermittelt, aufbereitet und veröffentlicht werden. Die Berichterstattung dient dem Aufzeigen von Fortschritten wie Fehlstellen, welche bei der Zielerreichung wichtige Korrekturen oder Verstärkungen ermöglichen. Seit dem Jahr 2006 ist die Ermittlung der mit dem EE-Ausbau verbundenen Beschäftigung Teil des Monitorings. Ausgangspunkt der Berechnungen sind die Investitionen in erneuerbare Energien des jeweiligen Jahres. Der Ausbau und der Betrieb von EE-Anlagen löst zusätzliche Nachfrage nach Anlagen und nach Leistungen für den Betrieb und die Wartung von Anlagen aus. Durch die zusätzliche Nachfrage wird zunächst die direkte Beschäftigung für die Produktion und die Bereitstellung von Biomasse sowie die direkte Beschäftigung in Betrieb und Wartung der Anlagen benötigt. Über eine Input-Output-Analyse werden aus der Produktion von Vorleistungen indirekt Beschäftigte abgeleitet. Die Strukturinformationen der EE-Branchen wurden in einer Reihe von Unternehmensbefragungen (2005, 2007, 2012) erhoben und seither fortgeschrieben. Seit dem Beschluss der Bundesregierung zum Energiekonzept (2010), spätestens aber seit den Beschlüssen zur Energiewende im Jahr 2011 umfasst der Monitoringprozess alle Energiewendebereiche und enthält die komplette Energiewirtschaft und die Energieeffizienz. So hat die jüngste Veröffentlichung von O’Sullivan et al. (2018) die Beschäftigung durch die Energiewende insgesamt im Blick. Sie wurde erstmals um eine Zeitreihe ergänzt, welche die Entwicklung der Bruttobeschäftigung durch erneuerbare Energien basierend auf einer konsolidierten Zeitreihe zum Ausbau, dem Bestand und den jährlichen Investitionen konsistent abschätzt. Die Bruttobeschäftigung durch den Ausbau erneuerbarer Energien in Deutschland dient im Folgenden als Ausgangspunkt für die Berechnung der EE-Beschäftigung in den Bundesländern. Dazu wird zunächst kurz auf die Veröffentlichungsreihe zur regionalen Abschätzung eingegangen. Kapitel 2 gibt einen Überblick über die Verteilung der Bruttobeschäftigung in den Bundesländern insgesamt und beleuchtet unterschiedliche Strukturen. Zusätzlich werden der Status und die Entwicklung für drei Energieträger gesondert dargestellt. Kapitel 3 geht auf die einzelnen Entwicklungen in den Bundesländern ein und Kapitel 4 fasst anhand der Gesamtdynamik zusammen und schließt mit einem zusammenfassenden Fazit.
Q43|Zur Berechnung der durch den Ausbau erneuerbarer Energien und durch Energieeffizienz verminderten Importe fossiler Brenn- und Kraftstoffe – Methode und Ergebnisse für die Jahre 2000 bis 2015|Die Energiewende beschreibt den Weg des umfassenden Umbaus des Energiesystems von einem System, das durch den Einsatz fossiler Brennstoffe gekennzeichnet ist, hin zu einem System auf Basis erneuerbarer Energien, in dem Energie sehr viel effizienter genutzt wird. In Deutschland als ressourcenarmem Land ist dies gleichbedeutend mit einem Rückgang fossiler Brennstoffimporte. Der Rückgang von Importen ist wiederum per se gleichbedeutend mit einem Anstieg des Handelsbilanzsaldos. Gleichzeitig lässt sich möglicherweise die Energiesicherheit steigern, denn die importierten fossilen Brennstoffe kommen zum Teil aus politisch wenig stabilen Ländern und sind erheblichen Preisschwankungen unterworfen. Weniger aufwendig als eine detaillierte Modellierung einer kontrafaktischen Entwicklung, die anschließend einem Energiewendeszenario gegenübergestellt wird, und zudem sehr transparent ist es, die Energieimporte aus den entsprechenden Statistiken des Statistischen Bundesamts den notwendigen Energieimporten ohne EE und Effizienz direkt gegenüberzustellen. Auf Basis der vom UBA bereitgestellten Minderung des fossilen Primärenergieeinsatzes in den Bereichen Strom, Wärme und Verkehr wurden für das Monitoring zum Ausbau erneuerbarer Energien in der Begleitforschung jährlich die durch den EE-Ausbau eingesparten Emissionen sowie die Importrückgänge abgeschätzt. Das UBA vergleicht zur Ermittlung der Substitutionsfaktoren zwei Szenarien für das jeweils aktuelle Jahr mittels derer sich ein neuer virtueller Mix ausrechnen lässt, der zu bestimmten Anteilen Energieträger enthält (Steinkohle, Erdgas, Mineralölprodukte), welche zum Teil importiert werden. Mit Importpreisen bewertet lässt sich so eine Abschätzung der Importminderung geben. Diesem Ansatz auch für die Energieeffizienz folgend wird in diesem Bericht ein vereinfachter Schätzansatz vorgeschlagen, der auf dem Vergleich statistischer Daten mit einem transparent konstruierten kontrafaktischen Verbrauch basiert. Ein derartiger Indikator lässt sich leicht fortschreiben und vermittelt als Zeitreihe anschaulich die Entwicklung der Importeinsparung durch die Veränderungen im Energieträgermix und im Energiebedarf insgesamt. Dabei gilt es immer zu berücksichtigen, dass Energieeffizienz nicht ausschließlich durch die Energiewende und die damit verbundenen Maßnahmen ausgelöst wird, sondern auch autonom stattfindet. Zunächst wird hierfür die Konstruktion dieses Indikators ausführlicher beschrieben. Das anschließende Kapitel zeigt die Anwendung der Berechnungsmethode am Beispiel von 2015, wobei sowohl eine gesamtwirtschaftliche Perspektive eingenommen wird als auch die Importeinsparungen in den einzelnen Endenergieverbrauchssektoren berechnet werden. Im Folgenden wird die Importminderung für die Zeit zwischen den Jahren 2000 und 2015 mittels der vorgeschlagenen Methode berechnet und die Ergebnisse werden diskutiert und eingeordnet. Der Bericht schließt mit einer Zusammenfassung und einem Ausblick.
Q43|Gesamtwirtschaftliche Effekte der Energiewende|Für die Transformation des Energiesystems zu einem klimafreundlichen System und dem gleichzeitigen Ausstieg aus der Kernenergie bis zum Jahr 2022 bei Gewährleistung einer sicheren, wirtschaftlichen und umweltverträglichen Energieversorgung sind technologische Entwicklungen und Investitionen notwendig. Da die Energiewende mit gesamtwirtschaftlichen Effekten und vielfältigen Verteilungswirkungen verbunden ist, ist es für die Akzeptanz der Energiewende entscheidend, dass sie gesamtwirtschaftliche Vorteile bzw. keine inakzeptablen Nachteile mit sich bringt und negative Verteilungswirkungen frühzeitig erkannt, begrenzt und – wenn möglich – ausgeglichen werden. In diesem Teilbericht zum gesamten Forschungsvorhaben 21/15 „Makroökonomische Wirkungen und Verteilungsfragen der Energiewende“ werden die Ergebnisse der makroökonomischen Analyse aus Arbeitspaket 3 vorgestellt. Zur Ermittlung der gesamtwirtschaftlichen Wirkungen der Energiewende in der Vergangenheit und zu zukünftigen Wirkungen werden modellgestützt zwei Szenarien einander gegenübergestellt. Das Energiewende-Szenario EWS bildet eine Welt ab, in der die Energiewende seit dem Jahr 2000 so abläuft, wie sie auch faktisch stattgefunden hat und in der in der Zukunft die Ziele der Energiewende erreicht werden. Das Kontrafaktische Szenario KFS bildet eine in sich konsistente alternative Entwicklung ab, die wie folgt beschrieben werden kann: Ab dem Jahr 2000 fand keine Förderung von erneuerbaren Energien und Energieeffizienz statt und wird auch in Zukunft nicht stattfinden. Zur Energieumwandlung werden ab dem Jahr 2000 nur diejenigen Technologien eingesetzt, die sich marktgetrieben durchsetzen. Der Vergleich ökonomischer Kenngrößen unter den jeweiligen Szenarioannahmen lässt Rückschlüsse auf die gesamtwirtschaftliche Vorteilhaftigkeit eines Szenarios gegenüber dem anderen zu. Im Anschluss an die Ausgestaltung der beiden Szenarien sowie die ihnen zugrunde liegenden Annahmen und Rahmendaten für die Entwicklung von 2000 bis heute wird die Entwicklung von Primär- und Endenergieverbrauch sowie der energiebedingten THG-Emissionen in den beiden Szenarien ausführlich beschrieben. Diese Szenarien werden in das umweltökonomische makroökonometrische Modell PANTA RHEI eingestellt. Die damit ermittelten gesamtwirtschaftlichen Ergebnisse werden umfänglich dargestellt und anschließend verschiedene Sensitivitätsrechnungen durchgeführt. Zum einen werden die Effekte des Szenarienvergleichs aufgespalten in Wirkungen auf dem Strommarkt und Effekte, die durch höhere Energieeffizienz und erneuerbare Energien in den verschiedenen Verbrauchssektoren ausgelöst werden. Zum zweiten werden Analysen für die EU-Kommission nachvollzogen, die den Einfluss unterschiedlicher Restriktionen auf Märkten und ihre Umsetzung in konkreten Modellen betrachten. Es folgt eine Einordnung der Ergebnisse, sowohl durch den Vergleich mit nationalen und internationalen Ergebnissen als auch durch Aufzeigen der Grenzen der Modellrechnungen. Außerdem bietet der Report einen kurzen Überblick darüber, wie und wo weitergehende Effekte quantifiziert werden (können). Er schließt mit einer kurzen Zusammenfassung sowie einem Ausblick.
Q43|Gesamtwirtschaftliche Effekte der Energiewende in den Bundesländern – methodische Ansätze und Ergebnisse|Die Energiewende hat eine Vielzahl von wirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen. Versteht man sie als Summe aller Maßnahmen, Instrumente und Strategien der Bundesregierung zur sicheren, umweltverträglichen und bezahlbaren Bereitstellung von Energie seit 2000, so hatte sie erheblichen Einfluss auf die Energiepreise, den Energieträgermix, den Ausbau erneuerbarer Energien und die Zunahme der Energieeffizienz in den meisten Nachfragebereichen. Lutz et al. (2018) kommen in ihrem Bericht zu den gesamtwirtschaftlichen Wirkungen der Energiewende zu dem Schluss, dass „der Vergleich der gesamtwirtschaftlichen Ergebnisse der beiden Szenarien „mit und ohne“ Energiewende, EWS und KFS, im Modell PANTA RHEI durchgehend positive Effekte der Energiewende insgesamt [zeigt]“. Wie aber verteilt sich dieses vielversprechende Ergebnis auf die Bundesländer? Welches Bundesland hat mehr von den positiven Effekten der Energiewende und warum? Zur Beantwortung gilt es, die speziellen Strukturen der Bundesländer, die auf charakteristische Weise auf die Energiewende reagieren, zu identifizieren und datengestützt aufzubereiten. Mit dem in der vorliegenden Untersuchung vorgeschlagenen methodischen Ansatz lassen sich die Auswirkungen der Energiewende von der Bundesebene auf die Bundesländer projizieren. Damit dies über ein einfaches Aufteilen der Effekte hinausgeht, ist eine Vielzahl an Annahmen, wirtschaftsstrukturellen Überlegungen und bundeslandspezifischen Daten notwendig. Die GWS verfügt über ein auf Bundesländer regionalisiertes ökonomisches Modell (LÄNDER, vgl. Anhang), das die Modelle wie PANTA RHEI auf Bundesebene ergänzt. Es basiert auf einer Fülle regionaler Daten wie den Volkswirtschaftlichen Gesamtrechnungen der Länder. Eine Auswertung der bundesweiten Szenarien mittels dieses Instrumentariums gibt einen Einblick in die strukturellen Wirkungen der Energiewende in den Bundesländern. Um die Energiewende in ihren Wirkungen auf Bundeslandebene besser zu verstehen, werden ihre beiden wichtigsten Säulen herausgegriffen und getrennt untersucht. Am Beispiel der Gebäudesanierung und der Stromerzeugungsinfrastruktur eines Bundeslandes werden die wirtschaftlichen Reaktionen auf Veränderungen durch die Energiewende aufgezeigt und untersucht.
Q43|Vorteile der Energiewende über die gesamtwirtschaftlichen Effekte hinaus – eine literaturbasierte Übersicht|Die erreichten und zukünftigen Fortschritte auf dem Weg zu einem nachhaltigen Energiesystem werden von einer Vielzahl von Untersuchungen und Veröffentlichungen begleitet. Die Energiewende bringt jedoch weitere Vorteile jenseits von Beschäftigung und BIP, die teilweise nur schwer quantitativ und monetär zu erfassen sind, sodass sich der Zusammenhang mit der Energiewende dabei nicht auf den ersten Blick erkennen lässt. Zu diesen nur schwer quantifizierbaren Aspekten der Energiewende ist inzwischen eine umfassende Literatur erschienen, die in diesem Beitrag aufgegriffen und eingeordnet wird. Dabei wird zunächst der Frage nachgegangen, warum der jeweilige Aspekt von Vorteil sein könnte, wie die Energiewende auch in Zukunft zu dieser Vorteilhaftigkeit beitragen wird und was die einschlägige Literatur zu dieser Einschätzung beiträgt. Der Fokus liegt auf Deutschland, aber auch internationale Aspekte der Transformation werden aufgegriffen. Der starke Rückgang der Kosten von den für die Energiewende relevanten Technologien ist gerade auch im globalen Rahmen ein beeindruckender Effekt und Vorteil der Energiewende, weshalb zunächst die Kostenentwicklung der letzten Jahre skizziert wird. Mit den Kostensenkungen bewirken die Veränderung der Energieerzeugungsstruktur ebenso wie die Veränderung des Energieverbrauchs und seiner Struktur teilweise tiefgreifende Änderungen auf Produktionsprozesse, mögliche Gewinne und Kosten in der Industrie, sodass im Anschluss der von der Energiewende ausgehende Strukturwandel beleuchtet wird. Es folgen die wesentlichen Ergebnisse und Argumentationen in Bezug auf Energiesicherheit und im Anschluss außenpolitische Aspekte der Energiewende. Das kurze Fazit fasst die wichtigsten Vorteile der Energiewende zusammen, die nach aktueller Literatur über die quantifizierbaren gesamtwirtschaftlichen Effekte hinausgehen.
Q43|Mögliche Engpässe für die Energiewende|Mit der Energiewende (EW) verfolgt Deutschland den langfristigen Umbau des Energiesystems. Der Ausbau erneuerbarer Energien und die Steigerung der Energieeffizienz sind die dabei verfolgten Kernziele. Die Energiewende wirkt gesamtwirtschaftlich positiv (Lutz et al. 2018). Allerdings stellt sich vor dem Hintergrund der sehr robusten gesamt-wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung in den letzten Jahren zunehmend die Frage, ob Engpässe und Restriktionen den Erfolg der Energiewende derzeit oder zukünftig teilweise konterkarieren können. Investitionen in die Energiewende sind wichtig, um die Ziele der Energiewende zu erreichen. Im Folgenden wird auf Basis einer Literaturrecherche für Deutschland untersucht, welche gesamtwirtschaftlichen und sozioökonomischen Zusammenhänge hierbei zu beachten sind. Neben den Engpässen bei der Produktion von Energiewendegütern gibt es auch Restriktionen, die in der Energiewende selbst und dem dazu notwendigen Transformationsprozess begründet sind. Dies sind zum einen Pfadabhängigkeiten der Infrastrukturen und Energiewendegüter, die dazu führen, dass bisherige Technologien lange im Einsatz sind und Investitionen in EW-Güter gebremst werden. Zum anderen handelt es sich um Verhaltensweisen, die die Wirksamkeit der Energiewende begrenzen, wie etwa der Rebound-Effekt, durch den der Energieverbrauch weniger stark zurückgeht als gedacht. Ziel dieses Teils des Beitrags ist es vor allem, zu zeigen, dass die Energiewende nicht im luftleeren Raum, sondern vor dem Hintergrund allgemeiner wirtschaftlicher Engpässe und Wachstumschancen stattfindet. Dazu werden nach einer Definition mögliche Engpässe bei der Produktion der EW-Güter aufgezeigt (Abschnitt 2). Anschließend werden in Abschnitt 3 übergreifende Restriktionen für die Energiewende dargestellt. Der Beitrag schließt mit einem Fazit und einem Ausblick auf die Bereiche, in denen eine tiefergehende Analyse und verstärkte Berücksichtigung bei der Gestaltung der Energiewende wünschenswert wären.
Q43|Not All Regions Are Alike: Evaluating the Effect of Oil Price Shocks on Local and Aggregate Economies|Using a sample of 48 contiguous U.S. states for the period 1973-2013, we study how oil price shocks influence state-level economic growth. The analysis incorporates (1) a structural decomposition of the supply and demand factors that drive the real price of crude oil; (2) heterogeneity of states in terms of their production and consumption of oil and natural gas; and (3) economic spillovers across neighboring states. Oil price effects vary across states, depending on the underlying source of the price shock and a state's average production of oil relative to its average consumption. Oil- exporting states are more vulnerable to unanticipated changes in oil prices, and the direct effect of oil price shocks can magnify or temper effects on neighboring states. Aggregated predictions from the state-level model also differ modestly from stand-alone aggregate model (Kilian , 2009 ). The aggregated state-level model implies that the recent (2005-2016) decline in U.S. dependence on foreign oil reduced aggregate sensitivity to exogenous supply shocks by more than a third.

Q43|The role of natural resources in production: Georgescu-Roegen/Daly versus Solow/Stiglitz|This paper proposes a historical and epistemological account of one of the key controversy between natural resources economics and ecological economics, lasting from early 1970s to the end of 1990s. It shows that the theoretical disagreement on the scope of the economy's dependence to natural resources, such as energy and minerals, has deep methodological roots. On one hand, Solow's and Stiglitz's works are built on a “model-based methodology”, where the model precedes and supports the conceptual foundations of the theory and in particular the assumption of “unbounded resources productivity”. On the other hand, Georgescu-Roegen's counter-assumption of “thermodynamic limits to production”, later revived by Daly, rest on a methodology of “interdisciplinary consistency” which considers thermodynamics as a relevant scientific referent for economic theory. While antagonistic, these two methodologies face similar issues regarding the conceptual foundations that arise from them, which is a source of confusion and of the difficult dialogue between paradigms
Q43|On the current account - biofuels link in emerging and developing countries: do oil price fluctuations matter?|Many developed countries promote the use of biofuels for environmental concerns, leading to a rise in the price of agricultural commodities utilized in their production. Such environmental policies have major effects on the economy of emerging and developing countries whose activity is highly dependent on agricultural commodities involved in biofuel production. This paper tackles this issue by examining the price impact of biofuels on the current account for a panel of 16 developing and emerging countries, and the potential nonlinear effect exerted by the price of oil on this relationship. Relying on the estimation of panel smooth-transition regression models, we show that positive shocks in the price of biofuels lead to a current-account improvement for agricultural commodity exporters (resp. producers) only when the price of oil is below 45 (resp. 56) US dollars per barrel. When the price of oil exceeds these thresholds, the effect of fluctuations in the price of biofuels on the current account tends to weaken and become non significant. Under these conditions, our findings indicate that, for agricultural commodity exporters which are also oil importers, the current account is pulled by two opposite forces, making its overall reaction modest or even nil.
