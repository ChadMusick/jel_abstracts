F64|Global unanimity agreement on the carbon budget|Carbon budgets are a useful way to frame the climate mitigation challenge and much easier to agree upon than the allocation of emissions. We propose a mechanism with countries agreeing on the global carbon budget, while the decision to emit is decentralized at the country level. The revenue is collected in a global fund and allocated according to endogenously defined weights proportional to the marginal cost of climate change. The proposal features a unanimous agreement of the national citizenries of the world and global Pareto efficiency. We run a simulation in the spirit of the Paris Agreement, with zero emissions after 2055. At the Global Unanimity Equilibrium, permits are priced at 90$/tC, yielding 1.3 trillion dollars annually. Africa, India and the less developed countries in Asia are the only net recipients, while the US and China are the largest net contributors.

F64|Trends in policy indicators on trade and environment|Addressing the relationship between domestic environmental regulations and international trade policies is essential to better understand the need for consistency and complementarity between these areas. The set of trade and environment indicators developed by the OECD aims to provide insights on this relationship by shedding light on topical debates regarding the interactions between trade and environmental policies. Issues covered include: carbon emissions embodied in trade; embodied raw materials in trade; the volume of trade in environmentally-related goods; tariffs on environmentally-related goods; support measures for fossil fuels; enabling policy and regulatory environment for renewable energy; the volume of trade in waste and scrap; and nutrient balances of exported grains. Although initial insights are provided for these indicators, no detailed analyses is developed at this stage. Rather, these indicators are building blocks to analyse, for instance, the determinants of identified trends or to allow for a better understanding of the issues at hand. Possible avenues for further policy-relevant investigations using the indicators are identified and discussed for each topic covered.
F64|Trade Negotiations and Global Relations: Emerging Players and Actors|"The EU's development policy seeks to eradicate poverty, promote the sustainable development of developing countries, defend human rights and democracy and promote gender equality and overcome environmental and climate challenges. Development aid is a limited resource. For this reason, the Union is committed to the effectiveness of aid and promotes close relations with partner countries in terms of programming and implementing development actions. With this perspective, the ""EU Code of Conduct on the division of labor in the field of development policy"" was adopted in 2007, and the ""Operational framework on the effectiveness of development aid"" was adopted in 2011. These measures are consistent with the international measures undertaken in response to the 2005 Paris Declaration of the OECD, which promotes ownership, harmonization, alignment, results and mutual responsibility in development assistance. Amidst highly anticipated outcomes from ongoing trade talks between US and China, Brexit negotiations outcomes, as well recently concluded NAFTA negotiations, the atmosphere surrounding global trade relations could not be more highly charged. This volume not only illustrates how the changing face, landscape and scene of political economy and international trade relations are significantly impacting financial stability, regulatory, legal and financial related actors; but also highlights and explains how certain actors are contributing in addressing those instabilities which are threatening current global spheres as a result of recent developments."
F64|CETA and Air Pollution|The study empirically investigates and shows that on average, the implementation of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) may contribute to the fight against global warming. This study finds that on average, a one percent increase of a percentage point in the bilateral volume of trade as a portion of GDP between Canada and a typical EU member could help reduce annual per capita emissions of GHGs in an average CETA member by about .57 percent. The results also show that the presence of CETA may decrease annual per capita emissions of GHGs in almost all CETA members. There is no statistically significant evidence suggesting an increase of GHGs per capita emissions in any CETA member, regardless of the model or statistical method employed in the paper. These results stand because of the combinations of the factor endowment hypothesis (FEH), the pollution haven hypothesis based on population density variations (PHH2), and the pollution haven hypothesis based on national income differences (PHH1) between each EU member and Canada.
F64|The Role of TTIP on Other than CO2 Air Pollutants|We empirically investigate the impacts of the implementation of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) on per capita emissions of eight air pollutants and municipal waste. We employ the same explanatory variables and apply the same empirical strategy and methodologies as in (Qirjo and Pascalau, 2019). We provide robust evidence suggesting that the implementation of TTIP could be beneficial to the environment because it may help reduce per capita emissions of NO2 and HFCs/PFCs/SF6 in a typical TTIP member. This result is based on the statistically significant evidence showing that, on average, the pollution haven motive based on national per capita income variations is dominated by the Factor Endowment Argument based on the classical Heckscher-Ohlin trade theory and the pollution haven motive originating from an inverse measurement of national population density differences. However, we also report generally statistically significant evidence implying that the implementation of TTIP could denigrate the environment because it may help increase per capita emissions of SO2, SOx, NOx, SF6, and NH3.

F64|The Double Crisis: In What Sense A Regional Problem?|We are now facing Sayer’s 'diabolical double crisis' - which encompasses both a deep financial crisis and an environmental one. The scale, scope and nature of this double-crisis is downplayed in the regional studies literature, much of which still focuses on innovative growth models often divorced from broader social and ecological contexts. To help solve both crises we call for regional studies to explore new models that allow us to focus on the most important issues of our time. We illustrate this by focusing on the contradictions in the waste produced by contemporary regional economies - waste of abundance, labour, and resources.
F64|Regulating Mismeasured Pollution: Implications of Firm Heterogeneity for Environmental Policy|This paper provides the first estimates of within-industry heterogeneity in energy and CO2 productivity for the entire U.S. manufacturing sector. We measure energy and CO2 productivity as output per dollar energy input or per ton CO2 emitted. Three findings emerge. First, within narrowly defined industries, heterogeneity in energy and CO2 productivity across plants is enormous. Second, heterogeneity in energy and CO2 productivity exceeds heterogeneity in most other productivity measures, like labor or total factor productivity. Third, heterogeneity in energy and CO2 productivity has important implications for environmental policies targeting industries rather than plants, including technology standards and carbon border adjustments.

F64|Implicaciones de política del Acuerdo de París en la planeación del sistema eléctrico de Colombia|Este documento analiza la incidencia de la política climática internacional en la planeación y el desarrollo del sistema eléctrico de Colombia. Particularmente, estudia las implicaciones que tendría el cumplimiento de las contribuciones nacionalmente determinadas (NDC) presentadas en el Acuerdo de Paris sobre el Sistema Interconectado Nacional. Para lograrlo, este documento se apoyó de las modelaciones realizadas por Arango-Aramburo, et al., (2018), quienes identificaron posibles trayectorias de adaptación del sector eléctrico colombiano, considerando que los escenarios de cambio climático podrían alterar los aportes hídricos a las centrales hidroeléctricas. Los resultados muestran que, ante el incumplimiento del Acuerdo de París, se produciría una disminución en la disponibilidad de generación hidroeléctrica que conduciría a la puesta en marcha de estrategias de adaptación del sistema eléctrico basadas en el uso de combustibles fósiles. En contraste, en el escenario que se implemente el Acuerdo, con su nivel actual de ambición, la disminución en la disponibilidad hídrica en el largo plazo sería menor, y las alternativas de adaptación se dirigirían a emplear energéticos convencionales –carbón, gas– con mecanismo de captura o a diversificar las fuentes de energía hacia las renovables, usando tecnologías como la solar y la eólica.
F64|Curse or Blessing? Has the Impact of Debt Relief Lived up to Expectations? A Review of the Effects of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiatives for Low-Income Countries| As the multilateral debt relief initiatives draw to a close, this article reviews the impacts of debt relief to low-income countries (LICs) building on both the theoretical and empirical literature of past decades. We show that, while the pioneering studies of the early 2000s are inconclusive, the most recent analyses overcome certain methodological impediments to highlight significant multilateral debt relief initiative effects. These analyses hence suggest that these large-scale programmes may well have met expectations, at least in part.
F64|Global climate change mitigation: Strategic incentives|Central to global agreement on carbon emissions are strategic interactions amongst regions over carbon tax implementation and the benefits to be shared. These are re-examined in this paper, in which benefits from mitigation stem from a meta-analysis that links carbon concentration with region-specific measures of economic welfare. Implementation costs are then drawn from a highly disaggregated model of global economic performance. Multiplayer games are then constructed, the results from which are sensitive to embodied temperature scenarios and discount rates but robustly reveal that the US and China would be net gainers from unilateral implementation in net present value terms. The dominant strategy for all other countries is to free ride. Net gains to the three large economies are bolstered by universal adoption, which could be induced by affordable side payments. Yet the revealed downside is that net gains to all regions are negative for at least two decades, rendering commitment to abatement politically difficult.
F64|The impacts of energy prices on industrial foreign investment location: evidence from global firm level data|This paper analyzes the role of energy prices in firms’ investment location decisions in the manufacturing sector. Building on the application of discrete choice theory to the firm location problem, we specify a conditional logit model linking bilateral foreign direct investment (FDI activity to relative energy prices. We then empirically test this link using a global dataset of M&A deals in the manufacturing sector covering 41 countries between 1995 and 2014, using econometric techniques adapted from the estimation of gravity models. The results suggest that upon deciding to invest, firms are attracted to regions that have lower energy prices. However, counterfactual simulations reveal that unilateral implementation of a $50/tCO2 carbon tax by various coalitions of countries is expected to have limited negative impact on the attractiveness of economies to foreign industrial investments. Hence, our results support the pollution haven effect, but find the magnitude is limited and could be addressed with targeted measures in the most energy intensive sectors.
F64|Discrepancies Between Environmental Kuznets Curves For Production- And Consumption-Based Co2 Emissions|This paper analyzes the patterns of CO2 emissions for a sample of 144 countries in 1992–2013. The environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis was tested with the help of econometric analysis for both production- and consumption-based emissions. The relationship between incomes and emissions was also examined for leading national economies. The results show an important distinction: while there is some evidence of decoupling between economic growth and the growth of production-based emissions at a higher level of income, consumption-based emissions continue to grow with rising incomes even in the richest countries. There is further investigation of the discrepancies between production and consumption EKCs, which are determined by emissions embodied in international trade. A structural decomposition analysis (SDA) was applied to define the contribution of different factors to the change in emissions embodied in trade with the rise of GDP per capita. While structural and technological factors explain most of this change at low and middle levels of income, the effect of the volume of trade plays the key role in the evolution of emissions embodied in trade in high-income countries
F64|Income-FDI-Environmental degradation nexus for developing countries: A panel analysis of America continent|The study attempts to find out relationships among income, FDI and environmental degradation for developing countries of America continent. Moreover, study examines existence of environmental Kuznets curve and pollution haven hypothesis for developing countries of America continent. The study uses panel data from 1990 to 2014 for America continent and employs four techniques i-e pooled OLS, fixed effects (FEM), random effects (REM) and two stages least square (2SLS). Findings of the study do not confirm existence of both EKC and PHH for America continent. The study also concludes that energy use, population density, globalization and human capital have significant impact on environmental degradation in America continent. The study recommends that policies should target CO2 emissions reduction either by setting threshold or by penalizing pollution intensive industries. Further, cleaner energy and technological developments should be promoted.
F64|Environmental Costs of European Union Membership: A Structural Decomposition Analysis|The interest in this paper lies in the environmental costs of the European Union (EU). EU membership requires a series of economic and political changes that should impact the country’s production and consumption structures and its trade relationships. These, in turn, will affect CO2 emissions sources and levels. This is especially true for the former Soviet Union countries that recently joined the EU, given the difference in their levels of development and production structure.Using a structural decomposition analysis we are able to quantify the main drivers of changes in emissions differentiating six components, namely: emissions intensity, industrial structure and sourcing,consumer preferences, final demand sourcing and consumption level. Grouping the countries into five clubs, New European Union countries, Old European Union countries, the United States of America, China, and the Rest of the World, we measure trading pattern changes and their impact on CO2 emission levels.
F64|Competences required for environmentally responsible managers - a European perspective|The main purpose of this paper is to identify the competences required for environmentally responsible managers in sustainable supply chain management. The proposed paper will analyze skills needed for green management. Along with theoretical study it will present the research results of the international TrainERGY project (http://www.trainergy-project.eu/) aimed at promoting green thinking among enterprises and academics across four European countries: Poland, United Kingdom, Italy and Greece. The findings of the research cover the differences between countries in terms of managers? environmental skills presence index which is a measure representing presence of particular skills in the surveyed companies. It also highlights the essential directions of a design and a content of the current and future environmental education and practice.
F64|Incorporating CO2 emissions into macroeconomic models through primary energy use|Two key pillars of the energy quadrilemma (which measure the sustainability of energy policy) are a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and economic development. Recent worldwide energy policy has focused on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, which will influence, and in turn be influenced by, economic activity and energy use. As such, it is critically important to identify and incorporate emissions into macroeconomic models. Typically, emissions are linked to economic activity via the level of output, both calculated at a sectoral level. However, this approach - while consistent with linear models such as Input-Output - assumes that emissions per unit of output remains constant, which can be problematic with more complex economic systems. In this paper we detail a method for incorporating sectoral and aggregate CO2 emissions into a macroeconomic model (CGE) of the UK through the use of sectoral primary energy use.
F64|Empirical estimates of the methane–income elasticity|We estimate the income-elasticity of methane emissions per capita derived from production, final production, and consumption in a global sample of countries for 1997–2011. We find relative decoupling between emissions and income, and evidence for a piecewise-linear relationship. The relation between economic growth and emissions improves as countries reach high levels of income, although the magnitude of the improvement is small. This points to very minor methane-efficiency gains from economic development.

F64|Carbon Dioxide Emissions and Economic Growth: An Assessment Based on Production and Consumption Emission Inventories|Working with a new dataset on comparable global CO2 production and consumption inventories spanning the 1997–2011 period, we investigate the relationship between real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and CO2 emissions per capita associated with both production and consumption activities. By including linkages between production-based emissions in one country and final consumption in another (via cross-border value chains), we focus on the entire carbon chain. We estimate polynomial and threshold models, accounting for reverse causality and identification problems. We find that the income-elasticity for both inventories is regime-dependent and reflects small carbon efficiency gains from economic development. Carbon footprints show larger income-elasticities, while national policy instruments targeting production can clearly be circumvented by carbon embodied in intermediate trade. This implies problems of environmental sustainability that may require consumption-based policy instruments.
F64|Economic Liberalization and the Environmental Kuznets Curve: Some Empirical Evidence|This paper applies the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) model to examine the impact of trade openness, foreign direct investment liberalization, the decreasing role of the state, energy consumption and urbanization on per capita emission in countries at various stages of economic development and as a group. For this purpose, a dynamic panel estimation applying the Arellano-Bond¡¯s Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) was conducted using the average of five-year observations from 1980?2009. The findings suggest that while trade and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) are not expected to affect environmental quality, increasing role of the state has a negative and significant impact only in developed countries. Further, the results suggest that energy consumption has a significant impact on all countries regardless of their stage of development, while urbanization affects environmental quality only in the least developed countries.
F64|Productivity Gaps and Vertical Technology Spillovers from Foreign Direct Investment: Evidence from Vietnam|Developing countries are eager to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) to gain positive technology spillovers for their local firms. However, which type of foreign firm is desirable for a host country looking for beneficial spillovers? At first sight, foreign firms with higher productivity may seem of more benefit by transferring their advanced knowledge; however, their technological and managerial knowledge may be too advanced for local firms to learn. To address this question, we use firm-level panel data from Vietnam to investigate whether foreign Asian investors in downstream sectors affect the productivity of local Vietnamese firms in upstream sectors according to the foreign firms' differing productivity levels. Using the method of endogenous structural breaks, we divide Asian investors into low, middle, and high productivity groups.The results suggest that the middle group has the strongest and most significant positive impact on local suppliers' productivity.

F64|Enabling Transformative Research: Lessons from the Eastern and Southern Africa Partnership Programme (1999-2015)|World leaders at the 2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Summit in New York have re- confirmed the relevance of sustainability as the guiding paradigm in countering the development and climate crisis of the Anthropocene. Recent decades however, have been characterized by confusion, contestations, and arbitrariness in defining the nature and pathways of sustainable development. Humanity must urgently find ways to unlock the potential of the sustainability paradigm and organize a sustainability transforma- tion. An emerging sustainability science community has already established considerable consensus on essential features of transformative science and research. Sustainability scholars are providing growing evidence that an emancipatory and democratic construction of sustainable development and more equitable, deliberative, and democratized knowledge generation are pivotal in tackling sustainability challenges. These findings are further underpinned by experiences gained in the Eastern and Southern Africa Partnership Programme (1999â€“2015)â€”a rare case of a long-term, transnational, and transdisciplinary research en- deavour already completed. The programme fulfilled the dual role which is compulsory in transformative research: It generated contextualized knowledge and innovation at the scienceâ€“society interface while simultaneously securing meaningful participation and Southern agency in a co-evolutionary process. This paper offers insight into the programmeâ€™s adaptive structure and implementation processes, which fostered deliberation, capacity development, and joint programme navigation benchmarked against local needs and broader sustainability demands. The ESAPP experience confirms that, if taken as the overarching frame of reference for all actors involved, the sustainability paradigm unfolds its integrative and transformative power. It enables sustainability-oriented actors from all scientific and practical fields to seek consilience between differing development and innovation paradigms and synchronize their development agendas and research frameworks on behalf of societal co-production of knowledge and innovation. Accordingly, the sustainability paradigm has the power to guide development and innovation policy, and practice out of the current confusion and ineffectiveness.
F64|Pluralism in Search of Sustainability: Ethics, Knowledge and Methdology in Sustainability Science|Sustainability Science is an emerging, transdisciplinary academic field that aims to help build a sustainable global society by drawing on and integrating research from the humanities and the social, natural, medical and engineering sciences. Academic knowledge is combined with that from relevant actors from outside academia, such as policy-makers, businesses, social organizations and citizens. The field is focused on examining the interactions between human, environmental, and engineered systems to understand and contribute to solutions for complex challenges that threaten the future of humanity and the integrity of the life support systems of the planet, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and land and water degradation. Since its inception in around the year 2000, and as expressed by a range of proponents in the field, sustainability science has become an established international platform for interdisciplinary research on complex social problems [1]. This has been done by exploring ways to promote â€˜greater integration and cooperation in fulfilling the sustainability science mandateâ€™ [2]. Sustainability science has thereby become an extremely diverse academic field, yet one with an explicit normative mission. After nearly two decades of sustainability research, it is important to reflect on a major question: what critical knowledge can we gain from sustainability science research on persistent socio-ecological problems and new sustainability challenges?
F64|Making Research Matter Moreâ€”Working with Action Research and Film in Sustainability Science|Advocacy for both critical analysis of social and environmental change and a more solutions-oriented agenda has been a central mission of sustainability science since its inception [1]. To this end, integration of knowledge across disciplinary divides and inclusion of non-academic actors into the research process have been widely promoted (e.g. [2â€“4]). Aspirations to link knowledge to action do not only bear on processes of knowledge generation, but also on strategies for research outreach.
F64|Sustainability Science in the Light of Urban Planning|The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that, as part of its mission, sustainability science can change the way planners engage with urban problems on three points: First, that effective standard planning is an illusion, and the crucial task for urban planners should be consideringâ€”on a place-based rationaleâ€”the long-term consequences of decisions, policies and, technology change. Second,how it is necessary to develop collaborative planning and co-production of knowledge. Third, to build effective actions on the basis of collaborative planning, it is crucial to take first into account how the population and the institutions respond to and resist change. Conversely, this paper shows that urban planning is also a breeding ground for consolidating the theoretical framework of sustainability science, considering that cities can be seen as paragons of both socio-ecological systems and complex adaptive systemsâ€”a position that is discussed throughout the article. Bringing sustainability science and urban planning in closer dialogue with each other, to exploit their potential synergies, has not been done sufficiently: It is an important gap in the academic literature that this article aims at filling.
F64|Methodological Challenges in Sustainability Science: A Call for Method Plurality, Procedural Rigor and Longitudinal Research|Sustainability science encompasses a unique field that is defined through its purpose, the problem it addresses, and its solution-oriented agenda. However, this orientation creates significant methodological challenges. In this discussion paper, we conceptualize sustainability problems as wicked problems to tease out the key challenges that sustainability science is facing if scientists intend to deliver on its solution-oriented agenda. Building on the available literature, we discuss three aspects that demand increased attention for advancing sustainability science: 1) methods with higher diversity and complementarity are needed to increase the chance of deriving solutions to the unique aspects of wicked problems; for instance, mixed methods approaches are potentially better suited to allow for an approximation of solutions, since they cover wider arrays of knowledge; 2) methodologies capable of dealing with wicked problems demand strict procedural and ethical guidelines, in order to ensure their integration potential; for example, learning from solution implementation in different contexts requires increased comparability between research approaches while carefully addressing issues of legitimacy and credibility; and 3) approaches are needed that allow for longitudinal research, since wicked problems are continuous and solutions can only be diagnosed in retrospect; for example, complex dynamics of wicked problems play out across temporal patterns that are not necessarily aligned with the common timeframe of participatory sustainability research. Taken together, we call for plurality in methodologies, emphasizing procedural rigor and the necessity of continuous research to effectively addressing wicked problems as well as methodological challenges in sustainability science.
F64|You Can't Eat Biodiversity: Agency and Irrational Norms in European Aquatic Environmental Law|Policies of the European Union cover a range of social, environmental and economic aspirations and the current environmental directives and laws have evolved from a suite of norms which have changed over time. These may be characterised loosely according to 'Three Ps': Practical, those taking an anthropocentric approach; Pure, those taking an ecocentric approach and Popular, those appealing to the general public. In this paper I use these three perspectives as a tool to analyse the complexity and identify contradictions in European aquatic environmental legislation. Some trade-offs between development and conservation are identified and used to characterise the potential qualities of more successful agency to achieve environmental goals in the governance of European aquatic environments.
F64|Fostering the Next Generation of Sustainability Professionals â€“ Assessing Field-based Courses in a Sustainability Science Graduate Program|A growing number of educational programs in sustainability science has paralleled the rise of the field itself. The educational approach of these programs follows the problem-driven, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary nature of the field itself. However, its effectiveness has yet to be systematically evaluated. Similarly, while ad-hoc evaluation schemes have attempted to monitor the quality of the educational programs, there is no standard method that accounts for the particularities of sustainability science programs. This study thus addresses the need for an assessment of the problem-driven approach of educational programs in sustainability science. We have conducted student self-assessments of field courses in the Graduate Program in Sustainability Science (GPSS-GLI) at The University of Tokyo, which positions its field courses at the center of its curriculum. The self-assessments were based on five key competencies identified as particularly important for sustainability professionals. Workshops and questionnaires engaged students in a reflection of the six field courses and of their own personal development through the activities offered. Our questionnaire results indicate that the majority of participants were satisfied with how the courses furthered their personal development. While some participants expressed frustration at being unable to sufficiently address the respective field's sustainability challenges due to time constraints, students generally recognized the five key competencies as important for addressing sustainability issues after participating in the courses. Moreover, participants attributed much of their learning to their active engagement in planned field research activities, rather than to passive learning. Variations in results across different course units provide material for further analysis and development of the curriculum. This study is an initial attempt at assessment, with room for ongoing improvement and further research to address additional requirements for fostering the next generation of sustainability professionals.
F64|Alternative Perspectives on Sustainability: Indigenous Knowledge and Methodologies|Indigenous knowledge (IK) is now recognized as being critical to the development of effective, equitable and meaningful strategies to address socio-ecological crises. However efforts to integrate IK and Western science frequently encounter difficulties due to different systems of knowledge production and underlying worldviews. New approaches are needed so that sustainability can progress on the terms that matter the most for the people involved. In this paper we discuss a case study from Aotearoa New Zealand where an indigenous community is in the process of renegotiating and enacting new indigenous-led approaches to address coupled socio-ecological crises. We reflect on novel methodological approaches that highlight the ways in which projects/knowledge are co-produced by a multiplicity of human and non-human actors. To this end we draw on conceptualizations of environmental ethics offered by indigenous scholars and propose alternative bodies of thought, methods, and practices that can support the wider sustainability agenda.
F64|Editorial Volume 13|Dear Reader, Those among us who have reached a certain age tend to have developed a long-term perspective and inclination to look back on individual years and to compare them for their respective blessings and injuries. In that sense, 2016 seems to take a special rank as an annus horribilis not just in my own assessment but in numerous commentaries we have come across over the past weeks. Foremost in our awareness featured the surprises: Nobody in my direct acquaintance foretold the Trump phenomenon or the Brexit decision. To find events equally unanticipated and far-reaching, one would have to go back to the 2007/8 financial crash, the 9/11 attacks, the dissolution of the USSR, or the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
F64|Threats to Security Posed by ISIS in Syria: A Human Security Approach|The civil war in Syria coupled with the attacks by ISIS, has resulted in one of the largest humanitarian crises since World War II. Although international efforts have resulted in regaining control of important cities, these military approaches have escalated and inflamed the violence of which innocent civilians bear the consequences. The continuing violence and resulting threats or insecurities negatively affect the lives, freedom, dignity and development of the people to name but a few. For that reason, the aim is to explore the applicability of a human security approach to the conflict in Syria that focuses on, among other aspects, minimising violence, mitigating the effects of the conflict, protecting people, restoring peace and eliminating the grounds that resulted in the development of these conditions in the first place.
F64|Emerging Security Challenges to Africa: The Case of Haphazard Disposal of Pharmaceuticals in Ghana|The study of the Disposal of Unused/Unwanted Medicines Project examines ways in which medicines are disposed of in Ghana and assesses how disposal methods can impact water resources. The study showed a number of challenges: gaps in the legislative framework for the disposal of medicines; environmentally-unfriendly methods of disposal of medicines; and large quantities of medicines potentially disposed of indiscriminately with major impact on the environment. It recommends a review of the legal framework to ensure the proper disposal of all unused medicines; policies to mop up excess medicines with members of the public; review of prescribing and dispensing practices to reduce excess medicines; and further research into the types of pharmaceuticals that are present and persist in the environment, their effects and how they affect quality of life.
F64|Sustaining nature-based tourism in Iceland|Iceland has been experiencing a tourism boom. The number of tourists visiting annually quadrupled between 2010 and 2016 and shows continued strength. The tourism sector is now the major export earner and is also creating new jobs and supporting new businesses. The government budget has also benefitted from high tax revenues. The surge in tourism supported growth after the crisis and the sector has become a major pillar of the economy. But, the breakneck growth of tourism has created a number of challenges. Growing pains have emerged as accommodation supply has lagged in the wake of unexpectedly large number of tourists, contributing to pressure on the local housing market. The environment, particularly in some popular sites, has also come under pressure. The government has reacted to these environmental and social impacts and has worked with the industry to agree on a path forward. Sustaining a nature-based tourism for Iceland will require more coordinated policy across government and a long-term strategic plan that builds on Iceland's strengths. Protecting the unique environmental attractions of Iceland - while mitigating adverse social impacts - will lay the basis for the healthy development of a new important sector. This working paper relates to the 2017 OECD Economic Survey of Iceland (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-iceland.htm).
F64|Trade in services related to the environment|This paper discusses the nature and scope of international trade in environmentally related services, and analyses the implications that services trade restrictions have on the provisions of these services domestically and abroad. Numerous services appear crucial to the delivery and proper functioning of environmental goods and equipment be they a wastewater-treatment facility or a renewable power plant. By helping lower the costs of these services and improving access to world-class suppliers, trade policy can contribute alongside energy and environmental policy to the prevention and abatement of greenhouse-gas emissions and pollution in all its forms. Besides clarifying the role and scope of services related to the environment, the analysis undertaken in this paper suggests that the restrictions that countries impose on services trade may have a detrimental effect on the provision of environmental activities through the establishment by specialised firms of a commercial presence abroad, i.e. through mode 3 trade in services.
F64|The Role of TTIP on the Environment|The current study empirically investigates and shows that, on average, the possible implementation of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) would generally help in the fight against global warming. In particular, the study finds that a 1% increase in the bilateral trade between the United States and the typical EU member would reduce annual per capita emissions of CO2 and GHGs in the typical TTIP member by about 2.7% and 2.4%, respectively. However, results also show that TTIP may increase annual per capita emissions of GHGs in the United States by about 2.5% per year. These results stand because the factor endowment hypothesis and the pollution haven hypothesis based on population density variations appear to dominate the pollution haven hypothesis based on national income differences.
F64|East Asian Integration: Towards an East Asian Economic Community|East Asia is a region of great global significance, currently accounting for around 30% of the global economy by most measures, e.g. production, trade, investment, and finance. It has also become increasingly integrated in various ways. Integration at the micro-level has steadily progressed since the 1960s, as indicated by rising intraregional trade. Moreover, East Asia’s economic regionalisation has become more functionally integrative, this broadly relating to the spread of transnational business and other technical systems where production, trade, and investment have become a function of each other within those systems. For example, as later explored, much of East Asia’s regionalised trade concerns cross-border movement of parts and components within the international production networks of multinational enterprises. Since the 1990s, East Asian states have in addition looked to strengthen regional cooperation and integration intergovernmentally at the macro-level, i.e. involving whole country economies. This has been driven by the need to manage their growing regional economic interdependencies and address future challenges that confront them all, such as globalisation and climate change. As we will discuss, this has been part of regional economic community-building efforts in East Asia, both across the whole region and within it at various subregional levels. We examine the key dimensions of East Asia’s integration, how they have developed over time, and what likely paths lie ahead in the endeavour to strengthen regional economic community-building.
F64|A microeconometric analysis of climate change drivers for coffee crops transition to cacao in Mesoamerican countries|Climate change will have a permanent impact over Mesoamerican agricultural sector. Present day crops such as coffee may not be enough to secure agricultural subsistence levels, therefore, the first stages of crop diversification are being observed in countries such as Nicaragua. Implementation of new crops such as cocoa may lead to new impacts over the environmental structure of the Mesoamerican ecosystem. These impacts may be of different, nature, but being diversification an already undergoing process attention must be paid to the underlying motivation and decision-making processes involved. This study analyses subjacent motivations and contexts that lead to the potential incorporation of cocoa crops in present-day Nicaraguan coffee farms. In order to achieve that, three main motivations were identified: climatic, economic and governmental. An econometric analyse was performed over the variables that affect farmers? motivations and decisions, in order first to analyse this decision-making process, and second, to understand how social and climatic evolution over the next decades will impact the context under which agricultural output is shaped. It was found that climatic perspectives are most closely affecting the smallholders? decision of incorporating cocoa plantations into their farms. Therefore, climate change will most certainly have a major role in the reshaping of agricultural structure in most of Nicaraguan geography. Moreover, results show a lower impact of market conditions and public subsidies over farmers? choices and decisions. These results favour the intuition that risk-reduction is a preferred strategy among Nicaraguan smallholders.
F64|Environmental policies and practices in Cruise Ports: Waste reception facilities in the Med|With cruise activities continuing to grow, the cruise world and related decision makers take initiatives aiming to handle the produced externalities. Among the key environmental issues is the handling of the various wastes produced on cruise ships. In recent times, cruise lines and ports have put efforts into reducing, selecting and managing generated wastes implementing the requirements of the international regulatory framework (MARPOL 73/78), as well as those imposed by the European legislation. This study focuses on the state port reception facilities (PRF) in the case of the second biggest cruise region of the world, the Mediterranean and its adjoining seas. In particular, it sheds light on the extent that the current practices of cruise ports have achieved a satisfactory level of compliance to the emerging environmental related international regulatory framework. The paper does so via a survey that maps the existing conditions and port based practices followed by 40 port entities that manage 52 cruise ports in the region. The findings record the available facilities, technologies and services suggesting a widespread effective correspondence to required adjustment. It also details a variation as regards the charging practices, that might affect the level playing field. The analysis generates knowledge on the emphasis given by cruise ports in addressing environment challenges. Given that the European Directive governing PRF is currently (2016) under review, the study provides practical recommendations to decision makers and practitioners on what can be done so as to further secure a sustainable cruise future.
F64|Drivers of international shipments of hazardous waste: the role of policy and technology endowment|Using a gravity model for trade, this work analyzes the factors influencing the patterns of international hazardous waste flows, relying on newly available data reported in the E-PRTR (European Pollutant Release and Transfer Registry) for EU-OECD countries over the period 2007 to 2014. Exploiting a consolidated empirical framework (Kellenberg, 2012), we test two empirical hypotheses: firstly, we explicitly assess if, according to the pollution heaven hypothesis (PHH), the relative levels of environmental policies across countries are an important determinant of hazardous waste trade, and secondly, we test if technological specialization, proxied here by a technology-specific patent stock, can be considered as a pull factor capable to influence the patterns of international trade of hazardous waste.
F64|Environmental Disasters and Electoral Cycle: An Empirical Analysis on Floods and Landslides in Italy|Abstract The aim of this paper is to analyse potential drivers of land use policy, in the form of building permits issued in Italian provinces. We first derive testable implications on the basis of a standard political agency framework, augmented to account for the impact of past environmental disasters (floods, landslides and earthquakes) and for the relevance of “building permits intensive” sectors in determining voters’ support to an incumbent politician. We then perform an empirical analysis that tests theoretical predictions using a unique dataset covering Italy in the period 2001–2012. Our main conclusions show that the occurrence of floods and earthquakes decreases building permits, implying that a bad history in terms of these phenomena strengthens the importance of voters affected by past disasters. No corresponding evidence seems to emerge with reference to landslides. On the other hand, the relevance of the construction sector increases the number of building permits issued. Finally, when elections approach, the number of building permits issued grows, suggesting that incumbent politicians may distort land use policies in order to favour “brown” voters in periods close to elections.
F64|Indigenous knowledge for sustainable livelihoods: Lessons from ecological pest control and post-harvest techniques of Baduy (West Java) and Nguni (Southern Africa)|With the impending threat of global climate change, the last decades have witnessed an increasing recognition of the potential contribution of indigenous knowledge to tackling global challenges of environmental sustainability. The sources and wisdom of indigenous knowledge have however much more to contribute to global knowledge, well beyond environment conservation and traditional medicine. This paper uses the examples of swidden cultivation, pest control and rice preservation techniques of the Baduy in West Java (Indonesia) and comparable grain pits utilisation by Nguni tribes in Southern Africa to discuss how indigenous sources of knowledge can be an inspiration for greater social cohesion and sustainable livelihoods. It also draws lessons showing that combining indigenous knowledge systems with modern scientific methods can make it possible to achieve results that neither system can do alone.
F64|Global Climate Change Mitigation: Strategic Interaction or Unilateral Gains?|Global agreement to reduce carbon emissions has been weakened by slowing growth and burden sharing conflicts. This paper examines strategic interaction amongst regions by simplifying the policy choice to that between carbon taxation and free riding. Benefits from climate change mitigation are constructed via a meta-analysis of existing studies that link carbon concentration with average surface temperature and measures of economic welfare. Implementation costs are then derived by modeling national and global economic performance. Multiplayer, normal form games with payoffs derived by netting costs from shared benefits are then constructed, revealing that the US economy is a net gainer in net present value terms from unilateral implementation. The comparative net benefits to Europe and China are negative but small, making their choice sensitive to the discount rate. The dominant strategy for all other countries is to free ride. Taking the three large economies as a group, there are net gains from implementing carbon taxes, which would be bolstered by universal adoption. Yet compensatory side payments that would induce universal adoption are still not affordable. Moreover, the net gains to all regions do not begin to appear for at least two decades, rendering commitment to abatement politically difficult.
F64|Approaches to the implementation of the sustainable development goals: Some considerations on the theoretical underpinnings of the 2030 Agenda|The paper discusses the theoretical underpinning of the concept of sustainable development, especially in relation to follow-up and review, including ex post evaluation of progress. The purpose is to explore methodological aspects of applied approaches to the implementation process, e.g. ways to unravel possible interactions among the numerous SDGs and targets, and to assess trade-offs between interventions. The aim is to go beyond various sustainable development interpretations, by exploring how they perceive and approach implementation of the goals, taking the complexity of this substantial task into account. The paper surveys the theoretical economic underpinning of the 2030 Agenda and the role of neoclassical economic theory in this context. Implementation routes for sustainable development interpretations based on other theoretical frameworks are briefly sketched for comparison. The analysis leads to the claim that it is questionable whether interpretations of sustainable development founded on neoclassical economic theory - as the 2030 Agenda - are applicable in relation to every aspect of sustainability.
F64|Economic Implications of EU Mitigation Policies: Domestic and International Effects|The EU has a consolidated climate and energy regulation: it played a pioneering role by adopting a wide range of climate change policies and establishing the first regional Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). These policies, however, raise several concerns regarding both their environmental effectiveness and their potentially negative effect on the economy, especially in terms of growth and competitiveness. The paper reviews the European experience in order to understand if these concerns are supported by quantitative evidence. It thus focuses on key economic indicators, such as costs, competitiveness and carbon leakage as assessed by quantitative ex-ante and ex-post analyses. A dedicated section, extends the investigation to the potential extra-EU spillover of the EU mitigation policy with a particular attention to developing countries. The objective of the paper is to highlight both the limits and the opportunities of the EU regulatory framework in order to offer policy insights to emerging and developing countries that are on the way to implement climate change measures. Overall, the European experience shows that the worries about the costs and competitiveness losses induced by climate regulation are usually overestimated, especially in the long term. In addition, a tightening climate policy regime in the EU might in fact negatively impact developing countries via deteriorated trade relations. Nonetheless it tends to facilitate a resource relocation that if well governed could be beneficial to those countries where the poor are mainly involved in rural activities.
F64|The impact of auditing on green information and communication technologies|The main purpose of this paper is to identify how auditors can contribute to supporting the protection of natural environment, without this being subject to their engagement. The interest in the topic was determined, on the one hand, by the infiltration of the information and communication technologies (ICT) in the auditors’ work and, on the other hand, by the significant increase of the concerns for environmental protection. The intersection of the two areas has led to the concept of green ICT auditing, approached by the present study. Within it, we argued the importance of establishing positive connections between auditing, environment and ICT for the society. We provided a brief presentation of the green ICT concept, as a result of the selection and study of the most relevant opinions from the specific literature. Next, in the most important part of the paper, we presented in detail how auditing can contribute to augmenting the favourable influences of green ICT on the environment, the latter being regarded both as a subject and as an object of auditing. Based on the information collected while performing the study, we concluded that auditors can have a significant role in decreasing the influence of ICT on the environment, but only if their endeavours are supported and sustained by the companies subject to audit engagements.
F64|Klimatske Promjene I Njihov Uticaj Na Zemlje Regiona|Savremene promjene i globalno zagrijavanje izazvane ljudskim aktivnostima su teme koje privlače mnogo pažnje na svim nivoima društva, kao i zainteresovanost od strane naučnika za detaljnije proučavanje. Uticaj klimatskih promjena zavisi od stope klimatskih promjena, izloženosti i osjetljivosti ekološkog i socio-ekonomskog sistema, kao i sposobnosti društva da se prilagodi tim promjenama. Procjenjuje se da će najviše štete donijeti zemljama u razvoju, jer nijesu spremne na ovakve promjene. Time se promoviše korišćenje obnovljive i čiste energije, kao i djelovanje zemalja na međunarodnom planu, a sve u cilju suzbijanja štetnih efekata klimatskih promjena. Veza između klimatskih promjena i održivog rasta je istaknuta i u mnogim međunarodnim okvirima koji su zaključeni do sada, a glavni razlog za njihovo kreiranje je borba protiv klimatskih promjena. Okvirna Konvencija UN o Klimatskim Promjenama, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) i Kjoto protokol su jedni od bitnijih okvira i njihovo glavno dostignuće je uvođenje obavezujućih mjera za smanjenje emisije gasova sa efektom staklene bašte za razvijene zemlje zajedno sa principima zajedničkih, ali različitih odgovornosti i fleksibilnih mehanizama koji se koriste da bi se označili ekološki, sociološki i ekonomski ciljevi na integrisan način. Posebna pažnja u ovom radu se daje regionu Zapadnog Balkana ili zemljama jugoistočne Evrope.
F64|Trade-off Curves and Elasticity Analysis in Multi Fuel Options System and Combined Problem|Recent environmental concerns and policies have reformulated the traditional economic dispatch problem by including the emission impacts in the mathematical model. The combined economic and emission dispatch problem is a multi-objective non-linear optimization problem. This paper presents a method to consider the fuel costs and environmental emissions simultaneously. The ?-constraint method for bi-objective optimization has been used to generate Pareto front. Furthermore, trade-off curves have been developed for different types of emission. The elasticity of cost with respect to the emission (say, emission elasticity) has been estimated for all Pareto optimal points and different types of emissions that provides invaluable information for the system operator to run the system with sufficient flexibility subject to technical constraints while the operator has multi fuel options. Moreover, the emission elasticity is effective tool for competition in the electricity market. The Iranian electricity market is considered as empirical evidence.
F64|Dynamic Impact of Income Inequality on Carbon Dioxide Emissions in Africa: New Evidence from Heterogeneous Panel Data Analysis|We extended the study of Zhang and Zhao (2014) for China, which examines the regional impact of carbon dioxide emissions on income inequality. The present article examine the dynamic impact of income inequality on carbon dioxide emissions in Africa. We applied heterogeneous panel autoregressive distributed lag techniques of mean group (MG) and pooled MG suggested by Pesaran et al. (1999), during 1984-2001. The main empirical result reveals that; the relationship between income inequality and carbon dioxide emissions is negative and statistically significant. This means that; widening income inequality could lead to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in the sampled countries. Moreover, the variables of trade openness, per-capita gross domestic product (GDP), and urbanization are positive and statistically significant; this means that increase in any of these variables could lead to overall increase in the level of carbon dioxide emissions. Therefore, in providing policies that will be used to improve environmental quality in Africa, income inequality should not be considered because it is reducing the level of environmental degradation through reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. Hence, policy makers should not consider income inequality when formulating environmental policies among the selected sample countries.
F64|Macroeconomic impacts of climate change mitigation in Latin America: A cross-model comparison|In this paper we analyse macroeconomic consequences of greenhouse gas emission mitigation in Latin America up to 2050 through a multi-model comparison approach undertaken in the context of the CLIMACAP–LAMP research project. We compare two carbon tax scenarios with a business-as-usual scenario of anticipated future energy demand. In the short term, with carbon prices reaching around $15/tCO2 by 2030, most models agree that the reduction in consumer spending, as a proxy for welfare, is limited to about 0.3%. By 2050, at carbon prices of $165/tCO2, there is much more divergence in the estimated impact on consumer spending as well as GDP across models and regions, which reflects uncertainties about technology costs and substitution opportunities between technologies. We observe that the consequences of increasingly higher carbon prices, in terms of reduced consumer spending and GDP, tend to be fairly linear with the carbon price in our CGE models. However, the consequences are divergent and nonlinear in our econometric model, that is linked to an energy system model that simulates step-changes in technology substitution. The results of one model show that climate policy measures can have positive effects on consumer spending and GDP, which results from an investment stimulus and the redistribution of carbon price revenues to consumers.
F64|Energy use, international trade and economic growth nexus in Australia: New evidence from an extended growth model|This study investigates the existence of either energy-led growth hypothesis or trade-led growth in Australia for a 53-year period (1960–2012) using a multivariate extended growth model. The econometric techniques used in this study are Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach of cointegration, the Granger Causality Test and Impulse Response Functions. The study finds the evidence of no long-run cointegration between the variables of interest. Granger causality test confirms bidirectional causal relationship between international trade and per capita GDP growth, but does not find any Granger causal relationship between energy use and per capita GDP growth. Thus, this study provides an evidence of the trade-led growth hypothesis over the energy-led growth hypothesis for the Australian macroeconomy.
F64|Global resilience to climate change: Examining global economic and environmental performance resulting from a global carbon dioxide market|In this study, we investigated global economic and environmental resilience in the presence of climate change. In particular, we examine the possibility of mitigating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions without stressing standards of living. Here, we set up a cross-country CO2 market constrained by a quota, where CO2 is optimally re-allocated based on relative shadow prices of the pollutant. The objective is to stabilize global emissions without hindering global incomes and in the process achieve a single CO2 price. We introduce a re-allocation model that takes into account each country’s underlying polluting technology. The model solutions are then used to investigate whether a single, global price for CO2 is attainable. Our results suggest that global CO2 emissions could stabilize without stressing global incomes, with a global CO2 market achieving equilibrium. With a CO2 market, countries would then have the incentive to consider adopting, improving, or investing in additional abatement technologies to move beyond current capabilities, while continuing to increase standards of living.

Nonetheless it tends to facilitate a resource relocation that if well governed could be beneficial to those countries where the poor are mainly involved in rural activities.
F64|A Review of the Circular Economy and its Implementation|Circular economy (CE) is a sustainable development strategy that is being proposed to tackle urgent problems of environmental degradation and resource scarcity. CE's 3R principles are to reduce, reuse and recycle materials. The principles account for a circular system where all materials are recycled, all energy is derived from renewables; activities support and rebuild the ecosystem and support human health and a healthy society and resources are used to generate value. This study is a review of the rapidly growing literature on CE covering its concept and current practices and assessing its implementation. The review also serves as an assessment of the design, implementation and effectiveness of CE related policies. It first presents the concept of CE and compares it with the current linear economy of taking materials, producing goods and disposing waste. It explains why it is imperative to move away from a linear economy towards regenerative sustainable industrial development with a closed loop. The paper then introduces current practices that have been introduced and discusses standards for the assessment of CE's development and performance. The main focus here is on providing a summary of the data analysis of key CE indicators to give a picture of CE practices. Third, based on an analysis of literature, the paper identifies the underlying problems and challenges to CE in an entrepreneurial perspective. Finally, the review provides a conclusion on CE's current development and gives policy suggestions for its future development as part of an entrepreneurial and innovative national level development strategy.
F64|Transplanting clean-tech paths from elsewhere: The emergence of the Chinese solar PV industry|New clean-tech industries emerge in increasingly complex spatial patterns that challenge existing explanations on industrial path creation. In particular, the case of latecomer regions quickly building up industries in fields that are unrelated to their previous industrial capabilities is not well understood in the literature. This paper aims to address this gap with an analytical framework that draws on technological innovation system and catching-up literatures to specify the place-specific and extra-regional system resources that firms in latecomer regions draw on in the industry formation process. An in-depth case study of the Chinese solar photovoltaics (PV) sector reveals an industry formation process that differs from existing models. Rather than depending on linkages with multinational companies, extensive policy support, or gradual recombination of pre-existing domestic capabilities, early industry formation in the Chinese solar PV sector emerged from path transplantation in a highly internationalized entrepreneurial project. Pioneering actors mobilized knowledge, markets, investment and technology legitimacy developing outside China and re-combined them with the country’s generic capabilities in export-oriented mass manufacturing. This implies that in some industries, globalization may enable a new model of industrial path creation based on bridging domestic resource gaps by directly mobilizing system resources emerging in the international networks of a global innovation system.
F64|The environment dimension of food supply chain analysis|The paper reviews relevant literature studying the environmental impacts of food supply chain from production to each stage throughout the supply chain. With limited data and information, to better understand these impacts, a concrete example of the tea supply chain in China is provided. The tea supply chain is analyzed from the environmental prospective, with potential pollutants being identified at each stage of the supply chain. As an example of the food supply chain in a developing country, some unique features of the developing economies are taken into consideration when concluding the implications.
F64|How does firm heterogeneity information impact the estimation of embodied carbon emissions in Chinese exports?|Using an augmented Chinese input–output table in which information about firm ownership and type of traded goods are explicitly reported, we show that ignoring firm heterogeneity causes embodied CO2 emissions in Chinese exports to be overestimated by 20% at the national level, with huge differences at the sector level, for 2007. This is because different types of firm that are allocated to the same sector of the conventional Chinese input–output table vary greatly in terms of market share, production technology and carbon intensity. This overestimation of export-related carbon emissions would be even higher if it were not for the fact that 80% of CO2 emissions embodied in exports of foreign-owned firms are, in fact, emitted by Chinese-owned firms upstream of the supply chain. The main reason is that the largest CO2 emitter, the electricity sector located upstream in Chinese domestic supply chains, is strongly dominated by Chinese-owned firms with very high carbon intensity.
F64|Consumption-based accounting of U.S. CO2 emissions from 1990 to 2010|To tackle global climate change, it is desirable to reduce CO2 emissions associated with household consumption in particular in developed countries, which tend to have much higher per capita household carbon footprints than less developed countries. Our results show that carbon intensity of different consumption categories in the U.S. varies significantly. The carbon footprint tends to increase with increasing income but at a decreasing rate due to additional income being spent on less carbon intensive consumption items. This general tendency is frequently compensated by higher frequency of international trips and higher housing related carbon emissions (larger houses and more space for consumption items). Our results also show that more than 30% of CO2 emissions associated with household consumption in the U.S. occur outside of the U.S. Given these facts, the design of carbon mitigation policies should take changing household consumption patterns and international trade into account.
F64|Urban Agriculture: Fostering the Urban-Rural Continuum|Urban agricultural projects have been mushrooming since the end of the twentieth century, reshaping urban landscapes and even the whole urban fabric, experimenting with alternatives to the traditional urban life, sometimes creating new commons, and bringing people together. Within a city, farmers, gardeners, and their neighbors share more than just fence lines. Cities already have a huge potential for farming. Three examples can be observed in very different cities around the World: Singapore, is fully self-reliant in meat, Bamako is self-sufficient in vegetables, and in Berlin there are 80,000 community gardens on communal land and 16,000 more people are on a waiting-list [1]. And this is just the beginning; in many cities new unbuilt areas emerge in the wake of deindustrialization (derelict lands, wastelands, brownfields, etc.), or as a consequence of urban shrinking due to aging populations (as in Japan or Germany), or of emigration (as in some African mid-sized cities). These new areas are a wonderful opportunity for urban agriculture. In Detroit, thousands hectares of urban land have been given over to unemployed workers for food growing. In Britain, urban agriculture has been promoted on wastelands of 20 cities by their various councils [2]. Urban agriculture is gradually becoming a planning policy option. In Delft, the planners of the city already combine urban agriculture with several other land uses in their planning documents; in Paris, an inclusive local land development plan protects agricultural landscapes [3,4]. Urban agriculture is neitherâ€”or no moreâ€”the short-lived remnant of a rural culture nor the hipsters' latest futile craze.
F64|Urban Agriculture, Commons and Urban Policies: Scaling up Local Innovation|May urban agriculture be the cornerstone that helps reconfigure more sustainable cities and if so, under which conditions? And if so, what type of urban agriculture? Such are the two issues underlying this article. Why not counteracting urban sprawl by fostering what could be called â€œrural sprawlâ€ , by introducing nature and rural characteristics such as farming within the city, in its interstitial areas and wastelands? In this perspective, urban agriculture becomes a common good, bringing people together and reshaping the whole urban fabric that would eventually propose a radical remaking of the urban. Urban agriculture lends particularly well to long-lasting urban policies, especially those turning environmental â€œbadsâ€ â€”such as brownfields and wastelandsâ€”into environmental â€œgoodsâ€ and urban amenities. Urban agriculture in interstitial abandoned urban areas may be one of citiesâ€™ main seedbeds of creative innovation. It is all about the right to decide and the power to create, renewing and deepening what Henri Lefebvre called The Right to the City.
F64|Action Research: An Essential Approach for Constructing the Development of Sustainable Urban Agricultural Systems|How can research contribute more directly to promoting and leading to sustainable solutions and projects? This article suggests that one of the most important research approaches capable of achieving this is the Action Research approach. This involves the researcher taking on a number of roles when working with other actors (e.g. citizens, farmers, local elected officials, citizen associations, government representatives. . . with the specific set of actors depending upon the nature of the subject being investigated and for which solutions are sought). The roles that the researcher can play involve providing appropriate information to the other actors, providing counseling to them, organizing and animating meetings with the actors, and accompanying the whole process involving all the actors. These roles are essentially played out by the researcher when the other actors request the researcher to assume whichever roles they consider to be significant. The fundamental notion is that through this process the actors appropriate the sustainable solutions as their own, and the researcher helps them achieve this. This article is based on: a) a synthesis of pertinent research using the Action Research approach (specifically in relation to sustainable agricultural systems in periurban territories), and b) specific research undertaken by the two co-authors of the article, all in the context of periurban agricultural systems during the last 8 years, as well as on some of their publications. The necessary characteristics of Action Research and the researchers involved are identified, namely: a) patience; b) an emphasis on process; and c) an emphasis on participation on the part of multiple actors.
F64|Cultivating the Glocal Garden|This paper addresses the question under which conditions small-scale urban agriculture (UA) initiatives can accelerate a sustainability transition of the global food system. It develops the notion of a glocal garden, a large number of likeminded local initiatives with a global impact and forms of worldwide collaboration. Taking a transition perspective, the glocal garden, producing vegetables and fruits, is a niche that has to overcome barriers to compete with the dominant food regime. Since a sustainability transition restructures (policy) sectors, institutional domains including knowledge systems, the paper explores which innovations are needed for the glocal garden to succeed. It discusses the glocal garden as an environmental, a social, an economic and a global project. As an environmental project, the glocal garden will link sustainable production of food with renewable energy production. As a social project, it will be organized into a consumersâ€™ cooperative. As an economic project, it will strive for profit, increasing the yield in a sustainable manner. As a global project, it will enhance collaboration between local cooperatives in the North and the South, as well as with rural agriculture. Under these conditions, the glocal garden can develop into a power, able to resist a possible future food regime that splits societies, in terms of quality standards and food products, into haves and have-nots.
F64|Building Urban Agricultural Commons: A Utopia or a Reality?|There are several categories of urban agriculture which need to be distinguished if we want to efficiently feed urban inhabitants with local agricultural produce while benefiting from other functions filled by urban agricultural landscapes: namely, eco-systemic functions or ecological and social functions. The second function will focus on methods to regulate unbuilt land in urban areas which have virtually no regulations and others which have strict controls preventing construction. The last will consist of possibilities to build, what I would refer to as, urban agricultural commons: in other words, tangible and intangible resources produced with farmers and gardeners for the inhabitants; for their local consumption and for the quality of the living environment, based on a political principle for common action. The concept of common is derived from the works of socioeconomist E. Ostrom (1990; [1]) and French philosophers P. Dardot et C. Laval (2014; [2]): â€œWhat is built in commonâ€ . It was applied to urban agriculture and landscape (Donadieu, 2012, 2014; [3,4]). The concept of urban agriculture has been used worldwide in the last twenty years by researchers, especially in France by A. Fleury (2005; [5]) and P. Donadieu(1998; [6]), in Mediterranean regions (Nasr and Padilla, 2004; [7]), in Asia, Africa and North and South Americaâ€”all through the publications of the Resource Centres Urban Agriculture & Food Security (RUAF; [8]).
F64|Siting Urban Agriculture as a Green Infrastructure Strategy for Land Use Planning in Austin, TX|Green infrastructure refers to a type of land use design that mimics the natural water cycle by using the infiltration capacities of vegetation, soils, and other natural processes to mitigate stormwater runoff. As a multifunctional landscape, urban agriculture should be seen as a highly beneficial tool for urban planning not only because of its ability to function as a green stormwater management strategy, but also due to the multiple social and environmental benefits it provides. In 2012, the city of Austin adopted a major planning approach titled the â€œImagine Austin Comprehensive Planâ€ (IACP) outlining the cityâ€™s vision for future growth and land use up to 2039. The plan explicitly addresses the adoption of green infrastructure as a target for future land use with urban agriculture as a central component. Addressing this area of land use planning will require tools that can locate suitable areas within the city ideal for the development of green infrastructure. In this study, a process was developed to create a spatially explicit method of siting urban agriculture as a green infrastructure tool in hydrologically sensitive areas, or areas prone to runoff, in east Austin. The method uses geospatial software to spatially analyze open access datasets that include land use, a digital elevation model, and prime farmland soils. Through this method a spatial relationship can be made between areas of high surface runoff and where the priority placement of urban farms should be sited as a useful component of green infrastructure. Planners or geospatial analysts could use such information, along with other significant factors and community input, to aid decision makers in the placement of urban agriculture. This spatially explicit approach for siting potential urban farms, will support the integration of urban agriculture as part of the land use planning of Austin.
F64|Agricultural Land and the New Urban Paradigm: Coexistence, Integration, or Conflict?|"The relation between ""urban"" and ""rural"" has changed and developed over the last few decades. The present contribution focuses on how the relationship between these two entities has developed, highlighting how it corresponds to a growing complexity and interdependence among the two. Awareness has increased that to the extent that proper management of these interdependences can contribute to solve problems, increase economic performance and also make a contribution to a higher quality of life in and around urban areas. In this framework, green infrastructures and agriculture practices in urban areas are discussed. The contribution concludes by suggesting strategies and actions for the proper implementation of green infrastructures and urban agriculture practices at regional and local scales."
F64|Identifying the â€œUsual Suspectsâ€ â€”Assessing Patterns of Representation in Local Environmental Initiatives|An increasing body of literature explores the role of transnational municipal networks (TMNs) in governing sustainable development. As associations, one key task of TMNs is to represent their members through production and dissemination of information and knowledge concerning municipal action for sustainable development. Case studies, often emphasising best practice, are used by many TMNs to fulfil this task. Nevertheless, despite strong scrutiny concerning the use of case studies in â€œpolicy mobilitiesâ€ research, there have been limited attempts to quantify the ways in which TMNs present and disseminate case studies and, by doing so, generate trends of presence and absence in literature on sustainable development. Assessing patterns of representation for continents, countries, municipalities and themes across nine international case study collections published by ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability since 1991, this study responds to this research gap and identifies the presence of â€œusual suspectsâ€ in the ICLEI case study collections, along with notable absentees. By doing so, the study contributes to policy mobilities research and literature on TMNs, by encouraging reflection and further research concerning the representation patterns influencing which municipalities and what topics are presented in discourses on sustainable development.
F64|A Review of 'Energy and Transport in Green Transition: Perspectives on Ecomodernity'|"The book â€œEnergy and Transport in Green Transitions â€“ Perspectives on Ecomodernityâ€ deals with the societally and scientifically crucial topic of energy and climate change mitigation. The book starts by setting high ambitions as the authors attempt â€œto go beyond both the extremism of the anti-capitalist critique and the radical enthusiasm of techno-economic positivismâ€ in their exploration to find ways to resolve political, economic and technological entanglements â€œto boost a greener economy and cultureâ€ . It aims to so through a regional comparative study that looks at mature Western economies, the rapidly developing China, and the developing economies in sub-Saharan Africa. The authors present an excellent descriptive historical review for those interested in the broader picture of energy production and automobile sector in the regions addressed. However, in an attempt to cover as much ground as possible while assuring ""maximum accessibilityâ€ , the authors' explanation of the dynamics of change involved is not conveyed in an analytically convincing manner."
F64|Editorial Volume 12|Dear Reader, As I write this first official reports confirm the existence of gravitational waves which Albert Einstein predicted a century ago. Ground breaking scientific discoveries such as this reaffirm to me the spatial relationships between the universe and human security issues, placing those issues into a new perspective that contrast with perspectives formed by our everyday lives. Nevertheless, for the majority of humanity, human security in its diverse manifestations remains the most significant consideration in their lives whereas the nature of gravity is hardly given a thought until such time when some clever technologist uses such a new insight and ends up revolutionising our lives.
F64|Human Security: Chinaâ€™s Discourses and Experience|This article addresses three research questions by elaborating on how the idea of human security is understood or defined by the government and social actors in China; how the distinction between the â€œprotectionâ€ aspect and â€œempowermentâ€ aspect of human security is understood and accepted; and what particular downside risks are perceived as pressing human security issues in China. Amongst these the major ones include air pollution, food security, and cyber security. The study reveals that, whilst as a term â€œhuman securityâ€ is not frequently used, there have been significant discussions leading to the consideration and implementation of various human security practices in China. The idea of human security has been firmly established and threats to human security detected. For both the government and academic community in China, human security and state security are not necessarily confrontational but can rather be combined, often complimenting each other. Recent developments in China are pointing to a positive direction in terms of human security in the country.

F64|A Review of 'Law's Impunity: Responsibility and the Modern Private Military Company'|The mercenaries and mercenarism are two points of concern for scholars studying the rules of war throughout history. Both in jus ad bellum (JAB) and jus in bellum (JIB) we can find a framework of international law crafted to impede the participation of individuals motivated to take part in hostilities to get private gain. Nevertheless, paradoxically, the problem is when corporations are supported by domestic law to perform serviced in ground combats abroad. In the latter case, Human Rights Law (HRL), International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and International Criminal Law (ICL) present numerous gaps that make it difficult to incriminate corporations, which perpetuate the impunity among private organizations involved in human rights violations in conflict zones.
F64|A Piece of Land or Peace on the Land: How Much Is a Peasant's Life Worth in Brazil?|Land inequality in Brazil is alarming and several poor individuals living in rural areas do not have enough income to survive decently. The struggle to access land should lead to a paradigm shift with social movements leading this process since democratization. Their strategies vary, but usually focus on complementary activities of mass mobilization that culminate in the occupation of unproductive land that is not fulfilling its social function in order to force expropriation and the creation of new settlements. This study aims to investigate, through empirical evidence, if such strategies are having the desired effect of allowing the poor to access land, without increasing the already high numbers, and potentially aggravating the violent characteristics, of such disputes. During the Cardoso and Lula presidential administrations the relation between the number of new settlements and the number of deaths caused by land disputes increased. However, there is still a long way to go to improve this policy and achieve positive results. Overall, is this struggle for the reduction of inequality in the Brazilian countryside being won? Is the sacrifice paying off? And what is the price regarding the relation between land conflict victims and the creation of new rural settlements?
F64|Pacification & Mega-events in Rio de Janeiro: Urbanization, Public Security & Accumulation by Dispossession|This paper outlines how Brazil's latest public security initiative-its highly controversial Police Pacification Campaign (UPP)-is an integral component of a neoliberal political framework that is enacting rapid urbanization projects in and around strategically located favelas (informal settlements or slums) of Rio de Janeiro. Specifically, it evaluates what kinds of economic development initiatives are moving forward, how they are facilitated by the UPP, how they connect to the city's mega-events, and who is profiting from them. The article also examines how the pacification has affected residents in three favelas over a seven-year period from the inauguration of the UPP in 2008 through to mid-2015.
F64|On Unstable Ground: Issues Involved in Greening Space in the Rocinha Favela of Rio De Janeiro|This paper is based on fieldwork undertaken in conjunction with Green My Favela, a land use restoration project that works with informal and vulnerable income sector residents to reclaim chronically degraded public areas by creating gardens inside the urban favelas of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The paper reveals how government intervention policies employed in the lead up to the 2016 Olympics are destabilizing the fragile social fabric of the cityâ€™s largest favela, Rocinha, through military occupation and urbanization activities that threaten an already low and unstable human security threshold.

This paper takes an intimate look at what is likely the last days of this contentious pacification policy, the part it plays in the wider â€˜Games Security Planâ€™, and how and why it has been implemented in the lead up to the 2016 Summer Olympics.
F64|Review of On-Scene Management of Mass-Casualty Attacks|Background : The scene of a mass-casualty attack (MCA) entails a crime scene, a hazardous space, and a great number of people needing medical assistance. Public transportation has been the target of such attacks and involves a high probability of generating mass casualties. The review aimed to investigate challenges for on-scene responses to MCAs and suggestions made to counter these challenges, with special attention given to attacks on public transportation and associated terminals. Methods : Articles were found through PubMed and Scopus, â€œrelevant articlesâ€ as defined by the databases, and a manual search of references. Inclusion criteria were that the article referred to attack(s) and/or a public transportation-related incident and issues concerning formal on-scene response. An appraisal of the articlesâ€™ scientific quality was conducted based on an evidence hierarchy model developed for the study. Results : One hundred and five articles were reviewed. Challenges for command and coordination on scene included establishing leadership, inter-agency collaboration, multiple incident sites, and logistics. Safety issues entailed knowledge and use of personal protective equipment, risk awareness and expectations, cordons, dynamic risk assessment, defensive versus offensive approaches, and joining forces. Communication concerns were equipment shortfalls, dialoguing, and providing information. Assessment problems were scene layout and interpreting environmental indicators as well as understanding setting-driven needs for specialist skills and resources. Triage and treatment difficulties included differing triage systems, directing casualties, uncommon injuries, field hospitals, level of care, providing psychological and pediatric care. Transportation hardships included scene access, distance to hospitals, and distribution of casualties. Conclusion : Commonly encountered challenges during unintentional incidents were added to during MCAs, implying specific issues for safety, assessment, triage, and treatment, which require training. Effectively increasing readiness for MCAs likely entail struggles to overcome fragmentation between the emergency services and the broader crisis management system as well as enabling critical and prestige-less, context-based assessments of needed preparatory efforts.
F64|Trade and the Environment: New Methods, Measurements, and Results|We review recent research linking international trade to the environment, with a focus on new results and methods. The review is given structure by a novel decomposition linking changes in emissions to changes in productive activity at the plant, firm, industry, and national levels. Although some new results have emerged from the application of a Melitz-style approach to trade and the environment, the full potential of this approach has not yet been realized. We discuss existing empirical and theoretical work, introduce three new hypotheses, and suggest paths for future researchers to follow.

F64|Productivity Gap and Vertical Spillover: Evidence from Vietnam|Technology spillover induced by foreign direct investment has been proved to be an important channel to boost the productivity growth of local firms in the host country, especially in the context of developing economies. However, the empirical evidence remains inconsistent as to what extent the scale of spillover is affected by the productivity gap between foreign investors and local firms. This paper attempts to make clear such mechanism by applying Vietnamese firm-level data. Focusing on Asian investors, we show that the relationship between the productivity gap and vertical spillover takes an inverted-U shape. To be specific, we use stepwise chow test to decide on the cutoff value of total factor productivity (TFP) as the grouping criteria, and divide investors into low, middle and high-TFP groups. The results reveal that local suppliers in Vietnam can benefit the most from the Asian investors with middle-level TFP, whereas the benefits from the other two groups fade away. The finding is strongly robust even after we control the other spillover-influential factors such as firms' own effort to innovate, foreign firms' ownership, country and industry heterogeneity, and no matter whether we use stochastic frontier or Levinsohn & Petrin measurement of TFP. It thus provides novel evidence that investors with advanced technology do not necessarily diffuse their know-how to local partners. This implies it is important that both Vietnamese local firms and investors with superior technology work in the same direction to stimulate more corporations with each other.
F64|"Does ISO14001 raise firms f awareness of environmental protection? |Case from Vietnam"|Environmental protection is an inevitable issue that developing countries all have to deal with during the process of inviting foreign direct investment (FDI). However, high correlation between FDI and pollution doesn ft necessarily indicate that foreign firms are to blame. In this paper, we apply firm-level panel data in Vietnam and unique information on waste discharge to show that foreign firms are actually more active to acquire ISO14001, a voluntary environmental standard. And the adoption will in turn improve firms f performance in waste control. It also increases firms f welfare as well as their productivity level. This paper provides strong evidence that firms f efforts towards corporate social responsibility will eventually benefit themselves as well.
F64|E-waste management as a global Challenge (introductory chapter)|Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment management (E-waste or WEEE) is a crucial issue in the solid waste management sector with global interconnections between well-developed, transitional and developing countries. Consumption society and addiction to technology dictate the daily life in high and middle-income countries where population consumes large amounts of EEE products (electrical and electronic equipment) which sooner become e-waste. This fraction is a fast-growing waste stream which needs special treatment and management due to the toxic potential of public health and environment. On the other hand, the e-waste contains valuable materials which may be recovered (precious metals, Cu) reused and recycled (metals, plastics) by various industries mitigating the consumption of natural resources.
F64|Does Globalization Impede Environmental Quality in Bangladesh? The Role of Real Economic Activities and Energy Use|This research investigates the relationship between globalization, environment degradation, industrial production, energy consumption and economic growth over the period of 1972-2015 for Bangladesh. The long run relationship between variables is examined using ARDL bound test and combined cointegration approach. These cointegration approaches predict the long run relationship between underlying variables. The empirical findings demonstrate that globalization, industrial production and energy consumption drives environmental degradation positively, but economic growth pushes environmental degradation negatively in the long run as well as short run. Further, the direction of causality is examined by VECM Granger causality which shows bidirectional causality between energy consumption and environment degradation, economic growth and environment degradation, industrial production and economic growth, and energy consumption and economic growth for both short-long run. Our results suggest a unidirectional causality runs from environmental degradation and energy consumption to industrial production. The empirics of Innovative Accounting Approach (IAA) confirm the findings of VECM Granger causality. Our findings suggest that Policymakers may focus on imports of advance technology and export led growth strategy to control environmental pollution.
F64|A Circular Economy Approach for Sustainable Economic Growth|This paper focuses on the circular economy model for sustainable development in the frame work of endogenous economic growth structure.

Recycling economic activities also contributes in the economic growth without degrading environment.
F64|Small Business Management In Relationships Of Micro And Macro Environment|Building the economy of a country and its competitive strength on international markets constitutes the determinant of the economic power of globalization. Countries, wishing to take an active part in creating this power must exert impact on their economy in terms of innovation, entrepreneurship and flexibility of management of their business. However, building the economy of the country begins from the bottom, therefore, from the local ? regional industry. In Poland, this industry consists in the enterprises of the SME sector, where there predominate small companies that do not have the financial potential e.g. for the development being the result of using modern technologies. The State (the policy run by the authorities) and aid programs of the European Union have a significant share in the development of such companies. However, the progress in business greatly depends on the enterprise itself and, particularly, the strategy selected as the leading one. The paper is an attempt to select factors both from the micro and macro environment. Degree of dependence and impact of these factors on each other/ the company represents valuable information for those managing small businesses. It may constitute the first step towards the decision in what direction the enterprise will develop or if it will be able to satisfy the requirements set e.g. by the external environment.
F64|Capitalism, Economic Political and slow and fast variables|In this paper we analyze the problem of the intensity and the diffusion times in the macroeconomic system of the measures of political economic by the Government, focusing on those indirect. We try to show how these effects and diffusion speedy depend crucially on the behaviour of economic agents which often act independently of each other looking for maximum personal gain. The conflicting nature of the capitalistic economic system does not allow us to make specific predictions about the effectiveness of such measures, as the Government has little capacity to control over the actions of private agents. So, nothing can be said before if the objectives that the Government is pursuing will be achieved. A typical example, is the use of instruments controlling the levels of environmental pollution, against which we nourish a latent skepticism. To show our caution, we use the concept of complex system composed of sub-systems connected to each other through relationship of a non-linear mathematical form which is often unknown. We also use the concept of synergetic and the principle of slow and fast variables (slaving principle). In particular, we also show that, when the evolution of a sub-system is logistical, it can give rise to the chaotic dynamics that may extend to other sub-systems and to the overall system. Our arguments are based also by the use of some models expressed, in most case, in the form of differential equations.
F64|Modello Baumol–Oates in tempo discreto e tempo continuo: analisi deterministica e stocastica|In questo paper andiamo ad analizzare un modello utilizzato da Baumol-Oates per mettere in relazione l’evoluzione dinamica dello stock di inquinante in rapporto al livello della carbon-tax. Del modello, inizialmente in tempo discreto, forniamo la soluzione ed alcune derivate di statica comparata della soluzione stessa. Il modello viene poi da noi posto in forma continua con una struttura leggermente diversa dall’originale e ampliato a due equazioni differenziali. Il modello ha struttura non lineare per cui si pone l’esigenza di linearizzarlo per analizzarne la dinamica almeno nell’intorno dei punti di equilibrio. L’analisi degli autovalori conferma la stabilità dei punti di equilibrio come il modello in forma discreta. Tuttavia, tale stabilità può essere accertata solo localmente. L’ulteriore estensione del modello a quattro equazioni non lineari comporta che i punti di equilibrio sono ora instabili per lo meno nell’intorno dei punti di equilibrio stessi. Successivamente, viene data una versione stocastica del modello, posta in forma strutturalmente diversa, anche se resta la filosofia di fondo del modello che pone in relazione inversa lo stock di inquinante con il livello del saggio di carbon-tax. Come è noto, tuttavia, nella soluzione di equazioni differenziali stocastiche, compare un processo di Wiener che è sconosciuto e la soluzione stessa non è derivabile. Conclude il paper una nota sulla efficacia del processo di linearizzazione di sistemi non lineari nel predirre la dinamica globale del sistema non-lineare stesso.
F64|Investigating the carbon leakage effect on the environmental Kuznets curve using luminosity data|This paper studies the effect of carbon leakage on the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) using satellite nighttime light data. I show that nighttime lighting is an important variable for estimating carbon dioxide emissions that is superior to other existing indicators and covers all countries in the world. I find evidence of an inverted-U shaped relationship between light and, thus, greenhouse gas emissions and income, with a turning point at approximately US $50,000. However, the relationship is primarily driven by changes in the structure of international trade, implying strong carbon leakage effects. Consequently, environmental regulations that become operative in only one part of the world may fail without global coordination.

F64|The Welfare Effects of Opening to Foreign Direct Investment in Polluting Sectors| This article shows how policies to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) in a polluting sector affect home-country welfare relative to the autarky case. We consider a welfare maximizing country who attracts FDI into a polluting sector, while accounting for environmental quality changes. The government sets the level of environmental regulation and public infrastructure. Foreign investors prefer good infrastructure quality and less environmental regulation. We show that under autarky, environmental regulations are increasing over infrastructure. However, with FDI, optimal environmental regulations may be a subsidy if the benefits from a wage increase outweigh the damages from pollution. Also, we find that if a country has very poor levels of infrastructure it is better off not allowing FDI to enter but as infrastructure quality increases, the result is reversed where welfare with FDI is higher than under autarky.
F64|Climate policy decisions under uncertainty|"The economics of global climate mitigation is discussed when there is imperfect knowledge of future climatic changes, of policy effectiveness and of the policy responses by different countries. Uncertainty is accounted for by using heuristics derived from classical decision rules. These heuristics provide plausible policy rules that depend on only limited information. They emphasize the possibility of “getting it wrong” in terms of the appropriate scale of policy response and from policy failure itself. The minimax rule or Precautionary Principle, which targets “worst case” situations, is not useful unless policies are effective with certainty. However the widespread presumption that policy action is warranted if climate-induced losses without action are “large"" relative to costs of policy can be justified using minimax regret reasoning. The global analysis is extended to individual national decision-making when nations jointly play a game against nature with policy spillovers. Simultaneous moves game solutions as well as heuristics are provided and indicate how policy actions are best determined for individual countries rather than for a global authority."
F64|Changing patterns of global agri-food trade and virtual water flows| International agri-food trade has expanded rapidly during the past decades and changed considerably in structure with important implications especially for developing economies. One of the main environmental concerns regarding international trade is about the exploitation and redistribution of water resources. In this paper we use the virtual water approach for analyzing the relation between global agri-food trade, its structure and virtual water flows in the period of 1986 to 2011. Specifically, for five world regions we calculate growth rates of interregional trade values and virtual water volumes, the contribution of different product groups to trade and the economic water efficiency of imports and exports. Our findings show that over time trade values have generally increased more rapidly than virtual water volumes. In Africa and South America virtual water exports have roughly quadrupled since 1986. In all regions staples and industrial products account for the largest share in virtual water trade. The recent shift towards high-value exports is beneficial for developing countries from a regional water efficiency perspective due to high trade values and low associated virtual water volumes. Water efficiency of trade has increased in all regions since 2000 and export water efficiency is especially high in Europe.
F64|The Economics of the International Trade of Waste|International trade in hazardous and nonhazardous waste and scrap products has been growing at an exceptional rate the past two decades. This review presents current data on the magnitude and trends regarding this growth and discusses the recent literature as it pertains to the economic incentives and drivers of international waste trade. Differences in environmental policy, taxes, disposal fees, and transport costs are important determinants across countries. However, the illegal nature of many types of hazardous waste also means that organized crime may play a role in some countries. Gaps in our understanding regarding microeconomic incentives as they relate to upstream and downstream recyclers and to the social welfare implications for wages, environmental quality, and human health are also discussed.
F64|Why is Pollution from U.S. Manufacturing Declining? The Roles of Trade, Regulation, Productivity, and Preferences|Between 1990 and 2008, emissions of the most common air pollutants from U.S. manufacturing fell by 60 percent, even as real U.S. manufacturing output grew substantially. This paper develops a quantitative model to explain how changes in trade, environmental regulation, productivity, and consumer preferences have contributed to these reductions in pollution emissions. We estimate the model's key parameters using administrative data on plant-level production and pollution decisions. We then combine these estimates with detailed historical data to provide a model-driven decomposition of the causes of the observed pollution changes. Finally, we compare the model-driven decomposition to a statistical decomposition. The model and data suggest three findings. First, the fall in pollution emissions is due to decreasing pollution per unit output within narrowly defined products, rather than to changes in the types of products produced or changes to the total quantity of manufacturing output. Second, the implicit pollution tax that rationalizes firm production and abatement behavior more than doubled between 1990 and 2008. Third, environmental regulation explains 75 percent or more of the observed reduction in pollution emissions from manufacturing.
F64|Why Is Pollution from US Manufacturing Declining? The Roles of Environmental Regulation, Productivity, and Trade|Between 1990 and 2008, air pollution emissions from U.S. manufacturing fell by 60 percent despite a substantial increase in manufacturing output. We show that these emissions reductions are primarily driven by within-product changes in emissions intensity rather than changes in output or in the composition of products produced. We then develop and estimate a quantitative model linking trade with the environment to better understand the economic forces driving these changes. Our estimates suggest that the implicit pollution tax that manufacturers face doubled between 1990 and 2008. These changes in environmental regulation, rather than changes in productivity and trade, account for most of the emissions reductions.
F64|Do stringent environmental policies deter FDI? M&A versus Greenfi eld|This study examines how environmental stringency affects the location decision of foreign direct investments. We analyze a fi rm-level data set on German outbound FDI and innovate on previous studies by controlling for the mode of entry and applying a mixed-logit analysis. The results show that Greenfi eld projects react to environmental regulation in a strongly different way than M&As. We fi nd robust support for pollution haven hypothesis for polluting Green fields. M&A investments in low polluting industries, on the other hand, seem to be attracted by stricter environmental regulation. We introduce a novel instrumental variable for environmental stringency and apply it to verify the results.

The Philippines is also interested in extensions of such policies, including the use of carbon taxes, measures to enhance energy efficiency, and changes to the country’s electricity generation mix.

F64|Variable selection in the analysis of energy consumption–growth nexus|There is abundant empirical literature that focuses on whether energy consumption is a critical driver of economic growth. The evolution of this literature has largely consisted of attempts to solve the problems and answer the criticisms arising from earlier studies. One of the most common criticisms is that previous work concentrates on the bivariate relationship, energy consumption–economic growth. Many authors try to overcome this critique using control variables. However, the choice of these variables has been ad hoc, made according to the subjective economic rationale of the authors. Our contribution to this literature is to apply a robust probabilistic model to select the explanatory variables from a large set of potential candidates in the case of the US from 1949 to 2010, not only for an aggregate analysis but also for a sector analysis. The results highlight the critical role of public spending and energy intensity in the explanation of growth. Furthermore, since the study reveals different explanatory variables for each sector, it indicates the importance of policy decisions specifically aimed at different sectors.

F64|Accessibility of waste collection services in Romania: a multi-scale analysis in EU context using thematic cartography|Low coverage of urban and rural population to waste collection services leads to various environmental threats caused by uncontrolled waste disposal. New EU regulations on waste management issues transposed into national laws have improved this sector, but, the population access to such services is still low compared to others new EU members. A multi-scale approach of this indicator is a necessary tool for a proper analysis of this environmental issue. The maps reveal that Romanian development regions (NUTS 2) have the lowest coverage rates at EU level in 2010. Furthermore, major disparities are reflected between Romanian counties in 2010. Thematic maps outline a comparative analysis at national and regional scale (Romanian counties & cities and communes of North-East Region) between urban vs rural areas in 2010. These geographical approaches are necessary for a better monitoring process of waste management sector.

F64|Emissions Trading with Offset Markets and Free Quota Allocations|We study optimal climate policy for a “policy bloc” of countries facing a market where emissions offsets can be purchased from a non-policy “fringe” of countries (such as with the CDM). Policy-bloc firms benefit from free quota allocations, which are updated according to either firms’ past emissions, or outputs. We show that the resulting abatement and its allocation between policy bloc and fringe are both inefficient. When all quotas are traded freely at a single price, the policy bloc chooses to either not constrain the offset market, leading to suboptimal policy-bloc mitigation; or ban offsets completely. The former (latter) case occurs when free allocation of quotas is not (very) generous, and the offset market is large (small). It is preferable for policy-bloc countries’ governments to instead buy offsets directly from the fringe at a quota price below marginal damage cost of emissions, while the policy-bloc quota price will be above this cost. With maximization of global welfare and a unified quota price, this price is higher, and offsets constrained in fewer cases, but the solution still inefficient. Full efficiency then requires a higher quota price in the policy bloc than in the fringe. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015
F64|The Environmental Impact of the FDI Inflow in the Transport Sector of OECD Countries and Policy Implications|This work investigates the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) inflowing in the transport sector and its connected activities of storage and communication of 30 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission from sectoral fuel combustion. To this purpose, an unbalanced dataset containing statistical information, all derived from different databases of various international organizations, for the 25 years between 1981 and 2005 is analysed through the use of the econometric technique of panel data. Apart from other evidence, the empirical result shows the existence of a negative relationship, although quantitatively very low, characterizing the cumulative effect of the considered type of FDI on CO 2 . This helps us to understand that the foreign investment flow arriving in the transport sector of the considered OECD receiving countries does not generate a dangerous detriment to the environment as can generally be expected. As a result, we argue in favour of those policy prescriptions suggesting its enforcement. Copyright International Atlantic Economic Society 2015
F64|Sustainability of Fiscal Policy in Democracies and Autocracies|"This paper tries to identify the fiscal sustainability record of democratically and autocratically governed countries by applying various performance indicators (credit worthiness, payment defaults, national debt, foreign assets) and also to clarify what effect the characteristics of a regime have on consolidation efforts in a country. The study identifies two key findings. While in the past, democracies have clearly found it easier to preserve their credit standing and solvency and to avoid government bankruptcy, a similar advantage can no longer be detected for democracies in terms of reducing national debt and foreign debts. Why democracies, in spite of their arrangements with a sensitivity for the public good and for due process, are finding it so difficult to avoid shifting their debts to future generations, to undertake cutback measures and to provide sufficient financial foresight, can in principle be interpreted as the other side of the coin, namely highly presence-oriented interests boosted even further through the short ""democracy-specific time horizon""."
F64|Time for Decarbonization of Conservation and Development Projects? The Political Ecology of Carbon Projects|The globe's first carbon projects were designed and implemented approximately 20 years ago following scientific insights that emissions of greenhouse gases needed to be mitigated. Visible in some of these early projects were the important aspects of social governance and local benefit sharing. The projects promised to be a panacea to environmental, social and economic problems in remote rural areas of developing countries. However, it took another decade before a wave of hundreds of carbon projects were launched. Many of the projects were offered under the mechanism of REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation, plus the role of conservation, sustainable forest management and carbon enhancement), as well as under a variety of voluntary schemes and national programs, public-private partnerships, and forestry-based investment initiatives. As decision-makers prepare the Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climatic Change in Paris (COP21), Earthscan has released a book entitled `Carbon conflicts and forest landscapes in Africa', edited by Melissa Leach and Ian Scoones. According to the editors, the focus of the book is on what happens on the ground when carbon forestry projects arrive, what types of projects work, and, equally important, what doesnâ€™t work.
F64|"A Review of ""The Politics of Sustainability: Philosophical Perspectives"""|Concerns about sustainable development are not a recent phenomenon. Societal problem-solving efforts within this realm have focused on concrete problems such as the preservation of fisheries, forests and national reserves. 'The Politics of Sustainability' has been discussed extensively inÂ literature, particularly after the publication of the Brundtland Commission's 'Our Common Future' report in 1987 [1] emphasizing inter-generational responsibilities involving economic, environmental and social aspects. Among other areas, the authors of the report highlighted the challenge of global climate change resulting from, amongst other things, unsustainable patterns of consumption. 'The Politics of Sustainability: Philosophical Perspectives', edited by Dieter Birnhacher and May Thorseth, bringsÂ a new angle into the discussion of the politics of sustainable development: ethical considerations.
F64|Editorial for Journal of Human Security Volume 11|This editorial marks the beginning of the journal's eleventh year since its inception as the Australasian Journal of Human Security. As a sample from an exÂ­tremely tumultuous era in human history, this time span has consistently provided an abundance of human security issues for me to comment on. Yet, for the first time since that fateful day in September of 2001, I feel that the world has arrived at another historical turning point. I am referring to the attack on the Paris office of the satirical journal Charlie Hebdo on January 7 and the events immediately following it.
F64|Human Security Workers Deployed in Austere Environments: A Brief Guide to Self-Care, Sustainment, and Productivity|Since the early 1990s, the human security movement has sought to expand the concept of security beyond the traditional military defense of national borders to focus on the intra-state security needs of populations at the individual level. Specific initiatives frequently address problems of population health, ethnic conflict, religious extremism, human rights, environmental or natural disasters, and other critical issues. For expatriate human security workers in the field, the environment may present meaningful challenges to their wellbeing and productivity. This can be especially so for those who have relatively more experience in academic, business, or administrative settings, and less in the field. The authors' goal is to illuminate practices that have demonstrated their efficacy in enhancing wellness, sustainment, and productivity for human security and other humanitarian and development workers deployed to austere environments. The content represents a synoptic consensus of best general practices and guidance from a range of resources comprising United Nations agencies and activities, national and international non-governmental organizations (NGO's), private volunteer organÂ­izations (PVO's), national military services, and international business concerns.
F64|A Review of 'Humanitarian Intervention and Legitimacy Wars: Seeking Peace and Justice in the 21st Century'|In his book Humanitarian Intervention and Legitimacy Wars: Seeking Peace and Justice in the 21st Century , Richard Falk argues that, with the growing prevalence of soft power, historical lessons of asymmetric warfare and legitimacy wars must be taken into account. Falk rejects the realist notion that the state is the only rational actor, offering a more constructivist approach that focuses on the norms, culture and morality of the international community. He asserts that humanitarian intervention is on the decline, and legitimacy wars are increasing. Much of this legitimacy is based on international law and its relevance in the international community.
F64|Notes from the Field: The Humanitarian Crisis in Ukraine|Humanitarian crises are politically and socially charged, and as actors, donors and organizations move in to help, duplication of services can ensue. Despite the influx of humanitarian actors into the war zone of eastern Ukraine, more are still needed to address immediate threat to the health of more than 5 million at-risk people in the area. The humanitarian disaster in Ukraine requires fast support and stakeholder involvement to mitigate preventable death among at-risk populations. As the crisis unfolds and many more people are caught in the crossfire with no health security, WHO is leading the charge to organize healthcare and humanitarian action to relive human suffering and engender health security for all.
F64|Educational Pathways to Remote Employment in Isolated Communities|Those who live in isolated communities often lack reliable, skilled employment opportunities, which fundamentally undermines their human security. For individuals who wish to remain in their isolated communities for family, religious, philosophical or other reasons, their attachment to their communities creates a disincentive for higher education. This promotes low educational achievement, which in turn results in low socioeconomic status, lack of social mobility, and a generational cycle of poverty. The human misery that results from such a feedback loop is observed in isolated communities throughout North America, including aboriginal communities in Canada. Fortunately, maturation of information and communication technologies now offers individuals the potential to gain high-skilled employment while living in an isolated community, using both (i) virtual work/remote work and (ii) remote training and education. To examine that potential, this study: 1) categorizes high-skill careers that demand a higher education and are widely viable for remote work, 2) examines options for obtaining the required education remotely, and 3) performs an economic analysis of investing in remote education, quantifying the results in return on investment. The results show that the Internet has now opened up the possibility of both remote education and remote work. Though the investment in college education is significant, there are loans available and the return on investment is generally far higher than the interest rate on the loans. The results identified several particularly promising majors and dozens of high-income careers. The ability to both obtain an education and employment remotely offers the potential to lift many people living in isolated communities out of poverty, reduce inequality overall, and provide those living in isolated communities with viable means of employment security, which not only allows personal sustainability, but also the potential for personal growth.
F64|Redefining Human Security for Vulnerable Migrants in East Asia|This article proposes human security as an analytical framework to understand the current trends of irregular migration (both forced and unauthorised) in East Asia and revisits the seven pillars of human security defined in the 1994 Human Development Report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). It explains how the concepts of human security are parallel to those prescribed in international human rights conventions but different in terms of the attitude towards states. Human security does not directly challenge state authority and adds a sense of urgency and moral authority that requires extra-legal measures by the states. The author argues that human security is the securitisation of human rights and is a better framework and policy discourse than human rights to engage with state and non-state actors, especially in East Asia where political leaders are more receptive to the former idea. The study draws examples from stateless Rohingyas, undocumented sex workers in Thailand and Singapore, trafficked brides from Vietnam and Cambodia, and smuggled North Korean refugees in China to demonstrate the nexus between human security and irregular migration.
F64|Sustainable Health for All? The Tension Between Human Security and the Right to Health Care|In the current global environmental crisis medical aid and disaster relief is given by the UN and its branches, by governments and by NGOs, who regard it as their duty to address large-scale humanitarian catastrophes. The duty to give medical aid rests on traditional interpretations of health security and on the bioethical imperatives to relieve suffering and to save lives. However, those principles are not easily reconciled in the current situation of global environmental change and the threats it poses to human security. The global demand for health care has already outpaced resources in many regions, and those resources are likely to decline further. An ethic based on more comprehensive concepts of human security can lessen the contraÂ­dictions between ethical priorities because it takes into account environmental security. HowÂ­ever, that approach leads to clashes with common interpretations of human rights, including the so-called right to health care. The argument presented in this paper states that, under the imperative of ensuring the survival for humanity in acceptable and sustainable ways, the latest generation of human rights pertaining to health care and environmental quality have become ungrantable. While this does not render them negligible, it does necessitate a new approach to global development aid and health security, with severe consequences for individual autonomy.
F64|Productivity, Capital Intensity and ISO14001 Adoption \Theory and Evidence from Vietnam|The determinants of ISO14001 adoption have been considered to fall into two categories: the external pressure from environment-oriented stakeholders or customers; the internal need due to expected future bene ts. In this paper we take a step further to elaborate on the mechanism of firms' adoption by investigating the interrelationship among firms' productivity, capital intensity and the decision-making of the adoption. Applying a general equilibrium model, we show that under optimal condition, highly productive firms can benefit more from the adoption. In the meantime technology advancement potentially drives up the capital intensity of the firms, and this factor will positively affect firms' incentive of adoption as well. The empirical practice using the firm-level data in Vietnam verifies our predictions with robustness. In addition, we find that the phenomenon outlined above becomes even more obvious in the manufacturing sectors.
F64|The Role Of The State In Creating A Green Economy|"Starting from the crisis on the real economy in 2008 it has been developed an intense discussion, supported by a number of declarations on the global scale, about the need for changes in the economy. A huge impact on this state of affairs was the analysis of the causes and effects of the economic downturn and the challenges of the future. As a result, some states have taken action to remedy the situation. Many of them were aimed at structural changes in production, consumption and environmental friendly investment. At the same time gained in importance the concept of ""low carbon economy"" and ""green economy"". The aim of this paper is to present the role of the state in the economy in terms of creating conditions for a green economy. The thesis of publication is: implementation of structural changes connected with creating a green economy requires the involvement of the state."
F64|Open Economy, Global Value Chain and Corporate Social Responsibility in China|Using a survey of 1,266 firms in 12 cities in China, this paper investigates the effects of open economy on the corporate social responsibility (CSR) of Chinese domestic firms embedded in the global value chain (GVC). We argue that, under a compliance-based paradigm, foreign domestic investment (FDI) and export not necessarily improve the CSR performance of Chinese firms. The cascade with foreign owned enterprises in the local value chain and CSR pressure from the GVC have important intervening impact on Chinese domestic firms’ CSR performance. The CSR performance improves in the domestic firms with foreign clients in the local value chain and under labor and environmental standards pressure from the GVC. There is no prominent improvement of CSR performance in domestic firms only with foreign suppliers in the local value chain. Regressions using the structural equation models show that the FDI has significant direct effect on working overtime and the social security coverage, while the export has no significant direct effect on CSR performance. However, export has significant indirect effect on improvement of the green investment and environment training through the cascade with foreign owned enterprises in the local value chain and pressure from the GVC.
F64|Oil – The Earth’s blood, a paper on how to recover its critical declining prices by using a hedge vaccine through a leading core of countries termed as VIRUS|This paper introduces the description of whom are the main concerns about the currently and critical decline of oil prices, and how this countries, named as VIRUS, could turn out to be a “vaccine” into resulting on a hedge to correct and return to economic viable prices on the commodity. It uses as methodology the acceptance of five main regions or countries as the main characters on the supply and demand of crude oil globally, using a hedge through observation of old prices through a sextic polynomial equation to determine the price to be used into an econometric equation to forecast the hedge price scenario that could help the recovery of the global oil prices at mid-term, taking also into consideration a possible decline over the shale gas demand of the USA due environment question over fracking
F64|Zmiany parametrów jakości życia młodych Europejczyków - implikacje dla przedsiębiorstw<BR>[Changing determinants of Quality of Life of Young Europeans and their implications for business]|The paper aims at presenting the results of initial research on the perception and understanding of quality of human life between young Europeans. A literature overview resulted in a brief presentation of actual state of knowledge about socio – economic understanding of quality of life. A list of material and non – material determinants of quality of life characteristic for the mentioned group has been presented. A number of theses has been assessed: 1. In past years one can observe a deterioration of socio – economic environment of young Europeans. 2. This fact has brought some limits to the possibilities of their personal and professional development. 3. Moreover, these changes force modifications inside the determinants of quality of life of young Europeans. 4. Therefore, early recognition of the nature of mentioned changes could allow companies a more precise adaptation to the needs and preferences of this new generation of consumers. Direct interviews have been adopted as the main research method. The paper contains also an analysis of potential business implications of changing environment adaptation strategies of future employees and entrepreneurs from the young generation.

F64|Accessibility of waste collection services in Romania: a multi-scale analysis in EU context using thematic cartography<BR>[L'accessibilità dei servizi di raccolta dei rifiuti in Romania: un'analisi multi-scala in contesto dell'UE utilizzando cartografia tematica]|Low coverage of urban and rural population to waste collection services leads to various environmental threats caused by uncontrolled waste disposal. New EU regulations on waste management issues transposed into national laws have improved this sector, but, the population access to such services is still low compared to others new EU members. A multi-scale approach of this indicator is a necessary tool for a proper analysis of this environmental issue. The maps reveal that Romanian development regions (NUTS 2) have the lowest coverage rates at EU level in 2010. Furthermore, major disparities are reflected between Romanian counties in 2010. Thematic maps outline a comparative analysis at national and regional scale (Romanian counties & cities and communes of North-East Region) between urban vs rural areas in 2010. These geographical approaches are necessary for a better monitoring process of waste management sector.
F64|What Accounts for the Growth of Carbon Dioxide Emissions in Advanced and Emerging Economies? The Role of Consumption, Technology, and Global Supply Chain Trade|Climate policy pledges and negotiations involve commitments about the reduction of emissions within national borders. However, the rise of global value chains has changed the nature of production and international trade, blurring the attribution of ultimate responsibility for emissions. This paper applies a novel method that examines the change in territorial emissions due to changes in energy intensity, supply chain participation, and domestic and foreign consumption. Our findings suggest that rising levels of domestic consumption are related to increased carbon dioxide emissions in both advanced and emerging economies. A substantial share of emissions growth in emerging economies is accounted for by higher participation in global production networks that serve expanding foreign consumption. However, even for economies that most rapidly integrated in global production networks, such as the People’s Republic of China, rising domestic consumption accounts for the bulk of territorial emissions. Improved energy efficiency partially stemmed the spike in emissions from higher consumer demand.
F64|Divestment from fossil fuel companies: Confluence between policy and strategic viewpoints|In October 2014, the Australian National University announced that it was divesting from seven fossil fuel-intensive companies. This announcement sparked an unprecedented response in the community, both positive and negative. We examine this decision, the divestment movement in general, the science behind the issue and strategic responses, both policy and organisational. We argue that a confluence between policy responses and organisational responses is beginning to emerge that will lead to greater action on climate change.
F64|Conceptual considerations on notions of social change versus social development|Social development can be considered as a result of combining the effects of using economic development policies, tax policies, but also social policies. Social development mainly needs economic support, generally, but very important is the support on social change, that can be achieved by unconditioned access to education for the entire population, access to health care, knowledge, etc. terms that lead to sustainable social development.
F64|The footprint of using metals: new metrics of consumption and productivity|Metal use and modern society are intrinsically linked and it is no surprise that global processes of industrialization and urbanization have led to ever increasing amounts of metal use. In recent decades, global supply and demand networks for metals have become increasingly complex. Industrial Ecology research is well placed to unpack this complexity and to explore potential resource efficiencies for metals. This is especially important during the current period of rising ore prices. We examine patterns of supply and demand for iron ore and bauxite, and recent trends in resource productivity of these two important metal ores. We introduce a consumption perspective and compare the material footprint of metal ores to the GDP of countries to look at how much economic benefit countries achieve per unit of metal footprint. We find that for the past two decades global amounts of iron ore and bauxite extractions have risen faster than global GDP, that both supply and demand of iron ore and bauxite have been concentrated in a handful of countries and that resource productivity from a consumption perspective has fallen in developed nations, as well as globally. The research shows no saturation of metal ore consumption at any level of income. Policies will be required to enhance both the productivity of metal production and the economic productivity of consumption (GDP per metal footprint) through more efficient mining, product design, reuse and recycling.

F64|A Selective Migration Review: from public policy to public health|The contribution of Steinbeck in the late-1930’s concerning motives and decisionmaking for environmental migrations did much to influence research in social science. The Tiebout’s hypothesis and theoretical model of migration, published in 1956, permitted evaluation of urban public policy implications. The impact of these two pioneers in migration theory set the stage for new models and new methods in migration research having advantage of much more data from many more environmental, economic and social sectors applied to many more accumulating, often tragic, examples. This paper looks at the state of the science as these two influential authors left it and how the public health part of the 1930’s Dust Bowl migration to California contributes to our understanding of this complex human, decision-making system. Finally, Garfield's scientometric propagation of scientific thinking was utilized for migration theories.

It is a region which contains some of the biggest hydrocarbon and mineral deposits in the world, and some of the most energy- and metal-hungry economies in the world. With half the world's population, it is one of the most dynamic regions of the globe in terms of population movement, providing a key focus of foreign investment, both inwards and outwards, with a high degree of technological dynamism. The region plays a central role in the industrial supply networks of the globe.
F64|Carbon emissions embodied in Russia’s trade|According to current international climate change regime countries are responsible for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which result from economic activities within national borders, including emissions from producing goods for exports. At the same time imports of carbon intensive goods are not regulated by international agreements. In this paper emissions embodied in exports and imports of Russia were calculated with the use of inter-country input-output tables. It was revealed that Russia is the second largest exporter of emissions embodied in trade and the large portion of these emissions is directed to developed countries. The reasons for high carbon intensity of Russia’s exports are obsolete technologies (in comparison to developed economies) and the structure of commodity exports. Because of large amount of net exports of carbon intensive goods the current approach to emissions accounting does not suit interests of Russia. On the one hand, Russia, as well as other large net emissions exporters, is interested in the revision of allocation of responsibility between producers and consumers of carbon intensive products. On the other hand, current technological backwardness makes Russia vulnerable to the policy of “carbon protectionism”, which can be implemented by its trade partners.
F64|Rural tourism: A kind of sustainable tourism in the face of global economic crisis|Tourism has represented one of the major sources of balance of trade earnings for many years in the most developed countries. According to estimates by the World Tourism Organization (WTO), world tourism flows will grow by 4-5% annually over the coming years, reaching in 2020 an estimated number of 1.6 billion international arrivals, of which 378 million will be short haul international travellers (Lanfranchi M., Giannetto C., 2010). With the passage of time demand will become more diversified and this will lead to the spread of “new tourism”, the search for new products and increasingly diverse offers, characterised by organized local tourist systems. This paper underlines the importance of the tourist district (TD) or local tourist system (LTS) model as a strategic tool for creating innovative processes of endogenous development in a highly globalized framework, moreover it tries to highlight the peculiarities of tourist districts and their importance (as a network of heterogeneous actors operating at local level) in overcoming the major limitations of the distribution chain. In this model we need to improve the use and knowledge of the cultural, environmental and gastronomic heritage of the area in question and this can only happen through the creation of a tight network of relationships, composed of and coordinated by both public and private entities able to meet all the requirements (accommodation, catering, entertainment, travel etc.) of potential visitors. Therefore, the birth of DT or STL represents an important opportunity for the promotion of tourism development of different local realities, because they are able to create innovative spatial models, capable of responding effectively to needs concerning the coordination of different tourism initiatives. There has been a heterogeneous response concerning implementation of STL in Italy, indeed some regions have not taken advantage of this potential tool for tourism development, while others have created a special discipline.
F64|Protection of the coastal landscape for tourism sustainability|In order to respond to the challenge of the sustainable development - that is the conciliation between landscape and environmental protection and socio-economic development – this paper intend to identify methods and scenarios able to promote the development using in balanced and durable way the several landscape and environmental resources. This paper on the “Protection of the Coastal Landscape for Tourism Sustainability” analyses the phenomena manifested between landscape resource and tourist activities. The paper proposes to analyse some tourist development models unable to provoke the degradation of natural ecosystems and the loss of local identities, but oriented to valorisation forms of the environmental, social and cultural characters of the sites. Thus, the tourism, can favourite the economic and cultural development of a territory or, on the contrary, can determinate its irreversible degradation.

The need for a responsible approach|The article intends to fire a warning on the great possibilities and opportunities people have to better know themselves and communities around while traveling. The intentions are to reveal the diverse significations the category connection has, viewed from different perspectives. Development of the international tourism helps us understand the progress already made on different continents. An accent is put on responsible tourism, a concept with large and useful application nowadays. Several initiatives pursued by committed Romanians are examples to complete the picture.

V sociálnych vedách sa kryštalizujú dva zdanlivo protichodné pohľady na fungovanie ekonomiky a spoločnosti rozvojových krajín. Jeden je ekonomický, druhý geografický. V tomto článku sa pokúsime ukázať, aký je príspevok ekonomických geografov k riešeniu problémov nerovnomerného rozvoja, chudoby a hladu. V príspevku ponúkneme odpovede na tieto otázky: Aké sú prvotné príčiny hladu a chudoby? Môžu ekonomické normy a pravidlá prevzaté z iných regiónov sveta vyriešiť tieto problémy? Akú úlohu tu zohráva geografia? (Modernization, regional development and economic growth in developing countries belong to the most discussed issues of the contemporary world. In social science, two seemingly contradictory views on economy and society of developing countries have emerged. These are the economic view and the geographical perspective. In the present paper, we identify contributions of economic geographers to the search for solutions of problems of unequal development, poverty and famine in developing countries. The main questions discussed in the paper include: What are the primary causes of famine and poverty? Is application of economic norms and strategies used in other regions of the world a suitable solution? What is the role of geography in this aspect?)
F64|Globalization, Infrastructure, and Inclusive Growth|This paper covers threes issues: first, defining and measuring inclusive growth; second, the relationship between international trade and inequality; and third, the links between infrastructure and inequality. Both international trade and infrastructure make it easier for people to exchange goods and services and to increase income by allowing specialization, economies of scale, variety, etc. The gains are important not only in aggregate, but also at an individual level, and different people’s ability to take advantage of them varies. Hence each can increase inequality. Critical to sharing the gains from trade is mobility—specifically labor mobility, which determines the capacity of people to move from areas, sectors, skills, or firms of low or declining opportunity to those of higher opportunity. In the context of inclusive growth, this constitutes a challenge. However, the answer should not be to eschew opening up the economy or building infrastructure, but to do so in an informed way and seek to undertake complementary policies that help the less well-off take advantage of them.
F64|Impacts of Oil Foreign Direct Investment on Environment and Poverty Level in Niger Delta Oil Producing Region: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach|This study examines impacts of oil foreign direct investment on the environment and welfare of people of Niger delta oil producing communities, using structural equation models. Overall, it was found that oil foreign direct investment has consistent impact on the environment than the well- being of the community, which results in high levels of poverty. The implication is that there is environmental diseconomies and widespread of poverty in the area. Thus, there is need for fostering sustainable partnership between the oil foreign direct investors and the host communities by suitable consideration of the issues of mitigation of environmental problems that will reduce the poverty level of the people. The environmental and socioeconomic system should be developed to maintain an intensity of biodiversity that will give assurance to the buoyancy of the ecosystems on which human consumption and production depend.
F64|Structural Disparities in Carbon Dioxide Consumption and Trade in the World Economy|Social scientists have long argued that developed countries are more and more responsible for climate change because they externalise pollution to less developed countries. This paper offers a way to quantify climate responsibility by calculating carbon footprints and carbon balances between regions by means of an input-output analysis. We find that regions in the center of the world economy are increasingly consuming CO2 which was emitted in the periphery. Developed countries exhibit a large emission balance deficit with the less developed economies. Furthermore, we decompose carbon footprint developments between 1995 and 2007 into three effects: technical progress, shifts in the global value chain and increasing final demand. Our results show that the effect of technical progress is overcompensated by the effect of increased consumption and value chain shifts. Footprint growth in the center is strongly linked to additional pollution and technical development in the periphery. These findings challenge the prevailing view of the potential of modernisation and globalisation with regard to climate change.
F64|Seeking Consilience for Sustainability Science:Â Physical Sciences, Life Sciences, and the New Economics|The human system, driven largely by economic decisions, has profoundly affected planetary ecosystems as well as the energy supplies and natural resources essential to economic production. The challenge of sustainability is to understand and manage the complex interactions between human systems and the rest of nature. This conceptual article makes the case that meeting this challenge requires consilience between the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities, which is to say that their basic assumptions must be mutually reinforcing and consistent. This article reviews the extent to which economics is pursuing consilience with the sciences of human behavior, physics and ecology, and the impact full consilience would have on the field. The science of human behavior would force economists to redefine what is desirable, while physics and ecology redefine what is possible. The challenges posed by ecological degradation can be modeled as prisoner's dilemmas, best solved through cooperation, not competition. Fortunately, science reveals that humans may be among the most cooperative of all species. While much of the mainstream economic theory that still dominates academic and the policy discourse continues to ignore important findings from other sciences, several sub-fields of economics have made impressive strides towards consilience in recent decades, and these are likely to change mainstream theory eventually. The question is whether these changes can proceed rapidly enough to solve the most serious problems we currently face.
F64|Mobile Open-Source Solar-Powered 3-D Printers for Distributed Manufacturing in Off-Grid Communities|Manufacturing in areas of the developing world that lack electricity severely restricts the technical sophistication of what is produced. More than a billion people with no access to electricity still have access to some imported higher-technologies; however, these often lack customization and often appropriateness for their community. Open source appropriate techÂ­nology (OSAT) can overÂ­come this challenge, but one of the key impediments to the more rapid development and distriÂ­bution of OSAT is the lack of means of production beyond a specific technical complexity. This study designs and demonstrates the technical viability of two open-source mobile digital manufacturing facilities powered with solar photovoltaics, and capable of printing customizable OSAT in any comÂ­munity with access to sunlight. The first, designed for comÂ­munity use, such as in schools or makerÂ­spaces, is semi-mobile and capable of nearly continuous 3-D printing using RepRap technology, while also powering multiple computers. The second design, which can be completely packed into a standard suitcase, allows for specialist travel from community to community to provide the ability to custom manufacture OSAT as needed, anywhere. These designs not only bring the possibility of complex manufacturing and replacement part fabrication to isolated rural communities lacking access to the electric grid, but they also offer the opportunity to leap-frog the entire conventional manufacturing supply chain, while radically reducing both the cost and the environmental impact of products for developing communities.
F64|Challenges in Sustainability: Another Brick in the Wall|We are proud of Challenges in Sustainability's (CiS) fruitful start. A variety of quality research articles, editorials and notes have been published on a range of themes and topics, including sustainability governance [1], improved cookstoves [2,3], the potentials of 3-D printing in the global South [4], and the need for consiliences between the natural and social sciences and the humanities [5], to name just a few. Furthermore, despite the journal's short history, we are pleased with its high visibility, where numerous articles have been viewed or downloaded over 1200 times since publication. The high exposure rate and the quality of publications affirm our aspirations for stable growth and development in the future.
F64|Reversing the Trend of Large Scale and Centralization in Manufacturing: The Case of Distributed Manufacturing of Customizable 3-D-Printable Self-Adjustable Glasses|Although the trend in manufacturing has been towards centralization to leverage economies of scale, the recent rapid technical development of open-source 3-D printers enables low-cost distributed bespoke production. This paper explores the potential advantages of a distributed manufacturing model of high-value products by investigating the application of 3-D printing to self-refraction eyeglasses. A series of parametric 3-D printable designs is developed, fabricated and tested to overcome limitations identified with mass-manufactured self-correcting eyeglasses designed for the developing world's poor. By utilizing 3-D printable self-adjustable glasses, communities not only gain access to far more diversity in product design, as the glasses can be customized for the individual, but 3-D printing also offers the potential for significant cost reductions. The results show that distributed manufacturing with open-source 3-D printing can empower developing world communities through the ability to print less expensive and customized self-adjusting eyeglasses. This offers the potential to displace both centrally manufactured conventional and self-adjusting glasses while completely eliminating the costs of the conventional optics correction experience, including those of highly-trained optometrists and ophthalmologists and their associated equipment. Although, this study only analyzed a single product, it is clear that other products would benefit from the same approach in isolated regions of the developing world.
F64|Editorial for Journal of Human Security Volume 10|Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela's death on 5 December 2013 and his funeral ten days later were taken as an occasion in the global media to discuss the merits of political leadership for human security, with occasional comments on its pitfalls. This particular leader is not the most politically safe object of discussion, as, for a long time, he openly advocated civil disobedience and resistance, initially of the non-violent kind, but later becoming violent. Predictably, the local hegemon reacted with great brutality and sweeping measures to the resistance of the ANC, policies that shocked many in the western world. This reaction by the govÂ­ernment and its supporters and the counterreaction it incited amounted, in the long run, to little more than a vast reduction in human security for most citizens of South Africa, lasting until the ANC's victory and Mr Mandela's ascendance to the presidency in 1994.
F64|Human Security in World Affairs: A Pedagogical, Multi-disciplinary Approach|Alexander and Sabina Lautensach (editors) propose that their book is primarily intended for students and for teaching, and that a pedagogical approach was prioritised rather than a reproduction in the standard format of an academic monograph (p. XVII). Throughout, they aim for a diverse, multi/trans-disciplinary approach in content and presentation by contributors with potential student outcomes focused on flexibility and a broad spectrum knowledge and understanding of human security. To these ends they have been very successful. This hefty tome, almost encyclopaedic in its scope and depth, needs to be approached by students in a certain way. ThatÂ is, students will benefit from some directed guidance regarding approach and methodology in order to successfully navigate through the many detailed concepts, theories and practicalities contained in the book. This is clearly provided in the preface where the authors spend quite some time outlining the rationale of the book in a simple and easy to understand way that will be particularly useful for students and other engaged readers.
F64|Fragile States, Infectious Disease and Health Security: The Case for Timor-Leste|Timor-Leste is a very young and developing nation state. Endemic infectious disease and weakened health security coupled with its growing and inclusive public institutions keep Timor-Leste fragile and in transition on the spectrum of state stability. The objective here is to systematically review Timor-Leste's state and public health successes, showing how a fragile state can consistently improve its status on the continuum of stability and improve health security for the population. The case study follows a state case study approach, together with a disease burden review and a basic description of the health portrait in relation to Timor-Leste's fragile state status. Disease burden and health security are directly proportional to state stability and indirectly proportional to state failure. Timor-Leste is a clear example of how public health can feed into increased state stability. Our discussion attempts to describe how the weak and fragile island nation of Timor-Leste can continue on its current path of transition to state stability by increasing health security for its citizens. We surmise that this can be realized when public policy focuses on primary healthcare access, inclusive state institutions, basic hygiene and preventative vaccination programs. Based on our review, the core findings indicate that byÂ increasing health security, a positive feedback loop of state stability follows. The use of Timor-Leste as a case study better describes the connection between public health and health security; and state stability, development and inclusive state institutions that promote health security.
F64|A Case for Cohabitative Security: The Philippine and Malaysian Experience|This article attempts to explore and analyse the evidence for cohabiting the human security concept into the national security frameworks of ASEAN countries. Using the Philippines and Malaysia as case studies, the article determines the extent to which public officials and policymakers have redefined and reenvisioned national security by incorporating non-traditional, people-centered elements of human security. The word 'cohabitation' refers to national governments' efforts to amalgamate statist and humanist dimensions of security when articulating and implementing their national security rhetoric and agenda. It argues that human security naturally complements state security, and vice versa. As such, human security and state security co-exist in a constructive manner that enhances the overall level of national security. In other words, they are mutually constitutive rather than mutually corrosive. Both cases underscore a two-pronged assumption. First, the meaning and provision of national security can neither be eloquently articulated nor completely substantiated without considerations for 'below the state' actors and issues. And second, the eminent status vis-Ã -vis power of the state in providing national security can neither be trivialized nor undermined.
F64|The Praxis of Social Enterprise and Human Security: An Applied Research Agenda|The growth of social enterprise within development NGO work might lead one to suspect it has been irredeemably corrupted by neo-liberal capitalism. However, using the tools of capitalism is not the same as subscribing to the values of capitalism. This paper is situated at the intersection of five fields: human security, international development, social enterprise, social franchising, and left-wing anti-capitalist thought. It examines the relevance of social enÂ­terprise to human security and to development, the relationship between social enterprise and the anti-capitalist values of the left, and it then focuses on social franchisingâ€”a subset of social enterprise that highlights the importance of cooperationâ€”suggesting that it may be a useful methodology for NGOs carrying out educational work in parts of the developing world. It synÂ­thesises and extends ideas that I have presented elsewhere [1-3], it draws on ethnographic fieldwork on the Thai-Burma border, and it puts forward an agenda for further applied research that is rooted in a sociological analysis of civil society and contributes to the human security paradigm.
F64|Human Security and Developmental Crisis in the Contemporary West Africa|The last two decades were characterized by severe conflicts in the West Africa subregion. The era of conflict resolution, management and peace building thus came to define theregion. The destruction left by long years of protracted conflicts and the present state of devel opment is reason enough to warrant attention both from within and beyond. The study expounds, operationalizes and clarifies the concept of human security and development, and how human security issues lead to underdevelopment. The paper investigates the human security concerns in the post-conflict period and also looks at the crisis of development in the sub-region. It highlights details on the developmental crises that have bedevilled the sub-region and at the same time exposes the threats these crises pose on national security and peace in the subregion. This paper concludes that there is no appreciable effort in operationalizing human security in West Africa and this will lead to instability. The paper maintains that human security issues now complicate the developmental crisis in the sub-region due to its ambiguity. The paper suggests that policy makers should address human security issues in order to tackle developmental crisis in the sub-region.
F64|The Fragility of the Liberal Peace Export to South Sudan: Formal Education Access as a Basis of a Liberal Peace Project|This study examines the disjuncture between the policy transposition of the Liberal Peace Project (LPP) in South Sudan from the country's local context. It underlines how deep rooted historical exclusion from social welfare services reinforces political exclusion and exacerbates poor civic engagement among different ethnicities in the country causing a constant relapse to violence. The study combines a qualitative review of data from Afrobarometer, the National Democratic Institute, international NGOs, and South Sudan's government reports within depth interviews and participants' observation. The research finds that restricted access to formal education alongside the conservative and orthodox approaches to peacebuilding, which broadly focus on centralised urban political institutions and exclude diverse local needs and preferences, limit citizenship participation to elections and preclude an equitable social order in South Sudan, establishing a continuum of fragile authoritarian peace, institutional peace and constitutional peace. In an emancipatory approach, the study proposes a framework that prioritizes an extended access to primary and post-primary vocational education as a more credible establishment for sustainable civil peace in the country. The LPP by the international community needs to be tailored to enhance the political will of the South Sudan government to extend free primary education access, incentivize primary education with school feeding programmes and to invigorate vocational training curricula. These will yield civil peace dividends, which avert South Sudan's structural source of relapse into violence with sustainable disincentives. Apart from women's empowerment through education and in all spheres of life, the government needs to ensure sustainability by guaranteeing a sustainable future for the present and for returning refugees by reducing the effects of climate change so as to cope with the increasing pressure on natural resources.
F64|Can the Pragmatic East Asian Approach to Human Security Offer a Way for the Deepening of the Long Peace of East Asia?|"East Asia (including Southeast and Northeast Asia) has witnessed the most spectacular pacification in the world during the past 30 years. Certain dimensions related to human security have been perceived as weak points in the long peace of East Asia. Despite progress, authoritarian violence is still a reality in East Asia. At the same time, certain other dimensions of human securityâ€”most distinctively those elements related to ""freedom from want""â€”have developed very well during the long peace of East Asia. This article will study whether the concept of human security constructs realities that are useful for peace in East Asia. For this, the article will look at how the way in which ""human"" and ""security"" are linked, serve and deepen the existing social realities of peace in the region. Furthermore, the article will look inside the concepts of ""human"" and ""security"" to see how human security is constructed and whether the construction serves to deepen the long peace of East Asia. The article will argue that the East Asian human security debate could be an intellectual adaptation strategy useful for the promotion of the long peace of East Asia in a deeper sense."
F64|Fragmentación y cooperación en la gobernanza energética global/Fragmentation and Cooperation in Global Energy Governance|El artículo aborda la interdependencia energética y la gobernanza mundial de la energía desde una perspectiva de economía política internacional. Describe la naturaleza fragmentada de la gobernanza energética, así como la tendencia hacia una mayor inter-polaridad, analizando por qué la hegemonía está limitada por la interacción de una miríada de regímenes internacionales energéticos dedicados a aspectos diferentes que conforman un ?complejo de regímenes energéticos? en lugar de un único régimen internacional. Por último, el trabajo analiza la gobernanza mundial de la energía desde el prisma de la provisión de bienes públicos globales, evaluando el impacto sobre la misma de las capacidades materiales, ideacionales e institucionales internacionales. This article addresses energy interdependency and global energy governance from an international political economy perspective. It starts by describing the fragmented nature of energy governance and the trend towards increased inter-polarity. It also explains why hegemony is bounded by the interplay of the myriad of dedicated international energy regimes, stating that they conform an ?energy regime complex? rather than a single international energy regime. Finally, the paper analyses the institutional evolution of the energy regime complex, trying to assess the impact of ideational, material capabilities and international energy institutions? in global energy governance.
F64|Using the Tax System to Address Competition Issues With a Carbon Tax|This paper considers how tax reductions financed by a carbon tax could be designed to mitigate the need for specific relief for firms in select energy-intensive, trade-exposed (EITE) sectors at the six-digit North American Industry Classification System level. Providing an output-based tax credit to EITE sectors or a broad based reduction in corporate income tax rates disproportionately benefits EITE sectors, thereby potentially reducing pressure for other transitional relief. Payroll tax reductions, on the other hand, do not disproportionately benefit EITE sectors given their higher than average capital intensity.
F64|Scaling up and replicating effective climate finance interventions|There is widespread recognition that climate finance needs to be scaled up from its current levels. However, there is no clear view on how developed countries can efficiently and effectively mobilise further climate finance to meet the needs of developing countries. Developed countries have committed to mobilise USD 100 bn per year of climate finance for developing countries by 2020 from a variety of sources. These include both public and private finance, thus the private sector is likely to play a significant role in the mobilisation of climate finance to meet this commitment. This paper explores how scale-up and replication of effective climate finance interventions efficiently mobilise private climate finance. The interventions examined in the paper have already been, or are being, scaled up or replicated. Scaling-up and replication of such climate finance interventions could be an efficient way to increase the private sector’s interest in mobilisation of climate finance, and thus to make progress towards the USD 100 bn per year goal by 2020. The paper draws lessons from selected mitigation and available adaptation case studies at project- and programme-levels as well as from experience with international climate funds. The paper examines three key aspects needed to scale up and replicate climate finance. The first is the institutional structures and decision-making framework of the climate finance source, its aims, the scale at which it operates and how barriers to scaling-up and replication have been addressed. Second, the paper explores how demonstrating effective low-carbon, climate-resilient technologies and systems can facilitate scale-up and replication. Third, the paper discusses the influence of policies to enhance domestic enabling environments for scaling-up and replication. Montée en puissance et réitération des interventions efficaces de financement climat Il est largement admis qu’une augmentation des financements climatiques est indispensable. Cependant, on ne voit pas bien comment les pays développés peuvent mobiliser, de manière efficace et rentable, davantage de financements de ce type pour répondre aux besoins des pays en développement. Les pays développés se sont engagés à mobiliser 100 milliards USD par an provenant de diverses sources d’ici à 2020 pour financer la lutte contre le changement climatique dans les pays en développement. Comme il s’agit aussi bien de financements publics que privés, le secteur privé jouera probablement un rôle important dans le respect de cet engagement. Ce rapport étudie comment la montée en puissance et la réitération des interventions efficaces en matière de financement climat permettent de lever des fonds privés de façon efficiente pour financer des actions climatiques. Les interventions qui y sont analysées ont d’ores et déjà été appliquées de nouveau ou à plus grande échelle : donner plus d’ampleur à ce type d’opérations ou les réitérer pourrait donc être un moyen efficient d’intéresser davantage le secteur privé et de progresser vers la mobilisation de 100 milliards USD par an visée à l’horizon 2020. Ce rapport dégage les enseignements à tirer de certaines études de cas portant sur l’atténuation et l’adaptation au niveau de projets ou de programmes, ainsi que de l’expérience acquise avec les fonds internationaux pour 3 le climat. Il aborde trois aspects déterminants et nécessaires pour donner plus d’ampleur aux opérations de financement climatique et les multiplier. Le premier concerne l’architecture institutionnelle et le cadre décisionnel de la source de financement climat, ses objectifs, l’échelle à laquelle elle opère et les moyens mis en oeuvre pour surmonter les obstacles qui empêchaient de passer à une échelle supérieure et de reproduire les opérations. Le rapport explique en deuxième lieu comment cela est facilité par la démonstration de technologies et de systèmes bas carbone, résilients au changement climatique et performants, pour ensuite aborder, en troisième lieu, l’influence des politiques qui améliorent les conditions nationales favorables à l’augmentation de ces financements et à la reproduction des opérations.
F64|The Use Of Green Certificates In The Banat Region|"The economy has developed and specialized itself in different fields of activity and great economists have had the possibility to observe the polluting effects of mankind’s activity (which nowadays develops its activity within some local, state and world business enterprises heading at present towards a globalization of the economic activity). Even though the harmful influence of the economic agent's activity on the environment has been noticed for over a century now, only in the last decades new span concepts and actions appeared, such as: sustainable development and national and international policies regarding the environment.Sustainable development pursues and tries to find a stable theoretical framework for making decisions in any situation in which a man/environment type relationship is found (whether it is about the environment or the economic or social medium) and it constitutes the main objective of sustainable development. At present, the concept comprises both the solving of the ecological crisis ensuring the quality of the environment and that of life quality in its complexity, including social and economic aspects. One of these solutions is the introduction of the ""green certificates"" concept. Its emergence led to the appearance of a competition in the field of energy production from renewable resources. Each green certificate must contain the following information: the quantity of produced energy and its source, a unique registration number and other additional information, if it is required. The validity period of the green certificate is the date on which the energy was already produced and consumed."
F64|Globalization, Infrastructure, and Inclusive Growth|This paper covers threes issues : first, defining and measuring inclusive growth; second, the relationship between international trade and inequality; and third, the links between infrastructure and inequality. Both international trade and infrastructure make it easier for people to exchange goods and services and to increase income by allowing specialization, economies of scale, variety, etc. The gains are important not only in aggregate, but also at an individual level, and different peopleâ€™s ability to take advantage of them varies. Hence each can increase inequality. Critical to sharing the gains from trade is mobilityâ€”specifically labor mobility, which determines the capacity of people to move from areas, sectors, skills, or firms of low or declining opportunity to those of higher opportunity. In the context of inclusive growth, this constitutes a challenge. However, the answer should not be to eschew opening up the economy or building infrastructure, but to do so in an informed way and seek to undertake complementary policies that help the less well-off take advantage of them.
F64|Solution to Internalize the Sustainability in a Spa Company|Our research views the sustainability of the company as a way to support the sustainable development of the local community. In turn, the local community developed sustainably has a positive impact on the sustainable development at society’s level. Local communities develop sustainably when companies intend to bring their contribution to a partnership relation between the local community and companies. Such partnership helps companies to choose solutions to mitigate threats and to support the local community to develop sustainably. Local community-company partnership does not allow the stakeholders to adopt a win-win attitude. In this context, stakeholders build strategies according to their own visions; the local community builds strategically a sustainable development whereas companies have strategies to increase the sustainability of the business.
F64|Empirical Investigation of Industrial Management|The paper is devoted to an aspect in the sphere of management business priorities of industrial management in XXI century. In modern times the actuality of treated problems is mainly laid into the necessities of the real management practice in industrial organizations and the need theoretical and applied knowledge to be offered to that practice which would allow it methodologically right and methodically correct to implement the corresponding changes in management of a concrete organization. Objects of analyses and evaluations are some fragmented approbations of theses using the corresponding instruments. The characteristic features of the organizations' profiles and the persons interviewed participated in the investigation are summarized. The determining approaches for Bulgarian organizations are considered too. On the basis of the critical analyses the fundamental tasks are drawn which are inherent to contemporary industrial managers. Attention is paid to key management functions for an effective managerial process. An analysis of managers reaching the best results in industrial management is presented as well as when they are reached. Outlined are also specific peculiarities of industrial management in the Republic of Bulgaria and parameters of the level of productiveness in conditions of business globalization and priority forms in marketing of the ready product or service in XXI century. The results of the launched idea for the necessity to create a new International management architecture (NIMA) are determined: structure and structure defining parameters. The results of the investigation of main business priorities in industrial management are commented as well as expected problems in the process of functioning of industrial organizations in XXI century. At the end the corresponding conclusions are made in respect to the techniques used in determining effectiveness of industrial management in Bulgarian organizations.
F64|Eco-innovation and its Contribution to Sustainable Development and Competitiveness|In the context of global economy a dominant role of knowledge is the importance of human resources in the process of innovation and value creation. This paper aims to address Romania’s competitiveness in the context of global change mitigation by analyzing the counties competitiveness and eco-innovation. The efficiency-driven stage of development, which Romania is part of require specific regulatory measure in order to achieve sustainable development and competitive advantage. Analyzing the eco-innovation local needs by focusing on the SME can be seen as a solution, as they are creative in order to compensate for the lack of funding in research, development and innovation (like cluster research which is beneficial for sharing the risk and cost involved in research activities).
F64|Special Study on Sustainable Fisheries Management and International Trade in the Southeast Asia and Pacific Region|This paper analyzes the current status of fisheries and aquaculture in Southeast Asia and international trade. Analysis concludes that a policy of sustainable management for both capture fisheries and aquaculture is of greatest importance, but such a policy has been neither planned nor implemented with a holistic and long-term perspective. Current policy reflects a short-term view and the immediate needs of each nation. Therefore, capacity building of human resources and organizations, including governments, is needed for the formulation of holistic national policies to seek long-term and fundamental remedies for the sustainable management of fisheries resources and intensified and extensive aquaculture. Such holistic national policies should include science-based management, monitoring, enforcement, coordination of capture fisheries and aquaculture, and international trade policies. It may include the effects of climate change and oil price increases, as well as international market trends and regulations or barriers. Moreover, international trade will be promoted based on the sustainability of capture fisheries and aquaculture. ADB members and governments are urged to provide official development assistance for policy implementation, in particular to the private sectors that may not otherwise receive any, and to small and community-related businesses. Recommendations focus on building capacity for the long run, among others, for which facilitation should be provided.

F64|Measuring Environmental Regulatory Stringency|Researchers have long been interested in whether environmental regulations discourage investment, reduce labour demand, or alter patterns of international trade. But estimating those consequences of regulations requires devising a means of measuring their stringency empirically. While creating such a measure is often portrayed as a data-collection problem, we identify four fundamental conceptual obstacles, which we label multidimensionality, simultaneity, industrial composition, and capital vintage. We then describe the long history of attempts to measure environmental regulatory stringency, and assess their relative success in light of those obstacles. Finally, we propose a new measure of stringency that would be based on emissions data and could be constructed separately for different pollutants.
F64|Climate Change and Extreme Weather Events in Latin America: An Exposure Index|Climate change is changing the frequency and intensity of Extreme Weather Events (EWEs), particularly in poor developing countries, and the international community is increasingly suggesting the design of adaptation funds to resolve this situation. Measures of vulnerability and exposure to EWEs are a critical instrument in guaranteeing a transparent, efficient and equitable allocation process in these funds. Latin American countries, which contribute little to climate change but are hard-hit by EWEs, urgently need new indicators to back up their claims for financial and technical assistance. Using DesInventar data, the paper develops an innovative Disaster Exposure Index (DEI) that encompasses many disasters' impacts. DEI calculations indicate an unexpected scenario where some regions usually considered resilient are found to be exposed. The results call for further development of regional indicators to facilitate the international, national and sub- national allocation of adaptation funds.
F64|How Can Latin America Help the World to Cope with Climate Change?|Latin America has a comparative advantage in deforestation compared to other forms of climate change mitigation. Thus, to the extent that Latin America should engage in mitigation, the optimal climate change policy should manage these advantages by generating incentives in Latin America to deal with forestry. This paper describes the problem of deforestation and studies the market failures that arise in relation to forestry emission problems, analyzing them from a global public good perspective. The paper additionally describes other problems related to forestry emission issues and presents a non-exhaustive review of the solutions currently proposed to address this issue. The paper concludes with policy recommendations.
F64|Rare Earth Elements - A New Challenge for the World Economy|"Rare Earth Elements or Rare Earth Metals (REM) are a collection of seventeen chemical elements in the periodic table, namely scandium, yttrium and fifteen lanthanides. The term ""rare earth"" arises from the rare earth minerals from which they were first isolated. They are uncommon oxide-type minerals (earths) found in Gandolinite extracted from one mine in Sweden. The first discovery was made in 1794, but it was only in 1940 that the scientist Frank Spedding developed an ion exchange procedure for separating and purifying the REM. For the next decades, they were hardly used in some ""minor"" industrial fields. Only after 2000 their importance grew, once the multitude of possibilities to use them was discovered due to technological progress. Now REM are incorporated into almost all modern technological devices: superconductors, magnets, electronic polishers, refining catalysts hybrid car components and military techniques. They are used in small quantities, but due to their extraordinary properties the prices are very high. The main problem is that China dominates this market, with 97% of total global supply. The highest concentration of rare earth metals are in Inner Mongolia in China, Mountain Pass in California U.S.A. and in Mount Weld in Australia. The developed countries are far behind China regarding production and are indeed depending on Chinese exports. Hence, there is a difficult situation on this particular market, with an uncertain future."
F64|A Comparative Analysis Of The Building Stock In Eu And Romania|Buildings occupy an important role in our modern society. However, the existing buildings have a very low thermal protection, leading to high levels of energy consumption making the buildings sector among the most significant CO2 source in Europe. Even if new buildings have high performance levels, the majority of the building stock is represented by older buildings which require renovation work. The European Union has imposed important reduction of specific energy consumption in all sectors, but energy conservation in buildings remains a key element in obtaining the sustainable development as evidence of human solidarity beyond the limits of space and time. In this paper the importance of the energy reductions in the building sector is outlined and both the energy policy and building stock statistics in EU and Romania are presented. Moreover, some measures and initiatives at European level are discussed, focusing on some important themes: demography, housing stock age and energy requirements.
F64|Sustainability: A Path-breaking Idea, but Still Associated with Huge Challenges|Sustainability science is a young discipline that started emerging in the late 20th century, although Hans Carl von Carlowitz had already introduced ideas about sustainable management of forests in the early 18th century. In recent times, the Club of Rome report in 1972 and the Brundtland report in 1987 developed these concepts further, and subsequently the sustainability idea became prominent in political debates as well. In both reports it was recognized that growth would have certain limits and a different style of resource utilization was therefore necessary. However, despite numerous approaches dealing with sustainability, it is still an important issue.
F64|Sustaining Welfare for Future Generations: A Review Note on the Capital Approach to the Measurement of Sustainable Development|Measuring sustainable development based on analytical models of growth and development and modern methods of growth accounting is an economic approachâ€”often called the capital approach â€“ to establishing sustainable development indicators (SDIs). Ecological approaches may be combined with the capital approach, but there are also other approaches to establishing sustainable development indicatorsâ€”for example the so-called integrated approach. A recent survey of the various approaches is provided in UNECE, OECD and Eurostat [1]. This review note is not intended to be another survey of the various approaches. Rather the objective of this paper is twofold: to present an update on an economic approach to measuring sustainable developmentâ€”the capital approachâ€”and how this approach may be combined with the ecological approach; to show how this approach is actually used as a basis for longer-term policies to enhance sustainable development in Norwayâ€”a country that relies heavily on non-renewable natural resources. We give a brief review of recent literature and set out a model of development based on produced, human, natural and social capital, and the level of technology. Natural capital is divided into two partsâ€”natural capital produced and sold in markets (oil and gas)â€”and non-market natural capital such as clean air and biodiversity. Weak sustainable development is defined as non-declining welfare per capita if the total stock of a nation's capital is maintained. Strong sustainable development is if none of the capital stocks, notably non-market natural capital, is reduced below critical or irreversible levels. Within such a framework, and based on Norwegian experience and statistical work, monetary indexes of national wealth and its individual components including real capital, human capital and market natural capital are presented. Limits to this framework and to these calculations are then discussed, and we argue that such monetary indexes should be sustainable development indicators (SDIs) of non-market natural capital, and physical SDIs, health capital and social capital. Thus we agree with the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission [2] that monetary indexes of capital should be combined with physical SDIs of capital that have no market prices. We then illustrate the policy relevance of this framework, and how it is actually being used in long term policy making in Norwayâ€”a country that relies heavily on non-renewable resources like oil and gas. A key sustainability rule for Norwegian policies is to maintain the total future capital stocks per capita in real terms as the country draws down its stocks of non-renewable natural capital â€”applying a fiscal guideline akin to the Hartwick rule.
F64|Sustainability Science: Progress Made and Directions Forward|I am honored to contribute an editorial for the inaugÂ­ural issue of Challenges in Sustainability (CiS). It has provided the opportunity for me to take a step back and reflect on both the developmental progress in the field of sustainability science since its formal launch, now over twelve years ago [1,2], and where the field might head in coming years. While it may always feel that the field is changing too slowly to keep up with the challenges it addresses, the developments have been noteworthy, especially in academia. I will discuss three areas: education, research and institutional development.
F64|The Pitfalls of Sustainability Policies: Insights into Plural Sustainabilities|"A lot can be learned from the numerous pitfalls of sustainable development implementation: they outline how collective representation, short term interests and balance of power can undermine sustainability. For instance, the usefulness of global institutions in dealing with sustainable development is questionable as most are skewed toward the interests and perceptions of developed countries. The notion of sustainable development itself induces a profound cleavage between academic authors and the actors of its implementation, some of whom confuse it with sustainable growth (which favors spatial equity), whilst the others with environment management (which favors intergenerational equity). This polarization is a real problem, since originally, ""Our Common Future"" report promotes an inclusive approach, able to cope with both equities simultaneously. Finally, if there are obligations toward future generations, there are also obligations toward the current generation. The key issue for effective sustainability policies should be making them acceptable to everyone by including the expectations of local societies and communities. As a matter of consequence, universal solutions do not exist. They would not meet the specificities of local circumstances. The traditional prescriptive sustainable development model should give way to flexible plural sustainabilities. Singular, top-down, global-to-local approaches to sustainable development should be substituted for multiple sustainabilities."
F64|Why 'Sustainable Development' Is Often Neither: A Constructive Critique|Efforts and programs toward aiding sustainable development in less affluent countries are primarily driven by the moral imperative to relieve and to prevent suffering. This utilitarian principle has provided the moral basis for humanitarian intervention and development aid initiatives worldwide for the past decades. It takes a short term perspective which shapes the initiatives in characteristic ways. While most development aid programs succeed in their goals to relieve hunger and poverty in ad hoc situations, their success in the long term seems increasingly questionable, which throws doubt on the claims that such efforts qualify as sustainable development. This paper aims to test such shortfall and to find some explanations for it. We assessed the economic development in the worldâ€™s ten least affluent countries by comparing their ecological footprints with their biocapacities. This ratio, and how it changes over time, indicates how sustainable the development of a country or region is, and whether it risks ecological overshoot. Our results confirm our earlier findings on South-East Asia, namely that poor countries tend to have the advantage of greater sustainability. We also examined the impact that the major development aid programs in those countries are likely to have on the ratio of footprint over capacity. Most development aid tends to increase that ratio, by boosting footprints without adequately increasing biocapacity. One conceptual explanation for this shortfall on sustainability lies in the Conventional Development Paradigm, an ideological construct that provides the rationales for most development aid programs. According to the literature, it rests on unjustified assumptions about economic growth and on the externalisation of losses in natural capital. It also rests on a simplistic version of utilitarianism, usually summed up in the principle ofÂ â€˜the greatest good for the greatest numberâ€™. We suggest that a more realistic interpretation of sustainability necessitates a revision of that principle to â€˜ the minimum acceptable amount of good for the greatest sustainable numberâ€™. Under that perspective, promoting the transition to sustainability becomes a sine qua non condition for any form of â€˜developmentâ€™.
F64|Sustainable Development within Planetary Boundaries: A Functional Revision of the Definition Based on the Thermodynamics of Complex Social-Ecological Systems|The dominant paradigm of sustainable development (SD) where the environment is just the third pillar of SD has proven inadequate to keep humanity within the safe operational space determined by biophysical planetary boundaries. This implies the need for a revised definition compatible with a nested model of sustainable development, where humanity forms part of the overall social-ecological system, and that would allow more effective sustainable development goals and indicators. In this paper an alternative definition is proposed based on the thermodynamics of open systems applied to ecosystems and human systems. Both sub- systems of the global social-ecological system show in common an increased capability of buffering against disturbances as a consequence of an internal increase of order. Sustainable development is considered an optimization exercise at different scales in time and space based on monitoring the change in the exergy content and exergy dissipation of these two sub- systems of the social-ecological system. In common language it is the increase of human prosperity and well-being without loss of the structure and functioning of the ecosystem. This definition is functional as it allows the straightforward selection of quantitative indicators, discerning sustainable development from unsustainable development, unsustainable stagnation and sustainable retreat. The paper shows that the new definition is compatible with state of the art thinking on ecosystem services, the existence of regime shifts and societal transitions, and resilience. One of the largest challenges in applying the definition is our insufficient understanding of the change in ecosystem structure and function as an endpoint indicator of human action, and its effect on human prosperity and well-being. This implies the continued need to use midpoint indicators of human impact and related thresholds defining the safe operating space of the present generation with respect to future generations. The proposed definition can be considered a valuable complement to the recently emerged nested system discourse of sustainable development, by offering a more quantitative tool to monitor and guide the transition of human society towards a harmonious relationship with the rest of the biosphere.
F64|Assessing the Climate Impacts of Cookstove Projects: Issues in Emissions Accounting|An estimated 2.6 billion people rely on traditional biomass for home cooking and heating, so improving the efficiency of household cookstoves could provide significant environmental, social and economic benefits. Some researchers have estimated that potential greenhouse gas emission reductions could exceed 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) per year. Carbon finance offers a policy mechanism for realizing some of this potential and could also bring improved monitoring to cookstove projects. However, there are formidable methodological challenges in estimating emission reductions. This paper evaluates the quantification approaches to three key variables in calculating emission impacts: biomass fuel consumption, fraction of non-renewable biomass, and emission factors for fuel consumption. It draws on a literature review as well as on interviews with technical experts and market actors, and identifies lessons learned and knowledge gaps. Key research needs identified include incorporating accounting for uncertainty; development of additional default factors for biomass consumption for baseline stoves; refinement of monitoring approaches for cookstove use; broadened scope of emission factors used for cookstoves; accounting for non-CO 2 gases and black carbon; and refinement of estimates and approaches to considering emissions from bioenergy use across methodologies.
F64|Building Disaster Resilience: Steps toward Sustainability|Disaster losses continue to escalate globally and in many regions human losses (death, injury, permanent displacement) often exceed the economic toll. Current disaster policies are reactive with a short-term focusâ€•respond and rebuild as quickly as possible and in the same way after the event. Such policies ignore the longer-term approach of building disaster-resilient communities, in which investments made now show financial and social returns later by reducing the impact of disasters. This article provides a vision for resilient nations in 2030 based on three recent policy reports. It highlights the necessary steps to wards achieving sustainability using the lens of disaster resilience as the pathway towards strengthening communities' ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, respond to, and recover from present and future disasters.
F64|Publishing Sustainability Research Visually: A Film about the Opportunities and Challenges of a Rural Entrepreneurship Initiative in Kenya|We have witnessed a large increase in the number of publications on sustainability challenges over the past decade. One important characteristic of the research is with the wide variety of actors that can make use of the results. Sustainability knowledge is often not only relevant for those in academia or policy-making circles, but it can also be useful for decision-makers in a diversity of societal facets and sectors. It is therefore essential that the sustainability research community have access to a diversity of knowledge dissemination outlets, including those that extend beyond the traditional, and often inaccessible, academic publishing realms. One positive development over the past decade in sustainability research reaching broader audiences has been the proliferation of open access publication outlets. The alternative has provided greater access to scientific articles to almost anyone with an Internet connection. But, is this medium of knowledge dissemination sufficient? Are there additional channels that sustainability researchers can use to broadcast knowledge to even broader user groups?
F64|Knowledge Governance for Sustainable Development: A Review|"Sustainable development is a knowledge intensive process, but plagued by persistent concerns over our apparent inability to connect what we know with more sustainable practices and outcomes. While considerable attention has been given to ways we may better understand and enhance the knowledge-based processes that support the governance of social-Â­ecological systems, relatively few have examined the governance of knowledge itself. The institutionsâ€”rules and normsâ€”that govern knowledge may shed light on the persistence of 'gaps' between knowledge and action. In this review I seek to answer the question: can interdisciplinary knowledge governance literature contribute to understanding and analysing the institutional knowledge-based dimensions of sustainable development? I present and analyse the concept of knowledge governance as it is emerging in a range of disciplines and practice areas, including private sector management literature and public regulation theory and practice. I then integrate the findings from this review into a model of sustainable development proposed by Nilsson et al. [1]. I show that knowledge governance (as a scale above knowledge management) can inform Nilsson et al.'s three ""nested"" dimensions of sustainability: human wellbeing (through access to knowledge and freedom to exercise informed choice); resource-base management (though enhancing regulation and innovation and transitions from exclusive to inclusive knowledge systems); and global public goods (by balancing public and private interests and fostering global innovation systems). This review concludes by presenting a framework that places sustainable development in the context of broader socio-political struggles towards more open, inclusive knowledge systems."
F64|Carbon Intensities of Economies from the Perspective of Learning Curves|While some countries have achieved considerable development, many others still lack accessto the goods and services considered standard in the modern society. As CO2 emissions and development are often correlated, this paper employs the theoretical background of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) and the learning curves toolkit to analyze how carbon intensities have changed as countries move towards higher development (and cumulative wealth) levels. The EKC concept is then tested with the methodology of learning curves for the period between 1971 and 2010, so as to capture a dynamic picture of emissions trends and development. Results of both analyses reveal that empirical data fails to provide direct evidence of an EKC for emissions and development. The data does show, however, an interesting pattern in the dispersion of emissions levels for countries within the same HDI categories. While data does not show that countries grow more polluting during intermediary development stages, it does provide evidence that countries become more heterogeneous in their emission intensities as they develop, later re-converging to lower emission intensities at higher HDI levels. Learning rates also indicate heterogeneity among developing countries and relative convergence among developed countries. Given the heterogeneity of development paths among countries, the experiences of those which are managing to develop at low carbon intensities can prove valuable examples for ongoing efforts in climate change mitigation, especially in the developing world.

F64|The United States and the Arab Spring|This article reveals, by studying correlative relationships between US regime support and regime properties, that the US foreign policy in the Middle East has traditionally helped governments to limit the political participation of Islamists, communists, enemies of Israel and populations that could be hostile to the US oil interests. This way the US economic and strategic security interests have contributed to human insecurity in the region. With the exception of the last interest, the US has relaxed its support for repression of the above-mentioned groups. This seems to be one of the international factors that made the Arab Spring possible.
F64|"A Review of ""Human Security in World Affairs: Problems and Opportunities"""|While security of our hominid encampments and settlements must have been at or near the top of our species priorities since our evolution some several hundred thousand years ago, awareness of the magnitude of our alterations, interactions and impacts on our world is a very recent event. Even more recent is our collective and growing angst over how are species is to secure some sort of permanence on a planet that is ultimately governed by natural forces and is forever changing.
F64|Doing Justice to Human Security: A Textbook in Tune with its Time|I begin this brief review of this important volume with the confession that I have not personally pursued a teaching style that has employed a self-acclaimed textbook for many, many years, preferring to construct courses around monographs, articles and other visual materials. However, were I provided the opportunity to teach a course at the upper division undergraduate level or early gradate level in the subject of human security, this would certainly be the book I would choose (with the caveat introduced below). Alex and Sabina Lautensach have given careful and thoughtful consideration to every aspect of the text: the preface and introduction, written by the editors, lay out both the logic of the text and frame the subject matter that will locate the reader firmly in the midst of the vast challenges that constiÂ­tute the issue of human security. They do so by emÂ­phasizing both the multiple dimensions along which the issue of human security can be located and the inseparable nature of these as they interact with each other in complex ways. In many respects this strikes me as one of the most important contributions to the textâ€”its steady insistence that human security as a construct is in a discursive state of constant emerÂ­gence, such that in some important ways all its varied dimensions insistently co-vary. To make such a claim is in itself dauntingâ€”to demonstrate its validity and mutual engagements through the complex subject matters of its 20 chapters, is a tour de force. Their conclusion is sufficiently rich to stand alone as an illustrative text in other course materials.
F64|The Radicalisation of Prison Inmates: A Review of the Literature on Recruitment, Religion and Prisoner Vulnerability|It should come as no surprise that prisons can become breeding grounds for radicalisation and terrorism as prisons serve as reservoirs for societyâ€™s most dangerous individuals (Useem & Clayton, 2009). Prisons are places of vulnerability and they provide a space where radical and extremist ideologies can flourish. Despite being a popular topic among researchers and policymakers, there still remain significant gaps in our understanding and many unanswered questions. This paper provides a literature review on prisoner radicalisation. It specifically explores the role religion plays in prison and its link to radicalisation, prisoner vulnerability to radicalisation, the radicalisation process, and outlines the current debate as to where terrorist prisoners should be held. This paper concludes by identifying the major gaps in the literature and offering concluding remarks.
F64|Opportunities for the Green Economy in Bulgaria|In the process of searching for new opportunities and models for the development of the Bulgarian economy in the post-crisis period, it has become even more obvious that we need a fundamental change in the existing conceptual framework. The existing model of economic growth, based on conventional manufacturing has to be transformed into a new much more resource-conservation one. Promoting ‘green’ manufacture could be the right response to this new challenge. The economic incentives stimulating towards launching a new model of green new deals aim to promote the creation of new green jobs, to establish energy-efficient production and clean technology. All this requires timely, adequate and responsible government policy. The active intervention of public authority requires a new distribution of the functions and competences between the private and public sectors keeping in mind the lessons learnt from the mistakes and omissions made so far. By analogy, ‘ecological’ capital should be created and developed along with human capital. This capital along with the existing couple of financial capital – new information and communication technologies (NICT) are to become the driving force of a new type of green economic deal. The target of the efficient macroeconomic policy for stimulating the development of green economy should be the establishment of a model of long term eco-friendly production on all markets and at all levels through a set of fiscal and regulatory measures. This new model should aim to accomplish a social benefit in the long term rather than maximizing company profits in the short run.
F64|Exploring Climate Finance Effectiveness|Ensuring that climate finance is used effectively will help to maximise its impact. The effectiveness of climate finance can be defined as the extent to which an activity attains its stated aims. These aims can vary, depending on the source of climate finance and how it is channelled. There are therefore different views on what “effective” climate finance is, as well as on how this effectiveness can be assessed. This paper explores how different communities view climate finance effectiveness; the policies or institutional pre-conditions that facilitate effectiveness; and how effectiveness is currently monitored and evaluated. The paper concludes by discussing the conflicts and trade-offs encountered in assessing effectiveness and a possible way forward in balancing multiple views and priorities. En veillant à ce que le financement climatique soit rationnellement utilisé, on contribuera à maximiser son impact. L’efficacité du financement climatique peut se définir comme étant le degré de réalisation des objectifs déclarés d’une activité donnée, lesquels peuvent varier en fonction de la source et des circuits de financement. Par conséquent, les avis divergent sur ce que signifie un financement climatique « efficace », ainsi que sur la façon dont cette efficacité peut être évaluée. Ce rapport étudie comment différents milieux ou communautés considèrent l’efficacité du financement climatique, ainsi que les politiques ou les préalables institutionnels qui la favorisent et les méthodes actuellement utilisées pour assurer le suivi et l’évaluation de cette efficacité. Il conclut par une analyse des contradictions rencontrées et des arbitrages à opérer lors de l’évaluation de l’efficacité, et propose une voie à suivre pour concilier les multiples points de vue et priorités à considérer.
F64|Measuring Environmental Regulatory Stringency|Researchers have long been interested in whether environmental regulations discourage investment, reduce labour demand, or alter patterns of international trade. But estimating those consequences of regulations requires devising a means of measuring their stringency empirically. While creating such a measure is often portrayed as a data collection problem, we identify four fundamental conceptual obstacles, which we label multidimensionality, simultaneity, industrial composition, and capital vintage. We then describe the long history of attempts to measure environmental regulatory stringency, and assess their relative success in light of those obstacles. Finally, we propose a new measure of stringency that would be based on emissions data and could be constructed separately for different pollutants.
F64|Border Carbon Adjustment and International Trade: A Literature Review|An important source of political opposition to measures aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) arises from concerns over their negative effects on the competitiveness of domestic firms, especially those that are energy-intensive and exposed to competition from foreign producers. Politicians and industry representatives alike fear that imports from countries without similar regulations can gain cost-of-production advantages over domestic goods. With many of the major economies of the world contemplating unilateral action to restrict their carbon emissions (while continuing to pursue co-ordinated multilateral action), the parallel concern of carbon leakage — whereby domestic reductions in emissions are partially or wholly counterbalanced by increased emissions elsewhere in the world — has also arisen. Various adjustments have been proposed, both in the academic literature and in draft climate legislation, including levying a border tax or requiring importers to surrender a quantity of carbon permits. Collectively, these kinds of adjustments are often referred to as border carbon adjustments, or BCAs. This note reviews the existing literature on BCAs and alternatives to BCAs and discusses what various researchers have concluded about the efficacy of BCAs from both a trade and an environmental perspective.
F64|The Incidence of Environmental Taxes on the Economic Competitiveness|This study is focused on the linkage between environmental taxes and economic competitiveness. The performed research has emphasized that the environmental taxes determine additional costs at the level of the economic polluting activities, influencing on competitiveness through price. However, competitiveness is determined by a set of structural factors and it cannot be reduced only to the impact exercised on prices by the environmental policy, by means of the fiscal instrument. In order to see if there is a relation between economic competitiveness and the fiscal instrument used for the implementation of the environmental policies we compared Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) to the value of the fiscal collections derived from the environmental taxes. According to the results, our analysis reflects that the economic competitiveness and environmental taxation at the level of the EU member states doesn’t reflect a direct correlation between them
F64|The distance-based approach to the quantification of the world convergences and imbalances - comparisons across countries and factors|The paper presents a general empirical method of distance-based multifaceted systematic identifying of the positions of countries in relation to inequalities and imbalances. In order to understand the world economic relations in their entirety, we decided to analyze twelve most populous countries and eleven macroeconomic, environmental and demographic indicators relevant to them. Our analysis covering the period 1992-2008 attempts to identify core parts of the global economic system and countries that pose a potential risk of instability.
F64|Environmental Taxation Evolution in Ukraine: Trends, Challenges and Outlook|Recent development trends of environmental taxation in Ukraine in context of the 2011 Tax Reform are analysed. Institutional, fiscal and security challenges for green taxes evolution during economic downturn and recession are summarized. Further modernization outlook for environment-oriented fiscal instruments in Ukraine considering European experience is suggested.
F64|Private Property Rights and Pollution in Emerging Market Economies|I use cross-country panel data to show that strengthening of private property rights protection lowers pollution emission intensity. The finding is robust to the inclusion of many controls and use of different independent variables. This paper provides preliminary empirical evidence for property rights theory of environmental goods, and suggests that completely specifying property rights is an important approach to response to environmental degradation.
F64|Causal Inference and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs): Assessing Whether There Was an Acceleration in MDG Development Indicators Following the MDG Declaration|Background: The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are a set of eight goals and corresponding indicators that were agreed to following the adoption of the United Nations Millennium Declaration in September 2000 by leaders of 189 countries. The goals state specific objectives for the world to accomplish by measuring progress in indicators during the time period from 1990 (ten years before the declaration) to 2015. While monitoring mechanisms have reported the progress towards achieving these goals, there has been little effort to evaluate whether there was a change in the development outcomes associated with the activities initiated by the MDGs. The dearth of evaluations applied to the MDGs may be associated with the lack of a true counterfactual or the challenges with the data quality. Our analysis focused on the questions of whether there was a statistically significant acceleration or deceleration (mathematically defined as an interrupted slope or intercept) for a particular indicator and, if there was one, whether that changepoint occurred before or after 2001. Accelerations occurring in 2000 or earlier cannot be causally associated with the MDG-related activities (since the acceleration predated the declaration) while accelerations after 2000 may logically be associated with MDG-related activities. Method: We applied the standard program evaluation methodology of an interrupted time series to the country level yearly measurements of the MDG indicators as well as a set of control indicators that were not included in the set of MDG indicators (and were not likely to have been directly impacted by MDG-related activities). The modeling technique used was a multiple linear mixed model where we identified the optimal year of the changepoint in the outcome by examining years 1992 to 2008 for all datasets. Analysis was performed separately for IDA-only countries (World Bank 2000 designation) as well as for a broader set of countries consisting of IDA, IBRD and Blend countries. The IDA (International Development Association) focuses on low income countries and the IBRD (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) focuses on middle income countries. The primary data source for the analysis was the World Bank database where the analysis explicitly assumes that the reported data points are accurate. Reported results contain separate analyses for (1) including heavy influence countries and (2) excluding heavy influence countries; thus resulting in four sets of reported analyses as well as a detailed review of the individual MDG indicator. Results: The general result was that there was no trend in statistically significant accelerations in the MDG indicators after 2000. Rather the results for all four sets of reported analysis were consistent in that about half of the MDG indicators exhibited no acceleration or deceleration during the time period from 1992 to 2008 and about one-third exhibited accelerations BEFORE 2001. Contrarily, nearly all of the control indicators had no change (neither acceleration nor deceleration) during the time period. It should be emphasized that the control indicators were identified based on data availability and other control indicators may exist that serve as more appropriate controls. The only MDG indicator that had a statistically significant acceleration in progress in 2001 or after for all four datasets was Indicator 8D (Debt Service). MDG indicators 1B (GDP per person employed), 4A (Infant Mortality Rate), 4A (Under-five mortality rate), and 6A (HIV prevalence among population aged 15-24 years) all had statistically significant accelerations in 2000 or earlier for all four sets of analysis. Discussion: The results may reflect some of the historical nature of the MGDs in that the Millennium Declaration represented a culmination of development agreements and goals that had been established over the preceding years. As such, many of the indicators selected to belong to the MDGs in 2000 had been previously identified in the global development agenda in the 1990s and campaigns to accelerate progress had been initiated before 2000. In fact, when the results of this study have been demonstrated at different United Nations forums, the reaction from seasoned development professionals has consistently been that of affirmation, where the audience generally has indicated that intuitively they would have expected the observed results given their knowledge of how the MDG indicators had been identified. Additionally, the results may be indicative of the impact of long-term broader economic trends where, for example, official development assistance (ODA) comprises only a very minor part of the global economy. Conclusion: In order to ensure ongoing global support for development, especially as the global development community looks beyond 2015 to the post-MDG era, there needs to be careful communication regarding what the MDGs did and did not accomplish. Many of those who are not development professionals have been drawn into the global discussions due to the strong communications support for the Millennium Development Goals. As such, much of the general public expects that an acceleration in progress was triggered following the September 2000 Declaration and the associated increase in ODA. Contrarily, the data show clearly that the activities following the MDG Declaration did not provide an acceleration in most of the development goals. For the subset of MDG indicators that experienced an acceleration, the accelerations tended to occur before the MDG Declaration. This does not preclude the possibility that activities associated with the MDGs helped sustain accelerations that predated the September 2000 MDG Declaration or ward off decelerations. Additionally, this does not preclude the possibility that the MDGS provided an acceleration post-2000 in a subset of countries (i.e. sub-Saharan Africa or heavily ODA dependent countries) but it is important to note that this study examined the broadest question regarding the impact of the MDGs on the entire set of developing countries rather than a selected subset.
F64|Climate Change Creates Trade Opportunity in India|Climate change is an emerging challenge to developing economy like India however it also creates opportunity to grow through climate friendly goods production and new direction of trade. This paper focuses India’s potential export trade in climate friendly goods. The estimated gravity model is defined as the potential trade and potential trade gap is measured as how well a bilateral trade flow performs relative to the mean as predicted by the model. Potential trade gap means that actual trade is less than predicted trade value. It suggests that there is a scope to increase the export of climate friendly goods (CFG) to trading partners. The total estimated CFG export potential trade gap in India is around 6 billion US dollar (USD) in 2008. This study contributes on the empirical measurement of potential trade of climate friendly goods in India. Paper suggests a possible climate smart export-led growth model in India and mitigates climate change problems.
F64|Globální problémy z pohledu environmentální ekonomie<BR>[Global Problems as Seen by Environmental Economics]|"The conventional view of the sustainability of social development is based on the works of the Roman Club, particularly the book ""The Limits to Growth"" by Donella Meadows and her colleagues (1972). In their opinion, the human population and economy are depleting the wealth of the Earth and pollutants and wastes are burdening the environment. However, the concern that mineral resources will be depleted is unsubstantiated. Environmental economics argues that a higher number of people and a higher income make resources scarcer on a short-term basis. For investors and entrepreneurs, higher prices represent an opportunity and an incentive to search for solutions. Many of them will not succeed in this search and they will bear the costs on their own. However, in a free society, the solutions are eventually found. And in the long run, we are better off thanks to the new discoveries than if the original problems had never occurred."
F64|Development Imperatives for the Asian Century|Evidence-based economic policies—pragmatic policies that work—played a major role in Asia’s success in raising its living standards in the last half century. However, growth prospects are now threatened by rising income inequality and environmental degradation if Asia continues on its established growth path. Evidence strongly argues for Asia to broaden its development priorities into a triple bottom line: that is, a focus on growth, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability. The paper focuses on how Asia can manage this ambitious goal. Possible resistance from vested interests is to be anticipated, but pursuing this path could bring large overall gains. The paper looks at how Asian governments and their development partners can make a difference in promoting the three policy objectives. Innovations in governance for better accountability, transparency, and feedback will be necessary for achieving these priorities. Societies in Asia and the international community will also need rigorous evidence and analysis to establish the benefits of this strategy and to make informed policy choices. International financial institutions and the donor community can provide financial lubricants for cooperation, as well as knowledge to help governments counter vested interests and champion regional perspectives on transborder issues. Reversing the negative social and environmental trends has to become a real development priority rather than a mere aspiration. Progress is possible on the three bottom-line goals, but it will require focusing Asia’s vaunted methods of learning and innovation to meet the new challenges.
F64|Does the Environment Responsibility Affect the Management Control System?|The literature suggests a problem emerging between management controls systems with the new responsibilities that companies must take into consideration. This study examines a system design management control tool orientation as behaviors that can overcome the uncertainties related to the environment and register the company in a voluntary approach which takes into account the environmental dimensions. A questionnaire survey sent to 306 Tunisian industrial companies was conducted. The results of the exploratory and confirmatory analysis are required. The results of the principal component factor analysis evidenced by Cronbach's alpha and KMO test, helped to cleanse the items selected from the literature. Similarly, the results of structural equations with indices of structural adjustment and parcimonies have devoted a good quality adjustment. Overall, findings suggest that most of the firm’s environment is uncertain, more tools to include in its environmental dimensions. On the other hand, the voluntary integration of an environmental approach is part of a strategy of cost leadership in the Tunisian industrial companies.
