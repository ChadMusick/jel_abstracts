M51|Fraudulent Financial Reporting and the Consequences for Employees|We examine employment effects, such as wages and employee turnover, before, during, and after periods of fraudulent financial reporting. To analyze these effects, we combine U.S. Census data with SEC enforcement actions against firms with serious misreporting (“fraud”). We find compared to a matched sample that fraud firms’ employee wages decline by 9% and the separation rate is higher by 12% during and after fraud periods while employment growth at fraud firms is positive during fraud periods and negative afterward. We discuss several reasons that plausibly drive these findings. (i) Frauds cause informational opacity, misleading employees to still join or continue to work at the firm. (ii) During fraud, managers overinvest in labor changing employee mix, and after fraud the overemployment is unwound causing effects from displacement. (iii) Fraud is misconduct; association with misconduct can affect workers in the labor market. We explore the heterogeneous effects of fraudulent financial reporting, including thin and thick labor markets, bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy firms, worker movements, pre-fraud wage levels, and period of hire. Negative wage effects are prevalent across these sample cuts, indicating that fraudulent financial reporting appears to create meaningful and negative consequences for employees possibly through channels such as labor market disruptions, punishment, and stigma.
M51|Strategic Investment Decisions in Multi-stage Contests with Heterogeneous Players|We study strategic investment decisions in multi-stage contests with heterogeneous players. Our theoretical model of a round-robin rank-order tournament predicts that players conserve resources in a current contest to spend more in the subsequent contest if the degree of heterogeneity in the current (subsequent) contest is sufficiently large (small). We confirm these predictions using data from German professional soccer, where players are subject to a one-match ban if they accumulate five yellow cards. We find that players with four yellow cards facing the risk of being suspended for the next match are (i) less likely to be fielded when the heterogeneity in the current match increases and (ii) more likely to receive a fifth yellow card in the current match when the heterogeneity in the next match increases or when the heterogeneity in the next match but one (for which they return from their ban) decreases.
M51|Endogenous Maternity Allowances as Exemplified by Academic Promotion Standards|I model the strategic interaction between scientists aiming for promotion and a research institution that seeks a highly productive faculty by setting a maternity allowance in the form of a minimum promotion standard. The model shows that maternity allowances need not derive from moral justice arguments but can emerge endogenously from efficiency considerations. The underlying mechanism rests on the assumption that exceptionally productive female professionals are also exceptionally productive if they choose to become mothers. Even though motherhood temporarily handicaps their productivity, it is exactly this cost of motherhood that signals the mothers’ intrinsic high productivity. I explicitly refer to the academic labor market and use empirical evidence from academia to justify the model’s specification, but the conclusions carry over to promotion decisions at the executive level in most professional lines of occupation.
M51|What Do Employee Referral Programs Do?|Employee referral programs (ERPs) are randomly introduced in a grocery chain. Larger referral bonuses increase referrals and decrease referral quality, though the increase in referrals from having an ERP is modest. However, the overall effect of having an ERP is substantial, reducing attrition by roughly 15% and decreasing firm labor costs by up to almost 3%. This occurs, partly, because referrals stay longer than nonreferrals, but, mainly, because all workers stay longer in treated than controls stores, even among stores where no referrals are made. The most-supported mechanism for these indirect effects is that workers value being involved in hiring.
M51|Gender Quotas in the Boardroom: New Evidence from Germany|We examine the introduction of a gender quota law in Germany, mandating a minimum 30% of the underrepresented gender on the supervisory boards of a particular type of firms. We exploit the fact that Germany has a two-tier corporate system consisting of the affected supervisory boards and unaffected management boards within the same firm. We find a positive effect on the female share on supervisory boards of affected firms, but no effect on presidency of the board or its size. We also study whether the increased female representation has had an effect on the financial performance of the firm and conclude that, unlike some previous studies in other countries, there has not been any negative effect on the profitability of the firm, neither at the time when the law was announced nor when it was passed.
M51|Fraudulent Financial Reporting and the Consequences for Employees|We examine employment effects, such as wages and employee turnover, before, during, and after periods of fraudulent financial reporting. To analyze these effects, we combine U.S. Census data with SEC enforcement actions against firms with serious misreporting (â€œfraudâ€ ). We find compared to a matched sample that fraud firmsâ€™ employee wages decline by 9% and the separation rate is higher by 12% during and after fraud periods while employment growth at fraud firms is positive during fraud periods and negative afterward. We discuss several reasons that plausibly drive these findings. (i) Frauds cause informational opacity, misleading employees to still join or continue to work at the firm. (ii) During fraud, managers overinvest in labor changing employee mix, and after fraud the overemployment is unwound causing effects from displacement. (iii) Fraud is misconduct; association with misconduct can affect workers in the labor market. We explore the heterogeneous effects of fraudulent financial reporting, including thin and thick labor markets, bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy firms, worker movements, pre-fraud wage levels, and period of hire. Negative wage effects are prevalent across these sample cuts, indicating that fraudulent financial reporting appears to create meaningful and negative consequences for employees possibly through channels such as labor market disruptions, punishment, and stigma.
M51|Responding to Regulation: The Effects of Changes in Mandatory Retirement Laws on Firm-Provided Incentives|The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1978 expanded employee age protections to age 70, making the widespread practice by U.S. firms of mandating retirement at age 65 illegal. Building on the work of Lazear (1979), we propose that the law change not only weakened the long-term employment contract, but also contributed to the rise in pay-for-performance incentives. We model the firm's choice between offering long-term incentive contracts with low monitoring requirements and pay-for-performance (PFP) contracts with high monitoring requirements, showing how the law change increased the relative attractiveness of PFP contracts. We test the model's predictions using data from the Baker-Gibbs-Holmstrom firm, evaluating the effect of the law change on the slope of the age-pay profile, turnover rates, and the sensitivity of pay to performance. Further, we find direct evidence of strategic response to the law change by the firm, including the introduction of bonus payments, change in performance management system, and increase in the proportion of top managers. The setting also provides an opportunity to empirically investigate how firms navigate career incentives for employees.
M51|The Effect of Employment Protection on Firms' Worker Selection|To estimate the causal effect of employment protection on firms' worker selection, we study a policy change that reduced dismissal costs for the employers of over a tenth of Sweden's workforce. Our difference-in-differences analysis of firms' hiring uses individual ability measures including estimated worker fixed effects and cognitive test scores. We find that the reform reduced minimum hire quality by 5% of a standard deviation, half of which we can attribute to firms' hiring becoming more selective. Our results help discriminate between existing theories, supporting the prediction that firms shift their hiring standards in response to changes in dismissal costs.
M51|Does Employing Older Workers Affect Workplace Performance?|Focusing on private sector workplaces in Britain, we investigate whether the employment of older workers has implications for workplace performance. We find no significant association between changes in the proportion of older workers employed and changes in workplace performance. We find some evidence that workplace labour productivity falls where the proportion of 'middle-aged' workers falls, either due to a rise in the proportion of older or younger workers, but this association does not carry through to financial performance. Overall, the findings suggest that any reluctance on the part of employers to employ greater numbers of older workers may be misplaced.
M51|What Do Employee Referral Programs Do?|Employee referral programs (ERPs) are randomly introduced in a grocery chain. Larger bonuses increase referrals and decrease referral quality, though the increase in referrals is modest. Still, ERPs are highly profitable, partly, because referrals stay longer than non-referrals, but, mainly, because non-referrals stay longer in treated stores than in control stores. In a post-RCT firmwide ERP rollout, referral rates remain low for grocery jobs, but are high for non-grocery jobs, which are perceived as more attractive. Our results (1) are consistent with referral-making being driven by money and altruism toward friends; (2) show that ERPs can have substantial benefits beyond generating referrals. The most-supported mechanism for (2) is that workers value being involved in hiring.
M51|The Impacts of Managerial Autonomy on Firm Outcomes|The allocation of decision rights within organizations influences resource allocation, expansion decisions, and ultimately outcomes. Using a newly constructed dataset, I estimate the effects of an earned autonomy program for State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in India. The program gave managers (the board of directors) of profitable SOEs more autonomy over strategic decisions such as capital expansion and the formation of joint ventures. I find that autonomy allows SOEs to increase their capital stock and form more strategic partnerships which leads to greater sales and profits. I also find that the likelihood that a manager subsequently joins a board of a private firm is greater for managers of those SOEs which were granted autonomy, indicating that career concerns is a consistent explanation for these managerial decisions. Taken together, these results indicate that large gains in SOE performance are possible without privatization (by policies like earned autonomy) and may occur partly through managers' career concerns.
M51|Successful and Dead-end Jobs in a Bureaucracy:Evidence from Japan|This paper develops a novel method that assigns a job a value to capture both the likelihood and speed of promotion from each job to a top executive and applies it to investigate the career paths of bureaucrats in Japan. We find that outwardly similar jobs within the same hierarchical rank, estimated using the standard method in Baker, Gibbs, and Holmstrom (1994), have very different opportunities to be promoted to a top executive. We can also detect frequent real demotions and the presence of early selection (read fast track) of elite bureaucrats unable to be detected through use of hierarchical rank.
M51|Exuberant Proclivity Towards Non-Standard Employment:Evidence from Linked Employer-Employee Data|In most industrialized countries temporary andnon-standard forms of employment (NSFE)have become a pervasive featureof the labor market. However, at the firm level, the diffusion of NSFE is less uniform than expected: while some firms exhibit high propensity to use NSFE, others make no use of it.Most conventional explanationsof NSFE use (market uncertainty, production regimes, competitive pressure)fail to account for such heterogeneity. In this article the authors develop an alternative explanationthat links the use of NSFE to firm-specific availability of managerial resources: whenever the latter are relatively scarce, firms make larger use of NSFE to reduce coordination and operating costs. Using a linked employer-employeepanel of manufacturing firms from the Emilia-Romagna region (Italy), the authors provide empirical support for this hypothesis. The result is robust to different estimation strategies and controlling for alternative drivers of NSFE use. This novel finding suggests that, the use of NSFE has strong managerial roots: it allows firms to compensate for firm-specific managerial weaknesses.
M51|Keep Calm and Carry on: Gender Differences in Endurance|We investigate endurance, the capacity to maintain levels of performance through internal rather than external motivation in non-rewarding tasks and over sequences of tasks, through a lab experiment. The significant driver of performance is payment scheme order for women and payment schemes for men. Both women and men respond to social cues, through increased intrinsic motivation (ambition) for women and through extrinsic motivation (competition) for men. We suggest implications for reward schemes in the workplace and for selection into executive positions.
M51|Employment Situation of Person with Disabilities: Case Study in Indonesia|Equality in an employment opportunity or commonly known Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)is still not entirely applicable to a person with disabilities. World Report on Disability record 15,3 percent of the world population is the person with disabilities at 2010. Most of the person with disabilities had not taken part in the mainstream of social activity and mostly relied on social aid, including in Indonesia, where 74,7 percent from the total of a person with disabilities are unemployed. Their living expenses and necessities mostly sustained by their own family, government, or social organization – which had caused a considerable loss for concerned parties. This research intended to discover factors that influence the low employment of a person with disabilities in Indonesia, then aim for the correlations between those factors to the acceptance of employer for a person with disabilities, as well as recommending concerned employer or organizations in supporting employment opportunities for persons with disabilities. Research methodology is done by the survey to an employee about their viewpoint towards workers with disabilities, and data processing is done by SPSS software. Results of research show that education level and design of work procedure significantly affect the low employment rate of workers with disabilities in Indonesia. Further studies and development required to elaborate proper job design for a worker with disabilities, also for developing education system for workers with disabilities.
M51|Managing Small Business Human Resources: An International Approach|While much of our knowledge concerning traditional HR topics (e.g., recruiting, compensation, or performance management) in large firms may also apply in small or emerging organizations, evidence suggests that new ventures are different and that management of people within them may not clearly map to management within larger, more established organizations. This paper reviews extant research on managing people within small and emerging ventures and highlights additional questions that have not yet been addressed. Our review suggests that as scholars, our understanding of the HR issues important to small and emerging firms is limited. While we have begun to understand how these firms should hire, reward, and perhaps even motivate their employees, we lack much of the theory and data necessary to understand how small and emerging firms train their employees, manage their performance, promote or handle organizational change, or respond to potential labor relations and political issues. The existing literature presents an often-confounded relationship between size and age, between the issues important to small firms and the issues important to young ones. Given the potential early HR decisions must impact the organization's downstream success, it is important that we understand how these functional areas of HR (as well as their integration and evolution) affect small and emerging firms, and how the HR decisions made during the formative stages of firm development impact the firm's long-term goals.
M51|The Value of U.S. College Education in Global Labor Markets: Experimental Evidence from China|One million international students study in the U.S. each year and the majority of them compete in global labor markets after graduation. I conduct a large-scale field experiment to study how employers in China value U.S. college education. I sent over 27,000 fictitious online applications to business and computer science jobs in China, randomizing the country of college education. I find that U.S.-educated applicants are on average 18 percent less likely to receive a callback than applicants educated in China, with applicants from very selective U.S. institutions underperforming those from the least selective Chinese institutions. The U.S.-China callback gap is smaller at high-wage jobs, consistent with employers fearing U.S.-educated applicants have better outside options and will be harder to hire and retain. The gap is also smaller at foreign-owned firms, consistent with Chinese-owned firms knowing less about American education. Controlling for high school quality, test scores, or U.S. work experiences does not attenuate the gap, suggesting that it is not driven by employer perceptions of negative selection. A companion employer survey of 260 hiring managers finds consistent and additional supporting evidence for the experimental findings.
M51|LinkedIn(to) Job Opportunities: Experimental Evidence from Job Readiness Training|Online professional networking platforms are widely used and offer the prospect of alleviating labor market frictions. We run the first randomized evaluation of training workseekers to join one of these platforms. Training increases employment at the end of the program from 70 to 77% and this effect persists for at least twelve months. Treatment effects on platform use explain most of the treatment effect on employment. Administrative data suggest that platform use increases employment by providing information to prospective employers and to workseekers. It may also facilitate referrals but does not reduce job search costs or change self-beliefs.
M51|Recruitment marketing: Do we understand what Generation Z expects from its future employers?|"The struggle for finding good employees in Austrian companies is in full swing, and it rests as a big problem on the desks of recruitment marketers and HR departments. Aside from a general shortage due to demographic developments, a new generation of future employees (the ?Z? generation) is growing up, and will be present on the labour markets in a very short time. These young people have been raised under completely different (technological, economic, and social) conditions and, in turn, have different expectations of their future job life and employers. Experience as well as literature on employment related expectations, motivation, and behaviours of Gen Z representatives is scarce, which makes it hard for companies to shape their job offerings in an efficient and effective way, matching the demands of this group. In order to contribute to a better understanding of this phenomenon, a large-scale mixed-method research was undertaken, six focus groups with 43 participants and 550 personal interviews with pupils and young students were conducted in Austria. The motivation was to identify and categorize criteria, which might distinguish an ?attractive from an average job? in the eyes of a Gen X candidate. Factor analysis methods were employed to reveal the categories that matter for this group.The findings suggest that the most important criteria for Gen X members are predominantly ?social?, namely team spirit, working atmosphere, job-life-integration. ?Factual? arguments like salary, job security, career advancement and task diversity only play a secondary role. The HOW is more important than the WHAT. A paradigm shift seems to gain momentum: Currently, most current job descriptions emphasize ""what"" statements: ""What are your tasks??; ""what are opportunities for development?""; or ""what is expected from you?"". However, Generation Z seems to be much more concerned about the ""HOW"": ""How does it feel to work here?""; ""how does my team function?""; ""How will my working day in this company look like?""; or "" how diversified and exciting is my job?"" Salary, job security and a financially stable company are still relevant, but they are not in the foreground. In addition, trends such as home office or high tech equipment of the office appeared to be not too catchy.The paper ends with recommendations for HR-representatives, including a better visualization of team spirit and working atmosphere, raising awareness for the social aspect of work, and establishing tangible elements of ?how it is to work in that company?."
M51|Legitimacy and Incentives in a Labour Relationship|We design a two-stage model where the winner of a tournament becomes the executive of his former opponent. We call procedural legitimacy, the legitimacy an executive obtains if he is promoted through a competition with no unfair treatment. The aim of this paper is to study how effort may paradoxically bolster or undermine this type of legitimacy with respect to technological assumptions. Besides we show that, in bayesian terms, winning the competition reinforces the belief of having been advantaged but it also reinforces the belief that the looser will be disadvantaged in the future and thus be less productive. This will tend to make winning the competition by being advantaged much less profitable. To incentivize more effort during the competition, the firm has to design a procedure where opponents are not evaluated by their peers but by neutral and external people. Thus the competition will not bring information on a potential inequality of treatment in the future. We argue civil servant examination in public administration and human resources departments are designed partially for this reason..
M51|Which kind of ability bolsters legitimacy?|The aim of this paper is to study in a theoretical perspective how the choice of the ability on which an executive is evaluated to be promoted may be a crucial stake. We show that a procedure where an executive is selected on a managerial ability will allow to increase his own wage, compared to a procedure where he needs to demonstrate ability on the same task than his employee. The intuition is that it would neutralize the issue of rivalry with the employee by preserving the self confidence of the employee in spite he has failed at being promoted, making him easier to incentivize. The consequence is that selecting leaders on their ability to outperform their employee will tend to favor the emergence of a leadership culture of humility during the promotion process in a sense that opponents will strategically reduce their performance to preserve the self-confidence of their employee and then make him less costly to incentivize. On the contrary, selecting leaders on managerial ability will favor the emergence of a leadership culture of demonstration of strength.
M51|The Hidden Effect of Meritocratic Promotion Procedure: Experimental Evidence|The aim of this experimental paper is to show how the willingness of an employee to accept inequality of wages between him and his executive will depend on the ability on which the executive is evaluated when he is promoted. This willingness to accept inequality is captured by the minimum wage enough to incentivize to work for his executive. We show that selecting an executive on his ability to outperform his employee at his own task will be counterproductive to make employee accepting inequality of wages. We argue that the efficiency of “merit-based” promotion procedure may be challenged by this result.

M51|Les entreprises de la branche du numérique : modes d'acquisition des compétences par le recrutement et la formation. Une exploitation de l'enquête DEFIS du Céreq|In digital companies, in which value creation and therefore growth are strongly linked to innovation, the acquisition and adaptation of skills appears to be a major challenge for both companies and employees. The ability of companies to integrate into a collective process of innovation is fueled by two complementary dynamics. On the one hand, the recruitment of highly qualified and operational employees, in a competitive context, is necessary. On the other hand, the different types of continuing training (formal, non-formal and informal) are emerging as essential means of adapting the skills and knowledge of employees to the rapidity of technological change. The analysis of the Céreq DEFIS survey illustrates the recruitment and continuing training practices of companies in this branche
M51|Promotions and the Peter Principle|The best worker is not always the best candidate for manager. In these cases, do firms promote the best potential manager or the best worker in her current job? Using microdata on the performance of sales workers at 214 firms, we find evidence consistent with the “Peter Principle,” which predicts that firms prioritize current job performance in promotion decisions at the expense of other observable characteristics that better predict managerial performance. We estimate that the costs of promoting workers with lower managerial potential are high, suggesting either that firms are making inefficient promotion decisions or that the benefits of promotion-based incentives are great enough to justify the costs of managerial mismatch.
M51|Selecting Directors Using Machine Learning|Can an algorithm assist firms in their hiring decisions of corporate directors? This paper proposes a method of selecting boards of directors that relies on machine learning. We develop algorithms with the goal of selecting directors that would be preferred by the shareholders of a particular firm. Using shareholder support for individual directors in subsequent elections and firm profitability as performance measures, we construct algorithms to make out-of-sample predictions of these measures of director performance. We then run tests of the quality of these predictions and show that, when compared with a realistic pool of potential candidates, directors predicted to do poorly by our algorithms indeed rank much lower in performance than directors who were predicted to do well. Deviations from the benchmark provided by the algorithms suggest that firm-selected directors are more likely to be male, have previously held more directorships, have fewer qualifications and larger networks. Machine learning holds promise for understanding the process by which existing governance structures are chosen, and has potential to help real world firms improve their governance.
M51|What Causes Labor Turnover To Vary?|Most turnover reflects churn, where hires replace departures. Churn varies substantially by employer, industry and worker characteristics. For example, leisure and hospitality turnover is more than double that of manufacturing. In the LEHD (QWI) data, permanent employer differences account for 36% of the variation in churn. The cost of churn is proxied by the mean wage and the benefit by the variance in wages. QWI and JOLTS data confirm predictions that high mean wage labor markets experience less churn and high wage-variance ones experience more churn. Additionally, less educated, younger and male workers have higher separation and churn rates.
M51|Capital Structure and a Firm’s Workforce|While businesses require funding to start and grow, they also rely on human capital, which affects how they raise funds. Labor market frictions make financing labor different than financing capital. Unlike capital, labor cannot be owned and can act strategically. Workers face unemployment costs, can negotiate for higher wages, are protected by employment regulations, and face retirement risk. I propose using these frictions as a framework for understanding the unique impact of a firm’s workforce on its capital structure. For instance, high leverage often makes managing labor more difficult by undermining employees’ job security and increasing the need for costly workforce reductions. But firms can also use leverage to their advantage, such as in labor negotiations and defined benefit pensions. This research can help firms account for the needs and management of their workforce when making financing decisions.
M51|Do Male Workers Prefer Male Leaders? An Analysis of Principals' Effects on Teacher Retention|Using a 40-year panel of all public school teachers and principals in New York State, we explore how female principals affect rates of teacher turnover—an important determinant of school quality. We find that male teachers are about 12% more likely to leave their schools when they work under female principals than under male principals. In contrast, we find no such effects for female teachers. Furthermore, when male teachers request transfers, they are more likely to be to schools with male principals. These results suggest that opposition from male subordinates could inhibit female progress in leadership.
M51|Decentralization of Firms in a Country with Weak Institutions: Evidence from Russia|Can decentralization of firms be successful in an environment with weak institutions? Decentralization can do a great job for improving firms’ efficiency and competitiveness by creating opportunities for quicker and more competent decision-making and enhancing motivation of employees. However, decentralization is associated with a substantial increase in agency risk, which is particularly important for firms that operate under weak institutions. Hence, the popular belief is that in countries with weak institutions, firms are unable to successfully decentralize. In this paper, we study evidence from Russian firms to challenge this belief. Following anecdotal evidence and trends observed in the data, we introduce the notions of real decentralization for firms that decentralize decision-making to competitively hired professionals and cautious decentralization for firms that decentralize to people hired through connections. We demonstrate that really decentralized firms are, on average, significantly more likely to invest even in Russian weak institutional conditions. We also show that the gap in investment between really decentralized and other firms declines as corruption grows. Empirical research presented in the paper implies that there still can be significant room for decentralization even in an environment with weak institutions, such as that of Russia. However, as the role of non-market factors (such as corruption) in firms’ prosperity increases, the potential value of decentralization for the firms declines.
M51|Managing Strategic Change and ERP Implementation under Distinctive Learning Styles: Quantitative case of Burberry PLC|This paper examines the effective strategic change management and Enterprise Resource Planning implementation under distinctive learning styles namely; diverging, converging, assembling, and accommodating learning styles through case of Burberry brand at Bicester Village, Cheshire Oaks, and Chatham Place. Additionally, paper investigates the strategic changes and organizational factors in relation with the ability to adopt change and successful ERP implementation. Total 87 respondents were approached through snowball, purposive, and convenience sampling. Findings revealed that accommodating learning style is the most influential learning style that significant positively affects the ERP implementation process. Interestingly, all learning styles (diverging, converging, assimilating, and accommodating) have statistically significant correlation with organizational change process. Additionally, complexity is the most critical organizational component affecting employees' ability to accept changes.
M51|Some Notes on the Concept of Social Capital: A Review of Perspectives, Definitions and Measurement|This paper delves into various perspectives – philosophical, sociological, economic and financial / business or oganisational - in literature on the concept of social capital. It presents a review of the definitions in broad literature categorised under various perspectives. While doing so, the focus ultimately narrowed down to definitions of social capital in business or organisational studies.
M51|Does the utilization of information communication technology promote entrepreneurship: Evidence from rural China|Impacts on the probability of transition to entrepreneurship in rural China associated with the utilization of information communication technology (ICT) are estimated using longitudinal data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) survey. We identify cell phone ownership and Internet use as proxy variables for ICT utilization and find that cell phone ownership and Internet use have positive impacts on entrepreneurship. After controlling for observables and time and regional fixed effects, cell phone users (Internet users) are 2.1 (6.2) percentage points more likely to engage in entrepreneurship than the others. Considering that the average entrepreneurship rate for rural households is only 9.2% in the sample, the influence of cell phone ownership and Internet use are very strong in the economic sense. Our results are robust to unobservable individual characteristics, model misspecification, and reverse causality of entrepreneurship to ICT utilization. Evidence also suggests that social network and information and knowledge acquisition play the mediating roles in the impact of ICT utilization on entrepreneurship.
M51|Gender Bias in Job Referrals: An Experimental Test|Employee referral programs, while efficient for the employer, have been shown to amplify sex-based occupational segregation in the labour markets. We present evidence from a laboratory experiment designed to shed light on same-gender bias in job referrals within gender-balanced networks. Our data suggest that women tend to favor women in their referral choice, whereas men do not attach much importance to the gender of potential candidates. Our experimental design allows us to disentangle between statistical discrimination, preferences, and pure same-gender bias. Our findings add to the existing literature by highlighting that gendered networks alone do not explain the observed gender homophily in referred-referrer pairs.
M51|Modelowanie AHP wyboru menadżera ds. integracji organizacyjnej w procesie fuzji przedsiębiorstw w kontekście teorii struktury rozwoju przywództwa<BR>[Choosing the merger’s organizational integration manager via AHP modeling of Leadership Development Framework]|Objective: elaboration of a decision-making model for choosing the organizational integration manager in the process of companies’ merger. Research Design & Methods: Analytic Hierarchy Process has been employed for model designing. Decision criteria came from a literature analysis on mergers and acquisitions. Decision alternatives derive from the modified Leadership Development Framework by Torbert & Cook-Greuter. Assessments of relevance of decision-making criteria have been acquired from carefully selected experts in mergers and acquisitions. Findings: research resulted in a decision-making model that proved that the possibly optimal efficiency of managing the organizational integration stage should be attributed to the Achiever leadership level. Implications & Recommendations: the model can be used in praxis for choosing managers, whenever their field of expertise is not the unique selection criterion. Contribution & Value Added: the application of a multicriteria decision-making model allows a wider perspective on managerial personnel selection for precisely defined managerial tasks – incorporating the candidate’s personality as one of the decision-making factors.
M51|Challenges Associated with Records Management in Sunyani Technical University|The paper investigate the challenges of record management in Sunyani Technical University using standard Ordinary Least Square method (OLS), One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and the central tendency (Mean). The findings of the study show that record management in the institution is challenged by improper records management; inadequate proper security for records; inadequate professionally trained records managers; there are inadequate resources to facilitate proper records management practices in the institution; insufficient space for records management; misplacement of vital records in the institution; loss of vital records in the institution; inadequate computer terminals; lack of record keeping policy; lack of record retention; lack of disposition schedule in the institution; ineffective means of retrieving record; improper records management in the institution. The managements of the institution should consider the findings of the study and address these challenges for proper record management and the benefits associated with such benefits.
M51|The analysis of the influence of motivation, competence, and incentive toward employee performance at pt Sianjur resort, a housing developer of Oma Deli Medan, Indonesia|This research aims to find out the influence of motivation, competence, and incentive variables toward employee performance. Population of this research is all employees of PT. Sianjur Resort, Medan, Indonesia that is, 37 people. The sample is selected using total population sampling method. The data is collected using questionnaires, while it is analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis. The research results prove that motivation, competence, and incentive simultaneously give significant influence toward employee performance. Motivation, competence, and incentive partially give significant influence toward employee performance. It is recommended that PT. Sianjur Resort pay more attention to aspects that can increase employee performance such as giving incentive regularly and fairly so that there is no negative perception among employees about discriminative behaviour by the employer in term of giving incentive. It is also suggested that PT. Sianjur Resort’s employees increase their performance based on motivation, competence, and incentive that have been given, such as increasing self-competence without waiting for the command from the employer, so self-performance can be more increased.
M51|Study on the effect of leadership style, reward systems, and working conditions on employee work performance (case study of the state plantation of Merbau Pagar, Indonesia)|The purpose of this study was to observe the influence of leadership style, reward system, working conditions on the work performance of employees of The State Plantation of Merbau Pagar, Indonesia. The samples obtained were 105 respondents, according to the above objectives, this study was formulated using respondent testing, hypothesis testing and questionnaire testing. Data collection techniques used in this study consisted of observations, interviews (interviews), questionnaires and documentation studies in the form of primary and secondary data. To facilitate problem solving, this research was carried out using a linear regression analysis method with the help of SPSS 23. The results of the study showed that, 1) Simultaneously leadership style, reward system and working conditions significantly influence work performance, 2) partially each each factor of the leadership style variable, reward system and working conditions have a significant effect on Work performance, 3) the results of the partial regression analysis indicate that the value of the working conditions factor is the most dominant factor in Work Performance.
M51|Does uncertainty affect real activity? Evidence from state-level| We use variation in the effect of US-wide or global uncertainty on state-level uncertainty to identify the impact of this shock on real activity. We nd that increases in uncertainty do have an adverse impact on real income, employment and unemployment. Thus, uncertainty shocks can be a source of economic fluctuations.
M51|How to Sell Jobs| Profit-maximizing firms should fill job positions at the lowest possible cost. Because employees may have preferences over the attributes of their jobs, we can view this problem as one of finding the optimal way to sell job attributes to potential employees. In this paper, we characterize the optimal mechanism by which a firm can sell jobs with desirable attributes. This mechanism is implemented by offering employees a long-term employment contract in which firms create a number of low-quality job positions and offer them to young employees, while only a subset of these employees are promoted to a desirable job. In contrast to the traditional compensating differentials framework, job desirability and wages are positively related in the optimal contract. Our analysis provides a novel framework for thinking about a number of phenomena, such as the span of control, inequality within and between generations, and the effect of competition on employment and wages.
M51|Teacher Screening, On the Job Evaluations and Performancee|I study the relationship between systematic and complementary screening and on-the-job teacher evaluations by their hierarchy, and teacher performance in secondary school. Using comprehensive French administrative data, I exploit within student across topics variations and I find that the classroom observation grade is the only evaluation grade significantly related to teacher performance. I then investigate whether the classroom observation has an impact on teacher performance and behaviour during the year of evaluation and in subsequent years. An event study shows that the classroom observation has no statistically significant impact on student achievement. I find that teachers are more absent during the months following the evaluation, suggesting that this evaluation provokes a temporary change in teacher behaviour.
M51|Current trends of employers? brands and strategies to improve the attractiveness of employers|The article deals with the attitude of HR specialists to current HR trends. It addresses the question of building an employer's brand as a competitive advantage in the labor market. Companies have begun or are slowly starting to deal with the Employer Branding concept. They do not want to leave anything to chance and want to manage their business with a long-term perspective. With a long-term perspective which helps firms to promote themselves on the external labor market in front of potential candidates and on the internal labor market in front of their own employees. This promotion must be able to address, attract, retain and motivate talented and qualified employees and ensure the engagement of their own employees. It is and will be a major challenge in recent years. Employer brand should serve as a useful organizational framework for strategic human resources management.For the purpose of these findings, an online survey is conducted every year, involving HR specialists. Research was conducted in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. The analyzes of individual years were evaluated and the results are compared on a year-to-year basis. The results show four main recommendations for companies operating in the Czech Republic.

M51|Careers within Firms: Occupational Mobility Over the Lifecycle|With falling labor market dynamism in the United States, opportunities within firms take on increasing importance in young workers’ career progression. Developing a variety of occupational ranking metrics, I show that occupational mobility within firms follows a standard lifecycle pattern in which the frequency, distance, and wage return from mobility fall with age. However, when upward and downward mobility are considered separately, the distance of moves increases over the lifecycle. Thus, while young workers make the smallest distance occupational moves up and down, they have the largest wage gains and losses associated with these moves. I find that wage growth for young workers deteriorated substantially in the first decade of the 2000s, primarily driven by a reduction in wage growth within firms, whereas mid‐career workers have experienced no such change. I argue this is most likely driven by the dramatic fall in employer‐to‐employer mobility for young workers since the early 2000s. Encouragingly, wage growth has improved markedly for young workers since 2012.
M51|Do Startups Provide Employment Opportunities for Disadvantaged Workers?|This paper analyzes whether startups offer job opportunities to workers potentially facing labor market problems. It compares the hiring patterns of startups and incumbents in the period 2003 to 2014 using administrative linked employer-employee data for Germany that allow to take the complete employment biographies of newly hired workers into account. The results indicate that young plants are more likely than incumbents to hire older and foreign applicants as well as workers who have instable employment biographies, come from unemployment or outside the labor force, or were affected by a plant closure. However, an analysis of entry wages reveals that disadvantageous worker characteristics come along with higher wage penalties in startups than in incumbents. Therefore, even if startups provide employment opportunities for certain groups of disadvantaged workers, the quality of these jobs in terms of initial remuneration seems to be low.
M51|Kritische Anmerkungen zum Umgang mit Langzeitarbeitslosigkeit: Vorbeugen ist besser als Heilen!|"Programme zur Bekämpfung von Langzeitarbeitslosigkeit wie das ""Teilhabechancengesetz"" setzen systematisch zu spät an. Sie sind primär kurativ ausgerichtet und vernachlässigen komplett eine prophylaktische Komponente. Dies begünstigt die Entstehung zusätzlicher Vermittlungshemmnisse während der Arbeitslosigkeit und senkt die Qualität des verfügbaren Arbeitskräftepotenzials. Erforderlich sind daher schon zu Beginn der Arbeitslosigkeit präventive Aktivitäten der Unternehmen und der Arbeitsagenturen. Diese müssen die Erkenntnisse der Psychologischen Arbeitslosenforschung nutzen und sollen typische Belastungswirkungen der Arbeitslosigkeit im Vorfeld eindämmen: Zerfall von Zeitstrukturen, Erosion von Selbstwert und Sozialkompetenz, Verschlechterung der physischen und psychischen Gesundheit. Ein wichtiger instrumenteller Ansatz besteht im flächendeckenden Einsatz von Outplacementmaßnahmen bei jedem Arbeitsplatzverlust."
M51|Fachkräftemangel in der Pflege: Kritische Situationsbewertung und Skizzierung einer Handlungsalternative|Das Bundeskabinett hat am 01.08.2018 das Pflegepersonal-Stärkungsgesetz beschlossen. Unter anderem ist darin die Einstellung von 13.000 zusätzlichen Pflegefachkräften vorgesehen. Angesichts der derzeitigen Mangelsituation in diesem Berufsfeld bestehen starke Zweifel, ob diese Stellen adäquat besetzt werden können. Zukunftsprojektionen für das Jahr 2030 zeigen, dass sich die Pflegekraftlücke noch deutlich vergrößern wird. Auch der Zugriff auf bislang unerschlossene Arbeitskräftepotenziale wird zur Schließung nicht ausreichend sein. Die soziale Dramatik dieses Problems verbietet eine abwartende Haltung. Bisher beschlossene Maßnahmen sind zu kleinteilig und zu reaktiv angelegt. Es sind kurzfristig Handlungen erforderlich, die einen aktiven Lösungsbeitrag in einer substanziellen Größenordnung leisten. Vorgeschlagen wird in einem stark fokussierten Handlungsansatz die Errichtung einer groß dimensionierten Pflegefachschule (10.000 Plätze) in einem Drittland. Es wird ein begründeter Kriterienkatalog für die Auswahl geeigneter Länder vorgestellt. Als potenziell geeignetes Land wird Vietnam diskutiert.
M51|Deferred-Compensation-Modelle: Ersatz für eine konventionelle betriebliche Altersversorgung nach dem Betriebsrentengesetz?|In Zeiten von wirtschaftlichen Hochphasen wird das Angebot an qualifizierten Mitarbeiter zunehmend knapp und der Wettbewerb um die Ressource Arbeitnehmer immer ausgeprägter. Im Rahmen des Aufsatzes sollte daher die Frage geklärt werden, ob Deferred-Compensation-Modelle einen Ersatz für eine konventionelle betriebliche Altersversorgung nach dem Betriebsrentengesetz darstellen können. Hierzu kann festgehalten werden, dass Deferred-Compensation-Modelle sowohl aus zivil- und arbeitsrechtlicher, handels- und steuerbilanzieller, sowie sozialversicherungs- und insolvenzrechtlicher Sicht in Deutschland als Mitarbeiterbindungsinstrumentarium eingesetzt werden können. Aufgrund der frei gestaltbaren Unverfallbarkeitsfristen kann bei der Ausgestaltung derartiger Modelle aus Sicht der Autoren mindestens eine genauso starke Mitarbeiterbindung erzielt werden als bei betrieblichen Zusatzrenten, die unter das Betriebsrentengesetz fallen.
M51|Welche Kriterien befördern den Aufstieg auf internen Karriereleitern? Eine empirische Untersuchung auf Basis des IW-Personalpanels|Eine Auswertung der 16ten Welle des IW-Personalpanels aus dem Jahr 2017 dokumentiert die Verbreitung von internen Karriereleitern. In fast jedem zweiten Unternehmen wurden die zuletzt vakanten Führungspositionen ausschließlich aus den eigenen Reihen besetzt. In weiteren drei von zehn Betrieben fiel die Wahl neben internen auch auf externe Kandidaten. Besonders Unternehmen mit 250 und mehr Beschäftigten nutzen ihre internen Arbeitsmärkte zur Auswahl von Führungskräften - nur lediglich 3 Prozent der großen Unternehmen besetzen Führungspositionen ausschließlich extern. Für drei Viertel der Unternehmen sind die persönlichen und die fachlichen Kompetenzen sehr wichtige Auswahlkriterien für die Besetzung von Führungspositionen. Die bisher erbrachten Leistungen haben für 55 Prozent ein sehr hohes Gewicht bei der Besetzungsentscheidung. In vier von zehn Unternehmen sind Kompetenzen und bisherige Leistungen gleichermaßen von hoher Bedeutung. In größeren Unternehmen, in denen Führungskräfte häufiger reine Managementaufgaben wahrnehmen, sind persönliche Kompetenzen wie die Kommunikationsfähigkeit oder Durchsetzungsstärke deutlich häufiger für die Beförderungsentscheidungen sehr wichtig. In kleinen Unternehmen, in denen Führungskräfte stärker operativ eingebunden sind, ist dagegen die fachliche Kompetenz wichtiger als in den großen Unternehmen. [...]
M51|Frauen in Führungspositionen: Empirische Befunde auf Basis des IW-Personalpanels 2017|Seit langer Zeit wird in der Öffentlichkeit kontrovers über die Vertretung von Frauen in Führungspositionen diskutiert. Die vorliegende IW-Studie untersucht, welche Faktoren einen Einfluss auf die Vertretung von Frauen in Führungspositionen in deutschen Unternehmen haben. Die repräsentativen Daten des IW Personalpanels aus dem Frühjahr 2017 zeigen, dass der Anteil von Frauen unter den Führungskräften und ihr Anteil unter den Bewerbungen um vakante Führungspositionen nah beieinander liegen und im Durchschnitt rund 29 bzw. 32 Prozent betragen. In der Metall- und Elektro-Industrie sind im Durchschnitt unter den Führungskräften sogar anteilig mehr Frauen zu finden als unter den Bewerbungen um vakante Führungspositionen. Die Befunde leisten damit einen wichtigen Beitrag für die Frage, inwiefern Frauen in Leitungsfunktionen in einem angemessenen Umfang repräsentiert sind. Die Kritik an vermeintlich zu wenig ambitionierten Zielquoten in Unternehmen, die unter die Selbstverpflichtung des Gesetzes zur angemessenen Teilhabe von Frauen und Männern an Führungspositionen fallen, läuft ins Leere, wenn sich relativ wenige Frauen für Führungspositionen bewerben. Grundsätzlich ist der Anteil weiblicher Führungskräfte zwar auch dort besonders groß, wo der Frauenanteil unter den Belegschaftsangehörigen hoch ausfällt. Allerdings weicht in Unternehmen mit einem überdurchschnittlichen Frauenanteil unter den Beschäftigten tendenziell die Quote weiblicher Führungskräfte von dem Anteil der Frauen an den Bewerbungen um Führungspositionen am stärksten ab. Die multivariaten Auswertungen bestätigen zudem, dass der Anteil von Frauen an den Bewerbungen für Führungspositionen und ihr Anteil unter den Beschäftigten eines Unternehmens in einem signifikanten Zusammenhang mit dem Frauenanteil in Führungspositionen stehen. Insofern dürften interne gegenüber externen Kandidatinnen stärker in den Blick geraten, wenn der Frauenanteil unter den Beschäftigten im eigenen Unternehmen höher ausfällt (home bias). Führung in Teilzeit korreliert ebenfalls signifikant positiv mit dem Frauenanteil in Leitungsfunktionen. Andere Unternehmensmerkmale, die - wie zum Beispiel die Branche, Unternehmensgröße oder das Vorhandensein einer betrieblichen Interessenvertretung - auch in der öffentlichen De-batte häufig adressiert werden, stehen hingegen mit dem Ausmaß der Vertretung von Frauen in Führungspositionen nicht in einem erkennbaren Zusammenhang.
M51|Identifying leadership skills required in the digital age|Is leadership changing in an increasingly digitalised work environment? This question arises in corporate practice, societal debates, and in business management research. The evolution of digital technologies changes working environments considerably and creates new challenges for executives. So far, however, only little research has been conducted on how these challenges and technology-driven changes are associated with altered requirements for the skill set needed by executives. In this paper we bridge that gap by applying a three-stage research design. First, we develop a novel conceptual framework in which we categorise leadership skills and associate them with tasks, management level, and leadership experience. Building on this, we conduct semi-structured interviews with executives and systematically investigate job advertisements at the management level. Our interview results show that communication skills, subject-specific knowledge, self-organisation skills, and self-reflection skills are considered particularly relevant in times of rapid technology-driven change. Furthermore, many interview participants identify empathy and an open-mindedness towards the new as crucial personal traits. Our job advertisement analysis further reveals that executives need to be able to speak English, have IT skills, and be flexible, motivated, and stress tolerant.
M51|Economic Policy Uncertainty in Turkey|Uncertainty over economic policy plays a key role in economic outcomes. But evidence and quantification for emerging markets are elusive because of measurement and reverse causality issues. In this paper, we construct a news-based economic policy uncertainty (EPU) index for Turkey and assess how it affects Turkish firms. To disentangle the issues of endogeneity and reverse causality, we use a difference-in-differences approach, exploiting the fact that firms with a high share of irreversible investment are more exposed to policy uncertainty. In sectors with large irreversible investment EPU has a greater effect on growth, investment, and leverage. The results are robust to different definitions of investment irreversibility, lag structure, and selection of sectors.
M51|Selecting Directors Using Machine Learning|Can algorithms assist firms in their decisions on nominating corporate directors? We construct algorithms to make out-of-sample predictions of director performance. Tests of the quality of these predictions show that directors predicted to do poorly indeed do poorly compared to a realistic pool of candidates. Predictably poor performing directors are more likely to be male, have more past and current directorships, fewer qualifications, and larger networks than the directors the algorithm would recommend in their place. Machine learning holds promise for understanding the process by which governance structures are chosen, and has potential to help real-world firms improve their governance.

M51|What is the Cost of Privatization for Workers?|The world is in the midst of a new wave of privatization, with record dollar amounts raised in both developed and developing countries. Using rich Swedish registry data covering two decades from the mid-1990s, we show that privatizations increased unemployment incidence by almost a fifth, and duration by a quarter, relative to peers who remained employed by a state-owned enterprise. This led to almost one million extra days of unemployment for the workers affected. Wages and labor force participation remain unchanged. Furthermore, we show that privatizations have been costly for workers, and therefore for society, only if they took place during recessions. These results shed new light on the welfare costs of privatization and how they can be mitigated.
M51|Cultural diversity and employment growth: Moderating effect of the recent global financial crisis|This article analyses the effect of cultural diversity on employment growth, considering the recent global financial crisis (GFC) as a moderating factor. In doing so, we developed competing hypotheses based on Blauâ€™s theory of heterogeneity versus an alternative perspective which combines the resource-based view (RBV) with social identity theory (SIT). We empirically test such theories using a unique longitudinal dataset comprising the population of all firms in Sweden between 2003 and 2012. We find support for the latter hypothesis, that is, the relationship between cultural diversity and employment growth is inverted U-shaped, which is even more pronounced during/after the GFC. We discussed the implications of these findings for other contexts. JEL Classification: M14 , M51 , E24 , G01

M51|Tertiary education expansion and task demand: Does a rising tide lift all boats?|We examine how the establishment of Universities of Applied Sciences (UAS) in Switzerland affects the jobs of not only UAS graduates but also middle-skilled workers with vocational degrees, for whom such tertiary education expansion may crowd out skilled tasks or elevate the task content. Applying machine-learning methods to job ad data, we analyze task content before and after the educational expansion, finding that in affected regions the tasks of both groups contain more R&D and become more like those of academic graduates. UAS graduates build a bridge between academic graduates and middle-skilled workers, facilitating the integration of middle-skilled workers into R&D tasks.

M51|Adoption of High Performance Work Organization, trade unions and employment redundancy in India|Following Osterman’s research framework of High Performance Work Organizations (HPWOs), the author, using his data sets from the three surveys conducted in India in 2001 and in 2011-2012, examined the adoption and diffusion of HPWOs in India and the factors behind them. It was found that HPWOs spread in India between 2000 and 2011, showing the regional variations in the diffusion and the contributing factors behind the adoption. The opposition of the trade unions against the HPWOs would become less significant once a single HPWO practice was introduced in the workplace. While the HPWOs did not show any significant association, the analysis suggests that trade unions affect managerial decisions to a greater degree than India’s restrictive labor law against employment downsizing.
M51|Gender Differences in Accepting and Receiving Requests for Tasks with Low Promotability|Gender differences in task allocations may sustain vertical gender segregation in labor markets. We examine the allocation of a task that everyone prefers be completed by someone else (writing a report, serving on a committee, etc.) and find evidence that women, more than men, volunteer, are asked to volunteer, and accept requests to volunteer for such tasks. Beliefs that women, more than men, say yes to tasks with low promotability appear as an important driver of these differences. If women hold tasks that are less promotable than those held by men, then women will progress more slowly in organizations.
M51|Promotion through Connections: Favors or Information?|Connections appear to be helpful in many contexts such as obtaining a job, a promotion, a grant, a loan or publishing a paper. This may be due to favoritism or to information conveyed by connections. Attempts at identifying both effects have relied on measures of true quality, generally built from data collected long after promotion. This empirical strategy faces important limitations. Building on earlier work on discrimination, we propose a new method to identify favors and information from classical data collected at time of promotion. Under natural assumptions, we show that promotion decisions look more random for connected candidates, due to the information channel. We obtain new identification results and show how probit models with heteroscedasticity can be used to estimate the strength of the two effects. We apply our method to the data on academic promotions in Spain studied in Zinovyeva & Bagues (2015). We find evidence of both favors and information effects at work. Empirical results are consistent with evidence obtained from quality measures collected five years after promotion.
M51|How Do Employers Use Compensation History?: Evidence from a Field Experiment|We report the results of a field experiment in which treated employers could not observe the compensation history of their job applicants. Treated employers responded by evaluating more applicants, and evaluating those applicants more intensively. They also responded by changing what kind of workers they evaluated: treated employers evaluated workers with 7% lower past average wages and hired workers with 16% lower past average wages. Conditional upon bargaining, workers hired by treated employers struck better wage bargains for themselves. Using a structural model of bidding and hiring, we find that the selection effects we observe would also occur in equilibrium.
M51|Contests as selection mechanisms: The impact of risk aversion|We investigate how individual risk preferences affect the likelihood of selecting the more able contestant within a two-player Tullock contest. Our theoretical model yields two main predictions: First, an increase in the risk aversion of a player worsens her odds unless she already has a sufficiently large advantage. Second, if the prize money is sufficiently large, a less able but less risk averse contestant can achieve an equal or even higher probability of winning than a more able but more risk averse opponent. In a laboratory experiment we confirm both, the non-monotonic impact and the compensating effect of risk aversion on winning probabilities. Our results suggest a novel explanation for the gender gap and the optimality of limited monetary incentives in selection contests.
M51|Justification as a Key Determinant of the Success of Affirmative Action|Quotas are a common but controversial instrument to reduce discrimination. We experimentally analyze the impact of awareness of exisiting discrimination on the effectiveness of quotas. Between treatments, we vary whether or not a quota is implemented and whether or not the affirmed group is discriminated against. We find that quotas lead to a decrease in performance of affirmed individuals. Absent of discrimination, quotas increase sabotage and reduce help received by affirmed individuals. We do not observe these undesirable effects in the presence of discrimination. Thus, perceived justification has a crucial impact on the effect of quota interventions.
M51|Whistle While You Work: Job Insecurity and Older Workers' Mental Health in the United States|We estimate the effects of job insecurity on older workers' health outcomes using an instrumental variables approach which exploits downsizing and state-industry level changes in employment. We provide evidence that job insecurity, as measured by the self-reported probability of job loss, increases stress at work, the risk of clinical depression and lowers self-reported health status. IV estimates are much larger than OLS estimates which we interpret as evidence that job insecurity which is outside the control of workers may have much larger effects on mental health. These findings suggest that employers ought to consider actions to offset the detrimental health effects of reducing personnel on their remaining (older) workers and pay attention at the stress that industry level changes in economic conditions may have on workers.
M51|Performance-Induced CEO Turnover|This paper re-examines the relationship between firm performance and CEO turnover. We do away with the distinction between forced and voluntary turnovers and introduce the concept of performance-induced turnover, defined as turnover that would not have occurred had performance been better. We show that more than 40% of all CEO turnovers are performance induced, and more than 50% of turnovers in the first eight tenure years. This far exceeds the frequency of forced turnovers identified in prior studies. We also find that the effects of performance on turnover are as high in the first five tenure years as in the next five, and that the effects decline only after tenure year 10. Further, CEO departures in all tenure years respond strongly to recent performance but are almost insensitive to performance in the more distant past. These results reject the standard model of CEO turnover in which boards learn from firm performance about constant CEO ability.
M51|Beetles: Biased Promotions and Persistence of False Belief|This paper develops a theory of promotion based on evaluations by the already promoted. The already promoted show some favoritism toward candidates for promotion with similar beliefs, just as beetles are more prone to eat the eggs of other species. With such egg-eating bias, false beliefs may not be eliminated by the promotion system. Our main application is to scientific revolutions: when tenured scientists show favoritism toward candidates for tenure with similar beliefs, science may not converge to the true paradigm. We extend the statistical concept of power to science: the power of the tenure test is the probability (absent any bias) of denying tenure to a scientist who adheres to the false paradigm, just as the power of any statistical test is the probability of rejecting a false null hypothesis. The power of the tenure test depends on the norms regarding the appropriate criteria to use in promotion and the empirical evidence available to apply these criteria. We find that the scientific fields at risk of being captured by false paradigms are those with low power. Another application is to hierarchical organizations: egg-eating bias can result in the capture of the top of organizations by the wrong-minded.
M51|Rules Rather than Discretion: Teacher Hiring and Rent Extraction|"Because of data limitations, there is little empirical research on how firms conduct hiring and the merits of different recruitment strategies. In this paper, I take advantage of a unique setting that allows me to compare the quality (value-added to student achievement) of the teachers hired in a discretionary proce3ss led by the teachers' union in Mexico with those hired on the basis of a screening rule. My results show that the teachers' union selects applicants of a considerably lower quality than those selected using a standardized test, despite the fact that the test has no power to predict teacher quality. I find evidence that the results are not explained by the self-selection of high-quality teachers to follow the test-based process. The combination of these results indicates that the teachers selected through the discretionary process are from the bottom of the distribution of applicant quality. My analysis also reveals that joint committees of state officials and union representatives allocate teachers hired in this way to schools in more ""desirable"" localities, but with similar pre-treatment trends in outcomes. Findings are consistent with standard models of rent extraction."
M51|Top Decision-Making Bodies in Large Companies: Gender Quota Shows Initial Impact on Supervisory Boards ; Executive Board Remains a Male Bastion|The gender quota for supervisory boards that has been mandatory since January 2016 has shown an initial impact. According to DIW Berlin’s Women Executives Barometer, at the end of 2016, there were more women on the supervisory boards of the 106 companies subject to the statutory quota than one year before. Their proportion increased by a solid four percentage points to more than 27 percent. And in the other groups of companies studied, the number of female supervisory board members also rose. However, the calculations based on the top 200 companies also showed that in companies in which the supervisory board already consisted of one-third women, the proportion hardly increased or did not increase at all. The gap between supervisory and executive boards has also widened because growth in the latter has flattened. Women represent only 6,5 percent of the executives at companies subject to the quota — even fewer than in the DAX 30 (11 percent) and the average of the 200 highest performing companies in Germany (eight percent). In companies with government-owned shares, the momentum has decreased significantly — they run the risk of losing their function as role models. To forestall a tightening of the law, companies should ensure more balanced gender representation on all executive levels.
M51|Financial Sector: Banks Fall behind and Now Have a Lower Proportion of Women on Executive and Advisory Boards than Insurance Companies|Women are still in the clear minority among the financial sector’s top decision-making bodies. According to DIW Berlin’s Women Executives Barometer, at the end of 2016, 21 percent of the supervisory and administrative board members of the 100 largest banks were female. The number has stagnated compared to last year. Since 2010, when the discussion about the gender quota for supervisory boards gained momentum, growth has been relatively flat — particularly in comparison to the top 100 companies outside the financial sector. At insurance companies, the proportion of women on supervisory boards was a solid 22 percent (an increase of around three percentage points). This puts insurance companies ahead of banks for the first time since 2006. Also of note: companies whose supervisory boards contained one-third women were not able to increase this number in 2016. Extrapolating from the past decade, supervisory boards of banks would need 50 years for the ratio of women to men to be equal. Gender parity in executive boards would be reached in 80 years. The proportion of women on executive boards remained very low overall as it reached roughly ten percent at insurance companies and eight percent at banks.

In companies with government-owned shares, the momentum has decreased significantly – they run the risk of losing their function as role models. To forestall a tightening of the law, companies should ensure more balanced gender representation on all executive levels. Die seit Januar 2016 verbindliche Geschlechterquote für Aufsichtsräte in Deutschland zeigt eine erste Wirkung: Dem Managerinnen- Barometer des DIW Berlin zufolge waren in den unter die Quotenregelung fallenden 106 Unternehmen Ende 2016 deutlich mehr Frauen in den Kontrollgremien vertreten als ein Jahr zuvor. Ihr Anteil stieg um gut vier Prozentpunkte auf mehr als 27 Prozent. Auch in den anderen Unternehmensgruppen legte der Anteil der Aufsichtsrätinnen zu. Die Berechnungen auf Basis der Top-200-Unternehmen zeigen zudem, dass in Unternehmen, in denen der Aufsichtsrat bereits zu einem Drittel mit Frauen besetzt ist, der Anteil anschließend kaum bis gar nicht mehr steigt. Die Schere zwischen den Aufsichtsräten und Vorständen öffnet sich indes weiter, denn in letzteren ist die Dynamik nach wie vor sehr schwach: In den unter die Quote fallenden Unternehmen sind im Durchschnitt nur 6,5 Prozent Frauen in den Vorstandsetagen vertreten – noch weniger als in den DAX-30 (gut elf Prozent) und den 200 umsatzstärksten Unternehmen (acht Prozent). In den Unternehmen mit Bundesbeteiligung hat sich die Dynamik deutlich abgeschwächt – sie drohen ihre Vorbildfunktion einzubüßen. Um möglichen Gesetzesverschärfungen zuvorzukommen, sollten Unternehmen auf allen Führungsebenen für ein ausgeglicheneres Geschlechterverhältnis sorgen.

Dem Managerinnen-Barometer des DIW Berlin zufolge waren die Aufsichts- und Verwaltungsräte der 100 größten Banken Ende des Jahres 2016 zu gut 21 Prozent mit Frauen besetzt. Damit stagnierte der Anteil gegenüber dem vorangegangenen Jahr. Auffallend ist die geringere Dynamik nach dem Jahr 2010 im Vergleich zu den Top-100-Unternehmen außerhalb der Finanzbranche – damals nahm die Diskussion um die Frauenquote in Aufsichtsräten Fahrt auf. Bei den Versicherungen betrug der Frauenanteil in den Aufsichtsgremien gut 22 Prozent – ein Anstieg um rund drei Prozentpunkte. Erstmals seit Beginn der Erhebung des DIW Berlin im Jahr 2006 lagen die Versicherungen damit vor den Banken. Auffallend ist, dass sich Unternehmen, deren Aufsichtsräte bereits zuvor zu einem Drittel mit Frauen besetzt waren, diesbezüglich im Jahr 2016 tendenziell nicht mehr steigern konnten. Schreibt man die Entwicklung der vergangenen zehn Jahre linear fort, würde es in den Aufsichtsräten der Banken noch ein halbes Jahrhundert dauern, bis Frauen und Männer gleichermaßen vertreten sind. In den Vorständen wäre das sogar erst in über 80 Jahren der Fall. Der Frauenanteil blieb mit fast zehn Prozent bei den Versicherungen und gut acht Prozent bei den Banken insgesamt sehr niedrig.
M51|Managerial Risk Aversion and Accounting Conservatism|This paper investigates the link between one managerial characteristic, the degree of risk aversion, and accounting conservatism. Two models are analyzed, one where the degree of conservatism is chosen by the principal (Board) and accounting information is used for stewardship, and a second where the principal delegates the choice of the degree of conservatism to the manager and accounting information is primarily used for investment efficiency. We show in the first model that higher risk aversion reduces the demand for conservatism from a stewardship point of view. In the second model, we show that delegation is an optimal way for the principal of committing to conservative reporting. Hiring a more risk-averse manager lowers the cost of implementing this conservative reporting. The two models provide opposite predictions for the association between managerial risk aversion and the degree of conservatism. Empirical evidence favors the second model's prediction. The paper suggests that managers with specific characteristics and incentive contracts might be endogenously chosen by the firm to implement an ex-ante optimal degree of conservatism.
M51|Financing constraints and fixed-term employment: Evidence from the 2008-9 financial crisis|This paper investigates the effect of the 2008–9 financial crisis on firms’ employment composition decision when it is possible to choose between permanent and fixed-term workers. We use linked employer-employee data for the universe of private sector firms in Portugal, and exploit precrisis variation in financial vulnerability across industries for identification. We find that firms in more financially constrained industries hire a larger proportion of fixed-term workers with respect to permanent workers after the 2008-9 crisis, relative to less financially vulnerable firms. At the worker-level, workers hired by firms in industries that require significant external financing are more likely to be hired with a fixed-term contract after the crisis than comparable workers hired by other firms. Our results suggest that the crisis induced financially constrained firms to use the more flexible fixed-term contracts more intensively.
M51|Promotion incentives in the public sector: Evidence from Chinese schools|We provide evidence that promotion incentives influence the effort of public employees by studying China's system of promotions for teachers. Predictions from a tournament model of promotion are tested using retrospective panel data on primary and middle school teachers. Consistent with theory, high wage increases for promotion are associated with better performance, teachers increase effort in years leading up to promotion eligibility, and they reduce effort if they are repeatedly passed over for promotion. Evaluation scores are positively associated with teacher time use and with student test scores, diminishing concerns that evaluations are manipulated.
M51|Firm growth, R&D expenditures and exports: An empirical analysis of italian SMEs|We study firms’ export and R&D activities and their effects on employment growth and worker flows for a sample of Italian SMEs operating in the manufacturing industry. After accounting for the under-reporting of R&D in SMEs, our quantile regressions reveal that: (i) R&D is associated with higher employment growth rates, higher hiring rates and lower separation rates; (ii) R&D-induced exports are negatively related to firm employment growth and hirings and positively related to separations; and (iii) pure exports are not a driver of employment growth and worker flows.
M51|Does Random Selection of Commissioners Improve the Quality of Selected Candidates? An Investigation in the Italian Academia|We study a reform occurred in Italy in 2008 in the formation of selection committees for qualifying as university professor. Prior to the reform members of the selection committees were elected by their peers, after the reform they have been randomly drawn. This policy was intended to increase the equality of opportunities of candidates via a reduction of the role played by connections to commissioners. Results show that the reform was ineffective in reducing the probability contribution of being an insider, but attenuated the impact of being connected to a commissioner without significantly raising the impact of scientific quality of candidates on the outcome of competitions. We also find that candidates internalised the changed environment and adapted their strategy of application.
M51|Employment Dynamics in a Signaling Model with Workers' Incentives|"Many firms adjust employment in a ""lumpy"" manner -- infrequently and in large bursts. In this paper, I show that lumpy adjustments can arise from concerns about the incentives of remaining workers. Specifically, I develop a model in which a firm's productivity depends on its workers' effort and workers' income prospects depend on the firm's profitability. I use this model to analyze the consequences of demand shocks that are observed by the firm but not by its workers, who can only try to infer the firm's profitability from its employment decisions. I show that the resulting signaling model has pooling equilibria in which, for small negative shocks, the firm bears the costs of some labor hoarding in order to conceal negative information from workers and thus maintain their incentives for effort. However, if negative shocks accumulate then labor hoarding becomes too costly; at that point the firm drastically reduces employment."

M51|Do Intellectual Capital, Corporate Social Responsibility, and Good Corporate Governance Affect Indonesia’s Mining Companies Value?|"""Objective –The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of Intellectual Capital (IC), Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) disclosure, and Good Corporate Governance (GCG) on the value of mining companies (as measured by Tobin's Q) listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange period 2011-2015. Methodology/Technique – Intellectual capital was measured by Value Added Capital Employed (VACA), Value Added Human Capital (VAHU), and Structural Capital Value Added (STVA). CSR disclosure was measured using Global Reporting Initiative index. GCG was proxied using independent commissioner, managerial ownership, audit committee, and institutional ownership. Empirical analysis was conducted using linear multiple regression analysis. The samples consisted 15 mining firms. Findings –The results showed that VACA, VAHU, and institutional ownership had a positive and significant effect on company value. STVA and independent commissioner have a positive but insignificant effect on company value. Audit committee and managerial ownership have a negative and insignificant effect on company value. Novelty – The study suggests managers to improve the company value by investing IC subcomponents; that is, physical capital and human capital and also add the number of shares held by institutions."""
M51|Evaluation of E-recruitment as a Business Model through Internet of Things Approach|"""Objective – Modern e-businesses are developing rapidly as new modern enterprises; e-business management is an important topic across contemporary management and modern information technology. The purpose of the paper is to investigate e-recruitment based on Business Model Ontology framework, to provide useful implication of e-recruitment as a business model. The aim is to create a usable model for building company’s value added through e-business, helping companies to evaluate contribution of each element added to the model. Methodology/Technique – The research done by reviewing previous studies in related areas. Findings – E-recruitment`s effect on initial job-seeker interest is limited, decreasing the potential possibility to attract a job-seeker and receive positive feedback. Information interaction plays a certain role in job seeker's attitude and job acceptance decisions, but the motivation-enhancing possibilities are likely to be less effective than traditional ones Novelty – The proposed model of study will provide a practical framework for business users."""
M51|Not in My Community: Social Pressure and the Geography of Dismissals|We investigate the impact of local social pressure on firms' firing decisions. Using linked employer-employee data, we show that secondary establishments located further away from headquarters have higher dismissal rates than those located closer. The effect of distance on dismissals is stronger, the greater the visibility of the firm in the local community of its headquarters and the larger the degree of selfishness of that community. We show that these findings can be explained by the social pressure exerted by the communities where firms' headquarters are located, which induces CEOs to refrain from dismissing at short distance from their headquarters.
M51|Disentangling managerial incentives from a dynamic perspective: The role of stock grants|We analyse the optimal contract between a riskâ€ averse manager and the initial shareholders in a twoâ€ period model where the manager's investment effort, carried out in period 1, and his or her current effort, carried out in period 2, both impact the secondâ€ period profit, so that it may be difficult to disentangle the incentives for these two types of effort. We show that stock grants play different roles according to whether the signal of investment effort is less noisy, or noisier, than that of current effort. We determine simultaneously the optimal stock grants and the optimal restrictions on sales of shares.

M51|Promotion through Connections: Favors or Information?|Connections appear to be helpful in many contexts such as obtaining a job, a promotion, a grant, a loan or publishing a paper. This may be due to favoritism or to information conveyed by connections. Attempts at identifying both effects have relied on measures of true quality, generally built from data collected long after promotion. This empirical strategy faces important limitations. Building on earlier work on discrimination, we propose a new method to identify favors and information from classical data collected at time of promotion. Under natural assumptions, we show that promotion decisions look more random for connected candidates, due to the information channel. We obtain new identification results and show how probit models with heteroscedasticity can be used to estimate the strength of the two effects. We apply our method to the data on academic promotions in Spain studied in Zinovyeva & Bagues (2015). We find evidence of both favors and information effects at work. Empirical results are consistent with evidence obtained from quality measures collected five years after promotion.
M51|Gender Quotas in the Board Room and Firm Performance: Evidence from a Credible Threat in Sweden|Board room quotas have recently received an increasing amount of attention. This paper provides novel evidence on firm performance from an exogenous change in female board participation in Sweden. We use the credible threat, aimed at listed firms, of a quota law enacted by the Swedish deputy prime minister as an exogenous variation. The threat caused a substantial and rapid increase in the share of female board members in firms listed on the Stockholm stock exchange. This increase was accompanied by an increase in different measures of firm performance in the same years, which were related to higher sales and lower labor costs.
M51|Communicating Company Innovation Culture: Assessment Through Job Advertisements Analysis|"The paper explores the composition of researchers' skillsets in an innovation-driven environment from the perspective of employers. The authors analyze the relation between skills requirements described in job advertisements for researchers and the presumed innovation culture of companies. The study is based on job advertisements content analysis and in-depth interviews with chiefs of research and development companies. It uses biotechnology industry as an example as it is one of the fastest-growing and innovation-driven sectors globally. Authors used data from Russian, as well as Canadian, UK and USA job search engines to consider international context. Empirical findings demonstrated that skills composition stress on hard skills more frequently and detailed, while soft skills are often a ""must have without saying"". The same is for digital skills that are assumed to be essential in high-tech companies globally and therefore not fully specified in job ads. There is a certain mismatch between skills presented in the ads and articulated in the interviews as employers tend to demonstrate innovation-friendly company culture for possible applicants. The present paper enriches literature on skills assessment, giving comprehensive lists of biotech skills in-demand divided into soft and hard categories. In addition, it provides the new insight into employee skills articulated by the companies as a strong element of organizational innovation climate"
M51|Organizational Concealment: An Incentive of Reducing the Responsibility|We studyworkers’ incentives of reporting problems within an OLG organization consisting of a subordinate and a manager. The subordinate is responsible for reporting a problem, and the manager is responsible for solving the reported problem. The subordinate has an incentive to conceal a detected problem since if he reports it but the manager is too lazy to solve the problem, the responsibility is transferred to the subordinate since he becomes a manager in the next period. We show that concealment is more likely either if subordinates are farsighted or the problem’s growth rate increases over time.
M51|Apprentice Poaching in Regional Labor Markets|"""A number of studies have found that firms provide less training if they are located in regions with strong labor market competition. This finding is usually interpreted as evidence of a higher risk of poaching in these regions. Yet, there is no direct evidence that regional competition is positively correlated with poaching. Building on a recently established approach to ex-post identify poaching of apprenticeship completers, our paper is the first to directly investigate the correlation between regional labor market competition and poaching. Using German administrative data, we find that competition indeed increases training establishments' probability of becoming poaching victims. However, poaching victims do not change their apprenticeship training activity in reaction to past poaching. Instead, our findings indicate that the lower training activity in competitive regions can be attributed to lower retention rates, a less adverse selection, and lower labor and hiring costs of apprenticeship completers hired from rivals.""

M51|Choking under pressure of top performers: Evidence from biathlon competitions|"Psychological pressure affects performance. This is especially true for individuals completing precision tasks in decisive situations, such as assessment tests, job talks, or sports competitions. In this paper, I shed light on detrimental effects of pressure on performance, a phenomenon known as ""choking under pressure"". I analyze a unique setting in which the effect of pressure on performance is naturally observable: Biathlon World Cup competitions. As the last shot in the final bout of shootings is regularly decisive for the victory, pressure is highest on the leader of the competition not to miss this last shot. Using event data from 11 seasons of Biathlon World Cup, I find strong evidence for ""choking under pressure"", implying that especially leaders are more likely to fail decisive shots. Furthermore, taking more time for the last shootings bout leads to a decrease in performance. Finally, I show suggestive evidence for a momentum effect - after missing a shot during the last shooting bout, the probability of missing the last shot decreases."
M51|The Relative Importance of Personal Characteristics for the Hiring of Young Workers|We investigate the relative importance of different personal characteristics for firms' hiring decisions. Our design allows firms to observe potential workers during a long screening period. At the end of that period firms can decide to make job offers, thereby revealing their preferences about workers' personal characteristics. We connect real-world job offers and workers' personal characteristics, both of which are usually unobserved. To investigate the relative importance of various personal characteristics for the likelihood to receive a job offer, we use a unique panel data set of entry-level workers. We find that grades and non-cognitive skills are important for receiving a job offer, with the Big Five Personality traits being the most important predictor. We find no effects for intelligence or economic preferences.
M51|Performance Pay and Applicant Screening|Using German establishment data, we show that the relationship between intensity of individual‐based performance pay and intensity of applicant screening depends on the nature of production. In establishments with increased multitasking, performance pay is positively associated with applicant screening. By contrast, in establishments without increased multitasking, performance pay is negatively associated with applicant screening. We do not find a similar pattern of results for group‐based performance pay or profit‐sharing. Our findings fit the hypothesis that individual‐based performance pay induces a positive self‐sorting of employees if jobs are less multifaceted. In this case, employers with a high intensity of performance pay do not need intensive applicant screening to ensure a high quality of matches between workers and jobs. However, if jobs are more multifaceted, individual‐based performance pay can entail problems of adverse self‐sorting. In order to mitigate or overcome these problems, employers making intensive use of performance pay also screen applicants more intensively.

M51|Employer screening costs, recruiting strategies, and labor market outcomes: An equilibrium analysis of on-campus recruiting|I analyze labor market matching with search and informational frictions, by studying employer recruiting on college campuses. Based on employer and university interviews, I develop a model describing firms’ choice of target campuses. The model predicts that with costly screening, firms concentrate (per student) at selective universities over those where high-quality students are larger in number, but smaller in proportion. Further, recruiting is affected by nearby universities’ selectivity. This prediction has strong support using data from 39 finance and consulting firms and the Baccalaureate and Beyond. For median-selectivity universities, a better regionally-ranked university is twice as likely to attract a consulting firm, and wages are higher by 4%. Halving screening costs, for example through algorithmic screening, structural estimation shows a 27% increase in the proportion of expected hires from universities outside the top selectivity quartile.
M51|Gender Stereotyping and Self-Stereotyping Attitudes: A Large Field Study of Managers|The dearth of women in top managerial positions is characterized by a high persistence and insensitivity to changes and differences in institutions and policies. This suggests it could be caused by slowly changing social norms and attitudes in the labor market, such as gender stereotypes and gender identity. This paper examines gender stereotypes and self-stereotyping in a large cross section of (about 2,970) managers at different job levels in (1,875) Danish private-sector firms. The survey data used contain detailed information about the managers as well as their employers. We find significant gender differences between managers with regard to gender stereotyping attitudes. Male managers on average tend to have stronger gender stereotype views with respect to the role as a successful manager than their female peers. However, female CEOs' gender stereotypes do not differ from their male peers' and have significantly more pronounced masculine stereotypes than female managers at lower levels. Female managers have stronger beliefs in their own managerial abilities regarding feminine skills and weaker beliefs in their masculine skills, whereas the opposite is observed for male managers. Gender stereotypes and self-stereotypes vary across types of managerial employees and firms. Beliefs in own ability could explain at most ten percent of the observed gender differential in C-level executive positions.
M51|Antecedents of Overtime Work: The Case of Junior Academics|Despite the ongoing public debate about precarious working conditions in academia, there is only little evidence on working hours and overtime work for the group of (non-tenured) junior academics. By using unique longitudinal survey data on the occupational situation and careers of doctoral students and doctorate holders in STEM fields in Germany, we explore potential antecedents of overtime. We find that overtime hours are less pronounced among firm employees holding a doctorate and among postdocs than they are among doctoral students. This result holds in the cross-section and also when examining status changes (from doctoral student to postdoc or to firm employee holding a doctorate) in difference-in-differences estimations. In contrast to firm employees, overtime hours are considerably positively associated with part-time contracts for doctoral students. Furthermore, our results reveal that individuals' career orientation is positively associated with extra hours. In contrast, individuals with family responsibilities and a stronger preference for leisure time spend significantly fewer hours at work.
M51|Clever enough to tell the truth|Abstract We conduct a field experiment on 427 Israeli soldiers who each rolled a six-sided die in private and reported the outcome. For every point reported, the soldier received an additional half-hour early release from the army base on Thursday afternoon. We find that the higher a soldier’s military entrance score, the more honest he is on average. We replicate this finding on a sample of 156 civilians paid in cash for their die reports. Furthermore, the civilian experiments reveal that two measures of cognitive ability predict honesty, whereas general self-report honesty questions and a consistency check among them are of no value. We provide a rationale for the relationship between cognitive ability and honesty and discuss its generalizability.
M51|The value of reference letters|We show that reference letters from former employers alleviate information asymmetries about workers’ skills and improve both match quality and equity in the labor market. A resume audit study finds that using a reference letter in the application increases callbacks by 61%. Women disproportionately benefit. Letters are effective because they provide valuable information about workers’ skills that employers use to select applicants of higher ability. A second experiment, which encourages job seekers to obtain and use a reference letter, finds consistent results. In particular, employment rates for women who obtain letters double, fully closing the gender gap in our sample.
M51|Simultaneous Search and Efficiency of Entry and Search Intensity|We consider a model where firms open vacancies and post and commit to a wage mechanism. Search is costly and workers simultaneously apply to multiple jobs. Firms can be connected to multiple workers and workers to multiple firms. We use a new method to derive the expected maximum number of matches in a large market as a function of the number of applications and market tightness. We also derive the conditions under which firm entry, worker participation, and search intensity are socially efficient. Finally, we show that a sequential auction under incomplete information can establish the social optimum and discuss some alternative mechanisms that can, under complete information of the entire network, also deliver social efficiency.
M51|Whistle While You Work: Job Insecurity and Older Workers’ Mental Health in the United States|We estimate the effects of job insecurity on older workers’ health outcomes using an instrumental variables approach which exploits downsizing and state-industry level changes in employment. We provide evidence that job insecurity, as measured by the self-reported probability of job loss, increases stress at work, the risk of clinical depression and lowers selfreported health status. IV estimates are much larger than OLS estimates which we interpret as evidence that job insecurity which is outside the control of workers may have much larger effects on mental health. These findings suggest that employers ought to consider actions to offset the detrimental health effects of reducing personnel on their remaining (older) workers and pay attention at the stress that industry level changes in economic conditions may have on workers.
M51|The Structural Change And Labour Productivity Of Firms: Do Changes In The Age And Wage Structure Of Employees Matter?|This paper aims to clarify how changes in the age and wage composition of the labour force are related to the productivity of firms over the business cycle. Based on a matched employer-employee database of Estonian firms from 2006–2014, we decompose changes in the labour force and distinguish between hired, separated and staying workers. Considering the age and wage of workers, we link changes in the labour force to changes in productivity. Using fixed effect panel data analysis we indicate that among high-waged employees middle-aged are the most productive, the productivity decreases with age but remains higher for old compared to young. the increase in labour productivity is supported by the decreasing share of employees with the lowest productivity. The share of high-income employees was reduced in the crisis and later mostly low-income employees were hired. In addition, structural changes have accelerated the process of ageing. There are, however, sector-specific differences because in knowledge intensive services, ageing is not as prevalent as in industry. We also show that labour productivity is higher in the youngest quartile than in the oldest quartile of enterprises in all four periods.
M51|Beetles: Biased Promotions and Persistence of False Belief|This paper develops a theory of promotion based on evaluations by the already promoted. The already-promoted show favoritism toward candidates with similar beliefs, just as beetles are more prone to eat the eggs of other species. With such egg-eating bias, false beliefs may not be eliminated by the promotion system. The main application is to scientific revolutions: when tenured scientists show favoritism toward tenure candidates with similar beliefs, science may not converge to the true paradigm. We extend the statistical concept of power to science: the power of the tenure test is the probability (absent any bias) of denying tenure to a scientist who adheres to the false paradigm, just as the power of any statistical test is the probability of rejecting a false null hypothesis. The power of the tenure test depends on the norms regarding the appropriate criteria to use in promotion and the empirical evidence available to apply these criteria. Economics and other social sciences are particularly at risk of capture by false paradigms because they have low power. Another application is to hierarchical organizations.
M51|Allocating Effort and Talent in Professional Labor Markets|In many professional service firms, new associates work long hours while competing in up-or-out promotion contests. Our model explains why. We argue that the productivity of skilled partners in professional service firms (e.g., law, consulting, investment banking, and public accounting) is quite large relative to the productivity of their peers who are competent and experienced but not well suited to the partner role. Therefore, these firms adopt personnel policies that facilitate the identification of new partners. In our model, both heavy workloads and up-or-out rules serve this purpose.
M51|Are CEOs Different? Characteristics of Top Managers|We use a dataset of over 2,600 executive assessments to study thirty individual characteristics of candidates for top executive positions – CEO, CFO, COO and others. We classify the thirty candidate characteristics with four primary factors: general ability, execution vs. interpersonal, charisma vs. analytic, and strategic vs. managerial. CEO candidates tend to score higher on these factors; CFO candidates score lower. Conditional on being a candidate, executives with greater interpersonal skills are more likely to be hired, suggesting that such skills are important in the selection process. Scores on the four factors also predict future career progression. Non-CEO candidates who score higher on the four factors are subsequently more likely to become CEOs. The patterns are qualitatively similar for public, private equity and venture capital owned companies. We do not find economically large differences in the four factors for men and women. Women, however, are subsequently less likely to become CEOs, holding the four factors constant.
M51|On the Economics of Audit Partner Tenure and Rotation: Evidence from PCAOB Data|This paper provides the first partner tenure and rotation analysis for a large cross-section of U.S. publicly listed firms over an extended period. We analyze the effects on audit quality as well as economic tradeoffs related to partner tenure and rotation with respect to audit hours and fees. On average, we find no evidence for audit quality declines over the tenure cycle and little support for fresh-look benefits after rotations. Nevertheless, partner rotations have significant economic consequences. We find increases in audit fees and decreases in audit hours over the tenure cycle, which differ by partner experience, client size, and competitiveness of the local audit market. More generally, our findings are consistent with efforts by the audit firms to minimize disruptions and audit failures around mandatory rotations. We also analyze special circumstances, such as audit firm switches and early partner rotations, and show that they are more disruptive than mandatory rotations, and also more likely to exhibit audit quality effects.
M51|An Empirical Study of Social Skill fs Impact on Career Decision Making|The purpose of this study is to investigate the relation between social skill, career decision making abilities, and career decision making self-efficacy (CDMSE) using statistical analysis.Although prior research discussed whether people can or not decide their own career and its factor that promote career decision making, the relation between social skill, career decision making abilities and CDMSE is rarely investigated. A questionnaire survey of 44 undergraduate students of Japanese national university was conducted. We analyzed the relation quantitively based on Bandura fs self-efficacy theory. We found that social skill promotes career decision making abilities and CDMSE directly and career decision making abilities partially mediate between social skill and CDMSE. Finally, we discussed theoretical and practical implications and addressed future research.
M51|Subjective Appraisals of Employee Potential: Do Gender and Managerial Level Matter?|While a growing number of empirical studies have analyzed gender differences at various career stages, there is a dearth of studies about formal appraisals of men’s and women’s career potential, i.e., their promotability. In this paper, I will empirically analyze whether female employees’ promotability assessments are systematically inferior to their equally qualified male colleagues. In doing so, I use detailed personnel data of a large global German company that has a formal promotability evaluation process in place. I consider a wide range of contextual variables that have been neglected in the past, such as information on employees’ demographic (i.e., gender, age, tenure) and job-related characteristics (i.e., pay grade, working hours, performance assessments), additional information on the employees’ direct supervisors, and the composition of the department. I find women’s likelihood of receiving an evaluation that qualifies them as promotable to be around 5 percentage points lower than for their male counterparts – the probability of receiving an outstanding assessment being only 20 percent per se. The gap is even more pronounced at around the age of 30, i.e., the average childbearing age in Germany. Furthermore, gender gaps persist at managerial levels, which points to the existence of systematic gender differences in formal promotability evaluation processes.
M51|Application of the Principle of Fairness in the Distribution of Rewards: Evidence from Serbia and Bosnia & Herzegovina|In the search for additional data, which would enable the conclusion on the implementation of the principle of fairness in the distribution of rewards as one of the key ethical concepts in relations between employers and employees, a survey was conducted, which entailed the corresponding proportional number of respondents from Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, to enable comparison of results. On the basis of secondary data, this research started from the assumption that the principle of Procedural justice in the distribution of income in Serbia and B&H has been insufficiently applied in practice in organizations in these two countries. It has been assumed that the ownership structure of the company (organization) affects the degree of implementation of the principles of fairness. The aim of this paper is to identify elements of the system of rewards which determine the perception of fairness among employees and to what extent they are implemented in organizations in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In this paper the authors are looking for the identification of elements that form the basis of fairness in the distribution of rewards and their importance for the perception of fairness. Methodologically, the paper is based on the analysis of the existing literature, secondary sources and statistically processed results of the survey conducted in 328 organizations in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The results of this analysis indicate that the elements of fairness in distribution of rewards were neglected in the organizations analyzed in this research. According to the presented data of the research conducted on the sample of 325 respondents in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina hypotheses are confirmed that the principles of procedural justice are not sufficiently applied in organizations in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Their application depends on the form of ownership. Low perception of procedural practice in distribution of rewards may have negative impact on business results, which can be the subject of some future research.

M51|When Vultures Bring Blessings: Employment Growth in Japanese Businesses under Private Equity Ownership|We track the effect of private equity ownership on employment in a methodological setup uniting descriptive analysis with checks for selection effects and causality. Applying this approach to buyout investments in Japan, we find evidence that employment grows significantly under private equity ownership, a finding that is in stark contrast with earlier studies on Anglo-Saxon economies; that the increase is not attributable to selection effects; and that growth rates during the holding period are significantly higher than under the previous ownership. We seek an explanation in the institutional setup and explore the relevance of reputation in transactions with revealed identities.
M51|Favouritism Or Fairness?: A Framed Laboratory Experiment|This paper provides laboratory experimental evidence for prevalence of organizational favouritism. It is significantly found that when subjects where put into a situation where they can offer a job to someone then the choice criteria is based on social ties rather than efficiency. Interestingly, even when subjects had the choice of giving the job to her favourite person, she prefers to give it randomly to anyone from her favoured pool, when her group size is large. Also, socio-economic factors like family structure, family occupation, social connection, caste and political connections are among the important factors in explaining the emergence of favouritism.
M51|An Empirical study of the Role of Demographics in Job Satisfaction of Sunyani Technical University staff|The paper analyses the effects of demographic variables on overall job satisfaction and satisfaction elements for Sunyani Technical University using standard Ordinary Least Square method (OLS). The estimates of the regression analysis indicate that demographic variables have insignificant positive and negative effect on overall job satisfaction. However, the estimates show significant positive and negative effect of demographic variables on some elements of job satisfaction. Managements of academic institutions should take into account the findings of the study to ensure that workers are well satisfied with their job so that productivity will not be affected. Future study should replicate the current study in a comparative study of private and public academic institutions.
M51|"The importance of training programs in the improvement of the performance of employees in the petroleum companies""- Case of Sonatrach company - The Regional Directorate of BERKAOUI (Ouargla- Algeria)"|The training of the workers in the enterprises allows the development in the skills and knowledge of the employees. As the other Enterprises, the training programs in the petroleum companies got a great importance, which became more cleared through this study. Through the case study on Sonatrach subsidiary employees, and based on self-questionnaire our paper aims to analyze the training programs contribution in the improvement of the unit productivity level, and on the upgrading of the profitability and efficiency of the workers. Nevertheless, the importance of the training contribution appears undoubtedly in minimizing the lost days caused by the work accidents, which is a huge costs organization must cover Although the luck in decreasing in the rates of this accidents.
M51|Gender Stereotype in Academia: Evidence from Economics Job Market Rumors Forum|"This paper examines whether people in academia portray and judge women and men differently in everyday ""conversations"" that take place online. I combine methods from text mining, machine learning and econometrics to study the existence and extent of gender stereotyping on the Economics Job Market Rumors forum. I first design a propensity score model to infer the gender a post mainly refers to from text, and simultaneously identify the individual words with the strongest association with gender. The words selected provide a direct look into the gender stereotyped language on this forum. Through a topic analysis of the posts, I find that when women are under discussion, the discourse tends to become significantly less academic or professionally oriented, and more about personal information and physical appearance. Moreover, a panel data analysis reveals the state dependence between the content of posts within a thread. In particular, once women are mentioned in a thread, the topic is likely to shift from academic to personal. Finally, I restrict the analysis to discussions about specific economists, and find that high-profile female economists tend to receive more attention on EJMR than their male counterparts."
M51|The Effectiveness of Promotion Incentives for Public Employees: Evidence from Italian Academia|This paper investigates how promotion incentives affect the productivity of high-skilled public employees. In a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we exploit the three bibliometric thresholds of the 2012 National Scientific Qualification (NSQ), the centralized evaluation procedure awarding the eligibility for career advancements in Italian universities. Specifically, we compare the 2013-2016 research productivity of assistant professors who barely achieve the qualification for associate professor with the productivity of candidates who barely miss it. The former have the incentive to enrich their publication records in order to meet the higher requirements for the full professor qualification by the following round of the NSQ. Conversely, the latter first need to re-apply for the associate professor qualification, thus facing lower promotion thresholds. We find that barely qualified scholars publish significantly more papers – and in journals of comparable quality – than their unsuccessful colleagues. The relationship between the increase in publications and the distance from the expected thresholds for the full professor qualification is inverted-U shaped: promotion incentives are mostly effective when the promotion threshold is neither too difficult nor too easy to meet. Our results emphasize the importance of promotion incentives as an effective tool for public management to enhance the productivity of state personnel. They also provide novel evidence on the responsiveness of scholars to publication-based hiring and promotion schemes.
M51|Outside options and wages: What can we learn from subjective assessments?|Abstract This paper studies the correlates of subjective assessments of how easy it would be for a worker to find another job as good as the present one and how easy it would be for an employer to replace a worker. First, I study the correlates of these two subjective assessments. Second, I study whether respondents who report better chances of reemployment receive higher wages and whether respondents who think they are easy to replace receive lower wages. The results are consistent with the standard job-matching model, which predicts that wages increase with better outside opportunity of the worker and fall with better outside opportunity of the employer.
M51|Political connections and firm operational efficiencies: evidence from a developing country|Abstract This paper investigates the impact of political connections on firm operational efficiencies. We test the political interventions in investment and employment decisions. Our results provide strong support for the presence of investment inefficiencies and excessive employment amongst politically connected firms, whereas the detrimental effect of political interventions is substantially larger on employment decisions. We further find that such operational inefficiencies are more pronounced for low-growth connected firms. Finally, the economy-wide cost of the excessive employments is estimated to be 0.19 % of GDP annually.
M51|The value of reference letters|This paper shows that reference letters from former employers alleviate information asymmetries about workers'skills and improve both match quality and equity in the labor market. A resume audit study finds that using a reference letter in the application increases callbacks by more than 60 percent, with women driving the effect. Letters are effective because they provide valuable information about workers'skills that employers use to select applicants of higher ability. A second experiment, which encourages job seekers to obtain and use a reference letter, finds consistent results. In particular, employment rates for women encouraged to obtain a letter increase by 49 percent, closing the gender gap in the sample.
M51|Motivating Workers through Task Assignment: A Dynamic Model of Up-and-Down Competition for Status|We show how competition for status that conveys explicit benefits can motivate effort in organizations such as schools, public agencies, and unionized firms in the absence of monetary incentives or intrinsically motivated workers. We develop an indefinitely-repeated labor market tournament model in which high-status agents may be rewarded either monetarily or with favorable task assignment. If monetary incentives are unavailable and the principal relies on task assignment this entails an efficiency cost relative to the benchmark case with monetary incentives. Our model offers a new perspective on the value to an employer of flexibility over job assignments within labor contracts.
M51|The inefficient advantage of experience in the market for football managers|We study hiring in a labor market where worker ability can only be observed on-the-job, but quickly becomes public information after labor market entry. We show that firms in these markets have a socially inefficient incentive to hire low talented, experienced workers instead of more promising labor market entrants, either when an extremely poor hire may bankrupt the firm, or when workers cannot commit to long-term contracts. In a dataset covering 38 years of hiring in the English labor market for football managers, we find that in around one quarter of all cases, where a firm hires an experienced worker, this experienced worker has an estimated ability below the average ability of recent labor market entrants. We argue this hiring behavior is inefficient, because it has persistently depressed the average ability of the active manager labor force over our sample period.
M51|Institutional Factors in the Evaluation by the Entrepreneur of Municipality Investment Climate|The article presents the results of the survey assessing the satisfaction level of small and medium businesses of the Sverdlovsk region with the factors of the institutional environment created in the area. Modern economics identifies four economic benefits of entrepreneurship development: job generation; productivity growth; innovation and economic growth. Governments, however, can exert either a positive or a negative influence on the extent to which in practice these benefits materialize. The positive result of Government policy is the investment appeal of the territory. We suppose, that the investment appeal of the territory depends on the correlation of the indicator of satisfaction and objective parameters of the institutional environment. Data for the subjective view was the survey of the satisfaction level of small and medium businesses of the Sverdlovsk region with the factors of the institutional environment at the year 2015 (more than 1000 respondents in 72 territories). Data for the objective view was Reports of the Heads of Sverdlovsk region municipalities about the efficiency in the municipal management, made public in 2015. The results of the research allow to develop a series of recommendations to improve the institutional environment for small and medium businesses. The basis for the selection of priority measures to improve the satisfaction of entrepreneurs is the correlation of the indicator of satisfaction and objective parameters of the institutional environment. The recommendations of the paper can be used by State and Municipal Governments in the policy of the increase of territory investment appeal. The scientific results of the research can become the base for further investigations of the correlation between subjective and objective factors of territorial development.
M51|Die betriebliche Altersvorsorge zur Zeit der Bonner Republik|Corporate Retirement Plans during the Bonn Republic: Alleviating the consequences of the war were at the center of social policy during the early years of the young republic. Yet up to 1956 pensions rose only slowly and irregularly so that old-age poverty remained widespread. The transition to a dynamic pension system based on gross earnings with the 1957 Pension Reform was the major step from a social state battling need and poverty to the caregiving welfare state. The minimum pension – abolished in 1957 – was reintroduced with the 1972 Pension Reform, paving the way to the early retirement society. This paper investigates the development of corporate pension plans up to the end of 1970s. Using Volkswagen and Merck as case studies, it shows that companies reacted to changes in the economic situation earlier than did the legislature and adjusted their social benefits systems accordingly. Parallel to the transition to the dynamic pension system based on gross earnings during the late 1950s, corporate retirement plans experienced an expansion, that is to say, following the 1957 Pension Reform, private benefits were not yet replaced by public benefits. This did not change until the expansion of the social state during the 1970s. The objective of including the Works Councils in the corporate pension discussion was to curb corporate social benefits.

Vor dem Hintergrund der erwarteten Fachkräfteknappheit wurde am Beispiel der niedersächsischen Ernährungswirtschaft zwischen 2014 und 2016 untersucht, (1) wie sich lokale Arbeitsmärkte auf Strategien und Entwicklung der überwiegend kleinen und mittleren Betriebe des Sektors auswirken, (2) in wie fern die Betriebe Unabhängigkeit vom lokalen Arbeitsmarkt erlangen können und (3) wie die Unternehmen ihrerseits die lokalen Arbeitsmärkte beeinflussen. Die Untersuchung fand in drei Schritten statt. Im Sommer 2015 wurde eine standardisierte Befragung der Ernährungswirtschaft in Niedersachsen mit 200 antwortenden Betrieben durchgeführt, die den Hauptteil der Studie bildet. Zweitens wurden im Herbst 2015 bzw. Winter 2015/16 Workshops zum Thema Fachkräftebedarf ('Fachkräfteworkshops') in einer ländlichen und in einer eher urbanen Region Niedersachsens organisiert, dokumentiert und im Nachgang ausgewertet.

M51|The retention effect of training: Portability, visibility, and credibility|This paper analyses the effect of training participation on employees' retention in the training company. It for the first time empirically combines the human capital and the monopsony theory by jointly controlling for the portability, visibility, and credibility of training. Based on an extensive German linked-employer-employee data set with detailed information on training history (WeLL-ADIAB), we show that training increases employees' retention. We compare the probability to stay at the same employer between training participants and accidental training non-participants (those who could not participate in planned training on the basis of exogeneous reasons). Higher portability of general human capital contents and visibility of training induced by training certificates however reduce the retention effect of training. Retention is further reduced when training is credibly provided and certified by external institutions, the full training effect on retention is still positive, however. We are careful to control for endogeneity of training participation in retention equations, unobserved time-invariant effects, and extensive individual and employer characteristics including wage increases and general job satisfaction.
M51|The organizational design of high-tech startups and product innovation|"""We investigate whether appointing a middle management level affects startups' innovation performance. Additional hierarchical levels are often suspected to restrict innovative activities. However, founders' capacities for information processing and resource allocation are usually strongly limited while, at the same time, R&D decisions are among the most consequential choices of startups. We argue that middle management is positively related to introducing product innovations because it improves the success rates from recombining existing knowledge as well as managing R&D personnel. In addition, we suggest that the effectiveness of these mechanisms depends on the riskiness of a startup's business opportunity. Based on a sample of German high-tech startups, we find support for our conjectures."" (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku) ((en))"
M51|A theory of intra-firm group design|I develop an intra-firm theory of group design and teamwork in the presence of peer effects. The purpose is to understand the interlinkages between intra-firm group formation and the extent of wage dispersion within the firm. Given a set of heterogeneous workers, the manager faces the challenge of allocating workers into endogenous groups (or teams) to maximize total profits. The optimal allocation features locational proximity between workers with similar productivity levels. I discuss the implications of this allocation on intra-firm wage outcomes. The main idea is that the wage paid to a single worker is determined by the productivity levels of the teammates as well as the worker’s own productivity. This means that team composition is critical to understanding the within-firm productivity and wage differentials. I show that intra-firm wage dispersion is more pronounced when workers are more alike within each team and more different across the teams. I provide numerical exercises designed to illustrate how the model’s predictions change as the key parameters are varied. One striking result is that a rise in the correlation between education and productivity (this can be interpreted as hiring workers with vocational education) leads to a decline in wage inequality within the firm. I also show that changes in the dispersion of worker efficiency lead to non-monotonic effects on within-firm wage inequality. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016
M51|How does the age structure of worker flows affect firm performance?|Abstract We develop a method for decomposing firm performance to impacts coming from the inflows and outflows of workers and apply it to study whether older workers are costly to firms. Our estimation equations are derived from a variant of the decomposition methods frequently used for measuring micro-level sources of industry productivity growth. By using comprehensive linked employer–employee data, we study the productivity and wage effects, and hence the profitability effects, of the hiring and separation of younger and older workers. The evidence shows that the separations of older workers are profitable to firms, especially in the manufacturing ICT-industries. To account for the correlation of the worker flows and productivity shocks we first estimate the shocks from a production function using materials as a proxy variable. In the second step the estimated shock is used as a control variable in our productivity, wage, and profitability equations.
M51|“Vicarious” Liability of the Employer in Sexual Harassment Cases: A Comparative Study|In recent years, sexual harassment in the workplace has drastically increased worldwide, including in South Africa. Consequently, the country’s courts have looked to protect employees by attaching obligations to employers that could render them liable when their employees are sexually harassed in the workplace. The Employment Equity Act and the Code of Good Practice on the Handling of Sexual Harassment Cases in the Workplace have also introduced measures in terms of which an employer may be held liable once certain requirements have been met. However, when compared to other jurisdictions such as the United States of America, Australia and Ontario, Canada, where the legal position on sexual harassment in the workplace and employers’ vicarious liability seems clear-cut and effective, the South African measures seem to lack teeth. Various loopholes, poor awareness and training as well as lacking implementation mean that employees who are sexually harassed in employment may find themselves unprotected and unable to hold their employer vicariously liable. In an attempt to contribute to the development of South African law in this regard, this article firstly provides an overview of the current position in South Africa, followed by a comparative overview of the law in the USA, Australia and Ontario, Canada. It is concluded that South Africa stands to learn valuable lessons from these jurisdictions’ approach to sexual harassment in employment. The most significant of these include the proposed establishment of a body similar to the USA’s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the Australian Human Rights Commission, which can be tasked specifically to deal with employment issues, including protecting employees against harassment, and enforcing and raising awareness about employer liability; making the drafting of internal policies on sexual harassment in employment compulsory and subject to inspection, and instituting compulsory training for managers to prevent and deal with sexual harassment in the workplace.
M51|Overconfidence and Occupational Choice|A statistical theory of overconfidence is proposed and applied to the issue of occupational choice. Individuals who can choose whether to engage in an activity or not must estimate their performance. The estimates have error and that error has positive expectation among those who engage in the activity. As a result, an unbiased ex ante estimate of performance in an occupatoin results in an ex post biased estimate of ability among those enter. The statistical theory of overconfidence provides a number of testable implications, most significant of which is that overconfidence should be more prevalent in occupations where estimates of ability are noisier. This and other implications are tested and found to hold using the Current Population Survey and Panel Study of Income Dynamics data.
M51|The Limits of Meritocracy: Screening Bureaucrats Under Imperfect Verifiability|Does bureaucratic ability predict promotion in governments? We show that self-reported performance in enforcing the One Child Policy predicts mayoral promotion in China. However, misreporting handicaps screening—a non-manipulated performance measure does not predict promotion. We show that this is consistent with a model where a government has a meritocratic objective but underestimates the imperfect verifiability of performance, rather than a model where a government is only interested in the illusion of meritocracy. Thus, despite meritocratic intentions, we challenge the notion that a successful promotion system effectively substituted for democratic institutions in explaining Chinese growth.
M51|Teacher Applicant Hiring and Teacher Performance: Evidence from DC Public Schools|Selecting more effective teachers among job applicants during the hiring process could be a highly cost-effective means of improving educational quality, but there is little research that links information gathered during the hiring process to subsequent teacher performance. We study the relationship among applicant characteristics, hiring outcomes, and teacher performance in the Washington DC Public Schools (DCPS). We take advantage of detailed data on a multi-stage application process, which includes written assessments, a personal interview, and sample lessons, as well as the annual evaluations of all DCPS teachers, based on multiple criteria. We identify a number of background characteristics (e.g., undergraduate GPA) as well as screening measures (e.g., applicant performance on a mock teaching lesson) that strongly predict teacher effectiveness. Interestingly, we find that these measures are only weakly, if at all, associated with the likelihood of being hired, suggesting considerable scope for improving teacher quality through the hiring process.
M51|How Management Risk Affects Corporate Debt|We evaluate whether management risk, which arises from investors’ uncertainty about management’s added value, affects firms’ default risks and debt pricing. We find that, regardless of the reason for the turnover, CDS, loan, and bond yield spreads increase at the time of management turnover, when management risk is highest, and decline over the first three years of the new CEO’s tenure. The effects increase with prior investor uncertainty about the new management. These results are consistent with the view that management risk affects firms’ default risk. An understanding of management risk yields a number of implications for corporate finance. Received May 15, 2016; editorial decision February 27, 2017 by Editor David Denis.
M51|Academics vs. Athletics: Career Concerns for NCAA Division I Coaches|We analyze the promotions and firings of NCAA Division 1 college basketball and college football coaches to assess whether these coaches are rewarded for the academic performance of their players in promotion and retention decisions. We find that an increase in Academic Progress Rate, as measured by the NCAA, for a college team in either sport significantly reduces the probability that the coach is fired at the end of the season. We find little to no evidence that an increase in the Academic Progress Rate enhances the chances of advancement (in the form of outside job offers) for these coaches.
M51|Who Gets Hired? The Importance of Finding an Open Slot|A model of hiring into posted job slots suggests hiring is based on comparative advantage: being hired depends not only on one’s own skill but also on the skills of other applicants. The model has numerous implications. First, bumping of applicants occurs when one job-seeker is slotted into a lower paying job by another applicant who is more skilled. Second, less able workers are more likely to be unemployed because they are bumped. Third, vacancies are higher for harder to fill skilled jobs. Fourth, some workers are over-qualified for their jobs whereas others are under-qualified. These implications are borne out using four different data sets.
M51|Do Recessions Accelerate Routine-Biased Technological Change? Evidence from Vacancy Postings|We show that skill requirements in job vacancy postings differentially increased in MSAs that were hit hard by the Great Recession, relative to less hard-hit areas. These increases persist through at least the end of 2015 and are correlated with increases in capital investments, both at the MSA and firm levels. We also find that effects are most pronounced in routine-cognitive occupations, which exhibit relative wage growth as well. We argue that this evidence is consistent with the restructuring of production toward routine-biased technologies and the more-skilled workers that complement them, and that the Great Recession accelerated this process.
M51|An Exploration of the Promotion Signaling Distortion|"Beginning with Waldman, Michael. 1984a. ""Job Assignments, Signalling, and Efficiency,"" 15 Rand Journal of Economics 255–67, it is well understood that in a world characterized by asymmetric learning promotions can serve as a signal of worker ability which can, in turn, lead to an inefficiently small number of promotions. In this article, we explore two related issues. First, how robust is the finding of a promotion signaling distortion to different ways of modeling the promotion process? Second, what are the various forms that the promotion signaling distortion can take? Our first conclusion is that a promotion signaling distortion exists across a wide range of settings, including some for which earlier work suggests no distortion. Our second conclusion is that, even if there is no inefficiency concerning the number of promotions, there can still be a promotion distortion that takes the form of inefficiencies concerning who is promoted.

M51|CEO Investment Cycles|This paper documents the existence of a CEO investment cycle, in which disinvestment decreases over a CEO's tenure, while investment increases, leading to “cyclical” firm growth in assets and employment. The estimated variation in investment rate over the CEO investment cycle is of the same order of magnitude as the differences caused by business cycles or financial constraints. Results from a number of tests generally support the view that the investment cycle is caused by agency problems, leading to increasing investment quantity and decreasing investment quality over time as the CEO gains more control over his board.Received February 17, 2015; accepted October 1, 2015 by Editor David Denis.

M51|Desempeño y productividad de la firma: ¿Cuánto aportan las mujeres que la dirigen?|La mujer ha ganado un espacio importante en el mundo empresarial en los últimos años, aunque todavía experimenta obstáculos considerables para llegar a las posiciones más elevadas de las firmas. Es por ello que el presente estudio busca establecer si existe un beneficio adicional para la empresa de que ellas logren alcanzar dichos cargos, específicamente cuando la gerente y la dueña de la firma son ambas mujeres, de tal forma que repotencian sus habilidades empresariales. Para ello se ha utilizado la World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES), entre los años 2009 y 2014, y se ha medido el desempeño de la firma a través del crecimiento en las ventas y en su productividad, aplicando un modelo MCO, con efectos fijos por región geográfica y sector industrial. Asimismo se ha corregido la endogeneidad instrumentalizando el hecho de que la gerente sea mujer, a través del Índice de Desarrollo de Género de las Naciones Unidas. Los resultados confirman la hipótesis de que dueña y gerente mujer repotencian sus habilidades empresariales, dado que la interacción de estas dos variables resulta significativa y positiva en las ecuaciones de las dos medidas de desempeño, mostrando que efectivamente la dueña mujer tiene una mayor capacidad para percibir y repotenciar las habilidades de las mujeres que se desempeñan en la gerencia de la firma.

M51|Macroeconomic and School Variables to Reveal Country Choices of General and Vocational Education: A Cross-Country Analysis with focus on Arab Economies|Abstract This research focuses on the analysis of the determinants of general and vocational educational choices in Arab economies with comparisons to other regions of the world. The selected framework considers educational choices as influenced by macroeconomic and education variables. The empirical investigation is based on regression analysis as inspired by the above model. Time series analysis is also used for Arab countries. The results indicate that education in the groups of countries analyzed is generally driven by unemployment, economic growth, and the schooling results. Arab countries do show that vocational educational accounts for the schooling performance, only. Comparisons with other groups indicate that Arab countries need to strengthen the links between general and professional education as this allows for a more balanced educational and employment systems, not accounting only for the performance of general education.
M51|Green Placement – An Innovative Concept & Strategy in Campus Placement Model|Campus Placements as we know today is a process involving interview of college students by recruiting companies utilizing institutional resources towards candidate job selection. The same campus placements which are being traditionally conducted by the arrival of HR Team to campus, their pre-placement talk about company and job description with the gradual interview rounds is slowly beginning to shift its perspectives towards a more greener stature. Especially now with the application of modern technology in hiring practices like E-Recruiting or On-line Recruitment, the entire campus recruitment process is also poised to leap towards a rapid change. Therefore, this research paper aims to construct an ideal strategy towards implementing campus placement process in parallel lines of E-Recruiting as well but with a more environment-friendly approach. This on-line campus placement process termed as 'Green Placements' will thrive as a conceptual model focused on to reduce resource wastages, save water, time, space, electricity by preserving the surrounding environment clean and green whilst the placement activity is being conducted at the college.
M51|Performance Measurement and Management Promotion through Non-Financial Measures: A Management Accounting Perspective|The purpose of this paper is the discussion of non-financial performance measures that can be adopted in the management accounting function of business organisations. The study is important because it shows how organisational focus on non-financial measures can substantially enhance profitability, albeit being subject to cost constraints. To begin with, the evolution of management accounting research over the last three decades is resented. The development in the academia is then contrasted with the management accounting techniques used in practice. Among different techniques available, the Budgeting technique and the Activity Based Costing (ABC) technique are assessed from the view-point of decision making and non-financial measures. The focus of the argument is on the suitability of non-financial measures on the evaluation of profitability through customer relationships. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and the Balanced Scorecard (BSc) are identified and evaluated as instruments to include non-financial measures. Furthermore, the application of non-financial measures taken into consideration in management performance evaluation and management promoting decisions is discussed. Managerial focus on promoting measures can be promotion driven and thus short-term oriented. This threat should be kept in mind when implementing non-financial measures in management accounting systems.
M51|Generational Gap and Youth in Arab countries|Abstract: The current research focuses on the analysis of attributes associated to generations in Arab countries. This is to disclose the existing differences and similarities within these existing generations and among a set of characteristics related to values, work attributes, and perception of macroeconomic threats. Findings reveal differences in the work attributes and similarities in values. With regards to the perception of macroeconomic threats, differences also exist between GCC and non-GCC countries. Current analyses investigate for the relationships between education, ICTs, unemployment, and political stability within Arab economies, and results indicate significant relationships between these variables and also a strong correlation between unemployment and the increase of political instability. The generational differences in Arab countries need to be monitored and enhanced in order to understand the different determinants of choices and preferences of Arab youth nowadays.
M51|Leadership style and Performance of Small and medium size enterprises in Cameroon|In Cameroon, SMEs contribute about 50% of the GDP and accounts for about 92% of businesses (INS, 2009) but about 80% of this SME’s created in Cameroon die before their 5th anniversary with one of the principal causes being the lack of corporate leadership. The main objectives of this research it to show the effects of leadership style on the performance of Cameroonian SMEs. The research follows a Hypothetico- deductive methodology through which primary data was collected through the Multi Factor Leadership Questionnaire which was administered on 114 workers form 38 SMEs in 05 major towns in the southwest region of Cameroon between the period of November 2015 to January 2016, the data was analysed using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Ordinary Least Square Multiple Regression(OLS), the SPSS version 20 was used for regression. The Principal results showed that the Transformational Leadership style exerted a positive and significant effect on the performance of SMEs in Cameroon, while the Transactional leadership style exerted a positive and significant impact on performance, this results are in coherence with the results obtained by Bass and Avolio, 2004 in their work entitled “Leadership and Performance beyond Expectations”. This research will therefore propose that in order to achieve organizational performance, managers should use the Transformational alongside with the Transactional leadership style since a combination of the two leadership style will permit the enterprise to attain performance beyond expectations.
M51|Corporate benefits and their impact on economy of a company. Case study|Company WA confirms current trends that a mid-size company (by number of employees) may provide a developed employee care program. Under this program, the portion of benefits to total costs is systematically increased, while the increase in benefit costs is within the limit for growth of personal expenses. Based on the analysis of employee satisfaction with the current system of employee benefits, the management has decided to increase benefit programs year on year (2015/2016) by 1.9 mil. CZK. The resulting proposal is oriented by the priority of employees - to improve their lifestyle. The proposal is also tax favourable in regards to personal expenses, employee’s taxes and effectively promotes management objectives in the development and stabilisation of human resources. Implementation of all current and proposed benefits amounting to 6.7 mil CZK will lead to tax savings amounting to about 1.6 mil. CZK in 2016.
M51|The Added Value of Women in Management: The Czech Case|The paper attempts to assess the added value of women in management in the context of the Czech Republic. The wider purpose is to contribute to the debate for the need of gender-balanced top managerial teams. It additionally contributes new inputs to the discussion as to whether quotas or other special measures are relevant to promote or engage more women in higher management positions within both the Czech public and private sectors. According to the results, Czech respondents view women as added value to management given the different characteristics of their approach over that of their male counterparts. However, the research reveals that women who obtain higher managerial positions demonstrate the same set of characteristics as men. In conclusion, the promotion system is designed for candidates that demonstrate typically male characteristics.
M51|Secret Search|We consider the problem faced by an organization that seeks to fill a high-profile position. We focus on a key decision about the recruitment process: should the organization make the identities of applicants public knowledge within the organization (â€œopen searchâ€ ) or keep the identities of applicants confidential (â€œsecret searchâ€ ). We analyse a very simple model that nonetheless yields a non-trivial problem: a single firm seeks to hire one of two possible candidates, whose abilities are known to the candidates themselves, but are unknown to the firm unless it conducts an open search process. Firms choose their search strategies, and post a salary. Candidates then decide whether to apply. A successful applicant earns the posted salary, but a rejected applicant under open search suffers a disutility cost. We characterise the unique Bayesian Nash equilibrium and find, among other things, that salaries are lower under secret search, and the expected ability level of applicants decreases as the posted salary increases under open search. We also show that when all candidates are willing to apply the salary is inefficiently low, and that the firm will, for some parameter values, choose secret search even when open search is more efficient.
M51|Politics in the family: Nepotism and the hiring decisionsof Italian firms|In this paper we investigate the effect of family connections to politicians on individuals’ labor market outcomes. We combine data for Italy over almost three decades from longitudinal social security records on a random sample of around 1 million private sector employees with the universe of around 500,000 individuals ever holding political office, and we exploit information available in both datasets on a substring of each individual’s last name and municipality of birth in order to identify family ties. Using a diff-in-diff analysis that follows individuals as their family members enter and leave office, and correcting for the measurement error induced by our fuzzy matching method, we estimate that the monetary return to having a politician in the family is around 3.5 percent worth of private sector earnings and that each politician is able to extract rents for his family worth between one fourth and one full private sector job per year. The effect of nepotism is long lasting, extending well beyond the period in office. Consistent with the view that this is a technology of rent appropriation on the part of politicians, the effect increases with politicians’ clout and with the resources available in the administration where they serve.
M51|Recruitment and apprenticeship training|The paper assesses non-training firm’s potential for free-riding on the training efforts of firms that train apprentices. In order to assess potential free-riding, the paper analyses whether training or non-training firms are more likely to recruit apprenticeship graduates that have been trained elsewhere. Firms without apprentices are less likely to hire apprenticeship graduates trained elsewhere than training firms. If these firms do hire apprenticeship graduates, they hire a smaller proportion compared to all new-hired skilled workers who have an apprenticeship degree than training firms. The paper discusses three potential explanations for this finding: lower demand for apprenticeship graduates, information disadvantage and apprentices’ preferences.
M51|Kritische Analyse von Employer Awards im Kontext des Employer Branding|Viele Unternehmen sehen sich bereits aktuell mit einem Fach- und Fuehrungskraeftemangel konfrontiert, der sich aufgrund der demografischen Entwicklung noch verschaerfen und weitere Engpaesse auf dem Arbeitsmarkt hervorrufen wird. Im Wettbewerb um die besten Talente gilt es daher umso mehr, als attraktiver Arbeitgeber von der potenziellen Zielgruppe wahrgenommen zu werden. In diesem Kontext sind sog. Employer Awards durch ihre grossflaechige mediale Verbreitung in den Fokus beider Arbeitsmarktparteien gerueckt. Die relevanten Akteure (potenzieller Bewerber bzw. Arbeitnehmer, Unternehmen als Arbeitgeber und Award-Anbieter) stehen vor komplexen Entscheidungsproblemen, die es zu untersuchen gilt. Ziel ist es, einen Loesungsansatz fuer die Entscheidungsprobleme der Award-Anbieter zu entwickeln. Aus der Perspektive des Award-Anbieters ist demnach zu untersuchen, wie ein Employer Award konzipiert sein sollte, um sowohl den Anspruechen der Arbeitgeber als auch den Anforderungen der potenziellen Arbeitnehmer gerecht zu werden. Zur Bewaeltigung dieser Herausforderung untersucht die vorliegende Arbeit die uebertragbarkeit empirischer Erkenntnisse der allgemeinen Award-Forschung aus dem Konsumguetermarketing, der Rating- und Rankingforschung sowie der Verarbeitung von Unschaerfe auf den Kontext der Employer Awards. Fuer den Umgang mit dem letztgenannten Problemfeld soll die modelltheoretische Umsetzung mit Hilfe von Methoden des Fuzzy-Control erfolgen.
M51|Time-distributed difference-in-differences approach: The case of wage returns to training|In this article we introduce econometric model specification that describes time-distributed treatment effect basing on the difference-in-differences approach. It gives us possibility to control for mobility in estimates of wage returns to professional training on the data of a Russian enterprise of 2006–2010. We show that wage growth after some kinds of professional trainings is well explained by the mobility
M51|Antecedents of Opportunity at Work: Evidence from White-Collar Employees in Turkey|Opportunities provided to employees at work facilitate important organizational outcomes. Although opportunity at work is a significant topic of research, antecedents of opportunity are under-explored. The study aims to analyze the relationships between opportunity at work and possible antecedents of opportunity, i.e. different types of leadership and high performance work practices. For this purpose, factor analyses and hierarchical multiple regression analyses are carried out using data from 550 white-collar employees. The results of analyses show that opportunity at work is explained with reference to three factors: Promotion, development, and recognition opportunities. Transactional, transformational, and participative leadership create at least one type of opportunity for employees. High performance work practices (HPWPs) predict development and promotion opportunity for employees working in different industries. The study fills a gap in the literature by exploring antecedents of opportunity at work, with important implications for both research and practice. Managers are advised to adopt the characteristics of transactional, transformational, and participative leadership in order to create opportunities for their subordinates. Moreover, organizations are recommended to employ HPWPs to create opportunities for their employees.
M51|The Importance Awarded to Human Resources and Human Resources Department in Companies from West Region of Romania|In literature, works that have the theme of human resources are some widespread, long a subject being addressed. Given their irreplaceable role in any organization, certainly in the area will continue to be of interest to those in the field. This paper aims to conduct a research, which has two main goals: identifying the importance given to human resources in organizations in the West Region of the country, and whether the Human Resources Department acts as the strategic partner of top management. The study does not include all companies in the mentioned area, but only those large or very large (over 250 employees), regardless of the nature of capital (Romanian, foreign, mixed) or sector (public or private), but that are not subsidiaries of multinational companies, with independent position, being independent decision. The results obtained with this study confirms the change in terms of human resources and the role assigned to the Human Resources Department within organizations, namely those in the Western Region of Romania.
M51|The Impact of a Managerial Model of Decision and Strategic Action Applied To the Companies from Mures County about Their Performance against the Competition|Using the qualitative marketing research in the field of strategic management highlights the different levels of complexity of this activity, involving the use of methods and techniques applied in psychological and sociological investigations. In their case, the researcher has an active role in the effort to obtain qualitative nature information, with small samples and is structured based on a rigorous process of selection of the respondents. Qualitative researches of investigating the attitudes, motives and behaviour are based on communication techniques directly or indirectly, that include also the semi-directive depth interview that requires the establishment of an interview guide that includes both closed and open questions, the moderator may, however, intervene in the process and adapt the themes and sub-themes addressed according to respondents' answers. The present research contains an approach guide targeted to the impact it may have a managerial model of decision and strategic action on the performances of an organization in relation to competition.
M51|Within- and Cross-Firm Mobility and Earnings Growth|A widely accepted premise is that promotions within firms and mobility across firms lead to significant earnings progression. Existing research generally has examined cross-firm mobility separately from hierarchical advancement. Yet, as the authorsâ€™ descriptive evidence from Danish panel data shows, how the two types of mobility interact is important for understanding earnings growth. Cross-firm moves at the nonexecutive level provide sizable short-run earnings growth (similar to the effect of being promoted to an executive position). These gains, however, appear modest compared with the persistent impact on earnings growth of promotions (either within or across firms) and subsequent mobility at a higher hierarchy level.
M51|Do Employer Preferences Contribute to Sticky Floors?|The authors investigate the importance of employer preferences in explaining sticky floors, the pattern in which women are less likely, as compared to men, to start to climb the job ladder. The authors perform a randomized field experiment in the Belgian labor market and test whether hiring discrimination based on gender is heterogeneous by whether jobs imply a promotion (compared to the applicantsâ€™ current position). The findings show that women receive 33% fewer interview invitations when they apply for jobs that imply a first promotion at the functional level. By contrast, the results show that their hiring chances are not significantly affected by the authority level of the job.
M51|Are Men Given Priority for Top Jobs? Investigating the Glass Ceiling in Italian Academia|We investigate the gender gap in academic promotions, focusing on the Italian system, in which candidates first participate in a nationwide competition to obtain a scientific qualification and then successful candidates compete to obtain a position at the department level. We estimate the gender gaps in the probability of success at these two stages, controlling for several measures of productivity. Whereas no gender differences emerge at the national level, women have a lower probability of promotion at the department level. Robustness checks suggest that estimated gender gaps are not results of measurement errors.
M51|The concept of ?empowerment? in the research on organization and innovativeness|The dynamic nature of the socio ? economic environment and a necessity to improvement of management systems of today's organizations leads to undertaking a research on an importance of organizational social potential and its dimensions. The theory of management science has a rich set of management concepts related to social potential. Very valuable concepts seem to be highly exposing the subjectivity and individuality of employees in organization. The aim of this study is an attempt to interpret the concept of empowerment from the perspective of this research on organization, and its potential of innovation.The study was focused on basic interpretation and systematization of the empowerment concept. The text indicated selected properties of empowerment such as engagement, initiative, creativity, autonomy, freedom, responsibility, efficiency etc. Further conceptualization of the concept was carried out from the managerial perspective as well as psychological dimension. On this background the study distinguished attributes and possibility of application of the empowerment concept in the area of development of the innovation potential of the organization. Among others, it was pointed out, for example: the space of social relationships, social awareness, organizational climate, active and free information exchange, access to knowledge, creation of new knowledge, organizational roles, flexibility and decentralization of organizational structures.
M51|The Effects of Migration on Romanian Employees: A Managerial Perspective|It is a fact that the phenomenon of migration has generated major outcomes on the Romanian society, both from a social point of view, but also from an economic perspective. Following the country integration in the European Union a large number of Romanians have chosen to migrate, especially in countries in Western Europe, in search of a better life and higher incomes. This migration has led to a decrease in the workforce in Romania, but has also changed the manner in which Romanian employees are viewed by the companies in which they work and changed the manner in which they behave at their workplace. The present paper seeks to provide a better understanding of the particularities of Romanian employees at their workplace and of the effects that migration had on these particularities.
M51|Firm-Level Hiring Difficulties: Persistence, Business Cycle And Local Labour Market Influences|Abstract We examine the correlates of reported hiring difficulties at the firm level using linked employer-employee and panel survey data over 2005-2011, focussing on the relative influence of firm-level characteristics, persistence, the business cycle and local labour market liquidity. At both the aggregate and the firm level, hiring difficulties eased after the onset of the Global Financial Crisis. Even in the presence of large cyclical changes in demand and labour market conditions, firm-level persistence is a dominant feature of the data, with one- and two-year lags of reported hiring difficulties both positively related to current difficulties. Firms paying higher wages are more likely to report difficulties when trying to hire skilled workers, while firms with more long tenure workers are less likely to report any difficulty hiring. Local labour market conditions appear unrelated to reported hiring difficulties.
M51|Happy Birthday, You're Fired! The Effects of Age-Dependent Minimum Wage on Youth Employment Flows in the Netherlands|"This paper investigates the effects of the age-dependent minimum wage on youth employment flows in the Netherlands. The Dutch minimum wage for workers aged 15-23 is defined as a step-wise increasing function of a worker's calendar age. At the age of 23, workers become eligible for the ""adult"" minimum wage which does not increase further. This creates an incentive for firms to discriminate against employees on the basis of their age, substituting more expensive older workers with younger ones. In order to grasp the size of these effects, I analyze monthly flows in and out of employment using administrative records for the entire youth population of the Netherlands. I account for the time remaining until workers' next birthdays, exploiting the fact that firms are facing a sharp discontinuity in labor costs in the month when a worker turns one year older. The results show a significant increase in job separation around the time of this discontinuity: the probability of job separation increases by 1.1% in the three calendar months which are closest to a worker's next birthday. This effect exhibits substantial heterogeneity with respect to a worker's age, showing that young and inexperienced workers are more likely to be affected by the discontinuities. The size of the effect also varies by the sector of employment, being particularly large for supermarket employees. Job accession peaks just after workers' birthdays, representing both entry of the workers with higher reservation wages and re-employment of the workers whose jobs are dissolved around the time of the discontinuity."
M51|Why Demotion of Older Workers is a No-Go Area for Managers|Demotion – a reduction of an employee’s rank and salary - is often mentioned by managers and policy makers as a measure to increase the employability of older workers, but in practice demotion is rarely applied. This paper takes a fresh look at the question of demotion by first employing a survey among European employers and second the use of a survey and a vignette study among managers in the Netherlands (N = 355). The European survey shows that although demotion is not often applied a considerable percentage contemplates the application in the near future, especially those employers who encounter work staff aging. The vignette study offers insight in their stated preferences with respect to demotion for a particular employee, described by a number of possible causes of underperformance. The key question is whether these causes refer to internal or external causes and causes which the employee can or cannot control. By using background characteristics on the manager, obtained through survey questions, we can assess whether the decision to demote is also affected the expectations of managers on the wider consequences of making demotion standard practice. Internal causes such as not willing to participate in training, and not being motivated to work increase the likelihood of demotion, whereas external causes (financial situation of the firm) are of little importance. However, even when an employee scores low points on all possible causes, demotion still is hesitantly considered. Much of this hesitation is connected to the perceived negative externalities which managers expect to materialize once demotion becomes standard practice
M51|Exploration for Human Capital: Evidence from the MBA Labor Market|We empirically investigate the effect of uncertainty on corporate hiring. Using novel data from the labor market for MBA graduates, we show that uncertainty regarding how well job candidates fit with a firm's industry hinders hiring and that firms value probationary work arrangements that provide the option to learn more about potential full-time employees. The detrimental effect of uncertainty on hiring is more pronounced when firms face greater firing and replacement costs and when they face less direct competition from other similar firms. These results suggest that firms faced with uncertainty use similar considerations when making hiring decisions as when making decisions regarding investment in physical capital.
M51|Social Networks, Employee Selection, and Labor Market Outcomes|We provide a direct empirical test of Montgomery’s 1991 notion that firms hire workers through social ties of productive employees as these workers know others with high unobserved productivity. We focus on coworker networks and show that firms recruit workers with better military draft test scores but shorter schooling when hiring previous colleagues of current employees, suggesting that firms use these networks to attract workers with better qualities in hard-to-observe dimensions. Incumbent workers’ abilities predict the incidence, abilities, and wages of linked entrants. These results suggest that firms rely on the ability density of the studied networks when setting entry wages.
M51|The Making of a Manager: Evidence from Military Officer Training|We show that officer training during the Swedish military service has a strong positive effect on the probability of attaining a managerial position later in life. The most intense type of officer training increases the probability of becoming a civilian manager by about 5 percentage points, or 75%. Officer training also increases educational attainment post–military service. We argue that the effect on civilian leadership could be due to the acquisition of leadership-specific skills during the military service, and we present suggestive evidence related to alternative mechanisms, such as signaling, networks, and training unrelated to leadership.
M51|Wage compression and manager inequality aversion|"Literature exploring pay finds that highly(less) productive workers often earn less (more) than they would if compensation perfectly reflected productivity, indicating ""wage compression"". Using a laboratory experiment, we show that such wage compression may partially be due to managers' own preference for equality."
M51|Ethnic discrimination in hiring decisions: A meta-analysis of correspondence tests 1990–2015|For almost 50 years field experiments have been used to study ethnic and racial discrimination in hiring decisions, consistently reporting high rates of discrimination against minority applicants – including immigrants –, irrespective of time, location, or minority groups tested. While Riach and Rich (2002) and Rich (2014) provide systematic reviews of existing field experiments, no study has undertaken a meta-analysis to examine the findings in the studies reported. In this article we present a meta-analysis of 730 correspondence tests in 42 separate studies conducted in OECD countries between 1990 and 2015. In addition to summarizing research findings, we focus on subgroups to ascertain the robustness of findings, emphasizing differences across countries, gender, and economic contexts. Moreover we test hypotheses with regard to taste-based and statistical discrimination. To this end, we draw on the fact that the groups considered in correspondence tests and the contexts of testing vary to some extent. We focus on first- and second generation immigrants, differences between specific minority groups, the implementation of EU directives, and the length of job application packs. There are many indications that ethnic discrimination in hiring decisions reflects taste-based discrimination, although in some cases statistical discrimination seems to occur.
M51|The core of the global corporate network|We investigate the network topology of a comprehensive data set of the world-wide population of corporate entities. In particular, we have extracted information on the boards of all companies listed in Bloomberg's archive of company profiles in October, 2015, a total of almost 100; 000 firms. We provide information on board membership overlap at various levels, and, in particular, show that there exists a core of directors who accumulate a large number of seats and are highly connected among themselves both at the level of national networks and at the worldwide aggregated level.
M51|Attraktivität junger Unternehmen für Fachkräfte|Die Arbeitgeberattraktivität wird nicht durch das Unternehmensalter beein-flusst. Von den jungen Unternehmen, die in den vergangenen fünf Jahren Fachkräfte suchten, hatte über die Hälfte Schwierigkeiten bei der Fachkräfteakquise. Werben die Unternehmen mit Arbeitsplatzmerkmalen wie überdurchschnittlichen Löhnen oder der Möglichkeit zum kreativen Arbeiten, steigt die Arbeitgeberattraktivität bzw. gelingt die Rekrutierung besser.
M51|Gender diversity in top-management positions in large family and nonfamily businesses|(Why) does the sex ratio in top-management positions in large family and nonfamily businesses differ? Using a unique data set and estimating (fractional) logit regressions we show that the female share in top-management positions in family businesses exceeds the one in nonfamily businesses. One reason is the selection mechanism social homophily from which females in family businesses benefit more because of a higher female share in the decision making body in family businesses. Another reason is the pathway self-appointment as (co-) leader of one's own business which is more common in family businesses. Nepotism seems not to play a role.
M51|Fünf gute Gründe für ein Auslandsstudium|Eine stärkere Auslandsmobilität während des Studiums ist sowohl auf nationaler als auch auf europäischer Ebene im Rahmen des Bologna-Prozesses ein zentrales bildungspolitisches Ziel. Welchen Stellenwert Auslandserfahrung auf dem deutschen Arbeitsmarkt hat, haben der Deutsche Akademische Austauschdienst (DAAD) und das Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft Köln in einer gemeinsamen Studie untersucht. Für einen Auslandsaufenthalt während des Studiums lassen sich ausgehend von den Ergebnissen der DAAD/IW-Befragung von 1.008 Personalverantwortlichen und auf der Basis vorausgegangener Studien fünf Gründe formulieren. Erstens verlangt der fortschreitende Prozess der Globalisierung vor allem in einem Land wie Deutschland, das tief in internationale Wertschöpfungsketten eingebunden ist, eine Vorbereitung auf berufliche Tätigkeiten, die zunehmend durch internationale Bezüge gekennzeichnet sein werden. Zweitens zeigt sich in einer Reihe von Befunden aus Absolventen- und Beschäftigerbefragungen, dass Auslandsaufenthalte nicht nur die immer notwendiger werdenden auslandsrelevanten Kompetenzen wie Fremdsprachenkenntnisse und interkulturelle Kompetenz verbessern, sondern darüber hinaus auch noch weitere relevante Fähigkeiten fördern. Dies führt drittens dazu, dass auslandserfahrene Absolventen gegenüber gleich qualifizierten Bewerbern ohne Auslandserfahrung mit besseren Einstellungschancen rechnen können. Außerdem haben sie viertens mehr Optionen, Tätigkeiten mit internationalen Bezügen zu übernehmen, deren Relevanz für die Unternehmen künftig zunehmen wird. Fünftens zeigen sich nach Auffassung der Unternehmen positive Effekte für die berufliche Leistungsfähigkeit insgesamt, was sich vor allem bei international tätigen Unternehmen durch einen Gehaltsvorsprung gegenüber nicht mobilen Absolventen auszahlen kann.
M51|Karrierefaktor berufliche Fortbildung: Einkommensperspektiven von Fortbildungsabsolventen|Absolventen einer beruflichen Aufstiegsfortbildung wie Meister oder Techniker sind im Deutschen Qualifikationsrahmen formal überwiegend auf der gleichen Stufe wie Bachelorabsolventen angesiedelt. Eine Aufstiegsfortbildung ermöglicht einen Karrieresprung gegenüber einer beruflichen Erstausbildung. Fortbildungsabsolventen stoßen dabei durchaus in Einkommensbereiche vor, in denen sich Akademiker bewegen. Unternehmen schätzen die Kompetenzen von Fortbildungsabsolventen. Viele Betriebe zahlen dieser Gruppe ein vergleichbares Gehalt wie Akademikern. Fortbildungsabsolventen, aber auch Akademiker stellen in sich sehr heterogene Gruppen dar, sodass weder Hochschul- noch Fortbildungsabsolventen durchweg bessere Einkommenschancen haben. Die Ergebnisse hängen vielmehr von zahlreichen Faktoren wie Fachrichtung, ausgeübter Tätigkeit oder Art des Abschlusses ab.
M51|Ländliche Lebensverhältnisse im Wandel 1952, 1972, 1993, 2012: Volume 6, Ländliche Arbeitsmärkte: Chancen für Frauen - Frauen als Chance|Eine Betrachtung der Erwerbsintegration von Frauen in ländlichen Räumen allein unter dem Aspekt des Fachkräftemangels greift zu kurz. Daher werden in dieser Arbeit lokale Geschlechterkulturen und ihre Wirkung auf die Situation von Müttern zwischen Familie und Beruf untersucht. Auf Grundlage einer standardisierten Bevölkerungsbefragung (n=3.177) wird die Einbindung von Frauen in Erwerbs- und Fürsorgearbeit für 14 Orte in Deutschland erfasst und diese Muster zu drei verschiedenen Geschlechterarrangements zusammengefasst. In zwei Orten lässt sich das sogenannte männliche Ernährerarrangement finden, in dem die Position der befragten Frauen deutlich durch Fürsorgearbeit gekennzeichnet ist. In den übrigen Orten entsprechen die Arrangements eher dem Dazuverdienerarrangement (Westdeutschland) oder dem Zweiverdiener-Arrangement (Ostdeutschland). Darauf aufbauend wird auf Grundlage qualitativer Interviews mit lokalen Experten des Arbeitsmarktes und der Verwaltungen, mit Arbeitgebern sowie Frauen und Müttern die lokale Geschlechterkultur in vier der 14 Orte rekonstruiert. Entlang vier thematischer Leitbilder über Familie und Geschlecht lassen sich unterschiedliche Orientierungen bezüglich der Verortung von Frauen zwischen Erwerbs- und Fürsorgearbeit identifizieren. Es zeigt sich, dass diese Leitbilder die Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf unterstützen oder auch negativ beeinträchtigen können. Zusätzlich kann aus dem Interviewmaterial abgeleitet werden, wie Leitbilder im Sinne von handlungsleitenden Orientierungen die Praxis der Menschen beeinflussen und die Ausgestaltung von Strukturen wie Kinderbetreuung, Teilzeitarbeitsplätzen oder Umschulungsmaßnahmen beeinflussen.
M51|Fördert sportliche Aktivität den beruflichen Aufstieg?|Eine höhere Entlohnung von sportlich aktiveren Arbeitnehmern konnte in den letzten Jahren bereits mehrfach nachgewiesen werden. Diese wurde u. a. auf eine höhere Durchsetzungsfähigkeit sowie auf bessere soziale Fähigkeiten zurückgeführt. In diesem Beitrag wird mit Daten des Sozioökonomischen Panels (SOEP) analysiert, ob sportlich aktivere Arbeitnehmer eher beruflich aufsteigen bzw. Positionen mit Führungsverantwortung erreichen. Außerdem werden Persönlichkeitsmerkmale der beförderten Personen untersucht, um feststellen zu können, ob sich diese in geringerem bzw. höherem Maße für die erreichten (Führungs-)Positionen eignen. Es zeigt sich zunächst, dass die Wahrscheinlichkeit, beruflich aufzusteigen, für sportlich aktivere Arbeitnehmer signifikant höher ist. Des Weiteren können bei den untersuchten beförderten Mitarbeitern stärkere Ausprägungen von Persönlichkeitseigenschaften, die insbesondere für Führungskräfte empfehlenswert bzw. vorteilhaft sind, nachgewiesen werden.
M51|Implikationen des Wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetzes für Hochschulen und Mitarbeiter|Das Wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetz (WissZeitVG) von 2007 wurde aktuell reformiert. So werden nicht mehr nur Obergrenzen für Befristungen von wissenschaftlichen Beschäftigungsverhältnissen formuliert, sondern diese sollen jetzt auch nicht kürzer sein, als für die angestrebte Qualifizierung angemessen ist, oder dem Zeitraum ihrer Drittmittelfinanzierung entsprechen. Das Gesetz gilt nur noch für wissenschaftliches und künstlerisches Personal sowie für Qualifizierungs- oder Drittmittelstellen. Insbesondere die Verlängerung der Vertragslaufzeiten hat Nachteile für Hochschulen bzw. Hochschullehrer als Arbeitgeber, ohne dass die Beschäftigten entsprechende Vorteile davon hätten.
M51|The strongest link in a weak team? Performance of players with and without outside options in relegated football clubs|In this study the performance of players in relegated German football clubs is analysed, in particular the change in their contribution to team production. The players in the data sample differ regarding their outside options. Different career opportunities of players may have two effects when their current team struggles against relegation. First, players with outside options should be less motivated compared to the reference group. Second, risk attitudes of players who lack career opportunities may change. The empirical results show that players with outside options contribute less to the teams overall running distance before they are transferred to league opponents. Players who stayed after relegation with their teams played more incomplete passes, which indicates that they are more willing to take risks. Effort levels of staying players get higher, but leaving players might have superior playing talent.
M51|Wage Posting as a Positive Selection Device: Theory and Empirical Evidence|We use the German Job Vacancy Survey to investigate whether firms are able to attract more suitable applicants by offering bargain wages rather than posting fixed wages. Contrary to the theoretical predictions provided by the literature, we find that the offer to bargain over pay decreases the share of suitable applicants. To explain these findings we develop a directed search model with asymmetric information about workers’ types and incomplete contracts, which allows firms to condition their hiring decision on the match quality revealed at the job interview. We show that wage-posting and wage-bargaining firms coexist if pooling workers with different expected match quality is too costly for wage-posting firms and if the bargaining power is not too far away from satisfying the Hosios condition. In such an equilibrium wage-posting firms hire only workers with a high match quality and wage-bargaining firms hire workers with a high and a medium match quality.
M51|Career mobility of temporary workers within and across establishments: A demand-side perspective|This paper addresses the career mobility of temporary workers from a demand-side perspective, focussing on promotions to managerial positions and wage growth. We use a large-scale revised administrative data source on employees entailing the entire population of promotions, which are considered a rare event. We provide evidence that compared to employees with a permanent contract, temporary workers are more likely to be promoted to a managerial position. Looking closer, this advantage is more pronounced across than within establishments, which we interpret as evidence for the greater importance of the flexibility over the screening function of temporary employment. However, because the qualification-related impact of fixed-term contracts on promotion is U-shaped, i.e. lowest for the medium-skilled IVET workers with long training periods in the establishments, we conclude that the screening function is still relevant in the German labour market. Moreover, the wage growth premium we find to be associated with fixed-term contracts can be explained by the fact that temporary workers benefit more from promotions to managerial positions.

M51|The retention effect of training – portability, visibility, and credibility|This paper analyses the effect of training participation on employees’ retention in the training company. It for the first time empirically combines the human capital and the monopsony theory by jointly controlling for the portability, visibility, and credibility of training. Based on an extensive German linked-employer-employee data set with detailed information on training history (WeLL-ADIAB), we show that training increases employees’ retention. We compare the probability to stay at the same employer between training participants and accidental training non-participants (those who could not participate in planned training on the basis of exogeneous reasons). Higher portability of general human capital contents and visibility of training induced by training certificates however reduce the retention effect of training. Retention is further reduced when training is credibly provided and certified by external institutions, the full training effect on retention is still positive, however. We are careful to control for endogeneity of training participation in retention equations, unobserved time-invariant effects, and extensive individual and employer characteristics including wage increases and general job satisfaction.
M51|The workforce composition of young firms and product innovation: Complementarities in the skills of founders and their early employees|We investigate the extent to which complementarities between technical and business skills of founders and employees matter for the generation of market novelties by new ventures. Using data about German start-ups, we find that there are no complementarities between technical and business skills within the group of founders, but that there are significant complementarities between technically trained founders and employees who have business skills. This suggests that the innovation potential of start-ups by technically trained founders is best explored by hiring employees who are trained in business. However, a reverse relationship does not exist: There are no complementarities between founders with business skills and employees with technical skills.
M51|The Value of Postsecondary Credentials in the Labor Market: An Experimental Study|We study employers' perceptions of the value of postsecondary degrees using a field experiment. We randomly assign the sector and selectivity of institutions to fictitious resumes and apply to real vacancy postings for business and health jobs on a large online job board. We find that a business bachelor's degree from a for-profit online institution is 22 percent less likely to receive a callback than one from a nonselective public institution. In applications to health jobs, we find that for-profit credentials receive fewer callbacks unless the job requires an external quality indicator such as an occupational license. (JEL I23, I26, J24, J44, J63, M51)
M51|Playing the Boys Game: Golf Buddies and Board Diversity|We study the participation of women in golf, a predominately male social activity, and its influence on their likelihood of serving on a board of directors. Exploiting a novel dataset of all golfers in Singapore, we find that woman golfers enjoy a 54% higher likelihood of serving on a board relative to male golfers. A woman's probability of serving on the board in a large firm or in a predominately male industry increases by 117% to 125% when she plays golf. Joining the boy's informal network appears to facilitate women's entrance or success in the executive labor market.
M51|Don't Demotivate, Discriminate|"This paper offers a new theory of discrimination in the workplace. We consider a manager who has to assign two tasks to two employees. The manager has superior information about the employees' abilities. We show that besides an equilibrium where the manager does not discriminate, equilibria exist where the manager discriminates in favor of the employee whom the employees expect to be favored. The manager, who has no taste for discrimination, discriminates in order to avoid demotivating the ""favorite"". We show that the nondiscriminatory equilibrium is unstable. Yet the manager would prefer to commit not to discriminate. (JEL D82, D84, J71, M12, M51, M54)"
M51|Inducing Leaders to Take Risky Decisions: Dismissal, Tenure, and Term Limits|"How can a principal (employer or voter) induce an agent (worker or politician) to choose the ""right"" actions if risky actions reveal the agent's decision making competence and only dismissal can be used as an incentive instrument? We first show that if the principal can commit to a replacement strategy, then optimal mechanisms involve either (i) a probationary period and then indefinite tenure, or (ii) dismissing poorly performing agents but also randomly replacing agents who take nonrevealing actions. When the principal cannot commit, incentives can be improved by imposing term limits on agents."
M51|Lifelong Learning and Employability in the Danube Region Countries: Influences and Correlations|A continuous challenge for education and lifelong learning is to assist individuals in acquiring skills and knowledge for successful work life, especially after the financial crisis which influenced negatively the employment growth in all European Union countries. The paper focuses on finding correlations between employability and lifelong learning in the Danube Region countries of the European Union and more explicitly in the ex-communist ones of this region. As research instruments, two online questionnaires were built based on a thorough literature review and a set of structured interviews and filled in by 390 IT students and 55 IT professors. The surveys’ results revealed a clear positive correlation between the level of education and the opinion about the importance of obtaining a job as a result of the educational endeavors. A special attention in the survey was given to social networks, which were acknowledged as modern facilitators of lifelong learning activities. The conclusions of the current study are particularly important in the Romanian context, as the employment rate of recent graduates is in a decreasing trend, but also for all the Danube Region ex-communist countries, which have to boost their employment rates as well, to assure their economical growth. Identification of factors stimulating employment of young people according with their education contributes at the sustainable economic growth of these countries, at the growth of graduates insertion in the labor market and at the diminution of labor migration.
M51|Firm Employment Growth, R&D Expenditures and Exports|This paper studies firms’ decisions to export and invest in R&D and their effects on employment growth and labor flows for a sample of Italian SMEs operating in the manufacturing industry. After accounting for the under-reporting of R&D in SMEs, our quantile regressions reveal that (i) R&D is associated with higher employment growth rates, higher hiring rates and lower separation rates; (ii) R&D-induced exports are negatively related to employment growth and accessions and positively related to separations; and (iii) pure exports are not a driver of employment growth and labor flows.
M51|Journal Lists: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis| This study examines the use of formal rankings of journals for personnel decision purposes by agricultural economics departments with agribusiness programs. It was hypothesized that the probability of using a list of formal rankings is related to a set of characteristics of the department. This suggests lists may reduce the level of uncertainty regarding the assessment of research quality by providing explicit targets in the department but may also induce faculty members to develop institution-specific human capital, thereby reducing faculty mobility and impeding career development. Whether lists are used, how they are compiled, and the extent to which they are relied upon when making personnel decisions should be viewed in the context of developments and trends in higher education; e.g., the presence of multi-disciplinary departments and the use of clinical and other non-tenure track faculty. Further, the difficulty of revising lists once they have been agreed upon should also be considered, especially when journal quality declines or where changes in personnel evaluations and in bylaws and similar documents are lengthy and arduous processes.
M51|Aggregate Recruiting Intensity|We develop an equilibrium model of firm dynamics with random search in the labor market where hiring firms exert recruiting effort by spending resources to fill vacancies faster. Consistent with microevidence, fast-growing firms invest more in recruiting activities and achieve higher job-filling rates. These hiring decisions of firms aggregate into an index of economy-wide recruiting intensity. We study how aggregate shocks transmit to recruiting intensity, and whether this channel can account for the dynamics of aggregate matching efficiency during the Great Recession. Productivity and financial shocks lead to sizable procyclical fluctuations in matching efficiency through recruiting effort. Quantitatively, the main mechanism is that firms attain their employment targets by adjusting their recruiting effort in response to movements in labor market slackness.
M51|Das Aus für die Generation Praktikum?|Hat die Einführung des gesetzlichen Mindestlohns zum 1. Januar 2015 Auswirkungen auf das Angebot von Praktika? Werden jetzt verstärkt Praktika angeboten, die vom Mindestlohn befreit sind? In einer Sonderfrage der Randstad-ifo-Personalleiterbefragung wurden diese Fragen untersucht. Die Ergebnisse der Befragung zeigen, dass das Angebot von Praktikumsstellen im vergangenen Jahr stark zurückgegangen ist. Fast jedes zweite Unternehmen, das vor 2015 freiwillige Praktika und/oder Pflichtpraktika angeboten hat, stellt seit 2015 gar keine Praktikumsplätze mehr zur Verfügung. Der Schluss liegt nahe, dass es seit Einführung des gesetzlichen Mindestlohns schwieriger geworden ist, einen Praktikumsplatz zu finden.
M51|The Paradox of Effective Labor Regulation|Why some countries choose a combination of highly protective laws and little enforcement is a puzzle that cannot be rationalized with traditional explanations. This paper collects administrative, legal and household survey data to emphasize a stylized fact about labor regulation that has been generally overlooked – countries with more protective employment regulations tend to enforce these regulations less, and usually focus their enforcement efforts on large firms.
M51|A New Method For Financial Decision Making Under Intuitionistic Linguistic Environment|Intuitionistic linguistic set is an effective tool to deal with uncertainty. In this paper we develop a new method for financial decision making problems under intuitionistic linguistic environment and introduce the induced intuitionistic linguistic ordered weighted averaging distance (IILOWAD) operator. The main advantage of this operator is that it is able to consider complex attitudinal characters of the decision-maker by using order-inducing variables in the aggregation of the Hamming distance. Moreover, it is able to deal with uncertain environments where the information is very imprecise and can be assessed with intuitionistic linguistic numbers. We studied some of IILOWAD’s main properties and different particular cases. We also develop an application of the new approach in a financial decisionmaking problem concerning the selection of civil engineering public project.
