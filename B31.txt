B31|Los polos de desarrollo de François Perroux en el modelo de regionalización para Colombia (1969-1972)|Con la creación del Modelo de regionalización en el capitulo para el desarrollo urbano y regional del Plan Nacional de Desarrollo 1969-1972, una buena parte de la teoría de François Perroux llega a Colombia bajo la dirección de Edgar Reveiz. Se encuentran al menos tres influencias claras de Perroux sobre las propuestas de política pública para Colombia. En primer lugar, el concepto de crecimiento desequilibrado y subdesarrollo se evidencia en el diagnóstico hecho en el plan sobre las desigualdades territoriales que afrontaba el país. En segundo lugar, la unidad motriz, efecto impulso y aglomeración se aplican en el Modelo de Regionalización en la selección de criterios para la identificación de industrias motrices. Finalmente, la definición de desarrollo que propone Perroux, como aquellos cambios sociales y mentales de la población para crear un crecimiento sostenible, se ve inmersa en la esencia del Modelo de regionalización en el sentido de la identificación de polos de desarrollo para Colombia. *** With the creation of the Regionalization Model in the chapter for the urban and regional development of the National Development Plan 1969-1972, a good part of François Perroux’ theory arrives in Colombia under the direction of Edgar Reveiz. There are at least three clear influences of Perroux on the proposals of public policy for Colombia. Firstly, the concept of unbalanced growth and underdevelopment is evident in the diagnosis made in the plan of territorial inequalities faced by the country. Secondly, the driving unit, propulsive effect and agglomeration are applied in the Regionalization Model in the selection of criteria for the identification of propulsive industries. Finally, the definition of development proposed by Perroux, as those social and mental changes of the population to create sustainable growth, is immersed in the essence of the Regionalization Model in the sense of identifying development poles for Colombia.
B31|Macroeconomic Dynamics at the Cowles Commission from the 1930s to the 1950s|Jacob Marschak shaped the emergence of monetary theory and portfolio choice at the Cowles Commission (which he directed from 1943 to 1948, but with which he was involved already from 1937) at the University of Chicago, where he was the doctoral teacher of Leonid Hurwicz, Harry Markowitz and Don Patinkin, and then from 1955 at the Cowles Foundation at Yale University, where he was a senior colleague of James Tobin until moving to UCLA in 1960. Marschak’s later attempts to clarify the concept of liquidity and to emphasize the role of new information for economic behavior date back as far as to his early experiences with hyperinflationary processes in the Northern Caucasus during the Russian Revolution. Marschak came to monetary theory with his 1922 Heidelberg doctoral dissertation on the quantity theory equation of exchange (published in 1924 as “Die Verkehrsgleichung”), and embedded monetary theory in a wider theory of asset market equilibrium in studies of “Money and the Theory of Assets” (1938), “Assets, Prices, and Monetary Theory” (with Helen Makower, 1938), “Role of Liquidity under Complete and Incomplete Information” (1949), “The Rationale of the Demand for Money and of ‘Money Illusion’” (1950), and “Monnaie et liquidité dans les modèles macroéconomiques et microéconomiques” (1955), as well as in Income, Employment and the Price Level (lectures Marschak gave at Chicago, edited by Fand and Markowitz, 1951). We examine Marschak’s analysis of money within a broader theory of asset market equilibrium and explore the relation of his work to the monetary and portfolio theories of his doctoral students Markowitz and Patinkin and his colleague Tobin and to the revival of the quantity theory of money by Milton Friedman, a University of Chicago colleague unsympathetic to the methodology of the Cowles Commission.
B31|Affective Portfolio Analysis: Risk, Ambiguity and (IR)rationality|Ambiguous assets are characterized as assets where objective and subjective probabilities of tomorrowâ€™s asset-returns are ill-deï¬ ned or may not exist, e.g., bitcoin, volatility indices or any IPO. Investors may choose to diversify their portfolios of ï¬ at money, stocks and bonds by investing in ambiguous assets, a fourth asset class, to hedge the uncertainties of future returns that are not risks. (IR)rational probabilities are computable alternative descriptions of the distribution of returns for ambiguous assets. (IR)rational probabilities can be used to deï¬ ne an investorâ€™s (IR)rational expected utility function in the class of non-expected utilities. Investment advisors use revealed preference analysis to elicit the investorâ€™s composite preferences for risk tolerance, ambiguity aversion and optimism. Investors rationalize (IR)rational expected utilities over portfolios of ï¬ at money, stocks, bonds and ambiguous assets by choosing their optimal portfolio investments with (IR)rational expected utilities. Subsequently, investors can hedge future losses of their optimal portfolios by purchasing minimum-cost portfolio insurance.
B31|Recovering Tinbergen|From the long viewpoint of history of economics, the two most important contributions that Jan Tinbergen made to economics are surely the development of the first macro-econometric model and a general theory of economic policy-making. This paper explores these two innovations to recover why they deserve such recognition, analyses their technical and conceptual depths, and shows how they relate to the economic history of the period and his personal history. In the process, it becomes clear that they are not separate innovations, but, as Tinbergen recognised, involved the same logic; and as we can recognise, were driven by the same ambition to make economics usable in the world.
B31|"""Positional Views"" as the Cornerstone of Sen's Idea of Justice"|Our paper offers a novel reading of Sen’s idea of justice, beyond the standard prisms imposed by theories of justice – resting on external normative criteria – and formal welfarism – involving the definition of individual welfare and its aggregation. Instead we take seriously Sen’s emphasis on personal agency and focus on his original contribution to the issue of objectivity. Firstly, we demonstrate that Sen’s idea of justice, with at its core “positional views”, is more respectful of persons’ agency than would be a theory based on individual preference or capability. Secondly, we argue that Sen’s conception of objectivity considers that both information and sentiments are relative to a position. Such an alternative approach to subjectivity allows the formation of more impartial views through collective deliberation and a better consideration of justice by agents themselves.
B31|Note sur quelques limites de la méthodologie de Pareto et ses interprétations|: L'article évalue les limites de la méthodologie que Pareto applique à l'économie et à la sociologie. La première partie revisite les fondements sur lesquels repose la méthode logico-expérimentale et des approximations successives que Pareto propose pour les deux disciplines. La deuxième partie explicite les étapes qui définissent l'expérimentalisme de Pareto en sociologie. La troisième montre que les résultats que Pareto met en évidence impliquent qu'il n'applique pas la même méthodologie à l'économie et à la sociologie. La quatrième partie explique pourquoi les formes méthodologiques auxquelles Pareto recourt ne permettent pas la synthèse des résultats qu'il prêtant réaliser.
B31|How Law and Economics Was Marketed in a Hostile World: L'institutionnalisation du champ aux États-Unis de l'immédiat après-guerre aux années Reagan|Cet article met en relief l'implication des fondations d'entreprises dans le développement de la Law and Economics aux Etats-Unis des lendemains de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale aux années Reagan. Il s'appuie notamment sur l'analyse de trajectoires individuelles ou collectives, qu'il s'agisse des programmes de recherche menés à l'université de Chicago par Aaron Director autour de l'antitrust, des programmes de formation des juges portés par Henry Manne ou encore des travaux académiques et du parcours administratif de Robert Bork. Il met l'accent sur le rôle de fondations d'entreprises pro-marché dans l'essor de la Law and Economics et sur son impact sur les manières de juger.
B31|Retrospectives: Lord Keynes and Mr. Say: A Proximity of Ideas|Since the publication of Keynes's General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, generations of economists have been led to believe that Say was Keynes's ultimate nemesis. By means of textual and contextual analysis, we show that Keynes and Say held similar views on several key issues, such as the possibility of aggregate-demand deficiency, the role of money in the economy, and government intervention. Our conclusion is that there are enough similarities to call into question the idea that Keynes's views were antithetical to Say's. The irony is that Keynes was not aware of these similarities. Our study sheds new light on the interpretation of Keynes's work and on his criticism of classical political economy. Moreover, it suggests that some policy implications of demand-side and supply-side frameworks overlap. Finally, the study underlines the importance of a thorough analysis of the primary sources to fully grasp the substance of Say's message.
B31|A Vision for a Dynamic World: Reading Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy for Today|"This paper was written for a symposium on ""Reconsidering the Classics."" Rereading Joseph Schumpeter's Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (CSD) for today, we argue Schumpeter's vision for a dynamic world remains essential for understanding the world. We begin the paper by briefly describing some background on Schumpeter and the context in which CSD was written. Then, we summarize the book, which Schumpeter divided into five separate parts on Marx, capitalism, socialism, democracy, and a history of socialist parties. Throughout our summary, we highlight the key arguments and touch on many ideas in the book, such as Schumpeter's description of socialism and his theory of democracy. Instead of tackling all these ideas in depth, we discuss the book's usefulness for readers today by focusing on Schumpeter's Big Idea--""creative destruction."" We conclude by discussing how influential CSD has been, and continues to be, in the social sciences and then provide suggestions for those interested in reading CSD today."
B31|Sraffa on Marshall's Theory of Value in the Cambridge Lectures: Achievements in an Unfinished Criticism|In his Cambridge lectures, Sraffa argues that classical political economy and marginalist economics present two alternative theoretical structures. This was a major achievement reached during the preparation of the lectures. The understanding of these two theoretical structures was however still unfinished: as known, he had already identified the need for simultaneous determination of prices and distribution - a result comprehensibly not made explicit in the lectures; but the critical implications of this result for the interpretation of Marshall's position were probably not yet evident to Sraffa. He in fact still accepted the Marshallian thesis that classical political economy and marginalist economics identified two single alternative “ultimate standards of value”. Sraffa’s failure to also overcome this limitation of the debate on the ultimate standard bears witness to his, albeit critical, initial adherence to the Marshallian theoretical framework. The road towards Production of Commodities was open but still unfinished.
B31|The Past and the Future of Keynesian Economics: A Review Essay|The recently published Elgar Companion to John Maynard Keynes (2019) is a major new contribution to Keynes scholarship, with sixty-three participants contributing ninety-five distinct entries, in 632 pages of text proper. This review essay provides an overview and assessment of the character and content of the work. It does so also via consideration of the question of Keynes’s key theoretical achievements; the relation between Keynes’s thought and the main currents of subsequent Keynesian economics; Keynes’s policy sensibility vis-à-vis ‘Keynesian’ policy; and finally, the question as to what is of endur-ing validity and greatest importance in Keynes’s economics, for the future.
B31|A missing touch of Adam Smith in Amartya Sen’s account of Public Reasoning: the Man Within for the Man Without|Sen claims that his 2009 theory of justice is based in part upon Smith’s idea of the “impartial spectator”. His claim has received criticism: some authors have responded that his interpretation of Smith’s concept is unfaithful to the original (e.g., Ege, Igersheim and Le Chapelain 2012); others, focusing on internal features of Sen’s analysis, critique his use of the Smithian impartial spectator, arguing that it is a weak point in his comparative theory of justice (e.g., Shapiro 2011). In this paper we address both sets of criticisms. While agreeing with commentators that Sen’s reading of Smith is somewhat unfaithful, we reiterate that his aim in The Idea of Justice is not to provide an exegesis of Smith but rather to build his own comparative theory of justice by “extending Adam Smith’s idea of the impartial spectator” (IJ: 134) to his own project. After clarifying their distinct approaches to the concept of the impartial spectator, we draw upon our account of these differences to evaluate Sen’s own use of the concept. Despite significant divergences, we show that Sen’s version of the impartial spectator is not inconsistent with Smith’s analysis. Though it does not correspond to Smith’s concept, i.e. to what the Scottish philosopher sometimes calls the “man within”, it is reminiscent of another figure from Smith’s moral philosophy: the “man without”. Beyond this analogy, there are further connections between Smith’s imaginary figure of the “man within” and Sen’s account of “common beliefs”—both notions are ways of representing our beliefs regarding what is moral or just. But whereas Smith’s moral philosophy offers an analysis of the process by which the “man without” influences the “man within”, nothing of that kind is to be found in Sen’s conception of public reasoning. And it is here that Smith’s famous concept of “sympathy” can supplement Sen’s theory, in a way which furnishes an answer to Shapiro’s (2011) criticism regarding the possibility of the spontaneous change of beliefs toward greater impartiality.
B31|Gordon Tullock on Majority Voting: the Making of a Conviction|This paper participates in the formation of the history of public choice theory. In particular, it will focus on the role of Gordon Tullock and the analysis of the simple majority decision-making process promoted in the famous Calculus of Consent, written along with James M. Buchanan. This paper shows that Tullock has already think about the issue of majority voting prior to the writing of his common book with Buchanan. Between 1959 and 1961 in particular, while Tullock was a postdoctoral fellow at the Thomas Jefferson Center for Studies in Political Economy and Social Philosophy at the University of Virginia and later Assistant Professor in the Department of International Studies at the University of South Carolina, he had an interesting interaction with Anthony Downs about majority decision-making process in a democracy. This interaction that consists in a correspondence between Tullock, Downs and their editors can be found for a part in the Gordon Tullock papers of the Hoover Institution Archives. It gave birth to some major articles by the two authors such as The Problem of Majority Voting by Tullock in 1959, Why the Government Budget is Too Small in a Democracy by Downs in 1960, Problems of Majority Voting: In Defense of Majority Voting by Downs and Problems of Majority Voting: Reply to a Traditionalist by Tullock in 1961. Our purpose is to highlight the interaction that forms the basis of these publications and shows the way Tullock matured his view about the majoritarian rule – one of the cornerstones of the public choice theory – at this time.

Стари И Нови Прочити На Теорията На Маркс<BR>[Money as coordination, new and old readings of Marx]|В икономическата теория на Маркс съществуват редица проблеми, един от които е за интегрирането, и за логическата връзка между теорията за парите и теорията за трудовата теория за ценността. Това засяга по-широкия въпрос за мястото на парите изобщо в системата на Маркс. Задачата на настоящата статия е да реконструираме в сравнителна перспектива походите на двама френски икономисти, Ж. Картелие и А. Орлеан, като ги съпостави с тези на И. Рубин и П. Струве. Всеки от четиримата предлага свое методи на решение за интегрирането на парите и ценността. Въпреки, че идеите на четиримата автори се преплитат, то могат да се обособят две двойки, а именно И. Рубин – А. Орлеан, и П. Струве – Ж. Картелие. Това отговаря на радикалността на техните аналитични решения. Докато първите съхраняват теорията за ценността (всеки по свои начин), то вторите практически я елиминират (също всеки по свой начин).
B31|Ingemar Ståhl. Bibliografi 1967-2011<BR>[Ingemar Ståhl. Bibliography 1967-2011]|Ingemar Ståhl was a productive and imaginative economist who was professor of economics at Lund University 1971–2005. His intellectual curiosity gave him a wealth of ideas that he applied to a wide range of issues, for example defense, social insurance, education, housing, labor markets, health, taxation, environment, finance, industrial policies and the political economy of the Swedish model. He became an academic pioneer who imported new theoretical developments, such as public choice and property rights, from abroad and applied them to Sweden. In addition to being a researcher he was also a keen participant in public debate and, at various times, a member of governmental and private policy commissions and a reformer of undergraduate teaching in economics in Lund. He exerted a profound influence on Swedish economic debate, arguing for market-oriented reforms and for more competition and freedom of choice in the public sector. His many contributions – published as well as unpublished – are listed in this bibliography.
B31|Countries, economy and markets: Analysis of hisbah institution and its contribution to Al-Mawardi perspective|The capitalist economy and the socialist economic history can not actually manifest even the distorted performance associated with economy and nothingness.

B31|Negara, ekonomi dan pasar: Analisis institusi hisbah dan kontribusinya dalam perspektif al-Mawardi<BR>[Countries, economy and markets: Analysis of hisbah institution and its contribution to Al-Mawardi perspective]|The capitalist and socialist economy throughout the history of economic thought can not factually bring about market justice and even tends to be distorted due to the weakening of economic ethics and the absence of the institutions that oversee the market. This article uses the method of content analysis and critical historical method in revealing the history of Islamic economic thought about the issue. The conclusion of this paper asserts that the state, economy, and market are inseparable in creating economic justice, one of which is al-Mawardi's idea of the institution of hisbah which plays a role in controlling and overseeing economic activity.
B31|The Market Power of Global Scientific Publishing Companies in the Age of Globalization. An Analysis Based on the OCLC Worldcat|This article evaluates tendencies and trends of the global academic publishing industry, vital for any reasonable long-term publication strategy planning in research. Such analyses are made possible today by the OCLC Worldcat. Our multivariate attempt, combining Worldcat global library circulation figures of publisher companies with results from earlier publisher ranking studies, is based on factor analysis of 32 variables, and our promax factor analytical model establishes that there are eight factors of global publisher impact, explaining almost 86% of total variance: 1. overall global standing of the company 2. company as a factor on the market 3. company impact on the global political and economic debate 4. successfully distributing best-sellers 5. impact on the scholarly community 6. successfully distributing production to more than 50 global Worldcat libraries 7. output during the last 5 years 8. outstanding academic quality Of the 51 companies with complete data under investigation here, the following companies are classified in the upper half: Oxford University Press; Springer; Cambridge University Press; Routledge; World Bank; Princeton University Press; Elsevier; CRC Press; University of Chicago Press; University of California Press; Palgrave Macmillan; MIT Press; Yale University Press; University of North Carolina Press; De Gruyter; Wiley-Blackwell; Kluwer Academic Publishers; University of Pennsylvania Press; Johns Hopkins University Press; Brill; Nova Science Publishers; University of Illinois Press; Duke University Press; University of Washington Press; and Edward Elgar. Scientists, wanting to get global audiences, are well advised to publish with those companies; and journal editors, wanting to get a global distribution for their journals, are equally well advised to cooperate with them.

B31|Pemikiran Ekonomi Al-Maqrizi<BR>[Al Maqrizi's Economic Thought]|This article writes about the thinking of Al-Maqrizi Islamic economic figure. The method used in the concept of money according to Al-Maqrizi is literature study. Al-Maqrizi is in the second phase in the history of Islamic economic thought, a phrase that begins to show signs of slowing innovative intellectual activities in the Islamic world. Al-Maqrizi is an Islamic economic thinker who conducts special studies on money and inflation. The socio-economic phenomenon and the effects of inflation depend on the nature of income and wealth of each group. If income is fixed or rising, but lower than the rate of inflation then the condition declines. Conversely, if their income rises higher than the rate of inflation, then their material welfare increases.

This paper discusses the way he thought the economics should be analyzed as well as his life cycle.
B31|On the Origins of Piero Sraffa’s Equations. New Evidence Following Pierangelo Garegnani’s Lead|The paper investigates the origins of the equations which form the structure of Piero Sraffa’s Production of Commodities by means of Commodities. Following an interpretation first developed by Pierangelo Garegnani in a paper that highlighted the importance of a manuscript headed ‘Notes Lon-don, Summer 1927 (Physical Real Costs etc.)’, we single out new evidence relevant to the reconstruction of the path which led Sraffa to conceive his equations. In particular, we stress how Sraffa came to pay special attention to the case of a subsistence economy (‘a community that produces just what is sufficient to keep it going’) and how this led him to shift his attention from the idea of reducing heterogeneous physical costs to an ‘absolutely necessary commodity’ to the determination of exchange ratios by the solution of systems of simultaneous equations.
B31|Edmond MalinvaudÂ´s Criticisms of the New Classical Economics: Restoring the Nature and the Rationale of the Old KeynesiansÂ´ Opposition|Contrarily to standard accounts of the history of macroeconomics, recent research has increasingly paid attention to the Old Keynesiansâ€™ criticisms of the New Classical Economics. In this paper, I study another study case through Edmond Malinvaudâ€™s criticisms of the New Classical Economics from the 1980s onwards. I argue that his opposition was radical in the sense that it was both multi-dimensional and systematic. I show, then, that the way he opposed reveals his own conception of macroeconomics, which owed much to the methodology and the practice of macroeconometric modeling. Finally, I suggest that the study of Malinvaudâ€™s opposition to the New Classical Economics shed light on both the nature and rationale of the Old Keynesiansâ€™.
B31|Rise of the Kniesians: The professor-student network of Nobel laureates in economics|The paper presents the professor-student network of Nobel laureates in economics. 72 of the 77 Nobelists belong to one family tree. The remaining 5 belong to 3 separate trees. There are 350 men in the graph, and 4 women. Karl Knies is the central-most professor, followed by Wassily Leontief. Harvard is the central-most university, followed by Chicago and Berlin. Most candidates for the Nobel prize belong to the main family tree, but new trees may arise for the students of Terence Gorman and Denis Sargan.
B31|The influence of Sen’s applied economics on his “social choice” approach to justice: agency at the core of public action to remove injustice|Our paper shows that Sen’s (2009) alternative theory of justice is greatly influenced by 1) his work on famines ; 2) his empirical work on gender inequalities, specifically within the Indian society, that helped him to refine his approach to hunger ; and 3) his involvement in the creation of the human development approach. All these engagements — seemingly completely separate from his contribution to the theories of justice — have, in fact, fostered the formulation of a novel approach in which agency and public reasoning are the core elements.
B31|Piketty’s (r – g) Law is Pareto’s Law: Consistent Analyses of Income Distribution Predicated on Inconsistent Definitions of Inequality|On the face of it, Pareto’s law and Piketty’s (r – g) law are inconsistent, with Pareto arguing that real per capita economic growth is the solution to the problem of income inequality and Piketty arguing for redistribution to be funded from a wealth tax. This study, however, establishes that when the same definition of inequality is adopted by the two scholars, Piketty’s and Pareto’s laws are the same economic law. It also establishes that Piketty’s assertion that Pareto treats income distribution as “rock stable” overlooks the critical aspects of Pareto’s law that emphasise change.
B31|The German anti-Keynes? On Walter Eucken's macroeconomics|Germany's approach to solving the Eurozone crisis is supposedly based on the ideas of Walter Eucken (1891-1950), the founder of ordoliberalism. In this and other contexts, Eucken's work has been described as being in direct opposition to that of John Maynard Keynes. Our paper aims to clarify and differentiate the relationship between the two scholars by making two main points. First, we show that Eucken supported a proto-Keynesian stimulus programme at the height of the Great Depression, the so-called Lautenbach plan of 1931. Second, we critically examine Eucken's description of 'full employment policy', a strategy with obvious parallels to Keynesian economic policy. Additionally, the paper maintains that when comparing Eucken and Keynes, more emphasis should be given to the fact that the former favours a rule-based rather than discretionary approach to policy-making.
B31|Of time, uncertainty, and policy-making : Lionel Robbins’ lost philosophy of political economy|In the second edition of his methodological Essay, Lionel Robbins attributes a significant role to uncertainty, dynamics and the time element. Understanding the motives that led to these revisions may offer important clues to assess what happened to political economy ever since, and how far economics has diverged from Robbins’ agenda. Our main claim is that these topics appeared on the second edition of the Essay because Robbins saw them as fundamental if economics (as a science) were to achieve its goal of being a useful tool for political economy, following the English Classical economists’ distinction between science and art. His conception of science was thus tailored to his interests in political economy, rejecting attempts to mimic the methods of the natural sciences by preserving the human element that makes economics a social science.
B31|Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, development economist|Accounts of Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen’s career as an economist usually focus either on the brilliance of his pioneer contributions to mathematical economics during the 1930s, or more frequently, on his later conversion to a critical approach to economic theory anchored on the centrality of the entropy law in a dynamic setting. These two disparate moments, however, were connected by Georgescu-Roegen’s strong attraction to the study of the problems afflicting underdeveloped societies. This began with his work on the agricultural economy of his native Romania, produced under the auspices of Harvard’s Russian Research Center in the late 1940s. Thenceforth, he embarked on a journey that spawned his early interest in Leontief-type linear models, an extended tour of Southeast Asia commissioned by Vanderbilt University’s Graduate Program in Economic Development, and several visits to Brazil during the 1960s to assist in the development of academic economics in the country. The paper highlights these lesser-known aspects of Georgescu-Roegen’s intellectual trajectory, while using his case to illustrate some of the paths open for inquiry during the heyday of development economics.
B31|The Europe of the five parts of the world: François Perroux on European Integration|"Although seldom remembered in this respect, François Perroux exerted direct and indirect influence on the debate on European integration in the immediate post-war period in France. The theme of European integration serves in Perroux’s work as a concrete case study on which a series of his recurrent themes could be explored, such as his theory of domination, his reflection on economic spaces, development and the costs of man (""coûts de l’homme""), or even as an extension of topics from his work in the 1930s related to corporatism and communitarianism. Perroux deals with the theme of European integration fundamentally in an extensive book from 1954, L’Europe sans rivages, but also in several others of his books and articles from the period, forming a complex and multifaceted analysis of the problematic that, nevertheless, insists in a central message: the importance of the global aspect of the European integration, thinking in a Europe of the “five parts of the world”. This paper offers an analysis of this set of writings, connecting it to the institutional and political context of the debate on European integration in France. The goal is to situate the effective influence Perroux’s ideas and his concrete personal influence on important names of Jean Monnet entourage. Taking these general questions as a reference, and starting with Perroux’s perspectives on topics such as national accounts, planning and liberal interventionism, the article also explores the critical thinking undertaken by Perroux, throughout the 1950s, on the institutional and political paths taken in the first years of the European integration process, approximating his analysis to other voices that critically discussed those paths, such as, for example, Gunnar Myrdal. Doing this, the paper also explores important connections, not frequently visited in the literature of the history of economic ideas, between the European integration and the field of economic development or regarding the debates on regional inequalities that took shape in the midst of the postwar European reconstruction projects."
B31|Jean-Michel Grandmont A forthcoming mind|This profile of Jean-Michel Grandmont is based on several interviews we had with him between September 2016 and April 2017. The interviews took place at our CREST offices, located at that time in Malakoff, just south of Paris. The objective of the profile is twofold. First, we trace the career of this highly influential mathematical economist who made seminal contributions to the fields of monetary economics, temporary equilibrium, business cycle theory, and aggregation of individual behavior. Second, we show how Grandmont and his colleagues contributed to changing the French landscape of economic research.
B31|L. Currie and A. O. Hirschman on Development as a Problem of Decision Making|This work analyzes the contributions of L. Currie and A. O. Hirschman to development theories. We show that traditional approaches to the divergence between these authors have overlooked some common views in their development strategies. For both, the catalyst role played by the experts —being facilitators of decision-making processes— is crucial for triggering economic transformation. Using evidence from both their published works and archival documents little exploited in the literature, we show that their experiences as experts in Colombia led them to refine their ideas on development and to appraise the importance of the political economy of expertise.
B31|Lawrence R. Klein and the making of large-scale macro-econometric modeling, 1938-1955|Lawrence R. Klein was the father of macro-econometric modeling, the scientific practice that dominated macroeconomics throughout the second half of the twentieth century. Therefore, understanding how Klein developed his identity as a macro-econometrician and how he conceived and forged macro-econometric modeling at the same time, is essential to draw a clear picture of the origins and subsequent development of this scientific practice in the United States. To this aim, I focus on Klein’s early trajectory as a student of economics and as an economist (from 1938-1955), and I particularly examine the extent to which the people and institutions Klein encountered helped him shape his professional identity. Klein’s experience at places like Berkeley, MIT, Cowles, and the University of Michigan, as well as his early acquaintance with people such as Griffith Evans, Paul Samuelson, and Trygve Haavelmo were decisive in the formation of his idea on how econometrics, expert knowledge, mathematical rigor, and a specific institutional configuration should enter macro-econometric modeling. Although Klein’s identity defined some of the most important characteristics of this practice, by the end of the 1950s, macro-econometric modeling became a scientific practice independent of Klein’s enthusiasm and with a “life of its own,” ready to be further developed and adapted to specific contexts by the community of macroeconomists.
B31|El agente representativo: ¿supuesto fuerte y equívoco u opción reductora de dificultades analíticas para el estudio macroeconómico?|En el presente documento se realiza un breve análisis del pensamiento de autores clásicos aún vigentes para el estudio económico de la sociedad moderna, con el fin de comparar sus metodologías de análisis con las metodologías actuales. Específicamente, se hace seguimiento al supuesto de agentes representativos y las consecuencias que su consideración tiene en los modelos de crecimiento neoclásicos básicos a partir de los cuales se hace política económica. Se reconoce la importancia de los supuestos en conjunto dentro del análisis neoclásico y su formalización, pero se considera su impacto en el análisis de los efectos distributivos del crecimiento y la desigualdad. Se encuentra que se debe tener especial precaución al sacar conclusiones de modelos que integren a este supuesto debido a que los efectos redistributivos no son despreciables.
B31|Del mundo del más o menos al universo de precisión: a propósito de los modelos de ciclos de los negocios de Ragnar Frisch Y Michal Kalecki|El objetivo de este trabajo es presentar de manera detallada los modelos matemáticos de Frisch y Kalecki, mostrando los problemas conceptuales y analíticos que la literatura reciente ha señalado. La linealización del sistema de ecuaciones de los modelos de Frisch y Kalecki, fortalecieron la idea de que los ciclos económicos se podrían explicar mediante un mecanismo de propagación de oscilaciones amortiguadas y uno de impulso de choques externos aleatorios, mientras que el ciclo auto-sostenido de manera endógena encontraría su fundamento en la no linealidad. ****** The aim of this paper is to present in detail the mathematical models of Frisch and Kalecki, showing the conceptual and analytical problems that recent literature has pointed out. The linearization of the system of equations of the Frisch and Kalecki models strengthened the idea that economic cycles could be explained by a mechanism of propagation of damped oscillations and one of impulse of random external shocks, while the self-sustained cycle of endogenous way would find its foundation in non-linearity.
B31|Jean-Michel Grandmont - A Forthcoming Mind|This profile of Jean-Michel Grandmont is based on several interviews we had with him between September 2016 and April 2017. The interviews took place at our CREST offices, located at that time in Malakoff, just south of Paris. The objective of the profile is twofold. First, we trace the career of this highly influential mathematical economist who made seminal contributions to the fields of monetary economics, temporary equilibrium, business cycle theory, and aggregation of individual behavior. Second, we show how Grandmont and his colleagues contributed to changing the French landscape of economic research.
B31|Shackle: an enquirer into choice|Despite the several attempts to rework Shackle’s ideas using alternative non-mainstream approaches, Shackle was and has remained an outsider in the economic discipline. Shackle, however, is not a man alone if we take seriously what he thought of economics, as a discipline concerned with a subject that is not self-contained but open-ended and impermanent. Starting from an assessment of Schackle’s understanding of choice as creative, an uncaused cause that happens in a present in which the future must be imagined and for which the past provides no satisfyingly complete anticipations, the paper argues that Shackle should be rescued from the role of a nihilist where he is often relegated. In this perspective, a fundamental key to assessing the richness, originality and anticipatory character of Shackle’s contribution can be found in the recent developments of several “friendly” disciplines such as the psychology of motivations and of self-rewarding actions, narrative as the “science’ of the possible and the role of calendar time in choice theory. In fact, all these novel re-thinkings can contribute and to the understanding of Shackle’s main point, that human (and therefore economic) agents are active, creative enterprisers, who cut the deterministic thread by injecting the new in history to come, in making a difference in the future courses of action.
B31|The Allais Paradox: What It Became, What It Really Was, What It Now Suggests to Us|"Whereas many others have scrutinized the Allais paradox from a theoretical angle, we study the paradox from an historical perspective and link our findings to a suggestion as to how decision theory could make use of it today. We emphasize that Allais proposed the paradox as a normative argument, concerned with ""the rational man"" and not the ""real man"", to use his words. Moreover, and more subtly, we argue that Allais had an unusual sense of the normative, being concerned not so much with the rationality of choices as with the rationality of the agent as a person. These two claims are buttressed by a detailed investigation – the first of its kind – of the 1952 Paris conference on risk, which set the context for the invention of the paradox, and a detailed reconstruction – also the first of its kind – of Allais's specific normative argument from his numerous but allusive writings. The paper contrasts these interpretations of what the paradox historically represented, with how it generally came to function within decision theory from the late 1970s onwards: that is, as an empirical refutation of the expected utility hypothesis, and more specifically of the condition of von Neumann-Morgenstern independence that underlies that hypothesis. While not denying that this use of the paradox was fruitful in many ways, we propose another use that turns out also to be compatible with an experimental perspective. Following Allais's hints on ""the experimental definition of rationality"", this new use consists in letting the experiment itself speak of the rationality or otherwise of the subjects. In the 1970s, a short sequence of papers inspired by Allais implemented original ways of eliciting the reasons guiding the subjects' choices, and claimed to be able to draw relevant normative consequences from this information. We end by reviewing this forgotten experimental avenue not simply historically, but with a view to recommending it for possible use by decision theorists today."
B31|From Methodology to Practice (and Back): Georgescu-Roegen's Philosophy of Economics and the Flow-Fund Model|Despite his early contribution to the rise of mathematics in economics, Georgescu-Roegen's later methodological criticism of models has received little attention from historians and philosophers of economics. This paper attempts to fill this gap following two lines. First, I examine his explicitly methodological claims and connect them with related topics in economic methodology. Building on the distinction between dialectical and arithmomorphic concepts, I characterise his approach to theory-making as a three steps process of idealisation, isolation and arithmetisation. In this framework, models perform two functions, checking for logical consistency and facilitating understanding, which can be related to the idea of modelling as theorising. I then confront these general principles with Georgescu-Roegen's flow-fund model of production. I use the methodology as a reading grid of this theory, while examining its limits and complementary principles in practice. This shows a great deal of consistency, where idealisation provides conceptual foundations, isolation determines the relevant problems, and models are built according to structural consistency. The two functions of models are then illustrated by the logical derivation of older principles formulated by Babbage and Smith, and the understanding of the different organisational patterns of production. But some slightly different functions also appear when specific configurations of the model enable to check the conceptual consistency of other theories, or the understanding provided by the model contributes to the formation of new concepts. Hence, the consistency and the complementarity between Georgescu-Roegen's methodology and practice of theory-making provide interesting insights and a useful background for further investigations
B31|Turgot, Smith and Steuart on Stadial Histories|The theory of the stages of society appeared in the mid-18th century. Following a successful reception over the course of the second half of the century, the four-stage theory was finally adopted by Classical Economics, holding that the exchange economy is the final outcome of a long period of economic development. This paper carries out a comparative analysis of the stadial histories of Turgot, Smith and Steuart. We found theories which were similar, but which were identical in the pre-eminence of the productive forces and economic organisation. Firstly, a number of dynamic principles are noted?i.e., a natural tendency to improve their conditions, a series of shocks that change the historical stage and the innovative capacity of some individuals. Secondly, the necessary conditions for the movement from the agricultural stage to commercial society do not coincide. Turgot requires an accumulation of capital, Smith uses the market and Steuart points to the artificial institutions created by merchants. This is the central point in order to understand the differences between their economic theories.
B31|Buchanan and public finance: The tennessee years|Abstract James Buchanan’s views on public finance have already been analyzed and they are quite well known, as are their origins and roots. However, nothing has ever been said about why Buchanan chose public finance in the first place. The first goal of this paper is to show that Buchanan had made this choice before arriving at Chicago. We show how Carlton C. Sims and Charles P. White influenced him. We also show, by analyzing Buchanan’s M.A. thesis, that he was not only interested in public finance but was also primarily concerned by ethical questions and defended a bureaucratic centralized solution to solve the problem he was discussing – how to share the benefits collected from a gasoline tax among Counties. This helps to understand that Buchanan did not choose to study public finance to learn how to fight government intervention. Quite the contrary: it was to legitimate it. Second, we also demonstrate that a lot of the ideas that will matter for Buchanan in his career – the importance of ethics and the principle of an equal treatment for equals, the need to link taxes to benefits, the importance to adapt the scale of provision of a public good to the type of public good – were already present in this first work.
B31|The Sound of Silence: A Review Essay of Nancy MacLean's Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right's Stealth Plan for America|This essay reviews Nancy MacLean's Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right's Stealth Plan for America, which triggered a huge controversy that virally spread on the internet and in various journals. We will evaluate MacLean's almost biographical account of James Buchanan, which portrays the 1986 Nobel Prize laureate as the mastermind behind today's attacks, by the foot soldiers of the radical right, on American democracy. This essay develops three main points. One, MacLean's general narrative puts too much emphasis on Buchanan and largely neglects the many other important characters who contributed to the intellectual criticism of government intervention. Two, MacLean's account is marred by many misunderstandings about public choice theory, for instance about the role that simple majority rule plays in constitutional economics. Third, in the midst of abundant archival material, her historical narrative is, at best sketchy, and is replete with significantly flawed arguments, misplaced citations, and dubious conjectures. Overall, MacLean tends to overinterpret certain aspects in Buchanan's life and thought, while she overlooks others that are equally important in understanding his work and influence. In particular, we stress that Buchanan was, first and foremost, a scholar, not a political activist, who gave significant attention to ethical considerations in his analysis of markets.
B31|From Karl Menger to Charles Menger? How Austrian economics (hardly) spread in France|The father of the “Austrian” Marginalist revolution and founder of the so-called “Austrian School of economics”, Carl Menger, had a mixed reception during different periods of development of French economics. Somewhat welcomed in the early days, he was rather forgotten later on. Even his major works were not published in translation until recently. What is the reason for such a situation? Criticisms of classical political economy have to be understood in their French context. In comparison to other countries, this paper details the case of France, besides showing how later Austrians, such as Friedrich Hayek, found a limited audience. This comparative study of economic ideas in France must start with the reception of the views of the founder and the role and impact of adopting/adapting or rejecting his views by French scholars. What place did they find in French academia? From Carl Menger to a “Frenchified” Charles Menger, how was Austrian economic thought disseminated in France? This essay starts by recalling the Belle-Époque and an astonishing letter by Charles Rist for the Jubiläum of Menger, in which he deplored the lack of translation of the latter’s works. The Austrian School in France is then discussed as pure economics replaces political economy in the Interwar period, with the 1938 Paris Congress of “liberal thinkers,” as the Vienna Circle became known, also comparing issues in philosophy. The paper considers how Austrian theories of “pure science” were received in Paris from the Vienna of the 1900s, at a time of ”Crossroads,” to the present day, through the Postwar and Cold War, until a revival since the 1990s and a rethinking of economic ideas after 2008.
B31|Amartya Sen : un allié pour l’économie de la personne contre la métrique des capabilités. Deux arguments pour une lecture non fonctionnelle de la liberté chez Sen|Dans cet article, nous voulons montrer que l’usage du concept de capabilité comme une simple « métrique » du développement humain est une vision réductrice de la proposition intellectuelle de Sen. Contrairement à certaines idées reçues, Sen partage l’idée des tenants d’une économie de la personne (Ballet et al 2014) selon laquelle une théorie de la justice en termes de droits à certaines capabilités resterait prisonnière d’une vision purement fonctionnelle de la liberté. Notre démonstration passe par deux types d’arguments : 1) en reprenant l’hypothèse standard et originelle de la capabilité comme ensemble de vecteurs de fonctionnements accessibles (e.g., Sen 1987), nous mettons en évidence quatre implications théoriques de l’approche de Sen que la perspective standard en termes de « welfarisme formel » (D’Aspremont 2011, Baujard 2016) ne permet pas de saisir ; 2) nous confortons cette lecture en examinant l’hypothèse – passée inaperçue jusque là – de la capabilité comme « pouvoir effectif » d’agir dans le sens de résultats que l’on valorise (Sen 2008, 2010 [2009]). Dans les deux cas, il s’agit de montrer que la capabilité pour Sen est bien autre chose qu’une « métrique » de l’avantage personnel. De surcroît, la seconde hypothèse amène à intégrer d’emblée la question de l’obligation morale dans le concept de capabilité. Dès lors, la capabilité non seulement n’est pas une métrique de l’avantage personnel, mais elle n’est même plus une représentation de l’avantage personnel. C’est ici qu’apparaît la véritable révolution conceptuelle de Sen qui, contrairement à ce que Ricœur (2004) avait cru lire, ne se trouve pas dans le couple droit-capabilité, mais dans le couple responsabilité-capabilité nous obligeant à repenser le cadre standard des théories de la justice.

B31|Ragnar Frisch (1895-1973)|"Ragnar Frisch was a Norwegian economist and statistician. He is well known for his effort in founding in 1930 the Econometric Society, the first international association in economics. In Europe it was followed by the European Economic Association in the mid-1980s. Ragnar Frisch was awarded the first Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, jointly with Jan Tinbergen, ""for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes."" Frisch appreciated this prize not quite as much as the Antonio Feltrinelli prize awarded to him in 1961 by the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, the old and famous Italian society of which Galileo Galilei was one of the first members. Frisch is remembered internationally for his contributions to econometrics, macroeconomics and a number of other fields. He is revered in Norway for his role as teacher of students of economics over a period of 40 years and for having founded the Institute of Economics of the University of Oslo. Frisch is also known as a coiner of terms, e.g. econometrics, macroeconomics and quite a few others. The article is an account of Frisch’s early years, his education as silversmith, study years abroad etc. It includes also his own account of his experiences during the World War II and his advice given to postwar students in 1949."
B31|The Race Between Demand and Supply: Tinbergen's Pioneering Studies of Earnings Inequality|Understanding inequality and devising policies to alleviate it was a central focus of Jan Tinbergen's lifetime research. He was far ahead of his time in many aspects of his work. This essay places his work in the perspective of research on inequality in his time and now, focusing on his studies on the pricing of skills and the evolution of skill prices. In his most fundamental contribution, Tinbergen developed the modern framework for hedonic models as part of his agenda for integrating demand and supply for skills to study determination of earnings and its distribution and the design of effective policy. His lifetime emphasis on social planning caused some economists to ignore his fundamental work.
B31|Helicopter Ben, monetarism, the New Keynesian credit view and loanable funds|The purpose of this paper is to examine the intellectual roots of monetary dominance; specifically, the view that fiscal policy is largely irrelevant to counter-cyclical macro stabilisation and long-run output growth. A first step towards monetary dominance was the monetarist reinterpretation of the Great Depression. In the 1990s orthodoxy replaced money supply targeting with inflation targeting while preserving monetarist results. In this monetarism without money, fiscal policy was not needed in the short-run for macro stabilisation, and in the long-run could only lead to higher inflation rates and to higher real interest rates that lowered potential output by crowding-out private investment. Expansionary fiscal policy was mostly overlooked in the early 2000s New Keynesian literature on the zero lower bound; instead, the optimism on unconventional monetary policies failed to prepare policymakers for the Global Financial Crisis. The crisis demands far-reaching changes to macro theory not least of which is a recognition that the theory of loanable funds is incapable of providing any insight into how the financial system works in practice or the long-term effects of fiscal policy.

In questo lavoro viene quindi presentato un profilo biografico di Mauro Fasiani, seguito da una breve analisi dei suoi scritti scientifici disposta secondo i principali filoni delle sue ricerche. Segue una bibliografia delle sue opere e la bibliografia degli scritti riguardanti il suo apporto scientifico. Il lavoro si conclude con la presentazione di trentotto schede, ciascuna corrispondente ad un suo saggio; rispetto agli scritti elencati nella bibliografia, mancano le schede corrispondenti a otto scritti, considerati del tutto trascurabili.
B31|Economic Policy in a Recession. Lessons from the Past|When an economy drops suddenly into recession, the paramount objective of any policy initiative is to avoid deflation. To that end, quantitative easing has little to offer. Arguments from the 1930s are assessed within the context of the recent Global Financial Crisis, where the preceding twenty years of the Great Moderation had left economists high on hubris. In avoiding their deserved comeuppance, economists continue to parade an ever-more sophisticated intertwining of statistical data within mathematical relationships that is essentially divorced from social and political relevance. Though sorely needed, the broad strokes of a politico-historical perspective are rarely found within the purview of current mainstream economics.
B31|Functional Finance: A Comparison of the Evolution of the Positions of Hyman Minsky and Abba Lerner|"This paper examines the views of Hyman Minsky and Abba Lerner on the functional finance approach to fiscal policy. It argues that the main principles of functional finance were relatively widely held in the immediate postwar period. However, with the rise of the Phillips curve, the return of the Quantity Theory, the development of the notion of a government budget constraint, and accelerating inflation at the end of the 1960s, functional finance fell out of favor. The paper compares and contrasts the evolution of the views of Minsky and Lerner over the postwar period, arguing that Lerner's transition went further, as he embraced a version of Monetarism that emphasized the use of monetary policy over fiscal policy. Minsky's views of functional finance became more nuanced, in line with his Institutionalist approach to the economy. However, Minsky never rejected his early beliefs that countercyclical government budgets must play a significant role in stabilizing the economy. Thus, in spite of some claims that Minsky should not be counted as one of the ""forefathers"" of Modern Money Theory (MMT), this paper argues that it is Minsky, not Lerner, whose work remains essential for the further development of MMT."
B31|Two Harvard Economists on Monetary Economics: Lauchlin Currie and Hyman Minsky on Financial Systems and Crises|In November 1987, Hyman Minsky visited Bogota, Colombia, after being invited by a group of professors who at that time were interested in post-Keynesian economics. There, Minsky delivered some lectures, and Lauchlin Currie attended two of those lectures at the National University of Colombia. Although Currie is not as well-known as Minsky in the American academy, both are outstanding figures in the development of non-orthodox approaches to monetary economics. Both alumni of the economics Ph.D. program at Harvard had a debate in Bogota. Unfortunately, there are no formal records of this, so here a question arises: What could have been their respective positions? The aim of this paper is to discuss Currie's and Minsky's perspectives on monetary economics and to speculate on what might have been said during their debate.

B31|Contemporary of every age: Gaetano Filangieri between public happiness and institutional economics|In the decades around the turn of the eighteenth century, Naples was capital of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and Europe’s third most populous city. From the early decades of the eighteenth to the end of the nineteenth century, the city spawned a school of intellectuals that, though predominantly juridical in cast, nevertheless displayed a surprisingly substantial openness to a new approach to the social sciences, which had developed above all in France, heavily influenced by the natural sciences and the experimental method. In harmony with Enlightenment thought, Gaetano Filangieri was the precursor, two centuries back, of the principles of indissoluble interaction between formal and informal institutions and economic development, between governance and social feedback, that are pillars of today’s school of institutional economics. His writings anticipated, in a number of respects, conceptual approaches adopted by later scholars. The present paper offers an institutional focus on his work, referring above all to Douglass North and his treatment of the role of the Glorious Revolution.
B31|Haney's Ideas on Economic Value|History of Economic Thought deals with the origin and development of economic ideas, concepts, laws and theories. It is the process of searching, understanding, analyzing and interpreting the economic ideas. It is imperative to study the economic history to gain knowledge about economic theories. If one wants to understand the present phenomena clearly he has to know what happened in the past.This study deals with the ideas of Lewis Henry Haney about the very important basic economic concept i.e., “value”. It can be understood that starting from the Greek Philosopher like Aristotle so many economists carry out the analysis and interpretation of the idea of ‘value’. Among them Lewis Henry Haney, is one of the notably Economic Historian who indulged in analyzing the ‘value’ concept. That can be traced in his famous book titled ‘Value and Distribution’.
B31|Keynes’s Trading on Wall Street: Did He Follow the Same Behavior When Investing for Himself and for King’s?|In the last few years Keynes’s activity as an investor has attracted attention in the specialized literature. Very recently his investments at Wall Street, in particular – both on his own account (Cristiano, Marcuzzo, Sanfilippo 2017) and on behalf of King’s College (Chambers and Kabiri 2016) – have been analyzed, and the evident connection with his theoretical analysis of the functioning of the financial markets contained in Chapter 12 of the General Theory has been duly stressed. The aim of this paper is to make detailed comparison of Keynes’s investment choices and strategies in the US stock market when he traded for himself and for King’s. As might be expected, there are similarities but also significant differences, well worth investigating. As far as the differences are concerned, one of the most striking is to be seen in his attitude when, after a period of bull market in 1936, he had to face the 1937 burst of the speculative bubble and subsequent recession. Detailed analysis of his behavior reveals that this event took him by surprise but his reaction differed with regard to his personal investments and the King’s investments. The prevalence of a ‘buy and hold’ strategy which, according to Chambers and Kabiri (2016), seemed to characterize his behavior in general when investing for King’s, was not always the typical choice when the investments were undertaken on his own account.
B31|The Comparative Statics of Effective Demand| Keynes introduces the term ‘effective demand’ in Chapter 3 of the General Theory as designating the point of intersection of two functions: the ‘aggregate demand function’ (D) and the ‘aggregate supply function’ (Z). For the first time in the literature, I here use specific functional forms for the D and Z functions and run numerical simulations which allow study of the comparative statics of the model in the face of various ‘shocks’. The demonstration of how the D/Z model actually works will hopefully prove useful for future students of the economics of Keynes.
B31|Gordon Tullock’s ill-fated appendix: “Flatland Revisited”|Abstract In an unpublished appendix to his Organization of Inquiry (“Flatland Revisited”) Gordon Tullock develops and extends ideas from both Ludwig von Mises and Karl Popper. We first discuss these commonalities and extensions, which center on the notions of necessary truth and reciprocity. Then we recover the manuscript history as well as comments from James Buchanan and provide an answer to the question of why the manuscript was never published.

Mindkét cikk vezérfonala, hogy Keynes egész tevékenysége és összes műve nyílegyenesen mutat utolsó vállalkozása és utolsó munkája: a Nemzetközi Valutaalap létrehozása és a nemzetközi gazdaság keynesi rendjének kialakítása felé. Ez ugyanolyan fontos, mint a keynesi általános elmélet, és joggal nevezhető Keynes általános nemzetközi elméletének. Mint köztudomású, Keynes Bretton Woodsban nem tudta elfogadtatni javaslatait; az ott tető alá hozott megállapodás nagyrészt az amerikai nézeteket megfogalmazó és képviselő Harry Dexter White elképzeléseinek felelt meg - ezért itt egyaránt szó lesz Keynes és White nézeteiről.

B31|How Germany’s anti-Keynesianism has brought Europe to its knees| This paper investigates the (lack of any lasting) impact of John Maynard Keynes’s General Theory on economic policy-making in Germany. The analysis highlights the interplay between economic history and the history of ideas in shaping policy-making in postwar (West) Germany. The paper argues that Germany learned the wrong lessons from its own history and misread the true sources of its postwar success. Monetary mythology and the Bundesbank, with its distinctive anti-inflationary bias, feature prominently in this collective odyssey. The analysis shows that the crisis of the euro today is largely the consequence of Germany’s peculiar anti-Keynesianism.
B31|Understanding Financialization: Standing on the Shoulders of Minsky|Since the death of Hyman Minsky in 1996, much has been written about financialization. This paper explores the issues that Minsky examined in the last decade of his life and considers their relationship to that financialization literature. Part I addresses Minsky's penetrating observations regarding what he called money manager capitalism. Part II outlines the powerful analytical framework that Minsky used to organize his thinking and that we can use to extend his work. Part III shows how Minsky's observations and framework represent a major contribution to the study of financialization. Part IV highlights two keys to Minsky's success: his treatment of economics as a grand adventure and his willingness to step beyond the world of theory. Part V concludes by providing a short recap, acknowledging formidable challenges facing scholars with a Minsky perspective, and calling attention to the glimmer of hope that offers a way forward.
B31|The Neoclassicals' Conundrum: If Adam Smith Is the Father of Economics, It Is a Bastard Child|Neoclassical economists of the current era frequently pay lip service to Adam Smith's theories to certify the validity of natural-laws-based, laissez-faire policies. However, neoclassical theories are fundamentally disconnected from Adam Smith's notion of value, his understanding of the economic individual and their interactions in society, his methodology, and the field of study he afforded to political economy. Instead, early neoclassical economists parted ways with the theories of Adam Smith in an effort to construct economic laws that would validate the existing capitalist order as universal, natural, and harmonious.
B31|Elementi di pensiero economico nello Stato commerciale chiuso di J. G. Fichte|"Questo scritto analizza i contributi dello Stato Commerciale Chiuso (1800) di Johann Gottlieb Fichte all'economia politica nel loro complesso. Presenta l'interpretazione del diritto di proprietÃ del filosofo tedesco come un a priori fondamentale del suo metodo economico. Quanto deriva da questa interpretazione - principalmente l'impianto di un'economia pianificata centralmente - appare il risultato di una costituzione economica ""razionale"" che perviene a un equilibrio di stampo socialista ma senza un calcolo economico esplicito. Il paper fornisce anche una nuova e diversa interpretazione dell'""anarchia dei mercati"" di Fichte, riconducendola a un esito derivante dal ""fallimento dei mercati"" stessi. Questi argomenti vengono discussi, infine, in una prospettiva comportamentale che giustifica l'attenzione di Fichte verso gli stili economici (Wirtschaftsstil) quale caratteristica tipica della tradizione economica tedesca."
B31|Jevons’s Ideal Role for Labor Unions as a Form of Co-operation|This research examines the ideas about labor unions found in William Stanley Jevons's works. I focus on the collaborative role Jevons envisioned for these organizations as part of a broader cooperative vision between workers and capitalists. Even though Jevons was not a supporter of labor unions and regarded them as monopolies with limited power to increase wages, on the one hand, and with great potential for generating dead losses of wages due strikes, on the other, he did not consider indispensable their elimination as long as they were guided to co-operate with business. This study concludes that there is more than one form of co-operation in Jevons’s thought. One explicit, from capitalist to workers, via profit sharing, and a second one, implicit, through the collaboration of workers to capitalists via their participation in labor organizations different than traditional labor unions. A major implication of this scheme is that both forms of co-operation have to be present for it to be beneficial for both classes. The latter, however, would not ensure that they are equally beneficiated.
B31|"A ""gung-ho"" Approach Towards Sophic Economy"|"The object of this study has been the Sophic Economy of Sergei Bulgakov ï¿½ an alternative and valuable philosophical-economic doctrine. At the beginning, facts-examples have been identified in a contemporary, social and purposely localized context (contemporary Italian society), demonstrating a certain potential sensibility towards the idea of Sophic Economy. Then, Bulgakovï¿½s thought has been expounded with a purposeful tone instead of the critical-purposeful frame originally used by Bulgakov himself in the volume Philosophy of Economy: the world as household. The quality of the examined content has raised the simple question, What about the dynamics of the diffusion of ideas like these? Employing what I call the ""gung-ho"" approach ï¿½ the researcherï¿½s imagination as a historical technique method that does not integrate the facts of the past but places them in a sort of laboratory-simulative environment model ï¿½ the idea of Sophic Economy has been inserted in NetLogoï¿½s Spreading Utopian Ideas Model. The popularization of an alternative philosophical doctrine and the proposal-experiment of an original method of historical research in Economics have been the main results of the present study."
B31|Against Samuelson’s Whig Interpretation of History of Economic Analysis and its Current Legitimation|The paper presents a negative view with respect to Paul Samuelson’s whig interpretation of history of economic analysis – to what he reduces historiography of economics, and actually against its current legitimation, seen in Medema and Waterman (2010) and Medema and Waterman, eds. (2014). The analysis is focused on the unity of Samuelson’s whig historical and theoretical approaches. The attention is drawn to a series of original methodological and theoretical views in his influential publications, identifying his position, which (views) as a matter of fact disprove his claim for ‘better’ whig interpretation of history of economic science. It is pointed out that it is not a mere idiosyncrasy of Samuelson’s contribution amongst the figures of post-World War II economics; it is an expression of the general tendency in mainstream economics to embody in its theory the whig historical approach.
B31|The grant element method of measuring the concessionality of loans and debt relief|The grant element is the “gift portion” of a financial transaction. The mathematical technique for arriving at a precise grant element percentage was first proposed by John Pincus of the RAND Corporation in 1963, and developed mathematically by Göran Ohlin of the Development Centre in 1966. Pincus also advocated expressing foreign aid in terms of its grant equivalent – i.e. the grant element expressed as a monetary value instead of a percentage. Grant element methodology was first used officially in 1969, in a target for softening the terms of aid. A grant element test was then introduced into the definition of official development assistance in 1972. Grant element methodology was subsequently applied to regulate the terms of export credits, to help assess the sustainability of developing country borrowing, and to calculate the level of debt relief and ensure comparability of effort in relevant Paris Club debt rescheduling operations. Central to grant element calculations is the selection of an appropriate discount rate to reflect financial market conditions. The present low interest rate environment raises challenges in this respect. This paper offers a layman’s introduction to the nature and mechanics of grant element methodology, and to the history of its application in practice.
B31|The Rural Economics of René de Girardin: Landscapes at the Service of l’Idéologie Nobiliaire|René-Louis de Girardin is remembered for having invited Rousseau at Ermenonville estate. Girardin believed it was necessary to further the debate on gardens on the basis of a principle of continuity that rejects any idea of enclosure. This made it possible to establish an agricultural model that increased production, and finally allowed the monopoly in grain sales to be broken. At the service of l’idéologie nobiliaire, his analysis shows the existence of a form of economic thinking in the second half of the 18th century that, giving primacy to agriculture, nevertheless cannot fall within the paths of physiocrats and agronomes.
B31|Commitment to norms and the formation of institutions|The paper discusses Searle's description of institutions in terms of deontological constitutive rules and collective recognition. It aims at integrating Searlian conception of commitment with an epistemology of rule-following capable to illustrate processes of formation of institutions. Social ontology per se cannot account for the formation of constitutive rules. Actually, it requires taking as given the object of collective recognition, i.e. the specific content of status functions. The hypothesis of interactive intentionality is introduced to account for the commitment to status functions as the result of an interactive decision-making process concerning alternative constitutive definitions. This interactive process, by acting on the normative interpretation of decision contexts, frames relevance and salience criteria and grounds the formation of institutions. Interactive intentionality hypothesis offers the opportunity to make social-ontological approach based on commitment theoretically commensurable with social-scientific approach based on equilibria and self-enforcement.
B31|Principles and Contributions of Total Quality Mangement (TQM) Gurus on Business Quality Improvement|Over the past few decades, Total Quality Management (TQM) gurus have been developed certain theories in the area of business quality improvement, which caused a huge paradigm shift in improving the quality of products and services. The main aim of this paper was to discuss regarding the key roles of TQM gurus such as Deming, Crosby, Juran, Feigenbaum, Ishikawa, and others in improving business quality within different organizations in 20th Century. Thus, a systematic literature review was performed to specify the concept of TQM principles and philosophies from the aforementioned TQM gurus. However, the literature review was provided invaluable insight on the understanding of the main ideas and philosophies proposed by these TQM gurus.
B31|The Legacy of Muhammad Hamidullah in Islamic Economics|"Dr. Muhammad Hamidullah is famous for his French translation of the Qur'an, and well-known for discovery, editing and bringing in light a number of rare and invaluable hadith manuscripts. He is also rightly acknowledged for his ground-breaking research works on international Islamic law, biography of the Prophet (peace be upon him), Islamic politics and archival heritage of Islam. A less known but significant aspect of his contribution is his pioneering works on Islamic Economics. Spread over more than fifty years he wrote scores of papers in English, Urdu, Arabic, French and Turkish. In fact it was he who coined the term ""Islamic Economics"" by which this discipline is known worldwide today. Many firsts in this subject belong to him. For instance: the first and the earliest record of the interest-free financial institution in the modern period, advocacy of mutuality as the basis for Islamic insurance, mutuality based Islamic finance, proposal for establishment of international interest-free monetary fund, federation of currencies for Muslim countries, etc. He also focused on topics such as nature of Islamic economic system, critiques of capitalism and communism, insurance, zakah and public finance, money and banking, partnership and equity finance, production and distribution, labor relations, et cetera. The present paper aims at introducing this aspect of his contribution and his legacy in Islamic economics."

B31|Economic philosophy of al-Mawardi: Review of economic behaviour in Islamic economic|Economic behaviour in the study of Islamic economics is the basis for the government to portray political ethics and ethical economic functions of individuals in functioning as a member of society. Secular ethics and religious ethics, according to al-Mawardi, as the code of conduct in conducting economic practices by the government and every member of society to uphold the principle of goodness. In the context of economic behaviour, the world ethics (adab al-dunya) and the religious ethics (adab al-din) became guidelines for economic actors in conducting business activities including other forms of cooperation or other muamalah practice.

These insights are vital, to understand Keynesian economics and its subsequent contributions in economic theory and economic policy.
B31|The Double Edge of Case-Studies: A Frame-Based Definition of Economic Models|Starting on the 1950s, the philosophy of science rearranged its methods. Logic gradually lost space as philosophers’ exclusive tool of analysis, whereas case-studies and historical methods emerged as viable instruments. However, the methodological transposition concealed a double-edged knife. The approximation of philosophy and scientific practice happened at the expense of exponentially widening the list of possible philosophical definitions for scientific concepts, creating numerous incomparable explanations. The present paper thus advocates in favor of the use of more objective tools for defining scientific concepts, looking to reduce incomparability of definitions. From this point of view, framing proposals are presented as suitable mechanisms for reasoned definitions, given that frames’ exemplar-dependency entail the necessity of organized selections of case-studies. In this context, community targeting understood as a limit of time and discipline for the selections of case-studies stood out as an organizational criterion. Considering this criterion, the present paper selected as case-studies, for defining the concept of an economic model, the first two cases where the term ‘model’ was utilized for referring to abstract economic reasoning. The proposed frame presented the following attributes: mathematical structure, adaptability, simplification, neutrality and purpose.
B31|Transforming the Abstract into Concrete: The Dual Semantic Roots of Economic Modelling|The existing connotation of models in economics emerged only in the XXth century, substituting the previous methodological terms: ‘scheme’, ‘diagram’ and ‘system’. This immature characteristic of economic models provokes important questions: when exactly and why schemes, diagrams, and systems became models? The purpose of the present paper is to look into the history of economic thought, searching for some explanations regarding these changes. The problem will be observed from a semantic point of view, reformulating a broad view of how the term was introduced. Considering this, the paper analyzes how the combination of cartesian and newtonian mathematics with psychological and empirical economics occurred, paving the way for the insertion of the term model into the jargon of economists in two different manners. The review shows that there were two semantic pioneers: Tinbergen (1935) and Von Neumann (1945). Both were the first economists to use the term ‘model’ for pure abstract reasoning in each of their respective methodologies.
B31|Evolutions and Contradictions in Mainstream Macroeconomics: The Case of Olivier Blanchard| This article traces the complex intellectual path of Olivier Blanchard, a personification of the controversial evolution of macroeconomic research over the last three decades. After contributing to consolidation of the core of mainstream macroeconomics, Blanchard recently suggested ‘rethinking’ some of its key aspects to take stock of the lessons of the 2008 Great Recession, which he witnessed as the International Monetary Fund’s Chief Economist. This welcome discussion, which according to Blanchard should open mainstream macroeconomics to heterodox thinking, has so far produced a certainly interesting albeit theoretically contradictory synthesis and limited policy consequences. The most paradigmatic aspect of this rethinking of macroeconomics is represented by the abandonment in teaching of aggregate supply and demand in favor of a revival of the IS–LM model complemented by the Phillips curve. While this change of perspective does allow for the instability of ‘natural’ equilibrium to be emphasized, a deeper reading may prove incompatible with the neoclassical foundations of the mainstream approach.
B31|Heterogeneity of habits as a foundation for Schumpeterian economic policy|Abstract In this paper, we highlight the heterogeneity of agents in Schumpeter’s theory. Because of its centrality in Schumpeter’s theory, we argue that agent heterogeneity should also be a key element for economic policy informed by Schumpeter’s theory. Schumpeter considered agents’ habits as a particularly important source of heterogeneity. We show how Schumpeter’s notion of habits is closely related to modern work on habits, and draw on recent research to elaborate theory that can provide the foundation for Schumpeterian economic policy. We argue that heterogeneity of habits can be a crucial building block and foundation of Schumpeterian economic policy: it offers a target for policy interventions that is different from incentives or information. This target is potentially as powerful as incentives or information, which only influence intentions rather than influencing behavior directly.
B31|Kautilya, Fibonacci and Samuelson on Discounting|The concept of discounting plays an important role in allowing efficientÂ inter-temporal choices. William Goetzmann (2004) claims that FibonacciÂ (1202/2002) introduced discounting. (i) It is shown that Fibonacci did notÂ understand the concept of discounting or its relevance and his Liber Abaci is aÂ book only of calculations and not of concepts. (ii) It is claimed that Kautilya (4thÂ century BCE) originated the concept of discounting and inter-temporal analysis.Â (iii) More importantly, relevance of his insight to todayâ€™s world is brought out.Â According to Kautilya, it was possible to reduce the risk premium by making rareÂ disasters rarer.

B31|Albert Hirschman, Lauchlin Currie, 'linkages' theory, and Paul Rosenstein Rodan's 'big push'|This paper introduces a hitherto unpublished 1970 paper written by the distinguished development economist Lauchlin Currie (1902-93) on Paul Rosenstein Rodanâ€™s famous 1943 paper on the â€œBig Pushâ€ which led to the balanced-unbalanced growth debate to which Albert Hirschman (1915-2012) was an important contributor. Both Currie and Hirschman had been key economic advisers to the Colombian government and their respective views on development planning are contrasted. In particular, it is shown how Currieâ€™s 1970 paper illuminates the theory behind the 1971-74 national plan for Colombia that he prepared and helped deliver; and how the related institutional innovations have had an enduring impact on Colombiaâ€™s recent economic history.
B31|Advanced or postponed wage payments: Sraffa validates Marx|In his theoretical model of production prices Marx follows the classical economists in treating wages as being paid in advance. Sraffa, instead, tends to treat them as being paid post factum. However, when Marx tackles the problem under less abstract scrutiny, he abandons the classical approach and declares that, as a matter of fact, wages are postponed. We prove that, if the period of postponed wage payment differs from the length of the production process, the correct prices are better approximated by an equation with the full post-payment of wages than by one with full pre-payment. Under perfect competition and postponed wage payments, Sraffa’s approach to price determination is the correct one, and validates Marx’s non-classical vision, whatever the period of wage payment.

B31|"The ""dark ages"" of German macroeconomics and other alleged shortfalls in German economic thought"|"Ordoliberalism is often accused as being responsible for Germany's policy stance during the Eurozone crisis. Ordoliberalism originates from the so-called Freiburg School of Economics, founded by Walter Eucken during the 1930s at the University of Freiburg, which is in fact in Germany. It is however neither true that ordoliberal thought has continuously been predominant and a prevailing idea in German macroeconomic policy, nor that it is responsible for Germany's policy stance during the crisis in EMU. In this paper, we show why a proper analysis must arrive at this conclusion by referring to Eucken's thinking and the development of German ordoliberalism across time in relation to the ""Rules vs. Discretion"" debate and to Constitutional Economics. Although ordoliberalism may have had some influence on the design of EMU, pragmatism, the status-quo and national interests are dominant in German economic policy."

B31|Retrospectives: Do Productive Recessions Show the Recuperative Powers of Capitalism? Schumpeter's Analysis of the Cleansing Effect|"Schumpeter has often been interpreted as a ""liquidationist,"" someone who is convinced that economic crises are necessary and unavoidable, and thus that government nonintervention is a sound policy in such crises. The first two sections of this paper discuss Schumpeter's views in greater detail and suggest that categorizing him as a ""liquidationist"" is an oversimplification and as an unrepentant ""noninterventionist"" is incorrect. Although Schumpeter was certainly not a strong supporter of public interventions, he did see a role for public expenditure programs in particular circumstances. During periods of recession, Schumpeter believed firmly in what he described as the ""recuperative powers of capitalism."" However, when a depression becomes ""pathological,"" there could be a role for government to intervene. In order to understand the overall picture of Schumpeter's message, we will first try to explain Schumpeter's analysis of recessions, depressions, and the other stages of business cycles. We will also discuss how Schumpeter perceived the recuperative powers of capitalism, a core concept in Schumpeter's analysis that allows him to distinguish between physiological and pathological recessions. In the 1990s, an active line of research examined the possibility that recessions may have a productive character along with their more obvious negative outcomes, because recessions in some way might hasten the process of reallocating economic recourses from slower-growth to faster-growth sectors. Such models were sometimes referred to as ""neo-Schumpeterian,"" but given our analysis of Schumpeter's work, we will question whether this label is appropriate."
B31|Allan Meltzer’s Model of the Transmission Mechanism and Its Implications for Today|Allan Meltzer developed his model of the monetary transmission mechanism in research conducted with Karl Brunner. The Brunner-Meltzer model implies that the Federal Reserve would benefit from drawing brighter lines between monetary and fiscal policy actions, eschewing credit market intervention and focusing, instead, on using its control over the monetary base to stabilize the aggregate price level. The model downplays the importance of the zero lower interest rate bound and suggests a greater role for monetary aggregates in the Fed’s policymaking strategy. Finally, it highlights the benefits that accrue when policy is conducted according to a rule rather than discretion.

B31|A questão das secas e o desenvolvimento econômico no semiárido brasileiro em Hirschman e Furtado: contribuições para uma discussão sobre resiliência econômica na região|This paper aims to analyze the economic resilience of Brazil’s semiarid region to the phenomenon of droughts. Specifically, the work proposal was to use Hirschman and Furtado analysis about economic development and the issues of droughts in Brazilian Northeast to build a notion of evolutionary resilience to droughts on the region. The paper focus on political and institutional aspects as determinants of the regional resilience by studying the governmental action against this environmental shock. It shows how this economy have become a vulnerable and few resistant system, non-able to learn and adapt from shocks, that is, a non-resilient regional economy.
B31|New starting point(s) : Marx, technological revolutions and changes in the centre-periphery divide|This paper investigates Marx's understanding of the connections between technological revolutions and the centre-periphery divide. Marx's initial elaboration on those topics may be helpful for a contemporary agenda to investigate how global capitalism has been shaped and reshaped by movements in this structural divide between a dynamic centre and a changing periphery. Technological revolutions have been shaping the structure of that divide, its nature and structure. Therefore, Marx's elaboration may be fruitful for both the understanding of the origin and the dynamics of technological revolutions and their impact upon the divide centre-periphery.
B31|Toward understanding 17th century English culture: A structural topic model of Francis Bacon's ideas|We use machine-learning methods to study the features and origins of the ideas of Francis Bacon, a key figure who provided the intellectual roots of a cultural paradigm that spurred modern economic development. Bacon's works are the data in an estimation of a structural topic model, a recently developed methodology for analysis of text corpora. The estimates uncover sixteen topics prominent in Bacon's opus. Two are key elements of the ideas usually associated with Bacon—inductive epistemology and fact-seeking. The utilitarian promise of science and the centralized organization of the scientific quest, embraced by Bacon's followers, were not emphasized by him. Using strategic communication, Bacon facilitated reception of his scientific methodology, targeted influential groups, and finessed powerful opponents. We provide the first quantitative evidence that the genesis of Bacon's epistemology lies in his experience in the common-law. Combining our findings with accepted arguments in the existing literature, we suggest that the effects of common-law culture can help explain the coincidence of early political and economic development in England.
B31|Friedman's Presidential Address in the Evolution of Macroeconomic Thought|"Milton Friedman's presidential address, ""The Role of Monetary Policy,"" which was delivered 50 years ago in December 1967 and published in the March 1968 issue of the American Economic Review, is unusual in the outsized role it has played. What explains the huge influence of this work, merely 17 pages in length? One factor is that Friedman addresses an important topic. Another is that it is written in simple, clear prose, making it an ideal addition to the reading lists of many courses. But what distinguishes Friedman's address is that it invites readers to reorient their thinking in a fundamental way. It was an invitation that, after hearing the arguments, many readers chose to accept. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to view Friedman's 1967 AEA presidential address as marking a turning point in the history of macroeconomic research. Our goal here is to assess this contribution, with the benefit of a half-century of hindsight. We discuss where macroeconomics was before the address, what insights Friedman offered, where researchers and central bankers stand today on these issues, and (most speculatively) where we may be heading in the future."
B31|Los orígenes del neoestructuralismo latinoamericano|La Región Centro de México se constituyó en el espacio demográfico y económico protagónicEste ensayo propone dar cuenta de la ambigüedad del concepto ´neostructuralismo´ cuando se le analiza a partir de la óptica de la obra de Osvaldo Sunkel; no obstante, ello no excluye una posible reconstrucción del término a partir de una reflexión en torno a sus autores “primigenios” y los respectivos vocabularios sobre el ´estructuralismo´. Sin embargo, el concepto ´neostructuralismo´ no armoniza necesariamente con la obra de Sunkel y, paradójicamente, tampoco con la obra de Raúl Prebisch antes del primer lustro de la década de 1970, sino hasta la publicación de la obra “Capitalismo perife´ rico, crisis y transformacio´ n”. Por lo tanto, la excursión conceptual que hacemos sobre el ´estructuralismo´ y el ´neostructuralismo´ da a entender que este último es fruto del progreso teórico dentro del pensamiento latinoamericano, bajo la singularidad con que Sunkel se integró al mismo.
B31|The Quarrel of Development Experts: Lauchlin Currie and Albert O. Hirschman in Colombia|Lauchlin Currie y Albert O. Hirschman trabajaron juntos en Colombia durante los años cincuenta como asesores del Consejo Nacional de Planificación. A su llegada, contaban con poca experiencia en desarrollo económico y nunca concordaron en las recomendaciones de política del Consejo ni en su funcionamiento. Rastrear estos debates en asuntos internos y públicos permite mostrar cómo la experiencia colombiana marcó sus posiciones sobre el papel del asesor de políticas, las políticas y los obstáculos del proceso de desarrollo. Nuestra principal contribución es mostrar cómo esta experiencia enriqueció sus teorías sobre el desarrollo, las cuales evolucionaron de discusiones técnicas sobre la mecánica del crecimiento a la adopción de una estrategia de desarrollo capaz de lidiar con problemas de economía política.
B31|Alexis de Tocqueville sobre el pauperismo o las promesas incumplidas de la Revolución democrática|Alexis de Tocqueville, más conocido por su análisis del Antiguo Régimen y la democracia, también fue un hombre político y parlamentario. En 1848, antes y después de la Revolución de febrero, Tocqueville en sus intervenciones frente a la Asamblea, advierte sobre las implicaciones políticas y sociales de la cuestión social. La situación de los trabajadores asalariados debía ser prioridad si Francia pretendía preservar el carácter liberal de la Revolución de 1789. La democracia, con su promesa de igualdad y oportunidades para todos, se quedaba corta frente a las aspiraciones de esta nueva clase trabajadora, fuente excluida de la prosperidad social. Tanto en sus intervenciones como en sus dos memorias sobre el pauperismo, Tocqueville hace un llamado urgente a ocuparse de la paradoja de las democracias industriales: el empobrecimiento de los trabajadores asalariados en medio del enriquecimiento del resto de la sociedad.
B31|Political Economics and Possibilism: Towards an Open Notion of Development|Hirschman was both a pioneer and a dissenter of development economics. He shares with the high theory the virtues and misfortunes of committing to modernize the underdeveloped world, but his exposure to the politics of development in Latin America gave new life to his early insights. Revealing the political dimensions of his concepts on economic development, Hirschman provides some mini-building blocks for a political economics consistent with an open notion of development. This inquiry, however, should not be seen exclusively through a methodological lens; it is grounded on his possibilism, a claim about modernity and the possibility of change. This article reconsiders the legacy of Hirschman’s thought for current debates on development and calls for recuperating his commitment to open societies.
B31|Business Cycles, Growth, And Economic Policy: Schumpeter And The Great Depression|Joseph A. Schumpeter’s theory of economic development analyzes how growth and cycle dynamics intertwine. The process of Creative Destruction plays an essential role in that dynamics: embodying a cleaning effect, it has a clear beneficial impact on long-run development. For that reason, and also for some of his famous (and provocative) non-interventionists statements, Schumpeter is generally interpreted as a pure liquidationist. This paper contests this rather simplistic view and shows that Schumpeter not only expressed much more nuanced positions as far as practical economic issues were concerned but also that his views on economic policy were rooted in his earlier contributions before the Great Depression, attesting that Schumpeter’s view on economic policy was consistent over time.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

I will divide this survey of Roland's research into five categories: the racial achievement gap, education policies and reforms, economics of social interactions, the economics of discrimination and anti-discrimination policies, and further topics involving the black-white racial divide.
B31|Retrospectives: How Economists Came to Accept Expected Utility Theory: The Case of Samuelson and Savage|Expected utility theory dominated the economic analysis of individual decision-making under risk from the early 1950s to the 1990. Among the early supporters of the expected utility hypothesis in the von Neumann–Morgenstern version were Milton Friedman and Leonard Jimmie Savage, both based at the University of Chicago, and Jacob Marschak, a leading member of the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics. Paul Samuelson of MIT was initially a severe critic of expected utility theory. Between mid-April and early May 1950, Samuelson composed three papers in which he attacked von Neumann and Morgenstern's axiomatic system. By 1952, however, Samuelson had somewhat unexpectedly become a resolute supporter of the expected utility hypothesis. Why did Samuelson change his mind? Based on the correspondence between Samuelson, Savage, Marschak, and Friedman, this article reconstructs the joint intellectual journey that led Samuelson to accept expected utility theory and Savage to revise his motivations for supporting it.
B31|"John Bloch’s ""The Future of War."" Pacifism Based on Economics"|John Bloch (1839–1902) was a railroad tycoon, banker, social activist, philanthropist and man of science. He was shortlisted for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1902 for his multi-volume work entitled The Future of War in its Technical, Economic and Political Relations, which was dubbed ‘the bible of pacifism.’ Thanks to his multilayered activities he perfectly fits the positivist ideals of his time. Despite this, due to the course of history and ‘unfavourable circumstances’ for featuring his figure, for decades he was largely forgotten. The goal of this article is to present Jon Bloch and his works in the fields of entrepreneurship, science and most of all his attempts in aid of peace. I will present his major pacifist hypotheses and arguments which are included in his work The Future of War. The author substituted the usual religious and humanitarian arguments in aid of peace, with economic assertions. Published in many languages, the book became essential reading for the intellectuals and politicians at the break of 20th c., while Bloch gained the nickname of ‘the father of contemporary pacifism.’ In order to verify the legitimacy of this claim I will contrast Bloch’s work to a work entitled The Great Illusion, by Norman Angell. Published in 1909, eleven years after the first publication of The Future of War, Angell’s The Great Illusion is wellknown to the Anglo-Saxon readership.

B31|Directed Technical Change and Capital Deepening: A Reconsideration of Kaldor's Technical Progress Function|This note proposes a growth model that is derived from the standard Solow growth model by replacing the neoclassical production function with Kaldor’s technical progress function while maintaining a marginalist theory of factor prices in the spirit suggested by von Weizsäcker (1966, 1966b). The hybrid model so obtained accounts for balanced growth in a way that appears less arbitrary than the Solow model, especially because it directly accounts for Harrod neutral technical change, without any need for further assumptions.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B31|The economist quae political economist: Lionel Robbins and the economic adivisory council|This paper assesses Robbins's participation in the Economic Advisory Council in 1930, drawing mostly on The Lionel Robbins Papers held atthe LSE. The divergences between him and Keynes are highlighted and an attempt is made to shed some light on Robbins' overarching interest on the interplay of economics as a science and political economy as a broader field that includes normative considerations. This renders invalid criticisms related to the absence of ethical considerations in Robbins' approach to economics. Specifically, some elements that would resurface in Robbins' later works are identified, and it is argued that the Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science should be situated within his larger purpose of illuminating the extent to which the science of economics could serve as an important tool – necessary, though not sufficient –to orient the formulation of public policies.
B31|Lionel Robbins’ first-step individualism and the prehistory of microfoundations|Robbins belongs to the prehistory of microfoundations, for his definition of economics helped to buttress the centrality that individual choice acquired after the Second World War. This, however, was an unintended effect of his seminal Essay. Our claim is that, underlying his definition of economics, a novel approach to methodological individualism is advanced, in which the isolated individual plays the role of a temporary device. The economic man is but a first step in order to analyze more complex social phenomena. More specifically, three types of methodological individualism are outlined and it is argued that Robbins’ approach cannot be classified as any of them; we thus propose a different category, that of ‘first-step individualism’. Robbins’ rationale for focusing on the isolated individual is not that social phenomena can be reduced to individual behaviour, but rather that this is the best starting point for economics, if it is to progress and be able to deal with more complex phenomena in the future.
B31|Academic exclusion: some experiences|Abstract We describe and compare the experiences of academic exclusion of Alexander Del Mar, J.A. Hobson, and Gordon Tullock. While aspects of the circumstances differed, a common element was academic exclusion because of challenges to mainstream views. Alexander Del Mar, J.A. Hobson, and Gordon Tullock were in due course recognized for the originality and merit of their contributions, although each incurred personal costs because of the exclusion by the academic elites of their time. Our study takes us into the role of ideologically based prejudice in judgment of the worthiness of economic ideas.
B31|On Lionel McKenzie's 1957 intrusion into 20th-century demand theory|In this essay, we read McKenzie's 17 paragraphs of 1957 on Demand Theory Without a Utility Index as an opening to the narrative of 20th-century demand theory and as a lever for the understanding of what has now reached culmination as the neoclassical theory of demand. In tracking the influence of these paragraphs on both theoretical and applied work, we also use them as a foothold for reflection on the process of theorizing to argue for the view that one cannot neglect the (changing) problematic that the theory is adduced to address, that the historical narrative behind a particular theorem is indispensable in understanding the theorem itself. This implicit theorizing of the process of theorizing then forces us to consider Stigler's distinction between textual and scientific exegesis and confront it to a second-order level of theorizing, and thereby bring out the continuity, possibly not quite seamless, between a theorem and its history.
B31|On the Possibility of Justice in Commercial Society according to Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith|Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith stand on opposite sides regarding their appraisal of commercial society. The citizen of Geneva is known as one of its most harsh critiques, whereas the Scottish philosopher is considered as one of its main advocates. However, both authors coincide on one aspect: justice is the main pillar of any society. In this text, I explore this point in order to advance our understanding about the contrast between these two major figures.
B31|Ochenta Años de la Teoría General 1936-2016|Este ensayo celebra los ochenta años de la Teoría General (1936-2016). El objetivo principal es resaltar el principio de la demanda efectiva como la más grande contribución teórica de JM Keynes a la economía para explicar el nivel del PIB y el empleo, en la economía capitalista, y sus fluctuaciones. Además, se hace hincapié en el capítulo 24, donde se analizan los problemas de la distribución del ingreso y la riqueza, en relación con el nivel de la demanda efectiva. Los altos niveles de desempleo y los bajos niveles de PIB que sufre la economía mundial, desde la crisis de 2008 hasta hoy, se han enfrentado con la eliminación o reducción del gasto gubernamental. Esta situación significa una gran inseguridad económica para millones de personas que no solo tienen que enfrentar el desempleo cíclico, sino también el desempleo tecnológico, con una mayor desigualdad del ingreso. Este no es un mundo keynesiano; éste es un mundo infeliz.
B31|Raúl Prebisch: historia, pensamiento y vigencia de la teoría de la transformación para el desarrollo de América Latina|Raúl Prebisch fue sin duda uno de los economistas más reconocidos e influyentes de América Latina, tanto por sus aportes teóricos para el desarrollo de la región como por su participación en la creación institucional. En este trabajo nos proponemos repasar en forma paralela su vida y pensamiento, destacando los principales debates en los que se vio involucrado. Nos interesa, en particular, resaltar el legado de sus últimas obras, donde completó su teoría sobre el desarrollo latinoamericano a la luz de la vasta experiencia obtenida en su larga trayectoria académica y profesional.
B31|Milton Friedman y sus visitas a Chile|This essay describes the main circumstances, facts and consequences of Milton Friedman’s two visits to Chile, in 1975 and 1981. Both visits are analyzed and the relationship between economic freedom and political liberty developed by Friedman is emphasized.
B31|Survival Value And A Robust, Practical, Joyless Individualism: Thomas Nixon Carver, Social Justice, And Eugenics|The aim of this paper is to provide a compressive assessment of Thomas Nixon Carver’s thought - from his early formative years in the 1880s to his post WWII career as a journalist and pamphleteer. The main (albeit not exclusive) focus of this paper will be on the theoretical and philosophical coordinates of Carver’s “new liberalism” - his own definition - and how this broad vision was intrinsically connected with an explicit hierarchical and eugenic approach to human nature. Just as important, what follows is also an attempt to increase our general understanding of the extent in which eugenic considerations permeated the realm of political economy during the first decades of the last century and how, in some specific cases as that of Carver, this influence persisted after the end of the Progressive Era.
B31|Wieser As A Theorist Of Institutional Change|In this contribution, we provide an interpretation of Friedrich von Wieser’s contribution to economics, which that pays tribute to the originality of his work, and particularly to his view of how institutions interfere with individual behavior. This interaction takes place within a disequilibrium framework where social influences such as power or social class, and psychological factors such as force of habit or herd behavior, are the product of human action but also constitute constraints on further action. The sectionSection 1 II stresses the institutionalist background of Wieser’s economics. We concentrate on Wieser’s general method— – which we assimilate to an example of Joseph Agassi’s (1975) institutional individualism— – and his analysis of the emergence and evolution of institutions via the dynamics of leaders and masses. In the section 2III, we reinforce and illustrate the ‘institutionalist’ stamp of Wieser’s economics by focusing on his work on monetary economics (Wieser 1904, 1909a, 1909b, 1927b) and his analysis of the emergence of money, based on our reading of Wieser’s Social Economics (Wieser [1927a] 1967) and The Law of Power (Wieser [1926] 1983).

B31|Choice-based cardinal utility: a tribute to Patrick Suppes| We reexamine some of the classic problems connected with the use of cardinal utility functions in decision theory, and discuss Patrick Suppes’ contributions to this field in light of a reinterpretation we propose for these problems. We analytically decompose the doctrine of ordinalism, which only accepts ordinal utility functions, and distinguish between several doctrines of cardinalism, depending on what components of ordinalism they specifically reject. We identify Suppes’ doctrine with the major deviation from ordinalism that conceives of utility functions as representing preference differences, while being nonetheless empirically related to choices. We highlight the originality, promises and limits of this choice-based cardinalism.
B31|Raúl Prebisch y la dinámica económica: crecimiento cíclico e interacción entre el centro y la periferia|Prebisch pensaba que para comprender la evolución de las economías capitalistas en el tiempo y en diferentes contextos se requería una teoría general del ciclo que abarcara las diferentes áreas de la actividad económica, a la que denominó “dinámica económica”. Esta teoría, elaborada entre 1945 y 1949, surgió como crítica de las teorías neoclásica y keynestiana, que Prebisch consideraba representaciones estáticas del capitalismo. Se aplicó primero a una economía cerrada y luego a un contexto de centro-periferia. En ella se combinaba la noción de que los beneficios son la fuerza motriz de la actividad económica, con un proceso de ahorro forzado y la idea de que el desfase temporal entre la circulación de ingresos (y la consiguiente demanda) y la finalización del proceso productivo constituyen la principal fuente de fluctuaciones cíclicas. La teoría dinámica de Prebisch, que nunca llegó a completar, influyó en la elaboración del “Manifiesto” (Prebisch, 1949). PALABRAS
B31|Raúl Prebisch and economic dynamics: cyclical growth and centre-periphery interaction|Prebisch believed that understanding the evolution of capitalist economies over time and in different contexts required a general cycle approach, encompassing all the different areas of economic activity, which he labelled “economic dynamics.” This theory, developed between 1945 and 1949, stemmed from a critique of both neoclassical and Keynesian theories, which Prebisch viewed as static representations of capitalism. It was applied first to a closed economy and then to a centre-periphery context. The theory combined the notion that profit is the driving force of economic activity, with a process of forced savings and the idea that the time lag between income circulation (and the resulting demand) and the completion of the production process are the main source of cyclical fluctuations. Prebisch’s dynamics theory, which he never completed, influenced his “development manifesto” (Prebisch, 1950).
B31|On a forest as a commodity and on commodification in the discipline of forestry|This essay revolves around two dates separated by a decade: a retrospective look based on Samuelson (1976), and a prospective one that relies on Mitra-Wan (1985–1986). It concerns a tension between two communities: to understand the basis of this dissonance, and to open lines of communication that seek to dispel it. More specifically, it relies on two frameworks (Walrasian general equilibrium theory, as in Arrow-Debreu-McKenzie-Uzawa-Gale-Nikaido-Kuhn and others, and the Ramseyian theory of optimal growth, as in Samuelson-Solow-Cass-Koopmans-Uzawa-Srinivasan and others), formalized and continually refined in the last half of the 20th century to deal with interaction and with time, both essential considerations in any kind of economics of forestry. It also gives prominence to the Muir- Pinchot controversy at the very beginning of the 20th century, and thereby underscores its relevance to current ongoing tensions and anxieties regarding issues of sustainability and global-warming. From a purely analytical point of view, it alludes in passing to the potential relevance to forestry economics of mean field theories in physics, and of subgame-perfect equilibria in the theory of non-cooperative games.
B31|F. A. Hayek and the economic calculus|"The paper offers a revisionist account of certain episodes in the development of F. A. Hayek's thought. It offers a new reading of his 1937 paper, ""Economics and Knowledge,"" that draws on unpublished lecture notes in which he articulated more fully the distinctions he made in the paper between a ""pure logic of choice,"" or the economic calculus, and an ""empirical element,"" which he would later call the competitive market order. Next, the paper shows that Hayek continued to try to develop his ideas about the role of the economic calculus through the 1950s and early 1960s, an effort that has been missed because it never led to any published work. Finally, the paper examines Hayek's attempt to articulate a theory of the market process, one that would be at the same level of generality as the economic calculus, in lectures he gave at the University of Virginia. He never developed a full-fledged formal theory, but his failed efforts still bore fruit in leading him to his contributions on spontaneous orders and the (verbal) theory of complex phenomena. This work anticipated contributions by others who were more technically trained."
B31|Curried Keynesianism meets the master: Lauchlin Currie's memorandum on The General Theory for the Federal Reserve Board|This short paper introduces Lauchlin Currie's unpublished memorandum to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve discussing Keynes's General Theory. The memorandum falls short of a full review of Keynes's magnum opus, but together with other published material it provides a picture of Keynesian ideas within the Fed during the Great Depression. It is suggested that Currie's views on Keynes are relevant, in particular because, contrary to what would become the dominant view, he does not think that wage or interest-rate rigidity is at the heart of the Keynesian results.
B31|Keynes's attack on the citadel: proportionality, the two-price theory, and monetary circulation|In the Treatise, Keynes claimed that the price levels of consumption and investment goods would not necessarily move in opposite directions. He further argued that the first claim had nothing to do with monetary circulation. If these two claims could be established, they would have constituted a direct attack on Ricardian economics and the economics of Marx, both of which are identified as self-adjustment mechanisms as in Say's law by Keynes. This paper seeks to evaluate these claims through the lenses of sector balance, the two-price theory, and monetary circulation.

B31|Antonio de Viti de Marco as a Political Commentator in the Daily Press|The Italian economist Antonio de Viti de Marco is well known as the founder of the pure theory of Public Finance, and as one of the inspirators of Public Choice. However, outside Italy nothing is known about his political commitment, an aspect that was truly important for him and closely linked to his scientific work. This paper explores his collaboration with daily newspapers in the context of early 20th century Italy, in order to project information beyond Italy’s borders about his political role.
B31|Montchrétien Founder of Political Economy|Montchrétien is still appreciated as a literate and author of tragedies, but is gravely neglected as an economist. His book - Traité de l’économie politique (1615) - is one of the most important expression of mercantilism. Like for the other mercantilists, Montchrétien’s main concern was development through the expansion on manufactures, the organisation of the poor for labour, the increase of exportations and a keen economic competition with the other states. Montchrétien enriches his arguments by drawing from his immense erudition about far and recent history, mythology and also a detailed and deep knowledge of the social and economic problems of his time. But his most important achievement was the foundation of modern political economy as different from ancient household economy. Contrary to the common conviction that the title of his book was just an unintentional chance, we are set to show that Montchrétien was perfectly aware of the main features of the new economic science: management of social wealth in the public interest, growth of social wealth and a general welfare as the main aim, balance between private and public interest. Private interest is the spring of enrichment; its protection is the source of individual rights and of liberty. Public interest must ensure equal rights, welfare and protection of the poor.
B31|Nation-World: Autarky and Geo-economics in Montchrétien’s Traicté|In his Traicté de l’oeconomie politique (1615), Antoine de Montchrétien proposed a model of development, based on an autarkic economy, formulating analytical and political alternative to increasing integration of world trade, which in the seventeenth century was under Dutch and English hegemony. Montchrétien’s response to the problem of world trade integration focused on the establishment of a French colonial empire, completely self-sufficient and closed to international trade. Montchrétien proposed an “economic nationalism” connecting politics and the economy, in a perspective that would be called geo-economic, pitting nationalism against globalization to avoid the failure in international trade competition that could threaten the political survival and independence of the country’s national interests. This paper explores the analytical frameworks of Montchrétien’s autarkic model, which constitutes an exception in the 17th century literature, which is focused on the idea of commercial supremacy and the gains of trade in a context of international competition.
B31|Econometrics as a Pluralistic Scientific Tool for Economic Planning: On Lawrence R. Klein's Econometrics|Lawrence R. Klein (1920-2013) played a major role in the construction and in the further dissemination of econometrics from the 1940s. Considered as one the main developers and practitioners of macroeconometrics, Klein's influence is reflected in his application of econometric modelling “to the analysis of economic fluctuations and economic policies” for which he was awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel in 1980. The purpose of this paper is to give an account of Klein's image of econometrics focusing on his early period as an econometrician (1944-1950), and more specifically on his period as a Cowlesman (1944-1947). Independently of how short this period might appear, it contains a set of fundamental publications and events, which were decisive for Klein's conception of econometrics, and which formed Klein's unique way of doing econometrics. At least four features are worth mentioning, which characterise this uniqueness. First, Klein was the only Cowlesman who carried on the macroeconometric programme beyond the 1940s, even if the Cowles had already abandoned it. Second, his pluralistic approach in terms of economic theory allowed him not only to use the Walrasian framework appraised by the Cowles Commission and especially by T.C. Koopmans, but also the Marxian and Keynesian frameworks, enriching the process of model specification and motivating economists of different stripes to make use of the nascent econometrics. Third, Klein differentiated himself from the rigid methodology praised at Cowles; while the latter promoted the use of highly sophisticated methods of estimation, Klein was convinced that institutional reality and economic intuition would contribute more to econometrics than the sophistication of these statistical techniques. Last but not least, Klein never gave up what he thought was the political objective of econometrics: economic planning and social reform
B31|Wassily Leontief and the discovery of the input-output approach|The paper is about Wassily Leontief’s path towards the discovery of input-output economics, published in the Review of Economic Statistics in 1936 and 1937 and in the 1941 monograph The Structure of American Economy, 1919-1929. The aim has more specifically been to look more closely into how Leontief’s discovery was rooted in earlier career and experience. The paper sets out an account of Leontief’s life from his childhood and youth in St. Petersburg, his study years in Berlin, his research experience at the Institute of World Economics in Kiel, and the circumstances that brought him to the United States in 1931 and to Harvard shortly afterwards.
B31|Antonio De Viti de Marco, political competition, and the principle of minimum means|De Viti de Marco is generally regarded as one of the most eminent scholars of the early Italian public finance tradition. This paper presents a new interpretation of his thought with respect to the prevailing literature. In particular, an original perspective is provided for three main themes. The first is the consistency of De Viti’s theory of the state, that is presented as a coherent but naïf structure founded on the principle of minimum means and on political competition. The second suggests that his reflections on concrete problems are clearly independent from his theoretical framework, which still presents some features that may have application in modern democratic states. Finally, it is argued that, even if De Viti’s role in spreading the marginal analysis in Italy remains unquestioned, he seldom employed marginal tools in his analysis, and that he was more closely related with classical economics, rather than with the real approach of marginal analysis.
B31|Decision Making And Saint Petersburg Paradox: Focusing On Heuristic Parameters, Considering The Non-Ergodic Context And The Gambling Risks|The Saint Petersburg Paradox is still a contemporary issue because of the great impact on the probabilistic theory and decision-making. This article proposes some hints on avoiding the trap of the infinite expected value (EV). The highly stochastic mechanism and its EV have always to be contextualized in the limited period where we take our choices taking into account all possible limitations deriving from the theory (including the non-ergodic features and some inappropriate consequences we may attribute to the EV). This contextualisation is one of the most important factors to consider especially when we deal with infinite quantity coming from models that may misrepresent our field of application and therefore generate paradoxes.
B31|From Abstraction to Phenomenology in Social Theory: Yanis Varoufakis the Economist|This document contains the text of the academic 'laudatio' delivered by IUC Academic Coordinator Ugo Mattei, upon appointing Yanis Varoufakis a Honorary Professor of the IUC in March 2016. The address presents an overview of Yanis Varoufakis' intellectual development and trajectory, to demonstrate how the latter fulfils the motivations underpinning his honorary appointment, namely: (i) Varoufakis' denunciation, informed by disciplinary acumen, of the theoretical and practical failure of the current mainstream approach in economics; (i) his deep theoretical contribution to the discipline of Political Economy through the recovery of the humanistic thought of Karl Marx; (iii) his lucid analysis of the reasons for the collapse of austerity policies in Europe and elsewhere; (iv) his vivid demonstration of the fallacy â€“ also theoretical â€“ of the extractive financial policies that victimize the working classes, the poor and the commons in Europe; (v) the clarity, in his theoretical work, about the incompatibility with the democratic ideal of a macroeconomic framework devoid of government instruments able to cushion the shock to the markets imposed by the capitalist mode of production in the absence of regulation and control of financial speculation.
B31|Hayek’s monetary theory and policy: A note on alleged inconsistency|Challenging the dominant view, we claim that Hayek’s monetary views did not significantly change over his lifetime. The prevalent perception of early Hayek as a money stream stabilizer and late Hayek as a price level stabilizer is attributable to an unjustified normative interpretation of Hayek’s positive analysis. We argue that in his contributions to monetary theory, Hayek took the goals of monetary policy as exogenously given and analysed the efficiency of different means of achieving them. Hayek’s allegedly inconsistent transformation from a critic to an advocate of price level stabilization is explained by a change of issues under his focus, rather than by a change in his positive views. We also claim that Hayek was always aware that every practical monetary policy involves difficult trade-offs and that he was therefore reluctant to impose his own value judgments on what people should strive for.

B31|Keynes életútja és a Nemzetközi Valutaalaphoz vezető gondolatai<BR>[The life of Keynes and his role in establishing the International Monetary Fund]|A cikk történelmi áttekintést ad Keynes gondolkozásának alakulásáról első munkájától a második világháborúig. A szerző azt a nézetet képviseli, hogy Keynes elsősorban a köz szolgája és államférfi volt - publikált munkái elsősorban konkrét javaslatait foglalták össze. Egész közéleti és tudományos tevékenysége oszthatatlan egész, és utolsó munkája a nemzetközi pénzügyek keynesi rendjének kiépítését szolgáló javaslat felé mutat. Az indiai valuta- és pénzügyekről szóló műve már tartalmazza az arany trónfosztására vonatkozó elképzeléseit, a háború gazdasági következményeit tárgyaló könyve pedig az elviselhetetlen adósságok és más fizetési kötelezettségek törlését indítványozza. A pénzről szóló értekezésében megtaláljuk a Bretton Woods-i intézmények létrehozására vezető javaslatainak alapgondolatait, Általános elméletében pedig kifejti a közjólét szolgálatának kötelezettségét, és ezt utolsó munkájában az összes nemzet közjólétének szolgálatára terjeszti ki.

Folyamatosan figyeljük egymás arcát, szavát, mozdulatait. Igyekszünk követni és megérteni a körülöttünk zajló eseményeket. Ennek során megpróbáljuk tapasztalatainkat interpretálni, elhelyezni az általunk már ismert és értelmezett mintázatokban. Ennek a folyamatnak három fontos eleme van: a ráhangolódás, a megértés és az értékelés. A gazdaságban az ezekhez kapcsolódó képességek a verseny és a kooperáció fontos feltételei. Az ember képessége és hajlama mások érzelmeinek, tetteinek átélésére azonban kétélű fegyver. Éppúgy ösztökél bennünket mások érdekében végzett jó cselekedetekre, mint a másokkal szembeni agresszióra. De mi választja el bennünk a jót a rossztól, a segítőkész, megbocsátó embert a bosszúvágyó rombolótól, az életeket mentő filantrópot az önző fenevadtól? Képes-e ilyen kérdésekre válaszolni a társadalom és a gazdaság jelenségeinek tudományos magyarázatára hivatott közgazdasági gondolkodás?

B31|Did Keynes Make His Case?|Paper considers Keynes’ case for fiscal stimulus under depression conditions – a case that remains prominent in both policy and academic literature. It highlights four specific real-history instances where, Keynes argued, monetary measures alone would not have restored prosperity and, hence, where fiscal activism would have been desirable. These were: 1) the depression of the 1890s; 2) the onset of the Great Depression in 1930; 3) the Roosevelt Recovery in 1933; and 4) the 1937-38 contraction in the US. But evidence from all four instances, gathered here, undermines Keynes’ claims... Paper then shifts to Keynes’ theoretical rationale, where it turns out that the frequently-cited “liquidity trap” argument was only one of several he advanced for monetary policy ineffectiveness. And it was not the one he most-often emphasized, while his own texts raise doubt about its coherence. Keynes view of Depression was intertwined with the stagnationist temper of economic theory during the middle 1930s, and with his cultural and aesthetic distaste for “capitalist individualism.” The weakness of Keynes’ real-history illustrations reflects in part Keynes’ flawed underlying critique of “classical” theory – a critique that, because it was so prominent, has often set back understanding. Keynes did not make his case.
B31|Solving a Longstanding Conundrum: The Uneasy Coexistence of Alternative Equilibrium Conceptions in Walras’s Theoretical System|The evolution of Walras’s theoretical ideas over the last thirty years of the 19th century is highly tormented: from the early outline of Walras’s theoretical system, as sketched in his surviving Geneva lecture notes (1871-72), through the various editions of the Éléments (1st: 1874-77; 2nd: 1889; 3rd: 1896; 4th: 1900), Walras’s exposition of General Equilibrium Theory undergoes a process of ceaseless revisions, which often do not blend with each other, occasionally giving rise to self- contradictory statements. This paper purports to show that such a tortured development can ultimately be traced to the uneasy coexistence in Walras’s approach of two different conceptions of economic equilibrium: a more traditional one, where an equilibrium of the economy is viewed as the outcome of a balancing of forces, themselves unrelated or only barely connected with individual optimizing behavior; and a more innovative conception, resting on the then revolutionary idea that an equilibrium ought to be viewed as a consistent array of optimally chosen individual plans of action. Starting from the first conception, which pre-dates Walras’s discovery of the link between individual demand and utility maximization (fall 1872), Walras strives to progressively enhance the role played by the second, without ever fully succeeding in his attempt. This is the root cause of most of the inconsistencies marring Walras’s Éléments, as well as indirectly affecting the subsequent developments of General Equilibrium Theory.
B31|The concepts of stock and flow. A revisit of Georgescu-Roegen definitions|After recalling the classical definitions of stock and flow introduced by Fisher, the paper briefly summarizes Georgescu-Roegen’s analysis of the production process and his definitions of the concepts of stock and flow, and also of those of fund and services necessary in his approach. The paper does then propose new definitions of the same four concepts and explore their implications for a different and more realistic approach to labor market analysis.
B31|The European Payments Union and the origins of Triffin’s regional approach towards international monetary integration|Robert Triffin (1911-1993) played an important role in the international monetary debates in the postwar period. He was known as one of the main advocates of a multipolar international monetary system. In this paper we analyse the origins of riffin’s “regional” approach towards international monetary integration. We argue that Triffin’s experience with the European Payments Union (EPU)played hereby a crucial role. Triffin was not only an “architect” of the EPU, but the EPU also led to an important shift in Triffin’s view of the geography of the international monetary system. Before his work on the EPU, Triffin thought of the international economy as composed of two geographical entities: national economies and the world economy. With his work on the EPU he introduced a third geographical entity: the region. The EPU would so be at the basis of Triffin’s advocacy of a regional approach towards international monetary integration. Moreover, while Triffin was initially quite positive on the IMF, he became, through his EPU experience, more critical of the IMF and its worldwide approach.
B31|The response of euro area sovereign spreads to the ECB unconventional monetary policies|We analyse variations in sovereign bond yields and spreads following unconventional monetary policy announcements by the European Central Bank. Using a two-country, arbitrage-free, shadow-rate dynamic term structure model (SR-DTSM), we decompose countries'yields into expectation and risk premium components. By means of an event study analysis, we show that the ECB's announcements reduced both the average expected instantaneous spread and risk repricing components of Italian and Spanish spreads. For countries such as Belgium and France, the ECB announcements impacted primarily the risk repricing component of the spread.
B31|The Interdependence of Monetary and Macroprudential Policy under the Zero Lower Bound|This paper considers the interdependence of monetary and macroprudential policy in a New Keynesian business cycle model under the zero lower bound constraint. Entrepreneurs borrow in nominal terms from banks and are subject to idiosyncratic default risk. The realized loan return to the bank varies with aggregate risk, such that bank balance sheets are affected by higher-than-expected rm defaults. Monetary and macroprudential policies are given by an interest rate rule and a capital requirement rule, respectively. We first characterize the model's stability properties under different steady state policies. We then analyze the transmission of a risk shock under the zero lower bound and different macroprudential policies. We finally investigate whether these policies are indeed optimal.
B31|Reading the General Theory as Economic Sociology: A broader interpretation of an economics classic|This paper argues that given certain self-definitions and key defining features of economic sociology, The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money can be read and interpreted as a text in economic sociology. Around this core argument, a case is built for a more open interaction and mutual appreciation between economic sociology and heterodox approaches to economics. The paper suggests how broader interpretations of classics of social science (such as the General Theory) may help us better appreciate the shared intellectual lineages and legacies of economics and sociology. It concludes with reflections on the historical development of the relationship between economics and sociology, and some speculation about their future.
B31|The ideas for future economic growth|(To the 110th birth anniversary of academician T. S. Khachaturov) The article analyzes academician T. S.

B31|Ideology, Class and Factional Struggles in the Mid and Late 1920s in Soviet Russia – Nikolai Kondratiev’s Tragic Fate|The introduction of the “socialist revolution, socialism, public property” paradigm and its ideological role for the establishment of the capitalist way of production in ÕÕ c. is studied. A situational analysis is made of the class and inter-factional struggles in Soviet Russia in the middle and in the second part of the 20s. The study analyses the class struggle between the large centralized state monopolistic capital on the one hand, and the small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises on the other, as well as their factional representation in the political life of that period. It reveals the advantages of the factional struggle of Stalin’s centrist faction and the importance of his ideologeme for the “establishment of socialism in a particular country”. It also shows how class struggle influences the tragic life of the outstanding Russian economist Nikolai Kondratiev.
B31|Keynes and the interwar commodity option markets|In the first quarter of the twentieth century, options began to be widely employed in the main financial centres in Europe and the USA for trading in spot and futures markets. From 1921 onward, Keynes embarked upon investment in these derivatives mainly—but not exclusively—in the commodity markets, showing a true fascination for this method of speculation. This type of financial investment he pursued mainly in the 1920s, with only a few operations undertaken during the 1930s. The option markets in which Keynes traded were metals—in particular copper, lead, spelter and, especially, tin. Besides metals, Keynes dealt in options also in other commodity markets, such as rubber and linseed oil, and sparingly in ordinary stocks and government securities. In this paper we offer a reconstruction of Keynes’s speculative activity in commodity options, drawing on the archival material kept in the Keynes Papers held at King’s College, Cambridge. This reconstruction is, to the best of our knowledge, entirely new to the literature and aims to provide an analysis of this particular aspect of Keynes’s investment behaviour, investigating his capacity to predict market trends and offering a preliminary assessment of his performance.
B31|Hicks’s thread (out of the equilibrium labyrinth)|The work of John Hicks is an unending source of inspiration for many economists and an unsolved dilemma for historians of economic thought. This article highlights the fact that Hicks’s peculiar perspective on the economic agent constitutes the sub-structure underlying his research path, and the common premise to his theories of markets, liquidity, capital, and risk. Hicks’s theory of the agent was intended to address the factual role of non-measurable risk (i.e. learning management) and was primarily concerned with the price and wealth effects that the transaction costs (costs of learning and moving) entail for learning-induced behaviours.
B31|What was the message of Friedman’s Presidential Address to the American Economic Association?|Abstract It is widely accepted that the importance of Friedman’s Presidential Address to the American Economic Association lies in its criticism of policy based on the Phillips curve. It is argued that a reading of the text does not support such a view, and this and other considerations suggest that any such aim was far from Friedman’s mind in 1968. His objective was the quite different one of making a case for policy ‘rules’ rather than discretion.
B31|Das Turgot Problem. The method of Economics|This paper examines A.R.J. Turgot’s explanation of the scope and method of economic science. We begin by highlighting two contradictory economic methodologies in Turgot’s writings according to the literature: one in his text on progress and another in his papers on concrete economic matters. An initial hypothesis in this paper holds that this ‘contradiction’ does not exist. To do so, we shall use his texts on scientific methodology, history of science and epistemology, mainly written during the decade of the fifties. The argument is that his taxonomy of sciences explains that the different methodologies observed by the literature, depending on the discipline, are the forms that the unit of science can take in each stage of the progress of the human spirit. A corollary to this hypothesis is that Turgot’s multi-disciplinary works describe a scene of the birth of economic science that is very removed from the political arena. Both debates on types of knowledge, the independence of disciplines, the specialized language and the association of authors are better explained from the sociology of science than from the history of political thought.
B31|Trevor Swan and Indian planning: The lessons of 1958/59|Trevor Swan is commonly considered to be Australia’s most distinguished economist. As part of a visiting professorship at MIT during 1958-59 he spent nine months in India to assist in the formulation of India’s third five year plan and to contribute to the development of India’s premier research institutions. This paper provides an account of his work in New Delhi. Swan’s closest associates were Pitambar Pant from the Indian Planning Commission and Ian Little who was visiting from Oxford. Swan was of the view that India’s economic problems should be clearly understood and the best policy measures to address these should be devised. This varied considerably from the practice of central planning and state control being practiced in India at that time. Swan was unable to influence the direction of economic policy in India but the economy’s subsequent performance would vindicate Swan’s views on how economic development policy should have been conducted.
B31|The Methodology of Polanyi's Great Transformation|Polanyi's book, The Great Transformation, provides an analysis of the emergence and significance of capitalist economic structures which differs radically from those currently universally taught in economic textbooks. This analysis is based on a methodological approach which is also radically different from existing methodologies for economics, and more generally social science. This methodology is used by Polanyi without explicit articulation. Our goal in this article is to articulate the methodology used in this book to bring out the several dimensions on which it differs from current approaches to social science. Among the key differences Polanyi provides substantial scope for human agency and capability to change the course of history. He also shows that the social, political and economic spheres of human existence are deeply interlinked and cannot be analysed in isolation, as current approaches assume.
B31|Thorstein Veblen on the nature of the firm and income distribution|The aim of this paper is to provide a theoretical model inspired by Veblen’s theory of the firm, and to derive some implications of firms’ behaviour for the process of income distribution. It will be shown that the firm is a locus of conflict, involving technicians – interested in expanding production – and “businessmen” – interested in gaining money profits via the management of the “pecuniary side” of the firm. The outcome of the bargaining within the firm defines the ‘workmanship-type’ or ‘non-workmanship-type’ nature of the firm, and affects the level of real wages and employment, insofar as the greater the power of technicians, the higher the real wages are. Moreover, since the expansion of production is associated with the minimum degree of underutilization of capital, technical improvements have a positive effect on the level of employment. Finally, it is argued that a wage increase can have a positive effect on the degree of capital utilization and the level of employment, via the increase in total demand and in the degree of capital utilization.
B31|Frederic S. Lee and His Fight for the Future of Heterodox Economics|Frederic S. Lee (1949-2014) was a dedicated captain of the heterodox economics movement over the past thirty years. In the course of his unfaltering fight for the future of heterodox economics, Lee contributed to both the development of heterodox microeconomic theory and the establishment of a global community of heterodox economists. This short tribute delineates Lee’s unique and important contribution that should be remembered and renewed in order to reproduce heterodox economics.
B31|The Theory of Economic Development of J.A. Schumpeter: Key Features|This paper comprises translation into English the preface of Iurii Bazhal to the first Ukrainian edition of Joseph Schumpeter’s famous fundamental book “The Theory of Economic Development: An Inquiry into Profits, Capital, Credit, Interest, and the Business Cycle” that was translated in Ukrainian and published in 2011 in commemoration of its 100th anniversary. The paper reveals the contemporary significance of this classical book as the challenger on replacing the neoclassical approaches in capacity to become the mainstream of modern economic theory. It is shown the Schumpeter’s approach gives a new vision of driving forces for economic development where a crucial conceptual place belongs to category the innovation. Second part of the paper reviews modern Neo-Schumpeterian approaches which have substantiated the importance of the structural innovation technological change of national economy for economic development. The government must permanently analyze a compliance of the actual production structure in the country with the current and future technological paradigms.

B31|Back to the long-run: the “Development Operation” as a supply-side policy by the Italian Industrial Association during the Seventies|The aim of this paper is to stress the proposal made by the Italian Industrial Association against the stagflation during the Seventies, labeled “Development Operation”, which tried to give Italy a long-run growth path, through a strong reduction of public debt, boosting the supply-side in order to gain more productive independence; all of this in close connection with the European Community framework and in line with IMF/OECD directives. Moreover, this policy statement provided for a synthesis of different schools and joined the crowding-out debate occurring at that time in Italy.
B31|The Freedom of the Prices: Hayek's Road to Serfdom Reassessed|Recent debate has centered around the contemporary relevance and even the original validity of F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom. Was it directed against command socialism only or against welfare-state interventionism as well? Should the book even be read anymore? This essay takes a step back from the dichotomy between socialism and interventionism and explores two specific ideas of Hayek's which deserve renewed attention: first, his claim that economic liberty is the fundamental liberty and that political liberty is merely secondary in value. Second, Hayek's conception of the rule-of-law, which has implications for contemporary command-and-control regulation. Furthermore, that Hayek's philosophical conception of the rule-of-law in the Road to Serfdom is related to his economic theory of prices in “The Use of Knowledge in Society.” While Hayek's specific target in the Road to Serfdom was command socialism, his book embodied arguments which are more widely applicable and relevant today.
B31|La politica economica della Democrazia Cristiana (1948-1963) e il dibattito all’interno del partito<BR>[The economic policy of Christian Democracy (1948-1963) and the debate within the party]|This paper aims to analyze, in a first part, the economic policy carried out by the Christian Democracy from the post WWII until the early Sixties; in a second part, the goal is to trace the debate inside this party to highlight the different positions taken by its members in order to understand why those kind of policies were achieved. We will see that, a first period of unity (largely) within the party, together with a second one where the left-wing component came out and succeeded to lead the party, made possible to design Keynesian based policies in order to boost growth and employment that our country needed.
B31|Schumpeter, Veblen and Bourdieu on Institutions and the Formation of Habits|As we know, Joseph Alois Schumpeter is one of the greatest economists of all times, while Thorstein Veblen is an economist and sociologist who made seminal contributions to the social sciences. Pierre Bourdieu, meanwhile, is one of the most famous structural sociologists, who has consistently worked on economic dynamics. These three scholars have laid the foundations of a socioeconomic perspective. However, several important aspects of their works remain less widely discussed, or even inadequately explored in a comparative manner. Of course, investigating the origins of their ideas in evolutionary and institutional economics and re-evaluating comparatively the influences that shaped their works is quite useful for promoting dialogue between Economics and Sociology. Within this framework, this essay focuses on the conceptual relationship between Schumpeter, Veblen and Bourdieu. Evolution and Change shape the economic life in their respective works and, in such a framework a central point of their analyses is the interdependence between the cultural, social and economic spheres. Furthermore, an economic sociology is built around the concept of habit formation. The three great authors’ systemic views focus on the various institutions and other aspects of cultural, social and economic life, where habits are formed and cover diverse fields and notions such as Consumption, Preferences, Art, Knowledge, Banking and even Capitalism. For instance, all three social scientists acknowledged the fact that the internal dynamics of capitalism introduce structural instabilities into the economic system. Also, they recognized that research and knowledge development is a collective social process. However, from a methodological perspective, their main emphasis is on the emerging dynamic evolution of habits, which is perceived as the interruption of already existing social norms and the conflict between routine and change. Several differences between Schumpeter, Veblen and Bourdieu are observed and analysed and ideas for future research are presented.
B31|Agama, ekonomi dan negara: Pemikiran ekonomi al-Mawardi pada Adab al-Dunya wa al-Din<BR>[Religion, Economy, and State: Economic Thought of al-Mawardi in Adab al-Dunya wa-al-Din]|The relation between religion, economy, and country became the main topic of building a public welfare system. Human beings have the potential to realize the political level of moral conscience to make ends meet, but man as a creature of religion must have a balance between religious morality and economy morality. With economic ethics are supported by religious morality, the welfare system can be realized systemically if the state, communities, and individuals can realize the six-dimensional: the religion that is adhered to, good governance, justice, national security, the prosperity of society, and the vision of the nation.
B31|Фирмата в Теорията на транзакционните разходи/The Firm as Transaction Cost Economics Concept<BR>[Фирмата В Теорията На Транзакционните Разходи]|Abstract: Within the framework of the mainstream neoclassical model, the existence of the firm creates serious theoretical difficulties. Major attempt to overcome them, leads to application of the Transaction cost economics developed by Coase, Williamson, etc. On its own turn, it creates new contradictions, part of which are treated by the present paper from the point of evolutionary political economy.
B31|Mises and Montaigne: A Comment|Ludwig von Mises (1881-1973) baptized the idea that the gain of some is caused by the loss of others as the “Montaigne dogma.” Mises considered the fallacy to be very widespread and sufficiently noteworthy that he devoted chapter 24 of his magnum opus Human Action to refuting the idea. Casto Martín Montero Kuscevic and Marco Antonio del Río Rivera (2015) discuss Mises´ refutation of Montainge´s dogma and claim that he misinterpreted Montaigne on fundamental grounds. They make the further claim that Mises misattributed the dogma to Montaigne. In this short response, we assess their argument to demonstrate that a more complete reading of Mises’s arguments vindicate both his identification and criticisms of the Montaigne dogma.
B31|Al-Asadi and his work al-Taysir: A study of his socio-economic ideas|Muḥammad bin Muḥammad bin Khalīl al-Asadī lived in A.H. 9th/ C.E. 15th century. The details of his birth, life and death remain obscure. He authored many works on the socio-economic problems of his time. All these works have disappeared without trace except one: al-Taysīr (the Facilitation). This surviving work is the only source of information about his life and his ideas. He suggested efficient market administration, public distribution of food, elimination of monopolies, monetary reform, management of public income and expenditure, embryonic quantitative use in production and distribution, and measurement of inflation. The depth and significance of his ideas remains largely unexplored. The present paper attempts to address this need.
B31|A közös ős nyomában: modern nyugati közgazdasági gondolkodás és az iszlám hagyomány<BR>[In the Quest for the Common Ancestor: Modern Western Economic Thought and the Islamic Tradition]|This scientific essay aims to examine the relationship between Western mainstream economics and its Islamic counterpart. It shows that the creation of Islamic economics is a new scientific program, and representatives of this discipline do not agree on its methodological foundations. Islamic economics does not make a distinction between normative and positive scientific attitudes and sets the influence of human behavior as one of its important goals. To prove that there is potential for future convergence the author argues that the „Schumpeterian gap” in history of economic thought does not exist. Analysing the thoughts of Ibn Khaldun, the paper sets the ground for a new paradigm by representing Khaldun as a common ancestor of Western and Islamic economics.
B31|Czech Economist Karel Engliš and his Relation to The Austrian School in the First Half of the 20th Century|This article analyses opinions and teleological approach of Czech economist Karel Engliš (1880-1961) and his relation to the Austrian Economics during the first three decades of the 20th century. He grew out from the Austrian subjective psychological school although he later refused its methodological psychological subjectivism and value theory. Engliš formed an original teleological economic school upon Kant´s noetics. This paper describes Engliš´s relation to the Austrian school: the polemic approach of Karel Engliš to Austrian Economics, followed by Engliš´s agreement with certain postulates of the Austrian School. Engliš supported the conclusions of the Austrian School regarding irreplaceability of economic individualism as the basis for a modern economic market system.

It is especially important to briefly overview his works and views on welfare economics and actuarial mathematics in light of the dominant approach in economics today, based on crude and supposedly neutral formalization, and often blind to the philosophical and moral implications of its analysis. De Finetti studied social security and social protection with analyses of great interest, for example anticipating the so-called Aaronâ€™s paradox by a decade. But he also discussed the relative merits as well as the relative security of pre-funded and pay-as-you-go pension systems, denoting a much wider perspective than what is currently usually the case.

B31|Lo Stato come ‘fornitore’ d’investimenti sociali (State as Social Investments Provider)|"We analyze the role of the State in social investment (education, health services, etc.), different from those in infrastructures. We do so because, in the current economic and social situation, this type of investment, in addition to strengthening the European social model, could be particularly effective in creating new jobs. To test the link between social investment and employment we modify the Paolo Sylos Labini’s employment equation model (MOSYL), inserting in the model social investment instead of those in infrastructures. The quantitative implementation is based on Eurostat data for the 28 EU countries, and the results are encouraging: the employment rate is strongly influenced by factors outside the labor market, which affect not only the general economic environment (represented by GDP), but also by elements linked to the social context, concerning the new forms of welfare.

B31|Keynes In Italian Econometric Models During The Seventies. The Experience Of Prometeia And Confindustria|The aim of this paper is to highlight the intellectual influence of Keynes in the building of Italian econometrics and how our scholars tried to find a way out from the stagflation occurred in Italy during the Seventies. We have chosen two case studies: the model designed by PROMETEIA, the think tank belonging to the University of Bologna, and DYANMOD, the main model of Confindustria (Confederation of Italian Industries). Although the Keynesian thought crucially influenced their structure and functioning, they managed to explain also the oil-shock-induced supply side effects, showing an unexpected degree of innovation within Keynesian thought. Furthermore, these models were conceived to join the larger Project LINK by Lawrence Klein, in order to connect the economies of many OECD countries. Given our microeconomic foundations, the main conclusions traced by these models were the focus on balance of payments equilibrium, capital accumulation and public finance constraints, thus asking for economic policies that could guarantee growth and disinflation.
B31|The Environmental Turn In Natural Resource Economics: John Krutilla And “Conservation Reconsidered”|Environmentalism in the United States historically has been divided into its utilitarian and preservationist impulses, represented by Gifford Pinchot and John Muir, respectively. Pinchot advocated conservation of natural resources to be used for human purposes; Muir advocated protection from humans, for nature’s own sake. In the first half of the twentieth century, natural resource economics was firmly on Pinchot’s side of that schism. That position began to change as the postwar environmental movement gained momentum. In particular, John Krutilla, an economist at Resources for the Future, pushed economics to the point where it could embrace Muir’s vision as well as Pinchot’s. Krutilla argued that if humans preferred a preserved state to a developed one, then such preferences were every bit as “economic”—either way, opportunity costs exist and economic choices must be made.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B31|Documents on Piero Sraffa at the Archivio Centrale dello Stato and at the Archivio Storico Diplomatico|This paper provides a list and a brief description of files and documents where the name of Piero Sraffa is mentioned currently kept at the Archivio Centrale dello Stato and at the Archivio Storico Diplomatico. For each file or document we provide indication of the reference number where it is conserved and a transcript of one or two of the relevant documents out of more than five hundred which have been located. The purpose of the paper is to illustrate the results of archival researches of the last decade, including more recent findings, and furnish a groundwork for further research, which may bring further light to bear on documents already known to us, and lead to the discovery of new documents or information, so as to provide a better basis to the reconstruction of the biography of Piero Sraffa and of people whose lives entwined with his – Antonio Gramsci certainly ranking high among them. Given the nature of this work, providing precise indications as to the exact location of the documents is crucial, and this implies that any such indication must be presented in Italian. Furthermore, as almost all the documents considered were written in Italian, also providing quotations in the original language seemed to us of special im-portance. For these reasons, we have asked the editors of this series of working papers – usually available only in English – to allow us to present our work also in Italian.
B31|Walras on capital: interpretative insights from a review by Bortkiewicz|A review by Bortkiewicz, wholeheartedly approved by Walras, of the second edition of the Eléments supplies an important insight, until now neglected, on how Walras interpreted his own capitalization equations before the fourth edition. The insight helps to explain why Walras was for so long unable to perceive that his given vectorial endowment of capital goods was incompatible with the uniform rate of return on supply price that he was assuming. Walras seems to have confusedly considered the capital endowments relevant for the determi-nation of equilibrium rentals to be the ones resulting from the production of new capital goods, and therefore as having already undergone an adjustment of their composition toward the one required for URRSP. Realization of the erroneousness of this view can explain the unobtrusive but crucial changes in the discussion of capitalization in the fourth edition, and most likely also the introduction of the ‘bons’.
B31|Stabilizing an unstable economy (Chapters 1-2)<BR>[Стабилизируя Нестабильную Экономику]|In the first chapter of his seminal book Hyman Minsky formulates methodological orientations in economic studies and general economic policies. The second chapter is devoted to the analysis of the period of financial instability in the United States since the late 1960's to early 1980's and the first recession 1973-1975. The author shows that due to the fiscal stimulus on the part of Big Government and the central bank as a lender of last-instance the US economy managed to avoid the depression and recession relatively quickly overcome. It happened not only because deficit financing budget expenditures supported the demand, but also because of increasing public debt act as a stabilizer of portfolios of creditors. During this period, it changed the character of the economic crisis and recession: instead of deep depression financial instability has taken a high and accelerating inflation form.

B31|Co-Authorship in Regional Science: A Case Study of the WVU RRI Research Community|The year 2015 marked the fiftieth anniversary of West Virginia University’s (WVU) Regional Research Institute (RRI), which has played an important role in many scientific collaboration networks. Through social network analysis (SNA) focusing on the RRI research community since its inception in 1965, this article illustrates the role that organizations and the networks they promote can play in scientific problem domains, promoting scholarly collaborations and coauthorship in the field of regional science. We analyzed an evolving WVU RRI coauthorship network that has grown and gained in complexity over time in terms of (1) global metrics, (2) components and cluster analysis, (3) centrality, and (4) PageRank and AuthorRank. The results of these analyses depict a well-developed and influential scientific collaboration structure within both WVU and the regional science research community.
B31|Paul Samuelson on His 90th Birthday|Editorâ€™s Introduction Originally published in Volume 51, Number 2, Fall 2007, page 39 . John Kenneth Galbraith (1908-2006) was one of the leading voices of American liberalism during the latter half of the twentieth century. Even though Professor Galbraith served on the economics faculty of Harvard University for fifty years, he is remembered today more for his role as a public intellectual and policy advisor to presidents than for his academic contributions to economic theory. Intensely interested in public policy, Professor Galbraith served several presidential administrations, including time as Ambassador to India under John F. Kennedy. During his lengthy career, he authored numerous bestselling books, including the influential The Affluent Society in 1958 and, The New Industrial State in 1967. In this short paper published posthumously, Professor Galbraith celebrates the 90 th birthday of another prominent economist of his generation, Paul Samuelson. Professor Galbraith outlines his views on Samuelsonâ€™s impact on the profession and posterity.
B31|Smith vs. Marx on Business Morality and the Social Interest|Editorâ€™s Introduction Originally published in Volume 20, Number 2, Fall 1976, pages 1-6 . William Baumol (born 1922) is not only one of the most influential living economists but is also one of the professionâ€™s most prolific writers. During his career, Professor Baumol has written or edited more than eighty books and authored several hundred academic journal articles across an impressive range of topics including; entrepreneurship, portfolio theory, industrial organization, public policy, and the history of economic thought. He is perhaps most well known as one of the originators of the Baumol-Tobin model of the transactions demand for money. Along with long-time collaborator, Alan Blinder, Professor Baumol is also the author of a series of college textbooks that are extensively adopted throughout the United States and the world. He currently holds the Harold Price Professor of Entrepreneurship at New York University, where he has taught for the past thirty-seven years, and is a Professor Emeritus and Senior Research Economist at Princeton University.

B31|A conquest of rice: agricultural expansion, impoverishment, and malaria in Turkey|Serving as a parliamentarian in late-1940s Turkey, Dr. Mehmet Serif Korkut wrote of his perceptions of the gravest danger to Turkish workers and the nation: malaria. In his view as physician and politician, the greatest factor exacerbating this disease involved the rapid -though legally regulated- expansion of rice cultivation within the country. Addressing this problem through his writings, Korkut connected this commodity with conditions of unchecked agrarian capitalism and impoverishment. In such a context, he argued, rice farming caused the state to be plagued with corruption and the peasantry with malaria. Relying upon his primary texts and supported by archival research, this article presents and analyses a unique critique of agrarian capitalism from Turkey's early Cold War era. In doing so, it contributes to a broader appreciation for the diversity of sources, ideas, and linkages between histories of agriculture and public health.
B31|Is neoliberalism consistent with individual liberty? Friedman, Hayek and Rand on education employment and equality|In their writings, Milton Friedman, Friedrich August von Hayek and Ayn Rand have been instrumental in shaping and influencing neoliberalism through their academic and literary abilities. Their opinions on education, employment and inequality have stirred up considerable controversy and have been the focus of many debates. This paper adds to the debate by suggesting that there is an internal inconsistency in the views of neoliberalism as reflected by Friedman, Hayek and Rand. The paper contends that whereas their neoliberal theories promote liberty, the manner in which they conceptualize this term promotes policies that would actually deny the individual freedom of the majority while securing liberty and financial success for the privileged few. The paper focuses on the consequences of neoliberalism on education, and also discusses how it affects employment, inequality and democracy.
B31|Mass Flourishing and Corporatism: Two Indian Stories|Abstract This paper examines Phelps’ notions of ‘corporatism’ and ‘flourishing’ from the point of view of India’s growth experience since independence in 1947 up to 1990s when economic reform was initiated. It looks at two pre-reform Indian stories, those of agriculture sector and industrial sector, which provide a developing country color to Phelps’ analysis.
B31|Which Economics? Which Economies?|Abstract It is argued that the problems affecting our societies at present are not so much the result of a mysterious disappearance of inventiveness and imagination, as Phelps deplores. It is rather the dramatic change of the socio-economic order propelled by the neoliberal ideology that captured the minds of many people and politicians. This led to a de-regulation of financial markets and a policy of austerity, which triggered the “Great Recession” and stifled innovation. There is also the problem of a mismatch between our measurement devices and what is to be measured in a world of bits and bytes. With the firm establishment and growth of R&D&I in all Western economies the talk about a declining innovativeness ought to be received with suspicion. New materials and rare earths, biotechnology, further advances in ICT and what is called the fourth industrial revolution based on cyber-physical systems can be expected to have an important impact on economic performance.
B31|Double trouble: modern misreadings of Cantillon|Although the 18th century Franco-Irish financier Richard Cantillon is universally esteemed as an outstanding pioneer of economic analysis, his work is not immune to present-day misunderstanding. This paper identifies two current misreadings both relating to his concept of â€œintrinsic value.â€ Both need clearing-up. (1) Anthony Brewer (1992) claimed to find a fatal flaw in Cantillonâ€™s theory of value. The present author (1993) demurred. That objection has not been taken up (or dismissed) in subsequent discussion of Cantillonâ€™s work. We therefore have unfinished business. (2) A second issue has emerged. Modern â€œAustrianâ€ commentators (who express great admiration for Cantillon) are promoting a seriously erroneous misinterpretation of his theory of value. We think it is time both to put forward, against Brewerâ€™s allegation, a stronger defence of Cantillonâ€™s theory, and also to make the point that Cantillonâ€™s conception is fundamentally different from how (some) â€œAustrianâ€ admirers apparently see it.

B31|"""Gefangene der Bilder in unseren Köpfen"": Die Macht abstrakten ökonomischen Denkens"|Wie selbstverständlich geht die heutige ökonomische Standardlehre davon aus, dass sie Studierenden eine feste und unveränderliche Sicht auf die Welt vermitteln kann. Doch woher kommt diese Annahme? Walter Lippmann, einer der Begründer des Neoliberalismus, gibt hierauf einen ersten Hinweis: Wirtschaftswissenschaft soll in der Lage sein, Bilder in Köpfen von Menschen zu verankern, die allem Denken und Handeln unbewusst zugrunde liegen, selbst aber nicht schöpferisch veränderbar sind. Anhand dreier Stationen - ausgesuchten Textpassagen von Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill und Léon Walras - zeigt der Beitrag, wie die Wirtschaftswissenschaft hierfür das Denken umformen musste: hin zu einem rein erfahrungsunabhängigen Denken, das seine Inspiration nicht aus der Begegnung mit der Wirklichkeit, sondern allein aus der reinen Mathematik und Mechanik übernimmt. Zugleich zeigt die philosophische Auseinandersetzung mit der Geschichte dieser Wissenschaft, dass diese Umformung selbst weder zwangsläufig noch alternativlos ist. Auch in der Ökonomie lässt sich die schöpferische Kraft des Denkens zurückgewinnen.
