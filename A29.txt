A29|Sustaining the Implementation of Dual-Language Programme (DLP) in Malaysian Secondary Schools|Objective - The implementation of Dual-Language Programmes (DLP) in the teaching and learning of Science and Mathematics is an initiative under the 'Upholding the Malay Language and Strengthening the English Language' (MBMMBI) policy. Though it has some similarities with the previous policy known as 'English for the Teaching of Science and Mathematics' (PPSMI), its execution is idiosyncratic in its own way. Since its inception in 2016, the programme has entered its third cycle involving students in primary and secondary schools in Malaysia. The curiosity to scrutinise the programme implementation has led to this study. The study aims to investigate the execution of this programme and to assess its sustainability. Methodology/Technique - Gleaning through the students' language capabilities, attitudes, teachers' support and acceptance of the programme, the study uses a questionnaire with open-ended questions and focus group discussions to unravel the aforementioned issues. 1,530 students from secondary schools across Malaysia were selected as the respondents of this study. Findings - The results reveal findings that may represent a measure on the direction of this programme. Looking from the student perspective, the challenges confronted in addition to those put forward may further serve as an indicator for the sustainability of the program. Novelty - This study infers how the programme can be further enhanced in terms of its implementation in its fourth year since inception. The findings of this study may assist policy makers in shaping the direction of the programme.
A29|Enhancing the Resilience of Junior High School Students to Bullying|Objective - Junior high schools have realized the need for resilience to prevent and respond to bullying. Resilience can help students better respond to bullying. Enhancing this construct can support the efforts of schools to create a supportive and safe learning environment. Methodology/Technique - This research examines a regional sample of 404 Indonesian junior high school students located in Central Java between the ages of 13 and 15. The study explores the connection between experiences with bullying and resilience by examining whether resilient students seem to be significantly affected at school. Findings - The findings of the study indicate that resilience has the potential to prevent the instance of bullying. Students with high resilience were identified as being able to mitigate the effect of bullying in school.
A29|Self-Concept and Social Adjustment of First-Year Students|Objective - Students who study in higher education institutions should have a good socialization process since it later influences their happiness and sadness during their first year of university life. They may face some difficulties and problems that may inhibit their academic success if they cannot adjust well. One of the successful social adjustment criteria is self-concept, in which is derived from interactions with others, for example, the environment. For that reason, it is important to investigate the self-concept and social adjustment of Psychology students, at UIN Maulana Malik Ibrahim Malang, during the first semester. This paper therefore aims to a) determine the degree of student social adjustment, b) determine the quality of self-concept, and c) identify the relationship between self-concept and social adjustment among first year students of Psychology, UIN Maulana Malik Ibrahim Malang. Methodology/Technique - The subjects of this study include 134 first year students at the Faculty of Psychology, UIN Maulana Malik Ibrahim Malang, East Java. The data was collected in accordance with the scale of self-concept and social adjustment. Finding and Novelty - The results show that 1) the degree of first students' self-concept is in average scale, 69.4%, 2) the social adjustment of first year students belongs to a moderate category, 71,6%, and 3) self-concept has positive correlation to social adjustment (r = 0,703, p = 0,000). These findings confirm that the higher the self-concept the students poses, the better the social adjustment they perform. This study suggests the need for intervention to escalate self-concept and social adjustment of students by collaborating with some stakeholders, particularly students' parents, universities, government, societies, and religious figures.
A29|Construction and Validation of the Learning Management System Success Scale in the Higher Education Setting|Objective - The concept of education is entirely outdated. Currently, many higher education institutions are adopting blended learning pedagogy to nurture 21st-century skills. The integration of ICT has become a recent global trend in education with universities and colleges using Learning Management Systems (LMS) as their primary method of disseminating and administrating teaching and learning processes. The exploration of the factors crucial for successful implementation of LMS is therefore essential. However, most literature on this topic focuses on the technical quality of LMS's, and few address the educational quality and efficiency of LMS. Previous research also fails to discuss the conceptualization and measurement of LMS success. This study aims to construct and validate an instrument to measure LMS success in higher education institutions. Methodology/Technique - Various IS success frameworks were used to design the constructs in this study. A quantitative methodology was adopted with the sample of 379 randomly selected responses from university/college students, academics, and course administrators from India (n=297) and the Maldives (n=82). IBM SPSS AMOS 25 was used to check the validity and reliability of the instrument and to identify the measurement invariance. Findings & Novelty - This study concludes that information quality, educational quality, system quality, service quality, intention to use, user satisfaction, and net benefits are the critical constructs for measuring LMS success. The findings of this study can be used to support scholars in developing and examining other information system-related theories, as well as to higher education institutions while implementing different LMS's.
A29|Intermediary Effect of Intention of ICT adoption on the Relationship of Attitudes toward Adoption and Adoption of VLE among the Malay Language Teachers|Objective - This research aims to explore whether the intention of ICT adoption in teaching Malay language acts as a mediator in the relationship between attitudes toward ICT adoption and the adoption of the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) among secondary school Malay Language teachers. Methodology/Technique - TAM is the basis theory in this quantitative study which uses a questionnaire to collect the data. The population of the study comprises of 410 secondary school teachers in Selangor by applying various probability sampling procedures. The research instrument was adapted from a previous questionnaire and pilot study which shows an alpha Cronbach at .81. Software of Smart-PLS was used to analyse the results of the study. Findings - The mediator analysis showed a positive and significant direct relationship (ß = .067, p
A29|Erasmus + (key action 1) mobility of students in distance learning programs. Empirical analysis based on the example of International Business School - Botevgrad, Bulgaria|"Digitization of education and implementation of online learning platforms are changing not only the way in which knowledge is provided from the universities but also the profile of students. In this respect, distance learning is preferred by individuals who, for one reason or another, are unable to physically attend lectures. A priority objective of the paper is to determine the willingness of distance learning students from International Business School - Botevgrad (Bulgaria) to apply for a mobility of a minimum 3 months study period under the Erasmus + program (KA1). Primary data is collected on the basis of in-depth interviews (n = 15). As a main conclusion of the data analyses, it can be stated that the participation of students in Erasmus + (KA1) study mobility, for at least 3 months period of time, is perceived as ""difficult to be achieved"" by the respondents participating in the survey. The present research paper helps to better understand the extent to which distance learning students are motivated to participate in mobility."
A29|Мобилност На Студенти В Дистанционна Форма На Обучение По Примера На Международно Висше Бизнес Училище – Ботевград, България<BR>[Mobility of students in distance learning programs on the example of International Business School - Botevgrad, Bulgaria]|Дигитализацията в образованието и въвеждането на онлайн обучителни платформи видоизменя не само начина за предоставяне на познания, но и профила на студентите. В тази връзка дистанционна форма на обучение е предпочитана от лица, които по една или друга причина нямат възможност физически да присъстват на лекции. Приоритетна цел на разработката е да се определи желанието на студенти от дистанционна форма на обучение в Международно висше бизнес училище – Ботевград (България) да реализират мобилност от минимум 3 месеца по програма Еразъм+ (КД1). Първичните данни са събрани на основата на дълбочинни интервюта (n=15). Като основно заключение от събраните данни може да се посочи, че осъществяването на студентска мобилност с цел обучение по програма Еразъм+ (КД1), от минимум 3 месеца, се възприема като „трудно изпълнимо“ от респондентите, участващи в проучването. Настоящата разработка подпомага за по-доброто разбиране на това в каква степен студенти от дистанционна форма на обучение имат мотивация да реализират мобилност.
A29|Enhancing central bank communications with behavioural insights|In this joint Bank of England and Behavioural Insights Team study, we test the effectiveness of different approaches to central bank communications. Using an online experiment with a representative sample of the UK population, we measure how changes to the Bank of England’s summaries of the Inflation Report impact comprehension and trust in its policy messages. We find that the recently introduced Visual Summary of the Inflation Report improves comprehension of its main messages in a statistically significant way compared to the traditional executive summary. We also find that public comprehension and trust can be further improved by making the Visual Summary more relatable to people’s lives. Our findings thus shed light on how central banks can improve communication with the public at a time when trust in public institutions has fallen, while the responsibilities delegated to central banks have increased.
A29|The Study on Blue Ocean Strategy in Guiding and Counselling of Senior High School in Indonesia|Objective - The development of science and technology has had a rapid and unexpected impact on human life. It also creates chaos and presents a challenge to various aspects of life, including to procedures of guidance and counselling in senior high schools. This area of research requires a dynamic movement to create a new world or new value in counselling and guidance management to increase its effectiveness, efficiency, creativity and productivity. This study aims to determine student behavior in the science and technology era, using the blue ocean strategy of guidance and counselling to create new value. Methodology/Technique - The study uses a descriptive qualitative method using 4 teachers as the source of primary data and 4 principals and 8 students as the source of secondary data. Findings - The results show that student behavior is very adaptive to independent learning and, on the other hand, the groups tend to behave politely. Novelty - The blue ocean strategy of guidance and counselling has created a new world in accordance with the needs of students through assessment and innovation of counselling and guidance programs in senior high schools.
A29|The Attractiveness of Schools of Management: The Case of Indonesia|Objective - In recent times, schools of management in Indonesia have experienced rapid rates of growth all over the country in both big cities and small towns. The increase in interest to join schools of management is reflected by the number of schools of management at the undergraduate, master and doctoral levels that exist in almost all universities, particularly at the undergraduate and master levels. This research aims to determine the factors that influence the decision of an undergraduate, master or doctoral student to enroll in a school of management. Methodology/Technique - This study uses factor analysis and in-depth interview. The data is collecting using an online questionnaire distributed through WhatsApp groups and emails to undergraduate, masters and doctoral students throughout Indonesia. 366 questionnaires were distributed in total. Findings - The result of research show that the factors affecting students' decisions to enroll at schools of management are the process, product, and motivation. While the high interest in entering master and doctoral in management with the non-management background is caused by several factors, primarily, due to its relevance to their work, career development, accreditation, and other factors. Novelty - Those students that already occupy key positions in both private and government sectors consider managerial skills are more dominant in schools of management.
A29|An Empirical Study on TQM Practices and its Influence on Employee Satisfaction and Performance in Technical Institutions: Teachers' Perspectives|Objective - Employee satisfaction and employee performance are critical to a service-oriented organization and its performance. Employees play a crucial role in the successful delivery of service and maintaining customer relationships in service oriented organizations. Satisfied employees in general perform better in service delivery as compared to unsatisfied employees. Employee satisfaction, in turn, results from total quality management initiatives such as top management support, employee training, employee participation, employee rewards, and team work that enable employees to provide better customer service. While the relationship of TQM practices and employee satisfaction has been tested in other service sectors, it has not been explored in the education sector. The objective of this paper is to investigate how TQM practices have an impact on employee satisfaction and employee performance within the context of technical institutions in India. Methodology/Technique - The data is collected from 250 teaching faculties of technical institutions in the southern states of India. Findings - The results of the study confirm that TQM practices are significantly positive predictors of employee satisfaction, which in turn contributes to better employee performance within the educational sector in India. Novelty - This study contributes to the development of literature by empirically testing the link between TQM practices and employee satisfaction and employee performance within the context of the education sector.
A29|Cultural Diversity Values Embedded in Children?s Literature|This study investigated the cultural diversity values embedded in children?s stories of the age 8-12 years in the Arab World presented by the characters of the stories, taking Jordan as a case study. The following questions were raised: 1- What are the cultural diversity values embedded in children stories for the age of 8-12 years? 2- What are the characters in children stories in terms of gender (male ? female), age (child-adult-old), and types (human-animal) that represented these values? Thirty three stories were chosen and analyzed using a developed checklist of the cultural diversity values, and Child, Potter & Levine (1971) classification of characters. Findings revealed that the cultural diversity values in children?s stories were not sufficient as they should be according to the used scale.
A29|Intention to Migrate Among International Muslim Students in Malaysia|"Objective – The primary objective of this study is to examine the association of the push-pull factors, perceived job prospects for students following graduation, religious considerations, and adaptability of international students with their intention to migrate. Methodology/Technique – A total of 373 international students, enrolled in undergraduate and postgraduate university programs in Malaysia, participated in the study. An online self-assessment and questionnaire was used to collect the results, using a series of questions and responses from the students. Findings – The empirical findings of the study reveal that the intentions of international students to migrate to Malaysia are mainly aroused by the Muslim environment in Malaysia, and other religious factors. On the other hand, economics and development were the primary considerations of international students intending to migrate elsewhere (excluding Malaysia). Novelty – Malaysia should continue to promote and market itseld more efficiently to international students, especially those from Asia and Africa, to position itseld as an ""Educational Hub"" (eduhub) within South-east Asia. In addition, international students' intentions to migrate were perceived to be closely connected to the actual numbers for future migration to Malaysia, and mobility of skilled labour; this may be identified as an area for further study."
A29|An attempt to optimise the number of pupils in comprehensive secondary schools based on their learning outcomes|There may be a significant correlation between the number of pupils in a school and their learning performance. Some studies point to the negative impact of schools with a large number of pupils on the educational results achieved. At the same time, the demographic crisis that has been deepening steadily for several years now represents an important motivation forrationalising the existing network of schools. The aim of the study was to determine the optimum size of schools based on the criterion of examination results expressed through educational value added. The analysis covered all comprehensive secondary schools in Poland over the2013 to 2015 period (a total of 1,943 schools). It determined the correlation between the size of a school expressed through the average number of graduates, and the results of thematura examination (the secondary schoolleaving exam in Poland) expressed through educational value added. Data for the analysis was obtained from the Section of Educational Value Added of the Educational Research Institute in Warsaw. The comprehensive secondary schools under study were divided into 5 classes, according to the criterion of the average annual number of graduates. The following analytical classes were distinguished: class A - up to 50 graduates, class B - 51-100 graduates, class C - 101-150 graduates, class D - 151 -200 graduates, class E - above 201 graduates. The analyses conducted in this study showed that the comprehensive secondary schools with over 600 pupils had the highest learning outcomes as expressed through educational value added. The lowest educational effectiveness was found in schools with less than 150 pupils. A dependency was discovered whereby the effectiveness of education increases as the number of pupils grows. Due to the lack of data concerning examination results in schools with more than 1,000 pupils (value indicated in American studies as the threshold value for positive learning outcomes), it was not possible to determine the maximum number of pupils that guarantees satisfactory learning outcomes.
A29|Life-Long Learning -perspective in life career|"Life-Long Learning can be interpreted as a response to of contemporary challenges. Today almost everyone commonly understands what Life-Long Learning is but when we look about it closer that meanings of LLL can be so different. Learning is can be presented for example as a unique phenomenon described as a way of life or as something that takes place in our daily interactions with "" the world"" around us or maybe be explained like great idea of education.This paper will show how LLL and human knowledge about Life-Long Learning are conceptualized in perspective of career and political-economic and social discourse. This paper will present the most relevant information based on results of studies (autobiographical narrative texts of life-F.Schütze) that was carried out under PHD project on 2015-2006 in Gdynia (Poland)."
A29|Education for Sustainable Development|Traditional education has conditioned us to believe that the world and the universe comprises distinct, isolated, material objects ? all separated from one another and collectively operating according to rational, deterministic, mechanistic laws. It has become conventional to describe sustainable development in terms of three overarching themes: economic, social, and ecological (sometimes called environmental). These are considered to be the fundamental areas of human experience that need to be addressed in any sustainable development scenario. This realisation that we are pushing the planet to its limits will require a more holistic view of education.It implies more of an inter-disciplinary approach and better links among the different school subjects, as well as a growing need for more thematic teaching. The education system will also have to set new goals, both at the level of complexity that the learners have to embrace and on producing learners with increased capacity to act. By combining a deeper and more integrated understanding with social and collaborative learning, students will explore making sustainable choices and decisions about their own lives, the lives of others, and their common environment. Social and collaborative problem-solving, decision-making, and capacity to make informed choices are central characteristics of combining interests and the ability to act. The interconnected environmental, economic, social and political challenges facing humanity demand capable and responsible citizens who can make informed choices and take appropriate action to create the conditions for social, economic, and environmental sustainability ? locally and globally.Education and lifelong learning are essential requisites for making those choices and taking such action.The report will present the Latvian experience and results in the education for Sustainable Development. The author of the article will share her teaching experience, will present her conclusions and provide practical examples for perfecting one?s knowledge and hope that this experience will be of use to her colleagues.
A29|Using YouTube video to promote university: a content analysis|In today’s global higher education environment, international students represent not only an important source of external income for universities: the degree of cross-border student mobility also reflects the internationalization of higher education sector. Universities have engaged in efforts to sell themselves to prospective students and promotional videos are among the most widely used marketing tools for this purpose. This article reports the results of a study analyzing the content of 140 higher education promotional videos from 14 countries available on YouTube. The results reveal that while the pattern of use of YouTube for two-way communication with viewers, information contents and appeal messages among sampled universities is fairly homogenous, some marked differences emerge when cultural background and global position ranking of the university are taken into account. The implications of these findings are that, although transnational higher education has been profoundly globalized, culture still plays a significant role in marketing practice for the recruitment of mobile students. In addition, different universities have various student-targeted segments. These findings provide the basis of a series of recommendations for universities looking to optimize their use of YouTube and promotional video design to market to international students.
A29|The Efficiency Of Differentiated Learning - Independent Learning Situations Versus Collaborative Learning|Current Romanian education emphasizes pupil group action in learning situations frontal organized, independently or in micro-groups. Thus, differentiated learning suffers, because it requires an individualized learning, and not just individual; there is necessary to alternate the organizing forms of learning situations, so they to produce progress in pupils’ learning. Using the method of the experiment, the undertaken research project has studied the impact of organizing individual learning situations compared to harmonizing the organizing forms of cooperative learning on pupil achievement in primary education. The experiential research sample consisted of 2 teachers and 56 pupils of class II. The control group comprised a class of 27 pupils, who have carried on an individual learning activity. The experiential group comprised 29 pupils who have carried out an activity based on the harmonizing different organizing forms of collaborationlearning. In the final assessment test, the results obtained by pupils confirmed the research hypothesis, demonstrating that in order to efficiently achieve the differentiated learning there is required a combination of organizing forms of learning and a stimulus for pupils’ collaborationwhich to increase their motivation for learning.
A29|The Model of the Formation and Implementation of the Creative and Innovative Potential of the Russian System of Higher Education|Theoretical interpretation and applied projection of the dynamics of the innovative role of higher education as a scientific basis for developing a model of the formation and implementation of the creative and innovative potential of the Russian higher education system are one of the most controversial problems of the modern Russian and world economy. The research is based on the principles of the system, system-situational and integrative approaches, macroeconomic and microeconomic analysis, methods of the structural and functional characteristics of the processes under study, research and projection of economic relations in their real dynamics with respect to their historical and logical origin. The integrating potential of the model of the transformative (creative and innovative) university is an adequate response to the challenges of the new era. This model allows to integrate and overcome a whole range of social and economic gaps in the public system precisely because it embodied the fundamental bases that meet the essence of the new era.
A29|Differing conceptions of the causes of the economic crisis: Effects of culture, economic training, and personal impact|We report findings from a survey regarding the lay perception of the causes of the worldwide economic and financial crisis. Respondents (N=2245) from a variety of countries were included: China (Hong Kong), Turkey, Russia, Israel, Germany, USA, and France. We have previously documented a range of factors that affects lay understanding of the crisis The present study expanded the database and focuses on the combination of factors that jointly predict whether the respondents view the crisis as a complex impersonal system that malfunctioned, or hold a moral/intentional view about its origins. We show that respondents from Western World countries, who were unaffected by the crisis and have economic training, interpret the crisis differently from all other respondents (i.e., those living in Turkey, Russia, or Hong Kong, and those who were personally affected by the crisis or without economic training). These differences have important implications on how policies are perceived and evaluated by the public, and should inform how they are presented to the public.
A29|High-Impact Practices: An Analysis Of Select University And Business School Programs|Colleges and universities are finding new ways to enhance the academic environment with high-impact programs such as student-based research, internships and international study abroad programs. Research has shown that students learn most when they are more engaged in the experience rather than passive participants. This exploratory study examines high-impact opportunities for undergraduate university students in the U.S. Web sites and other materials from 90 randomly selected AACSB and ACBSP member schools were reviewed to determine how each incorporates high-impact educational practices into their overall university programs and in their business school programs. Three high-impact programs were examined: undergraduate research, internships and global learning opportunities. Recommendations for future high-impact educational practices are discussed. High Impact (HI) programs are prevalent in U.S. colleges and universities. There is a significant positive relationship between high-impact activities and graduation rates. Institutions that have healthier high impact practices have better graduation rates. Larger schools and schools with AACSB accreditation also have stronger high impact practices devoted specifically to business schools. Doctoral granting institutions scored higher in all three practices analyzed in this study. Undergraduate research is the area in which high-impact ratings were the lowest
A29|The Influence of Early Literacy Competences on Later Mathematical Attainment: Evidence from TIMSS & PIRLS 2011|Childrenâ€™s competence levels in numeracy and literacy before or at school onset are good predictors of their attainment over the school years. Nevertheless, there are large differences in the level of numeracy and literacy knowledge among children at school entry. This initial knowledge gap has long-lasting negative consequences for the poor performers. Here we used international secondary data from the PIRLS&TIMSS 2011 as well as TIMSS 2011, including background data collected with the Learning to Read Survey, to identify early literacy practices that predict later mathematical attainment. Previous studies conducted using the same dataset have reported that early numeracy and literacy abilities before school onset (as reported by parents) are associated with studentsâ€™ later mathematical and reading attainment, respectively. Nevertheless recent theoretical frameworks of early mathematical development include certain literacy skills as an independent predictors of mathematical performance. Using ordinary least square regression models we found that early numeracy competences consistently predicted later mathematical attainment while the effects of early literacy competences were variable and not always significant for the individual countries. Results also showed a stronger influence of early reading abilities than of early writing abilities on later mathematical attainment. The identified effects were independent of childrenâ€™s gender, home resources for learning, parentsâ€™ highest education and occupation level, student years of pre-school attendance and early numeracy abilities. This report complements and extents previous body of research by determining the relative impact that early literacy skills have on later mathematical attainment across EU countries. Findings highlight the importance of including numeracy and literacy practices in the preprimary curriculum as well as the challenges of implementing ECEC curricula on the basis of identified best practices from international research.
A29|How to Give a Good Research Presentation: Three Essential Elements|This annotated presentation presents three basic guidelines for giving a compelling research presentation. First, use the introduction to create a gap in knowledge, which the research will then fill. Second, make kinetic slides, which allow the audience to anticipate some of the causal connections to be established in the formal analysis. Third, let the visual slides, the written paper, and the spoken narrative act as complements, not substitutes, giving each a unique role suitable to their form. Currently, these guidelines are routinely violated in research presentations, limiting their interest and effectiveness.
A29|La formación en economía social. Análisis de la oferta universitaria de posgrado en España<BR>[The training in social and solidarity economy. Analysis of the university offer in Spain]|En el presente artículo se analiza la importancia que tiene la formación para el fomento de la economía social, prestando especial atención a la caracterización de la oferta formativa de este tipo de estudios y diferenciándola respecto a la oferta formativa convencional en el área de Administración y Dirección de Empresas, emprendimiento e innovación. Previo a ello, se reflexiona, en base a un breve análisis bibliográfico, sobre las relaciones que se establecen entre educación y economía para, posteriormente, centrarnos en la caracterización de este tipo de formación, prestando especial atención a la que se centra en la Economía Social. Para ello, en primer lugar, se ha elaborado una base de datos en la que se incluyen todas las titulaciones de posgrado relacionadas con los estudios de Economía. Asimismo, se ha diseñado un cuestionario estructurado con el objetivo de caracterizar este tipo de formación. Se concluye la escasa importancia que tiene en el sistema universitario de posgrado español la formación en Economía Social, detectándose algunas diferencias significativas en la caracterización del proceso formativo entre las titulaciones de Economía Social y las convencionales de Administración y Dirección de Empresas, emprendimiento e innovación empresarial, en aspectos tales, como: los valores, las competencias, las habilidades, la forma de entender y transmitir el funcionamiento de la economía, etc. A partir de estas conclusiones se dan una serie de recomendaciones que pueden contribuir a fomentar y dinamizar, mediante la formación en posgrados, la Economía Social.
A29|Does Online Availability Increase Citations? Theory and Evidence from a Panel of Economics and Business Journals|Does online availability boost citations? Using a panel of citations to economics and business journals, we show that the enormous effects found in previous studies were an artifact of their failure to control for article quality, disappearing once fixed effects are added as controls. The absence of aggregate effects masks heterogeneity across platforms: JSTOR has a uniquely large effect, boosting citations around 10%. We examine other sources of heterogeneity, including whether JSTOR disproportionately increases cites from developing countries or to “long-tail” articles. Our theoretical analysis informs the econometric specification and allows citation increases to be translated into welfare terms. © 2015 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology

A29|Academics Assessment Of Students Web 2.0 Activities. Case Study Of The Economic Profile|The evaluation is the way through which the universities demonstrate their own value, but also that of their graduates. Our present paper suggests a debate regarding the evaluation of students in economics in a web 2.0 world. More precisely, we are trying to offer an answer to the question: Do the students of economics have the necessary computer science abilities to learn and to be evaluated in a 2.0 web environment? The paper starts off with the presentation of fundamental principles of assessment and teaching done with Web 2.0 means and methods. The exemplifications are added to this structure as they had been presented in the specialized works of this domain. The paper then goes on to present the results of our prospective study. Through this prospective study we wanted to identify the attributes based on which we could create the next phases of our research into elaborating the behavior of the students as it is observed during the process of evaluation. This evaluation takes place in a world that is bombarded with synchronic and a-synchronic means of communication called according to acronyms such as web 2.0, 3.0 and maybe even 4.0. It is in this context that we consider that the main purpose of the present paper is to determine the state of being prepared/ unprepared characterizing the student in the use (acceptance) of the evaluation and assessment of certain softs for socialization. In order to achieve our purpose, we have carried out a survey based on which we were intending to obtain the students’ level of perception regarding the evaluation system they are subjected to through web 2.0 means as well as their reaction to the web type of evaluation. The result we obtained demonstrated that the students are willing to participate at a declarative level, but they are not actually willing to be evaluated through web 2.0 means when it comes to practice. The end of the study is where we identified the need for a better means of informing and counseling both the students and the professors or other teaching staff in order to take full advantage of the Web 2.0 evaluation potential.
A29|Mother Tongue As A Viable Vehicle For Enhancing The Teaching/Learning Of Oral English Among Pupils In Edo Central Senatorial District Of Edo State, Nigeria|Nigeria is made up of 36 states and a Federal Capital Territory with 774 Local Government Councils. The nation has well over 350 indigenous languages (Osime, 2011). Edo State is one of the states. The state is located in the South-South geo-political region of the nation. Edo State is politically subdivided into 3 Senatorial Districts of Central, South and North. Our research is focused on one of the 5 local government areas of the state- Esan Central Local Government Area -in view with the place of the Esan language (which is basically the indigenous language of the people) as a viable tool for the teaching/learning of Oral English among pupils in the area. The place of language in the education of a child cannot be overemphasized. Inspite of the huge nature of Nigeria, she has no National language (NL). However, the nation has official language (OL) which is the English Language (EL). In view of the foregoing, the Nigerian National Policy on Education (NPE) stresses the importance of the use of Mother Tongue (MT) in the education of a child. Our focus was to step out the challenges being faced by primary school pupils in the Esan Central Local Government Area of Edo State as far as the use of Oral English (OE) is concerned. After a robust interaction with the learners, we discovered a lot of issues affecting the effective teaching/learning of Oral English. Consequently, recommendations were made. It is believed that if our recommendations are adhered to strictly, the current challenges identified would be over.

The Bologna process which began in 2003 with the signing of the Bologna declaration has led to the development of the European Higher Education Area combining respect for the diversity of programs, institutions and educational traditions in specific countries. As results of these process Albanian universities have introduced the following, training at three levels (licentiates, Master's and PhD). Through this paper we shall try to show what the tools are needed to achieve autonomy and put in the efficiency for our university system to serve a quality education and increase the academic quality of higher education institutions themselves
A29|How to apply as a doctoral student in Germany?|There are some peculiarities for applying as a doctoral student in Germany. The aim of this paper is to explain the most important ones for foreign graduates considering doctoral studies in Germany. Doctoral studies are free in Germany and one can get even a paid job at the university or a stipend while writing one's dissertation. There are some formal requirements for doctoral students but it is most important to convince a professor to accept one. For this end and in one's own interest it is decisive to look for a good match, particularly similar research interests.
A29|Level of Satisfaction of Educational Services Consumers. Impact and Consequences for the Responsibility of an Economics Faculty|The aims of this paper are to provide a conceptual delimitation of educational services and their main and secondary components, and to quantify the level of satisfaction of specific consumers in academic organizations specializing in economics, with a view to restructuring their responsibilities. The method of statistical investigation is the thorough investigation including the graduates of bachelor and master courses in the accounting economic field, based on a questionnaire assessing the opinions of 138 graduates from the Faculty of Economics of Pitesti, which covers the full spectrum of 93 distinct variables. The databases were analyzed from a descriptive statistical standpoint with the software package Eviews, focusing on the normality of distributions. The major assumptions concern identifying variables intensely associated with the level of satisfaction of educational services consumers, for the first three and six main service categories, defined by 36 variables marked by respondents, plus another three and respectively six categories in further 15 variables, which define secondary educational services (according to the correlation ratio). Educational organizations belonging to the academic area are naturally concerned with the requirements expressed in the complex concept of satisfaction of those trained through the programs and specializations of a faculty (in this case, an economic faculty), with the aim that the educational services provided in a sustainable manner should cover nearly all their expectations as consumers (students and MA trainees), and also the educational requirements for shaping and training skills that the graduates need in order to succeed in the labour market. The differentiated behaviours of the consumers of educational services can be found at the end of the paper, in a number of econometric models that allow a coherent strategy; they lend a much greater responsibility to the organization doing the job, namely by improving the reputation of an economics faculty, reflected in the vectors and the detailed rating and specific to such surveys. The impact of educational services and the responsibility of the academic organizations for these services to be, through accurate and complete information, conducive to providing satisfactory performance for graduates in the labour market, are the core of the last section of this paper. The conclusions round out the whole endeavour, completing and detailing some necessary upcoming projects.
A29|Attitudes and Intentions of Business Master Students towards Sustainable Tourism and Entrepreneurship|Sustainable development has become in the last three decades an issue of high importance, both from theoretical view and from the public policies’ view. Nevertheless, sustainable development can be generated only by sustainable enterprises and businesses, which should take into consideration not only the economic aspects, but also the social and environmental ones, i.e. businesses striving to meet the ”triple bottom line”. This paper aims at investigating master students in Business Administration, i.e. future business people, are actually prepared for creating and running businesses in sustainable tourism and which is the profile of future “sustainable entrepreneur”. In order to answer this question, a surveybased research was conducted among master students in Business administration, concerning aspects such as: what is the understanding of business master students on ”sustainability” issues and which are their sustainability-related habits, attitudes and behaviour as consumers. We used factorial analysis, resulting in a four factors model, to investigate attitudes related to: importance to run a sustainable business, the use of renewable energy resources, recycling used products, employing local labour force, promoting the use of local resources etc. The paper presents the main findings in the context of previous researches in the literature, drawing conclusions and proper recommendations.
A29|Student Evaluation of a Training Program in International Agricultural Development| In the program that is featured in the poster, participants were members of the Nevada National Guard’s Agribusiness Development Team (ADT). The program consisted of four days of training to develop an overall understanding of agriculture in the U.S. and world. The classroom training encompassed topics related to agriculture and the modern world and global resources for food. The first three days were group sessions, specifically, classroom lectures, guest presentations, activities, and case studies. The fourth day involved the group breaking out into specialist teams, guided by faculty members in bio-physical science disciplines. The training was attended by 11 army personnel and was held on the campus of Cal Poly Pomona in the U.S. The focus of the poster is the evaluation of the training program that was done by participants.
A29|Balancing European SME Managers’ Training Contents: Perceived Importance & Training Needs|Background: Given the limited available time of in-service professionals, the balance between the perceived importance of the course content and training needs is essential for the acceptance and attractiveness of training courses aimed at them. Objectives: The goal of the paper is to contribute to the development of entrepreneurship and business training programs for European SME managers. Methods/Approach: In six European countries a survey focusing on SME managers’ views on the importance of individual items from a list of potential course content items, and their training needs was carried out, and followed by an analysis using exploratory and multivariate techniques. It was aimed at identifying homogeneous groups of managers with common training needs and perceptions of content importance. Results: Homogeneous groups of managers who assign the same importance to certain competences and who have common training needs are identified. Conclusions: Results of our research could help training institutions to develop courses aimed at SME managers. The balancing approach proved to be an interesting method of combining conflicting requirements for the training course curriculum development.
A29|Up or Out: Research Incentives and Career Prospects of Postdocs in Germany|" type=""main"" xml:id=""geer12010-abs-0001""> Academic careers in Germany have been under debate for a while. We conduct a survey among postdocs in Germany to analyze the perceptions and attitudes of postdocs regarding their research incentives, their working conditions, and their career prospects. We conceptualize the career prospects of a postdoc in a life-cycle perspective of transitions from academic training to academic or non-academic jobs. Only about half of the postdocs sees strong incentives for academic research, but there is quite a strong confidence to succeed in an academic career. Furthermore, postdocs who attended a PhD program show better career prospects and higher research incentives compared to others. Academic career prospects and motivation are strongest for assistant professors. Apart from this small group, however, postdocs report only a small impact of the university reforms of the last decade. Female postdocs show significantly higher research incentives but otherwise we find little gender differences. Finally, good prospects in non-academic jobs are not associated with a reduction in the motivation for research."
A29|The Integration Of Creativity Management Models Into Universities’Virtual Learning Communities|Given the access of an increasingly higher number of individuals to virtual learning networks, the issue of creativity management becomes extremely important, especially for schools and universities. In the specialized literature, participating in virtual learning communities has several advantages, including: permanent access to information, high educational performance and increased creativity, and also better-developed professional identity (North and Kumta, 2014; Boulay and van Raalte, 2014). In the Romanian literature, there are few studies that aim directly at the relationship between the participation in virtual learning networks and creativity and innovation management models, especially in higher education institutions. This paper aims to study the ways in which creativity and innovation management models can be used in virtual learning networks in order to achieve better productivity at both individual and organizational levels, taking into account several best practices from this field and their possible implementation in Romanian educational institutions.

A29|Student perceptions toward flipped learning: New methods to increase interaction and active learning in economics|The “flipped classroom” has begun to revolutionize the way that students receive information from their teachers and is ushering in a new era of active and creative thinkers. Although flipping the classroom has gained popular attention, very little research has focused on flipping the classroom at the collegiate level. This paper documents the implementation of a “partially-flipped” class over one semester of a large enrollment microeconomics course, as well as presents results of students’ perception toward flipped learning. I find that students respond positively to flipped learning, and that it is an instructional design that is beneficial across student groups.
A29|Economics education: literacy or mind framing? Evidence from a survey on the social building of trust in Portugal|This paper deals on the issue of whether or not studying economics has a relevant effect on molding the values and attitudes characteristic of the trust-building processes prevailing in a democratic society. Mainstream economics teaching, based on the self-interest model of rational, maximizing, individualistic representative agents, may well cause indoctrinating effects, creating or reinforcing both political conservatism and selfishness values and behaviors among economics students. This result is confirmed by most studies in relevant literature, but it may be otherwise explained by a so-called self-selection effect, suggesting that “economists are born, not made”. In this paper a contribution to this literature is made with more empirical evidence, namely the results of a survey entitled “Social Building of Trust in Portugal”, referring to a considerable diversity of samples (economics students, other students, ordinary citizens of two counties, urban and rural) and being applied in three different years: 2006, 2009 and 2012.

A29|Does Tenure Make Researchers Less Productive? The Case of the “Specialist”|Many studies suggest that research productivity falls after tenure is granted. We have however limited choice-theoretic understanding of why this should occur. With some simplifying assumptions, we rationalize this as follows. Scholars are assumed to be “specialists”: their research productivity consists in transforming Ph.D. chapters into publishable papers. We show how a department that hired such a scholar provides incentives to maximize research productivity. We show his research productivity and publication paths are then characterized by a “bang-bang” solution, i.e., either he works with maximum or minimum effort. The department sets the scholar’s wages proportional to the department’s impatience to spur his productivity, and only succeeds if he turns out to be more impatient than the department. The paper provides a novel perspective on academic productivity and the tenure system.
A29|The Measuring Effect of Employee Satisfaction of Academic Staff to Employee Performance|This study is for the faculties of Economics and Administrative Sciences, Communication, Tourism, Theology and Literature based on Gumushane University, and for instructors who take charge in the units based on Rectorship. As a result of this study, the effect of academic staff and employee satisfaction when compared to employee performance have been researched and documented. In this context, the effects of internal and external satisfaction to employee performance that are two subdimensions of employee performance, also have been studied to be implemented. Also, the activity of wages policy which to please academic staff, has been evaluated in the recent period. In conclusion, employee satisfaction of attenders partly affects employee performances. Moreover, it has been detected that the external satisfaction levels of attenders positively affected performance senses. This result has shown that the applied wages policy was interpreted as an useful policy for them in the recent period. In addition to this, the evidence has been reached that the internal satisfaction levels of academic staff negatively affected academic job performance.
A29|Business Education For Sustainable Development: The Case of Romanian Universities|Our study approaches the concept of sustainable development from a business perspective by looking into how universities can contribute to incorporating sustainability in the formation of future business professionals.

A29|Insights On Ethical Behavior Of Individuals In Mexican Organizations, Reflexion Sobre El Comportamiento Etico De Los Individuos En Las Organizaciones En Mexico|There is insufficient information about individualâ€™s ethical behavior in Mexican organizations and the drivers that motivate non ethical behavior. The objective of this investigation is to identify the variables that cause such unethical behavior. We found eleven variables of organizational behavior that influence individuals to engage in unethical acts. These variables are: pressure for unrealistic objectives, adverse personal situations, competition for scarce resources, individualÂ´s professional growth, and work pressure. Despite the fact that most companies have Codes of Ethics to encourage an adequate behavior of its stakeholders, we found that none have a prevention program to avoid such unethical behaviors.
A29|Using the medical group as a learning tool in economic education|The learning group in Regional Economics works in a similar way as the Balint medical group. During a session, a “problem” is presented by a group member, in the context of a rotation or “turn taking”. The other members do not try to ”solve the problem” by adding technical information or giving “advice” to the presenter. Instead, they explore its meaning by treating the issue as if it were their own problem, revealing in loud voice their free associations with the topic initially presented. This kind of reflection helps the presenter because it forces her to “think further” about the issue, overriding the trend to solve the problem in an automatic, pseudo-intuitive way.

Analysing a case study approach, the resulting evidence is strong support for the inclusion of Jesuit pedagogical foundations that are traditionally absent from non-humanities based modules.
A29|Foundations of the economic and social history of the United States: Metaphysical|"""Oppositional Analysis"" - the name I give to the metaphysics presented in this volume - proposes a number of dichotomies through which one may analyze and understand systematically the structure of every level of reality. Macroeconomic theory, as well as social research, are two excellent stages upon which we may search for clues and insights to the interaction of oppositions. This is so particularly in connection with an analysis of the precepts of the ""Austrian School"" of macroeconomics as presented by Ludwig von Mises in his well-known and highly influential book Human Action. Based upon the circuit given for a musical note (see the Apologia and the Introduction to Volume 2, as well as the more extensive treatment herein) and the ""Circuit of Being"" which will be introduced in this final volume, I propose a model of economics which may correlate with a view of the physical universe of five dimensions as suggested by Theodor Kaluza. I suggest that these dichotomies may underlie the unity created by Kaluza’s work between General Relativity and Maxwell’s equations for electro-magnetism. If this is so, Oppositional Analysis and the economic and social history of the United States may provide a starting point from which we may learn important insights as to the inner workings of these economic and social oppositions as well oppositions of a more physical nature."
A29|Šedesát let oboru finance na Vysoké škole ekonomické v Praze<BR>[60 Years of the Study Branch Finance at the University of Economics, Prague]|The article deals with circumstances in which finance as a branch of study at the University of Economics, Prague (UEP) has been developed. Finance is taught both as a theoretical part of economic science and as a subject preparing students for practical work in the field of finance. Finance is one of the oldest branches existing at the UEP established at the same time as the University, in September 1953. At that time the soviet economic model was applied on the Czechoslovak economy including the field of finance. So the translations of soviet textbooks were used in addition to the Czech ones. In the sixties the problems in development of the Czechoslovak economy intensified and the necessity to strengthen the role of money in the economy was emphasized. This tendency reflected in the contents of teaching process. The period of normalization broke these efforts, but the teaching had never been completely restored to the position it had in the sixties. After 1989 the teaching concentrated on the role of finance in the conditions of market economy. Study program provides knowledge of the issues of financial markets, banking, insurance, national and local budgets and public finance.

Didaktische Lehr-Lern-Konzeption und empirische Analyse fuer die Sekundarstufe II|Die vorliegende Arbeit ist ein interdisziplinaerer Beitrag zur persoenlichkeits- und kompetenzorientierten Entrepreneurship-Forschung. Im Fokus steht die Frage, ob die unternehmerische Persoenlichkeit im Rahmen einer Entrepreneurship Education zur ganzheitlichen Foerderung unternehmerischer Handlungskompetenzen entwickelt werden kann. Dieser Frage wird auf theoretischer, konzeptioneller und empirischer Ebene nachgegangen. Neben der Legitimation des Bedarfs der Entrepreneurship-Foerderung erfolgen eine Diskussion der referenztheoretischen Basis unternehmerischer Persoenlichkeit und ihrer Entwickelbarkeit sowie eine kritische Wuerdigung der persoenlichkeitsorientierten Entrepreneurship-Forschung, der in der vorliegenden Arbeit inhaltlich und methodisch begegnet wird. Bezug nehmend auf die Interaktion der Persoenlichkeits- und Kompetenzentwicklung werden Anforderungen an die konzeptionelle Ausgestaltung subjektorientierter Entrepreneurship Education-Massnahmen zur ganzheitlichen Foerderung unternehmerischer Handlungskompetenzen aufgezeigt. Auf dieser Basis wird ein didaktisch begruendeter, konzeptioneller Vorschlag fuer eine Entrepreneurship Education, die diesen Anforderungen entspricht, skizziert. Im Zuge der Implementierung dieses Entrepreneurship Education-Konzepts in der Sekundarstufe II einer allgemein- und einer berufsbildenden Schule wird zur UEberpruefung der Entwicklung unternehmerischer Persoenlichkeit eine Laengsschnittuntersuchung im Paneldesign mit zwei Erhebungswellen durchgefuehrt. Aus den Ergebnissen der Interventionsstudie ergeben sich Erkenntnisse zur Entwicklung unternehmerischer Persoenlichkeit sowie Implikationen fuer kuenftige Forschung. Fuer die Entrepreneurship Education-Praxis bietet die Arbeit eine didaktische Grundlegung einer handlungsorientierten Unterrichtsreihe zur ganzheitlichen Entwicklung unternehmerischer Handlungskompetenzen sowie konzeptionelle Desiderata fuer Entrepreneurship Education-Massnahmen zur Foerderung unternehmerischen Denkens und Handelns.
A29|The Alpha of a Survey of the Literature in Economic and Financial Literacy|There is a century long history of economic and financial education laced with implications for both political civic education. It has been argued by some economists that since economics is based on rational self-interested “agents” we don’t need to teach economics at the undergraduate level all. This paper offers a brief review of the literature from the K- college results of economic and financial education extending the survey to the more recent attempts at public financial and economic education. In the review we try to highlight both the results and types of approaches. We then identify some of the areas in which the relatively new areas of behavioral and experimental economics are relevant to economic and financial literacy efforts. We speculate on how these findings may effect economic and financial literacy efforts in the future. JEL Classification: A20, A21, A22, A29

A29|The Contribution Of The Foreign Languages In Improving The Services In Higher Education|In the eyes of the whole world, the European Union had and has a huge influence upon the economical, commercial, legal, social and cultural conditions of the member states and now it represents a reality and a certainty. In this society of globalization and technology the young generation plays an important role in building the Europe of tomorrow. Due to the political social and economic changes that have occurred in our lives in the recent decades doubled by the tremendous development of the digital technology the academic education must take important steps towards a united Europe, a unity achieved mainly through the means of education. â€œThe best school is the one, where above all, you learn to learnâ€ said the Romanian historian and philosopher Nicolae Iorga. Nowadays the best school gives students the opportunity to learn at least a foreign language, offering them the possibility of academic or professional mobility. Our paper aims to present the role of foreign languages in improving not only the students' quality of life but also the services in higher education.
A29|Executive Development Programmes - Requirements and Success Factors|The article deals with the requirements placed on Executive Development Programmes (EDPs) and their success factors. Executives belong to the top and upper management of companies who see the organization as a unit and not the individual function areas in the foreground. EDPs seek qualification that goes beyond the skills of their current activities, they offer practical state-of-the-art training to acquire new techniques, and they benefit from the experience of other participants. Further education institutions have to satisfy the demand for teaching technical, conceptual and social skills in compliance with the requirements of the learning process and type of content. Selection criteria for an alternative training or a specific school are, in general, content, target group and existing own resources. Using a practice-induced model, interdependent success factors of EDPs were identified such as provider quality, experiential learning and internationality, applied approach and environmental conditions.
A29|Students’ perceptions of economics: identifying demand for further study| Most university departments aspire to increase their quantity of students. The objective of this empirical study is to ascertain whether it is possible to identify students who would demand more economics study. Using data on student perceptions of economics and the application of logistic regression, two step autoclustering, K means clustering, analysis of variance and Tukey's honestly significant difference statistical techniques, we reveal distinct clusters of students, including a small cluster of students who appear to be more open to further study.
A29|Teaching Italian as a foreign language: the educational use of economic texts|The present paper tries to emphasize how to learn the Italian language and culture through technical texts, with special emphasis on the texts of the economy. The use of authentic materials such as special purpose languages, in our case the language of economics, during the lessons of Italian, has proven to be a good method for language acquisition. As the basis of our work, we have chosen the vocabulary of economic language, even though the list of terms used particularly in a field are also present in the common language. We have developed a teaching unit dedicated to business students who have a B1-B2 proficiency level. Starting from a banking-financial text, our lesson takes into consideration, through various exercises, morphological and syntactic aspects, as well as the vocabulary of finance and economics.
A29|Business communication and Italian commercial correspondence|"Despite more frequent use of e-mails, fax messages, or memos, letters still have their role in trade. At the same time, this form of correspondence adapts itself to current times, with the purpose of not being eliminated by ""competition"", adopting new formats and structures. The present paper tries to make a brief presentation of the main means of communication, with a particular accent on business correspondence. A detailed description will be given to the types of Italian business letters (circulars, bids, requests, orders, etc.), to their subcategories (external and internal circulars, offers of goods and services etc.), to their aesthetic format and to their structures."
A29|What do people know about the economy? A test of minimal economic knowledge in Germany|This research evaluates Minimal Economic Knowledge (MEK) in Germany - that is, basic knowledge of economic facts, concepts, and causal relationships needed for understanding and successfully participating in the economy. It is addressed to gain an understanding of the level of Minimal Economic Knowledge in the German public. To fulfill this goal we conducted three studies: The first study developed a scale for measuring MEK using a Delphi method approach. The resulting questionnaire comprises 24 questions in four economic domains: finance, labor economics, consumption, and state economics, testing for three kinds of knowledge within each domain - facts, concepts, and causal relationships. Our second study tested the MEK level in a representative sample of German adults (N=1,314), with a mean result of 59.4 (of 100) indicating a considerable lack of economic knowledge. It further analyses the influence of demographic drivers such as gender and age. A third, explorative study (N=243) determined additional drivers for MEK such as a person's origin, life experience, use of media, and social circumstance.

Los resultados indicaron, según la escala utilizada, que los encuestados poseen conocimientos aceptables en materia de Educación Financiera. El ANOVA confirmó diferencias significativas en algunas variables tomando en cuenta aspectos tales como el tipo de escuela, el grado escolar, el sexo, la edad de los participantes y la escolaridad de los padres. Se identificaron las variables a atender con especial interés para el diseño de la propuesta didáctica para la enseñanza de temas financieros.
A29|La estrategia y la construcción del conocimiento - strategy and knowledge construction|El objetivo de este trabajo teórico es explicar los procesos estratégicos desde la óptica de la epistemología constructivista, analizando así el sistema, su entorno y sus vínculos. El lenguaje es el coordinador conductual básico, mientras que la estrategia es el coordinador conductual de orden superior. Proponemos que el proceso estratégico consiste en una constante equilibración de asimilaciones y acomodaciones sucesivas y simultáneas de los constructos cognitivos del decisor. Concluimos que, dado que los cambios en el entorno son cada vez más rápidos, profundos y complejos, los constructos cognitivos estratégicos deben estar en permanente proceso de reconstrucción, incorporando a la incertidumbre y a la amenaza de ruptura cognitiva como trasfondo y marco de la estrategia. Por lo tanto, la teoría de la estrategia puede ser profundamente potenciada por la epistemología, entendida como la teoría del conocimiento
A29|El valor en la organización|El valor es esencial en toda organización pero ha sido matizado en términos de la rentabilidad para los accionistas y de los beneficios netos; este documento explora el valor desde una percepción subjetiva, objetiva, tangible e intangible, teniendo en cuenta pensadores clásicos de la Economía, para clarificar su concepto a partir de su evolución y llegar a profundizarlo a partir de la escuela del aprendizaje de la estrategia, para articular el valor de uso y el transaccional con el conocimiento producto del aprendizaje. Estas acciones canalizan el valor y la dirección, desplegados en los diferentes niveles de la organización, son las encargadas de dar orientación, integrar y dinamizar los conocimientos, las relaciones entre los diversos recursos y sus iteraciones, para transformar el valor existente en flujos de valor que permitan la generación de nuevo valor para la organización y sus partes interesadas
A29|Algunos Interrogantes en torno al desarrollo de los clusters|Desde los años noventa, a raíz de los aportes de Porter (1991), el tema de los clusters se ha constituido en un objeto de análisis y en un mecanismo de política pública para mejorar la competitividad y el desarrollo económico de los territorios. Lo anterior supondría una mayor competitividad para aquellas empresas que trabajan bajo esquemas de aglomeración territorial con el apoyo de instituciones de interfase que para aquellas que operan de manera aislada. Así, las empresas que lograrían tener desempeños superiores serían las que al mismo tiempo podrían cooperar y competir. A tenor de esto, el artículo busca, entre otros aspectos, conjeturar en torno a cómo en una situación contradictoria, dos o más organizaciones empresariales pueden tejer o no relaciones de confianza y construir relaciones de cohesión donde se convive en medio de interacciones de complementariedad y antagonismo, así como establecer cómo se enfrenta en estas asociaciones productivas los procesos de cambio. La perspectiva que se asume en este artículo busca integrar los planteamientos esenciales de la llamada escuela del posicionamiento estratégico con la teoríadel cambio y la teoría de la confianza. Para ello, éste se estructuró en torno a cuatro interrogantes: ¿qué es un cluster?, ¿cuáles son los factores económicos y estratégicos que posibilitan los clusters?, ¿cuál es el rol que tiene el cambio en el posicionamiento estratégico de los clusters? y ¿cuál es el papel que desempeña la confianza en la conformación y desarrollo de los clusters
A29|Sistemas de control estratégico y organizacional. Críticas|El control ha sido históricamente considerado parte fundamental para el logro de los objetivos en las organizaciones empresariales. Sin embargo, es ampliamente criticado dada su reacción tardía a las condiciones cambiantes del entorno y su incapacidad para actuar en ausencia de crisis. Por lo anterior, y a fin de identificar las causas que expliquen por qué estos sistemas fallan se exploran en el presente documento el papel y las características del control, soportada para tal fin en aspectos como la teoría del control, las teorías económicas y administrativas, así como resultados de estudios empíricos. El estudio destaca, entre otros aspectos, que los sistemas de control tradicional incluyen instrumentos orientados a la búsqueda de equilibrios estables tales como la centralización, la estandarización y la especialización, los cuales limitan o reducen las posibilidades de actuación de los individuos y por tanto disminuyen la posibilidad de responder Rápida y efectivamente ante nuevas circunstancias

A29|Coaching a regular economics research seminar at Lisbon University in 2010-2011: a groupanalytic approach|This paper describes the implementation of a new protocol for the regular economics seminar run by the Economics Department of ISEG and the research center UECE during academic year 2010-2011. The main innovative features of this protocol were: the introduction of a discussant that explains the paper using a clear, non-technical language, thus giving “holding” to the audience; the requirement that the speaker should be “silent” during the discussion stage, in order to “frustrate” the audience and encourage them to reinterpret the paper presented in a personal way, thus giving “exchange” to the presenter. The new protocol was successful in ensuring a satisficing participation level and had a remarkable effect upon change in learning understandings in the School, namely through the engagement of important professors of ISEG as discussants during the sessions. The main shortcoming was the strength of resistances to change within the seminar team, in particular in what concerns the requirement that the presenter should be “outside” the group during the discussion stage.

A29|Finding Methods To Combat The Lack Of Interest Students For Knowledge - A Priority In Contemporary Society|Romania is currently facing an acute crisis of values. The students' interest for knowledge declined alarmingly. The society puts so in front of the education system new problems and new demands about human resources training, level of education and culture of the population, standards of conduct and aspirations. As a result of new acquisitions of the science and of the culture, of the human knowledge in general and especially due to the dynamics of these processes, the school is placed in a position to reconsider periodically the contents of training, the values of the system, the strategies. School also must find appropriate ways to combat students' disinterest for knowledge. Therefore, the paper analyzes the causes that led to this phenomenon, by applying questionnaires to students and outline several solutions designed to drive society towards progress, towards knowledge.

A29|Estudio sobre el cálculo de costes de la formación on-line|Para mantener una economía productiva, competitiva y sostenible es necesario el aumento del nivel de competencia de los trabajadores y la adaptación a los cambios sociales y laborales en que nos encontramos inmersos. Es indudable que el uso de las nuevas tecnologías (TIC) es el factor que más ha influido en una nueva cultura de la formación, a la vez que presenta un medio que contribuye poderosamente a su expansión, con sus aplicaciones en la educación a distancia. Desde la Unión Europea se viene insistiendo en la necesidad de desarrollar una formación profesional a lo largo de la vida que permita la adquisición de nuevos conocimientos y el reciclaje permanente para conseguir una mejor promoción e integración social de los trabajadores así como una mayor competitividad de las empresas. El cálculo de costes de las acciones de e-learning es un cálculo que implica de una laboriosa tarea de recolección de datos. Habitualmente, como sucede con muchos otros servicios TIC, el cálculo de costes olvida conceptos que acaban convirtiéndose en costes ocultos. En el presente estudio se pretende diseñar un modelo de cálculo de costes completo que compute aquellos costos ocultos y que no están incorporados en los cálculos de costos habituales. En este sentido se van a estructurar en dos grupos: • Recursos humanos: Docentes, técnicos y CAU • Recursos técnicos. Hospedaje, LMS y producción de contenidos Este modelo será contrastado con diferentes entidades participantes en el proyecto de formación continua online de la Generalitat Valenciana (E-Formación GVA) de forma que se recaben datos fidedignos y se consensue un modelo de costos. Posteriormente servirá como base para el desarrollo de una aplicación que permita describir un escenario económico de inversiones a realizar para poder desempeñar las acciones de e-learning.
A29|Education and Training Needs in the Field of Visitors Receiving Structures and Tourism Services in the Lower Danube Region|"The paper analyzes the new realities and conditions for the development of tourism in the Lower Danube region in the context of the ""Danube Strategy"" of the EU, the state of the Bulgarian and Romanian tourist market, and the Romania market, as well as the possibilities for development of alternative tourism along the Danube. Special attention has been paid to the problems of education and training in the field of tourist facilities and services in Bulgaria and Romania and the need for their improvement. The reasons for this are that education and training are strategic factor for sustainable development trough contribution to human capital development, within the Romania-Bulgaria Cross-Border Cooperation Program 2007-2013. In relation to this the Academy of Economic Studies in Bucharest, Romania and D. Tsenov Academy of Economics in Svishtov, Bulgaria decided to collaborate in the field “Cooperation on human resources development – joint development of skills and knowledge”, through the development of cross-border liaisons and exchanges between the two universities. Both Bulgaria and Romania have represented and still represent important tourism destinations in Eastern Europe, promoting coastal tourism, spas, mountain resorts or heritage tourism. Comparing with the existent potential and with the other Central and East-European countries, including Bulgaria, Romania has modest economical performances in tourism industry. The last decade shows a relative decline of external demand for Romania, the main causes being the missing fund for investment in developing, modernization, and rehabilitation of specific infrastructure, the less diversification of the entertainment, the tourism services’ quality – lesser comparative with competitors. On other hand, in the same period, Bulgaria has improved the tourism services’ quality and economic performances. Training specialists in tourism is one of the ways of performance growth in this field. Although there are numerous educational institutions for tourism professionals (high school and vocational school, universities with Bachelor and Masters Degrees, post university and doctoral studies), in both countries the quality of the tourism employees is low and unable to sustain high quality services. Therefore, trans-border cooperation in tourism between Romania and Bulgaria can bring benefits both in better turning to account the touristic potential and the educational systems of the two countries."
A29|Central Banks' Involvement in Encouraging Economic Education and Literacy|Currently, economic education plays a vital role in the future health of world economy and enables citizens to efficiently participate in the society in which they live. The economic literacy of citizens is not only the problem of state authorities, but it is also a common challenge and responsibility for many public institutions and non-profit organizations. Key players among these institutions are central banks that invest significant resources in educating the public to achieve economic efficiency, a good conduct of monetary policy and welfare. The aim of the paper is to emphasize the involvement of more-and-more central banks in fostering economic education and literacy, not before clarifying some key concepts and highlighting the importance of the subject in our society.
A29|Steve Sharpe: A Stock Report|This case pertains to the valuation approach for a common stock being considered for purchase by a student in a Student-Managed Fund (SMF) class at a university. The fundamental factors of analysis pertaining to the profile of the company include the firmâ€™s products or services, the nature of the demand for the products and the managerial comparisons for sales. In addition, earnings per share, return on sales, return on assets and return on equity are considered. However, historical data on price-earnings ratios and dividend payout ratios are very important in all valuations, but they are not stressed in the case. The emphasis of the case relates to recognition of risk, as it pertains to the common stock of the firm, estimations of the required rate of return (sometimes known as the hurdle rate), calculation of the present value factor which permits analysts to determine the present value of annualized return data projected into a specific future period. A price of the common stock projected into the future can be discounted to compare its present value with the current market price to determine whether the stock is undervalued or overvalued. In like fashion, a holding period return calculated in a time period greater than five years can be annualized for comparison with the required return obtained from an asset pricing model to determine whether the stock is undervalued or overvalued.
A29|The Student-Managed Fund: A Case Study of Portfolio Properties|This case provides students with an in-depth look at various risk measurements in portfolio management. The primary issues examined in this case are: 1) Review pertinent concepts of describing and summarizing a bath of numerical data in the context of identifying portfolio properties. Although these concepts have been covered in basic statistics courses, it is important enough to go over again so that students may be better prepared for discussions regarding various risk measurements in portfolio management; 2) A distinction between use of geometric and arithmetic return data; 3) How risk is measured in investments, and what some of the measures of risk are used. In particular, it is recommended that a spreadsheet model be used to compute these various risk measurements. Differentiate between different types of risk; namely, total risk, systematic risk, and nonsystematic risk; 4. Demonstrate that the true betas tend to move toward 1.0 over time. With more advanced students, it is recommended that they use the Excel spreadsheet, (or some other statistical software, i.e., SAS or Minitab), to run the single-index regression model and verify these beta estimates. This case has a difficulty level appropriate for senior or first year MBA students. It is designed to be taught in a single class period (60 to 80 minutes). With more advanced students, the case can be assigned as a team project. The team presents their findings and conclusions to the class. If the case is used as a team presentation project, approximately 2 to 3 hours of student preparation time should be adequate for most students depending on their computational ability.

A29|Rebordering the borders created by multidisciplinary sciences: A study|Emergence of “Glass ceiling” like phenomena in the minds of professionals doing research in a multidisciplinary subject needs to be studied. For an example, computational neurosciences(CNS) comprises of neurology, cognitive science, psychology, computer science, physics, mathematics, information technology, radiology, anthropology, sociology, and biology. When a specialist doing research in a multidisciplinary science like computational neuroscience, know less about other disciplines. This at times leads to tension among the members of the multidisciplinary group. This may create an environment where some members feel excluded. This may also lead to a power structure among different professionals. In case of CNS, the biological scientists feel the computational and engineering sciences may use their mathematical power to control them. On the other hand the engineering scientists feel they need to learn more about biology to understand CNS. The highly technical medical specialist such as Electro physiologists were also feeling like the biologists. As computational neurosciences gaining more importance, it is important to understand the interaction among the scientists from different disciplines and its effect on the development of discipline. The present paper is an attempt to study the dynamics of the members of the multidisciplinary group, who have done their short course on CNS.

A29|Realistic Research Policy Of European Dimensions|The paper aims at delineating the directions of the research policy of UE–Varna on the eve of 90th anniversary of the establishment of the University. The presentation on that issue is preceded by an analysis of the main factors that have influenced the development and the state of the academic science of economics after 1990. According to the author, the change of the economic system and the democratic transformations in the country have created a greatly modified environment for the development of the University science of economics, which should be taken into consideration when formulating an adequate and realistic research policy. After a brief survey of the new directions of the research policy of the academic governing body in the conditions of Bulgaria’s full membership of the EU, according to the author there have been identified five key fields of research policy, on which our efforts should focus in perspective. Those are: greater purposefulness in the thematic orientation of research; broader use of the project/program - based principle and existing opportunities both nationally and internationally; creation of autonomous units for research activity in the structure of the University; differentiation of a „Research” fund and improving the administrative capacity of the Department of Research.

The results indicate that CAPM is used in most SMFs as the means to estimate the required rate of return. Value Line and Wall Street Journal are the two most widely used information sources by SMFs. It is not common for a SMF to be equipped with its own trading room. The median value of the SMFs is $460,000, but the sampling distribution of the SMFsâ€™ market capitalizations is highly right-skewed. Most of the SMFs have the same asset allocation decision. In total, about 69% of the SMFs in our sample invest at least 90% of the capital in Equity.

We describe briefly the genesis of this system and pointed out that Tunisia in spite of remarkable progress, suffers from some problems related to the low and partial integration of the professional training system in the general system of training. In a more precise way, the implement of professional training turns out incapable to anticipate future professions. Furthermore, when certain professions are not any more asked on the labour market, the implement continues to form candidates without taking into account the change of demand in labour market. Also, the output of the professional training system continues to convey a negative image with the public as well as companies. Finally, linkages between professional training and the other elements of the system of training are little numerous, or even inexistent. All these dysfunctionalities, and many others, exist well and truly in both countries.
A29|The transition to market-based economic education: evaluating program effectiveness in Kazakhstan|This article presents an analysis of a program designed to enhance economic literacy through teacher training in the former Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan. The cognitive and affective outcomes for high school students who were taught by teachers trained through the National Council on Economic Education's (NCEE) International Economic Education Exchange Program (IEEEP) are examined and compared to those of students in courses taught by a sample of teachers who had not received training. like most publicly supported programs, beneficiaries were not randomly chosen and assigned to treatment and control groups. To overcome the inherent sample selection which allowed for the interdependency of economic understanding and attitudes. The results indicate that students taught by trained teachers achieved higher post course scores on standardized testing instruments, after controlling for differences in student attributes, teacher characteristics, and the non-random selection of teachers into the training program. However, both the cognitive and affective improvements would have been greater even if teachers had been randomly assigned to the program. The authors call for additional research to evaluate the criteria and methods used to recruit and select teachers for participation in training programs such as the IEEEP.

A29|The training in market economy|The present global economic situation led to a re-consideration of the place held by human resources professional formation and development within an organization and on a larger scale of the place that a country's labour force development and specialization should hold for overcoming the effects of the global economic crisis. First of all the formal education achieved in schools, highschools and universities should support the society's (at a macro level) and community's (at a micro level) efforts to reach economic and social progress and should act as a catalizator for progress, due to simplified curricula, adapted to the labour force demands and foreseeing global research trends and domanins. However, formal education is only the premises for human resources development in contemporary organizations; trainings are the ones which will make a difference between the human resources of different companies, due to the knowledge and abilities that are taught to employees.

A29|ICT ve veřejné správě a SMB sektoru: Čtyři roky nových výzev<BR>[ICT in public administration and SMB companies: four years of new challenges]|Four years of EU membership has brought new opportunities and challenges for local companies and public administration in member countries. New small and medium companies (SMB) emerged in the neighboring regions cross over the former frontiers, there are new clusters using inter-regional cooperation. Based on the extensive cooperation with “old” EU countries new best business practices are being introduced in the existing processes. The public administration has to follow not only the new legislation but also the new business needs. All mentioned changes create new impulses for Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Basic statistic data presented in this paper imply considerable reserves in document workflows on municipal administration level. SMB companies lag behind the EU average in electronic business level. One of the reasons could be relatively low support of Content Management Systems and logistic chains (SCM) by existing ICT. In order to meet the demands described some changes and tuning in the infrastructure, security and standardization is necessary. Necessary changes are regularly put into operation what leads to new opportunities for ICT students leaving the universities. The ratios of ICT students and graduates compared with the total numbers stagnated in the last years. Hence, changes in the ICT education and its permanent actualization are needed in all branches of ICT.

With web technologies expansion is growing need to educate new specialists and users. It is target of technical and economic universities. In this respect we have to observe uses of external environment and offer fields of study whose school-leavers find good jobs. Web technologies area is very extensive and always we have to do thorough evaluation what to teach in terms of fields of study in singles types of schools.
A29|“If you don’t know what port you are sailing to, no wind is favorable” Appointment Preferences of Management Professors|Based on a survey of university management professors in German-speaking Europe, we analyze the relationship between individual and organizational characteristics and university academics’ preferences in appointment decisions. Senior faculty’s attitude towards change proves to be a particular robust predictor of differences in appointment preferences. Faculty who were satisfied with university structures before any reforms place greater value on high-quality monographs and the possession of the venia legendi. Faculty who welcome the aims of university reforms value prestigious journal publications and international experience in applicants. Our results confirm previous homophily and similarity research by showing that university professors value characteristics and qualifications that they themselves possess. Our results also show that differences in appointment preferences depend on whether universities are publicly or privately financed, and their rank in the CHE reputation ranking.
A29|Do tutorial programmes influence the performance of Economics students? A case study of the Economics 178 course at Stellenbosch University|The deteriorating performance of first-year Economics students has become a concern at many South African universities. Addressing the issue requires a thorough understanding of the factors influencing students’ success. Studies analysing academic performance usually use the education production function approach. This approach identifies inputs crucial to learning to achieve certain outputs. Factors that have been investigated in other studies include the impact of lecture attendance on performance, as well as other factors such as matric results (particularly performance in Mathematics), gender and the age of the student. This study adds to existing literature by analysing the impact of the tutorial programme as an input. The case study investigates the tutorial programme for first-year Economics students at Stellenbosch University (SU) using both a quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results confirm what previous studies have found, namely that lecture attendance, gender and matric results contribute positively to performance in first-year Economics. The main finding of the paper is that tutorial attendance also contributes positively to academic performance.
A29|What explains the academic success of second-year economics students? An exploratory analysis|The factors influencing academic success of first-year Economics students have received much attention from researchers. Very little attention, however, has been given to the determinants of success of senior Economics students. In the USA, Graunke and Woosley (2005: 367) indicate that college sophomores (second years) face academic difficulties, but this receives little attention in the literature. Economics is an elective subject for second-year students at Stellenbosch University. The academic performance of the second-year students has shown a decline, as compared to the first-year Economics performance and the faculty’s average performance. An observed phenomenon at Stellenbosch University is the poor attendance of lecture and tutorials by second year students, some of the factors than can perhaps explain why students perform poorly. This phenomenon may be explained in part by second year students losing interest in academic activities, focusing on other social commitments. This study investigates the academic success of second-year Economics students. It adds to the existing literature on the factors affecting the academic success of Economics students by focusing on the second-year students (a much neglected group in empirical studies, particularly in South Africa). The empirical analyses confirm some of the existing findings in the literature, namely that lecture and tutorial attendance are important contributors to academic success. We also find that as students progress to Economics at the second-year level, their performance in individual matriculation subjects is less relevant, except for those students who had taken Additional Mathematics. However, the matriculation aggregate mark is significant in explaining the academic performance, in a non-linear way. An important finding is that non-White students tend to perform more poorly in essay writing (one of the components of the course mark in the second year) than White students.
A29|Economic importance and statistical significance: Guidelines for communicating empirical research| A critical objective for many empirical studies is a thorough evaluation of both substantive importance and statistical significance. Feminist economists have critiqued neoclassical economics studies for an excessive focus on statistical machinery at the expense of substantive issues. Drawing from the ongoing debate about the rhetoric of economic inquiry and significance tests, this paper examines approaches for presenting empirical results effectively to ensure that the analysis is accurate, meaningful, and relevant for the conceptual and empirical context. To that end, it demonstrates several measurement issues that affect the interpretation of economic significance and are commonly overlooked in empirical studies. This paper provides guidelines for clearly communicating two distinct aspects of “significance” in empirical research, using prose, tables, and charts based on OLS, logit, and probit regression results. These guidelines are illustrated with samples of ineffective writing annotated to show weaknesses, followed by concrete examples and explanations of improved presentation.
A29|Using Distance Education in Extension Programming| This paper provides an overview of the development of the Management Analysis and Strategic Thinking (MAST) program conducted by Kansas State University. This intensive management training course for progressive farm and agribusiness operators is being delivered successfully using a combination of face-to-face and distance extension delivery techniques. We find that some parts of the program are best delivered face to face and other parts are best delivered via distance. Of participants surveyed, 94% would recommend the MAST program to their peers, and 100% believe the program will have a positive impact on their businesses' bottom line.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

A29|Multi-Dimensional Analysis of Poverty in Ghana Using Fuzzy Sets Theory|The paper studies the multidimensional aspects of poverty and living conditions in Ghana. The aim is to fill the vacuum that has been left by traditional uni-dimensional measures of deprivation based on poverty lines, exclusively estimated on the basis of monetary variables such as income or consumption expenditure. It combines monetary and non-monetary, and qualitative and quantitative indicators, including housing conditions, the possession of durable goods, equivalent disposable income, and equivalent expenditure, with a number of composite human welfare measures. The study employs the fuzzy-set theoretic framework to compare levels of deprivation in Ghana over time usig micro data from the last two rounds of the Ghana Living Standard Surveys (1991/1992 and 1998/1999). The estimation results of the membership functions, depicting the levels of deprivation for the various categories of deprivation indicators, show a composite deprivation degree of 0.2137 for the whole country in 1998/99 as compared to 0.2123 in 1991/92. This deprivation trend reveals that poverty levels hard scarcely changed in Ghana. In fact, it even rose slightly during the nineties, contrary to the uni-dimensional analytical GLSS 4 report of an overall broadly favourable trend in poverty in Ghana during the 1990s.
A29|Overview of Potential Problematic Fields and Experience With Respect to Implementation of E-Learning in a Company and School Environment in the Czech Republic|E-learning has become a significant supportive cornerstone of the educational process at universities and in companies, where it is applied as supplementary education of the staff. At the Silesian University in Opava, School of Business Administration in Karvina, under completion of grant projects e-learning study of number of bachelor study programs received an accreditation. E-learning is applied for training in the business sector in the Czech Republic as well as in different countries. Both at universities and in companies there exist specific solutions of effective implementation of the individual e-learning systems depending on a myriad of factors derived from differences in the individual environments. The articles provides an overview of potential problematic areas, which may occur in implementation of e-learning and it is in the Czech Republic where these problematic situations have been tackled. The purpose of the article is to list basic problematic areas, each of which deserves a separate article and a detailed analysis.
A29|Writing Teaching and Research Case Studies|A case study is a valuable instrument for teaching and examining business related disciplines. Application and utilization of case studies have been discussed at length in the academic literature. To a lesser degree, authors have addressed the issue of case production. Case studies can be employed not only for teaching but for research purposes as well. Case study methodology assists solving various research problems in social sciences. This paper provides discussion about steps, limitations and creative approaches, which are associated with writing both teaching and research cases. Through an ongoing analysis of overlaps and differences between teaching and research cases there might be a possibility of transition from a research to teaching case and vice versa.
A29|Notes on the Importance of the Teaching of the History of Economic Theories for the Students of the UEP|The article deals with the question how important is the knowledge about the history of the economic theory for the students of the University of Economics of Prague (UEP) in the time when the courses of standard micro and macro economics are one of the main parts in the education of the young economists. History of Economic Theories (HET) had been taught at the Czech universities of economics since 1945. At the beginning of this period HET was oriented mainly on the critique of selected non-Marxian economic theories, especially of the Austrian school, but in the course of time the critique was displaced by the positive explication of the development of economic theory. In 1993 HET ceased to be obligatory in the new system of education in the UEP. The importance of knowledge of the history of economic theories caused, that the new subject Economic History, in which HET is included, begins to be obligatory for all students of the UEP.

A29|Teaching of the History of Economic Theories in the University of Economics Prague|The article deals with the question in which extent the students of the University of Economics Prague (UEP) could get knowledge about the development of the economic theory. In the time, when it was impossible to buy any of foreign economist (with exception of Marxian authors form the socialist countries), the only way was the study of History of Economic Theories (HET), which had been taught at the UEP since its foundation in 1953 until 1993. At the beginning of this period HET was oriented mainly on the critique of selected non-Marxian economic theories, especially of the Austrian school, but in the course of time the critique was displaced by the positive explication of the commented theories. In 1993 HET ceased to be obligatory due to the bad assessment of the ability of the Department to ensure lessons in the new system of education in the UEP. But now the importance of knowledge of development of economic theories is stressed again and the new subject Economic History, in which HET is included, begins to be obligatory for all students of the UEP.
A29|Tipping and the Dynamics of Segregation in Neighborhoods and Schools|"In a classic paper, Schelling (1971) showed that extreme segregation can arise from social interactions in preferences: once the minority share in a neighborhood exceeds a ""tipping point"", all the whites leave. We use regression discontinuity methods and Census tract data from the past four decades to test for the presence of discrete nonlinearities in the dynamics of neighborhood racial composition. White mobility patterns in most cities exhibit tipping-like behavior, with a range of tipping points centered around a 13% minority share. These patterns are very pronounced during the 1970s and 1980s, and diminish but do not disappear in the 1990s. We find similar dynamic patterns in neighborhoods and in schools. A variety of specification checks rule out the possibility that the discontinuity in the initial minority share is driven by income stratification or other factors, and underscore the importance of white preferences over neighbors' race and ethnicity in the dynamic process of segregation. Finally, we relate the location of the estimated tipping points in different cities to measures of the racial attitudes of whites, and find that cities with more racially tolerant whites have higher tipping points."
A29|Value-Based Education For Human Development – Eritrean Perspective|Education is important in any country since it promotes the knowledge, skills, habits, and values. The learning does not solely come from the teacher. Hence the educator for the child is both the teacher and his peer group. The societal values have been diminishing over the past few decades. Therefore, it is necessary develop the holistic citizenship education. The problem of value education of the young African nation Eritrea is gaining prominence in educational discussions during the recent times. Hence, Eritrea emphasises on values in education and attempted to incorporate its National Curriculum Framework for School Education-2003. An attempt is made in this paper to discuss the Eritrean societal values in fighting for their freedom and it provides some conclusions and implications to develop the value education in Eritrea.
A29|Models for ranking European institutions of higher learning with an application to data from Greece|Monitoring the success of colleges and universities can be useful to many interested parties and for many purposes. For example, it can assist administrations to identify the strengths and weaknesses of their institutions and take corrective actions. It can enlighten the decisions of funding authorities, as transparency and accountability in public life are becoming subjects of wide social concern. And of course it can provide prospective university students and their parents with the data they need to make informed educational decisions. In this paper we propose a flexible analytical framework for ranking institutions of higher learning and apply it to date from 19 Department of Economics, Business Administration, and European International and Economic Studies that operated in Greece in 1998. Our results suggest that the proposed model is robust with respect to several criteria. In particular, the rankings in each category remain unchanged for a wide range of the weights employed to sum the contributions of research, teaching and other activities of the faculties. The top departments retain their relative positions in their categories irrespective of whether the rating criterion is research or teaching, thus ascertaining the finding that good teaching goes hand in hand with good research. And last, but not least, it is found that market ratings of the various departments, as represented by the evaluations of graduates their employers, and other interested parties, are consistent with the rankings based on academic criteria

A29|El campo de la economía y la formación de los economistas|En este artículo se analiza el campo de la economía, particularmente la influencia de la academia americana en la formación de los economistas, y la consolidación de la dominación de la teoría económica estándar en el campo, lo que en conjunto ha contribuido a deslegitimar las corrientes científicas diferentes a la teoría neoclásica, en lo cual la excesiva formalización y el uso de las matemáticas han jugado un papel determinante.
A29|Reflexiones sobre la acción docente en las asignaturas de Economía Aplicada en el marco del futuro espacio europeo de educación superior|Las sociedades actuales se caracterizan por el relevante papel del conocimiento. El dominio del mismo así como la capacidad para incrementarlo se ha convertido en un requisito fundamental para asegurar el crecimiento económico. Esto convierte a las universidades en una pieza clave del desarrollo económico actual al ser las principales instituciones generadoras y difusoras del conocimiento en las sociedades modernas. La creación en Europa de un Espacio Europeo de Educación Superior antes de 2010 busca propiciar las condiciones para que las universidades del viejo continente logren responder a las exigencias que la sociedad actual les plantea. Se pretende que este espacio universitario común logre una convergencia pedagógica de los sistemas de educación superior que conviven en la actualidad en Europa, propiciando mayor movilidad y una universidad más competitiva y eficiente. El objetivo de este trabajo es presentar una reflexión sobre los recursos didácticos y métodos docentes que actualmente son aplicables para la enseñanza de las asignaturas de economía aplicada en la búsqueda de aquellos más apropiados para responder a las nuevas exigencias bajo un sistema universitario europeo común. La reflexión se ilustra con algunos ejemplos concretos de experiencias didácticas aplicadas innovadoras, bien en recursos bien en métodos, correspondientes a materias pertenecientes al área de economía aplicada. Modern societies characterize by the key role of knowledge. The ability to master and increase it has become a crucial element to guarantee economic growth. In this context universities are a key factor for development as they are the most important knowledge institutions. Besides universities are committed to the development of a coherent and cohesive European Higher Education Area by 2010, with the aim of responding to the challenges posed by the new society. It is expected that this common area will induced pedagogic convergence, more mobility and more competitiveness in education systems. Thus the aim of this paper is to review the different pedagogic resources and methods in order to highlight their usefulness and implementation in the applied economics area in the framework of the European Higher Education Area. We also provide some examples on some innovative didactic experiences, either on resources or on methods.
A29|La dicotomía micro-macro no es pertinente|Professor González criticizes the separation of the microeconomic and the macroeconomics, he considers this inadequate not only from the theoretical point of view, but also from a pedagogical perspective. The first part of the article shows how economic theory has been built without differentiating micro from macro. For he the great authors do not separate them. The next part of the article shows the intrinsic fragilities of micro and it questions the pertinence of the microfoundation of macro; if micro is weak, then it cannot support the macro. The article ends by mentioning some important areas in contemporary economic discussion that could be studied without making such distinction.
A29|Adjusting Basic Maritime Training in an E-Learning Environment|This paper aims to disseminate the results and the findings of two projects, partially funded by the European Commission, one on computer based training and another on e-learning. Both projects have been focused on training employees of the wider marine and maritime community. Different approaches have been used for attacking specific needs and several methodologies have been employed. Both projects are described and presented to the academic community as well as to professionals. Their results and findings are thoroughly discussed. The importance of distance working in modern societies and its intertwined role in relation with the development e-learning are also discussed from the point of view of the wider maritime industry.

A29|Nová ekonomika mění požadavky na vzdělávání na vysokých školách<BR>[New Economy Change Requirements to Education at Universities]|There are many social changes in the era of new economy. The most important change is exploitation of the up to date information and communication technologies. At present we do not only automate existing processes, but form completely new structures of processes and activities. We can consider new economy as era of the inputting new information technologies, creative cogitation of people and advancement of human potential to society. It brings new requests for education process at universities above all. Universities should educate people, how to realize and use new actions and technologies in practice.
A29|Space, computers and learning|This paper aims to provoke thinking about the way people can use computers to learn, the way tutors or instructors can integrate them into their curriculum, and the consequences for the way that the computers themselves are laid out and timetabled. Our experience (Ryan, M., Wells, J., Freeman, A. and Hallam, G. 1996) led us to conclude that though computers radically modify the learning process, they do not replace the tutor. Instead, they change the way that tutor and student interact. By reflecting on the three-way interaction between students, tutors and computers we suggest a theory of the physical space that these occupy, and its consequences for classroom design.
A29|Hemispheric dominance and language proficiency levels in the four macro skills of Western Mindanao State university college students|This study was conducted to determine the relationship between the hemispheric dominance (HD) and the English proficiency (EP) scores in the four macro skills of the Western Mindanao State University college students. It hypothesized that students’ HD would have a significant correlation a) with their EP scores in listening, speaking, reading and writing, b) with their global EP score, c) with both the macro and global scores when respondents would be grouped according to age, gender and area of specialization. In this study, there were 240 respondents selected through purposive, stratified, and random sampling techniques from the 5,096 students of the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Education. Using the standardized HD Test, the standardized Listening and Reading Comprehension Tests, the researcher-made Speaking and Writing Skill Tests and Cloze Test and employing mainly the Pearson r for the statistical analysis, the study concluded: 1) that most of the students of the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Education of Western Mindanao State University were left-brained (74.6%); 2) that the students were “good” in speaking, “fair” in listening and writing skills but “ poor” in reading and in global English; 3) that there was no significant relationship between the students’ hemisphericity and their EP scores in listening, speaking, reading, writing and global proficiency tests; and 4) that a significant relationship was shown between HD and EP scores when respondents were grouped according to age and area of specialization only.
A29|The Effect of Classroom Games on Student Learning and Instructor Evaluations|Assuming that instructors of economics are utility maximizers, they may find it useful to engage in classroom behavior that is likely to generate favorable outcomes with respect to student course evaluations. This is especially true if student course evaluations are used in assessing teaching effectiveness for tenure, promotion, and salary decisions. In this paper, we present evidence that the use of a classroom gaming exercise can raise instructor evaluations and also enhance student learning outcomes. The tests are conducted in a framework that indirectly controls for grade inflation and considers student attendance and grade expectations as other sources of influence on instructor evaluation ratings.
A29|An Alternative Interpretation of the Houshold's Optimization Problem|This note is an invitation to academic economists to broaden the way in which we presant and interpret the household's optimization problem to out students in Microeconomics course. It suggests that while maximizing utility subject to a budget constraint is mathematically equivalent to minimizing expenditures for a given target level of utility, the psychological implications of these alternatives presentations of the optimization problem may be quite different.
A29|Electronic publishing: technical constraints with policy consequences|This paper reviews the impact of two convergent trends in publication; the growth of 'electronic dissemination' through bodies such as Social Science Electronic Publishing, and the increasing electronic presence of normal journals. It assesses the prospects and difficulties surrounding emergent projects of fully-electronic refereed publications such as the new journal of the Society for Non-Linear Economic Dynamics. It discusses a project, current at the time, to convert the annual proceedings of a regular economics conference into a refereed electronic publication, and review the issues governing choice of medium, editorial standards and procedures, citation, authentication and copyright. This project subsequently matured into the refereed online journal Critique of Political Economy (COPE) [www.copejournal.org]
A29|Combining Multiple-Choice and Constructed-Response Test Scores: An Economist's View|There exists considerable evidence from educational measurement theorists that constructed-response questions add little new information about student achievement beyond that provided by multiple- choice questions.

A29|Exporting Economic Models: CoPS' Experience in South Africa and Asia|The ORANI-F model of the Australian economy is closely based on the original ORANI model (Dixon, Parmenter, Sutton and Vincent, 1982), which has been used for many policy analyses in Australia. However, as well as having a more recent database, ORANI-F is a forecasting model: it includes some dynamic mechanisms absent from ORANI. We have created a generic version of ORANI-F as a pattern or template model to initiate collaborative CGE modelling with teams outside Australia. The ORANI-F documentation (Horridge, Parmenter and Pearson, 1993) is well adapted to skill transfer; it takes the reader through all the steps required for implementation of such a model, including its computer representation in GEMPACK, a flexible system for handling CGE models (Harrison and Pearson, 1993). The template model enables foreign collaborators to rapidly start running and analyzing their own simulations, so building up CGE experience. Country-specific features are incorporated by adapting or extending the template model. We illustrate this with IDC-GEM, a CGE model of the South African economy that is based on ORANI-F, but contains several new elements. IDC-GEM distinguishes multiple households, differing by income and ethnicity. Labour is grouped by skill and ethnicity. The macro equation system, structured around a SAM, includes mechanisms to distribute labour income between the different households. We present IDCGEM simulations of the effects of a South African tariff cut. Export-oriented industries tend to gain, at the expense of import-competing sectors like textiles and cars. This causes ethnic groups who work more in expanding industries to gain at the expense of other groups who are concentrated in shrinking sectors. On the demand side, car tariff cuts (leading to cheaper cars) disproportionately favour the richer households -- the poor buy few cars. Similarly ORANI-F has been used as a basis for the CAMGEM CGE model of Thailand. Here, special additions include an explicit treatment of Thailand's large international tourism industry. We are also in the process of contructing a Vietnamese GGE model, again based on the template. GEMPACK software, the template model, and documentation that explains both of these thoroughly, are three key advantages as we transfer our modelling technology to foreign environments.
A29|A Living Wage? The Effects of the Minimum Wage on the Distribution of Wages, the Distribution of Family Earnings, and Poverty|This paper analyses the distributional impact of the 1990 and 1991 increases in the federal minimum wage. The rise in the federal minimum wage had very different impacts across states, depending on state-specific minimum wage floors and the overall level of wages in each state. In states with a higher fraction of workers affected by the minimum wage change, we find that the minimum wage hike generated significant increases in the lower percentiles of wages, and significant reductions in wage dispersion. The higher minimum wage also led to increases in the lower percentiles of the family earnings distribution, and a narrowing of the dispersion in family earnings. We find some evidence that the increase in the minimum wage lowered poverty rates for families with some attachment to the labor market.
A29|What can we learn from univariate time series models? The case of sugar production in Mauritius 1879-1987|In this paper, we attempt to show the validity and limits of univariate time series modeling applied to annual production of sugar in Mauritius form 1879 to 1987. We analyse the series through the main components of long-term growth and stationary dynamics of short-term coupled with the impact of exogenous shocks.
A29|Analysing the Research and Teaching Quality Achievement Frontier|The paper analyses the nature of the achievement possibility frontier between research and teaching quality in higher education under a system of quality evaluation by reference to discrete quality grades. It finds several important reasons why the associated feasible set is likely to be non-convex, and hence where the assumptions of the widely used nonparametric frontier performance analysis technique of Data Envelopment Analysis are no longer valid. The paper therefore investigates the use of the alternative Free Disposal Hull technique, and compares the results of deploying these techniques to the performance evaluation of UK Departments of Economics.
