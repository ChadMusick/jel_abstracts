E16|Is Germany A Hub Of Factory Europe For Cee Countries? The Sink Approach In Gvc Decomposition|The goal of the paper is to decompose gross exports/imports to/from Germany for seven selected economies in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE): the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, and Slovakia for 2000 and 2014, to identify the role of German in absorbing, reflecting, and redirecting CEE trade. We use a gross trade decomposition proposed by Borin and Mancini (2017), which is the extended version of the methodology of Koopman, Wang, and Wei (KWW; 2014). Our analysis shows the deep integration of CEE into ‘Factory Germany’ as well as also the overestimated role of Germany as a market of final destination. Germany plays the increasing role in CEE export redirection (and vice versa) to extra-European destinations, especially to the US, China, and Russia. Additionally, we state that the Baltic countries and Poland export domestic value added mostly included in services, while the Visegrád countries do so in manufacturing.
E16|Italian Regions In Global Value Chains: an Input-Output Approach|This work uses input-output techniques to analyse the value added content of the interregional and international trade of Italian regions, which are characterized by marked differences in their level of development and production structure. Regions differ from one another in their degree of dependence on international and other regions’ demand: in those of the Centre and North, the contribution of foreign demand to regional production of value added is greater than in Southern Italy, where the role of national demand is much more important. Most regions show a significant participation in global value chains for given amounts of exports to other countries and regions which, however, are smaller overall in relation to total production in the South. The latter is also somewhat peripheral in the geography of international trade and depends to a greater extent on national suppliers; moreover, the supply ties between the different regions of the South are weak compared with the ties with some regions of the Centre and North.
E16|Construcción de modelos aplicados de equilibrio general para la evaluación de política púbica|Existen muchos artículos técnicos acerca de la construcción de modelos de equilibrio general aplicados, pero pocos acerca de los conceptos y la metodología usada en un modelo de equilibrio general computable. En este trabajo, la discusión se centra en el área conceptual de estos modelos, más que en la parte técnica. De esta forma, se presentan los elementos clave a tener en cuenta con estos modelos para llevar a cabo simulaciones para el análisis y evaluación de políticas públicas. ****** There are many technical papers about building applied general equilibrium models, but few about the concepts and methodology used in a computable general equilibrium model. In this paper, the discussion focuses on the conceptual area of these models, rather than on the technical side. In this way, the key elements to be taken into account with these models are presented to carry out simulations for the analysis and evaluation of public policies.
E16|A Post-Separation Social Accounting Matrix for the Sudan| The 2012 SAM for the Sudan, with a special focus on agriculture, water and energy, is built using data from domestic sources in the Sudan including the Central Bureau of Statistics, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning and the Central Bank of Sudan besides other external sources. Major data sets used include the 2012 National Accounts and Trade Statistics of the CBS, the 53rd Annual Report of the Central Bank of the Sudan, the 2011 Labor Force Survey, the 2009 Household Income and Expenditure Survey, The 2009-2012 Agricultural Production Cost Survey and the 2005 Industrial Survey. Data from external sources are used to complement national sources. These sources include IMF studies on government finances, FAO reports and data on agriculture and ILO reports on labor. The SAM distinguishes between agricultural activities based on the modes of irrigation, energy based on its major sources and water based on modes of production and types of uses. Land is divided into irrigated and non-irrigated, while natural water resources are added in a separate account. Households are categorized by state, location (rural and urban) and income quintiles. Labor accounts are differentiated based on location (rural and urban), skill level and gender.
E16|A Comparison of the Economics Impacts of Conditional and Unconditional Cash Transfers in Egypt|This paper uses a computable general equilibrium model to distinguish between the economy-wide impact of targeting conditional and unconditional cash transfer to Egyptian households following the full removal of subsidies. Analyzing the impact on the middle class whose vulnerability increased during the reform is another addition of this paper that makes an empirical contribution to the literature discussing the effectiveness of cash transfer compared to price subsidies. The STAGE model is calibrated on the Egyptian Social Accounting Matrix 2012/13. The results show that the removal of subsidies will have the largest negative impact on the consumption of middle class. Moreover, Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) maintains the best policy for mitigating the harmful effect of removing subsidies. It has a positive impact on the demand for labor in education and health sectors where the majority of labor is skilled males and semi-skilled females. Similarly, introducing CCT will boost production in health and education sectors.
E16|Social Accounting Matrix: A user manual for village economies|The application of Social Accounting Matrices (SAM) is well established at the national level and provides a comprehensive economic framework. The procedure for developing national SAMs is extensively documented in literature. However, it can also be constructed for smaller economies, such as a village. Studies dealing with village SAMs are rare. In addition, there are hardly any guidelines for design. This gap will be addressed in this paper, which provides a manual for the construction of a village SAM. Theoretical principles and data requirements are discussed. A hypothetical village SAM is constructed by using numerical examples. Subsequently, the SAM of a real-world village case study from Zambia is analyzed. It is demonstrated how macroeconomic indicators can be calculated and microeconomic information obtained. Furthermore, a village SAM provides the database for scientific modelling approaches which are presented. Village SAMs are thus a useful management tool and support policy planning at local and regional level.
E16|The network of inter-industry flows in a SAM framework|The networks of nominal flows between industries in a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) framework are studied. The flows of the SAM submatrices of production (or output of goods and services) and intermediate consumption, are identified, which are constructed from the supply and use tables of the National Accounts. From these flows, the inter-industry networks are induced. The structure of these networks are analysed, as well as, the underlying generation of income. An application to Portugal illustrates the approach.
E16|A structural analysis of Japanese economic development|Japan successfully escaped from poverty after the world war and attained prosperity in a matter of two decades. There were two keys for the success. One was the priority production system – the idea to develop the industries at the bottom of the triangulated input-output table first, and to climb the triangle step by step. The second key for the success was the country’s unique financial system; they deliberately grew both long-term financial institutions for large enterprises and local credit associations for small businesses. When Japanese exporting manufacturers fought the appreciation of yen at the end of the 20th century, their answer was the mass introduction of industrial robots. The exporters won the fight but the country did not. What went wrong; what lesson do we learn from it?
E16|Using Massive Online Choice Experiments to Measure Changes in Well-being|GDP and derived metrics (e.g., productivity) have been central to understanding economic progress and well-being. In principle, the change in consumer surplus (compensating expenditure) provides a superior, and more direct, measure of the change in well-being, especially for digital goods, but in practice, it has been difficult to measure. We explore the potential of massive online choice experiments to measure consumers’ willingness to accept compensation for losing access to various digital goods and thereby estimate the consumer surplus generated from these goods. We test the robustness of the approach and benchmark it against established methods, including incentive compatible choice experiments that require participants to give up Facebook for a certain period in exchange for compensation. The proposed choice experiments show convergent validity and are massively scalable. Our results indicate that digital goods have created large gains in well-being that are missed by conventional measures of GDP and productivity. By periodically querying a large, representative sample of goods and services, including those which are not priced in existing markets, changes in consumer surplus and other new measures of well-being derived from these online choice experiments have the potential for providing cost-effective supplements to existing national income and product accounts.
E16|Tracing value-added and double counting in sales of foreign affiliates and domestic-owned companies|In this paper, we propose a new accounting framework for the decomposition of value-added into domestic, foreign and double counting terms in domestic sales. In this framework, we show where the value-added double counting is derived from and give an explicit expression of domestic and foreign double counting terms based on the Inter-Country Input-Output (ICIO) tables’ Ghosh insight. We can distinguish domestic sales from exports and trace the value added and double counting in sales of foreign affiliates and domestic-owned enterprises. Based on this framework, we then calculate the value-added by foreign-owned and domestic-owned firms in exports and in domestic sales by using an Inter-Country Input-Output table split according to ownership. Preliminary results suggest that there is much more double counting in sales of foreign affiliates than in exports and that more value-added is created through exports than through sales of foreign affiliates in world GDP.
E16|Unconditional Basic Income: Who gets it? Who pays for it? A social Accounting Approach to Distribution|Unconditional basic income is not a new topic in political economy, and it gains new momentum as more and more research is being devoted to it. The discussion focusses on the adequacy and effects such a policy measure may entail for a person and his socio-economic situation, usually. Object of investigation is the individual, and the corresponding theory is of micro-economic descent. In this paper, in contrast, we develop a method of how to assess feasibility and consequences of an unconditional basic income for a modern, open economy, on the macroeconomic level, using concepts and statistics of a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) as our main tool. A SAM-based approach can measure, and perhaps model, the impact on the economic activity of a country, and on its economic institutions of new policy measures such as introducing an unconditional basic income. The economic activity of a country is expressed in monetary flows as registered in the National Accounts. So their underlying principles and definitions are adopted. However, the habitual way of putting an economy into a sequence of institutional accounts connecting each institution’s income to the cost, - similar to business accounting - reveals only one, namely the inner-institutional half of the economic circuit. The other, outer half, namely, how the costs of one institution generate income for another one is better captured by the format of a Social Accounting Matrix. In the paper, the impact of an unconditional basic income is quantified, for macroeconomic aggregates of institutional sectors and socio-economic groups of households, taking the German and the Portuguese economies as examples. Purpose of the paper is not to argue for, or against, an unconditional basic income, but to offer a scientific tool with which to calculate and assess possibilities and consequences of the proposal, for a national economy as a whole.
E16|A simple and accurate method to calculate domestic and foreign value-added in gross exports|In this paper, we propose a hypothetical extraction that provides a theoretically-funded measure of FVA in gross exports and we provide full expressions for a decomposition of gross exports into four terms: DVA, domestic double counting (DDC), FVA and foreign double counting (FDC). As in Los et al. (2016), the fact that we calculate a hypothetical GDP without the exports from a given country is the basis for validating the interpretation of the FVA term. Our DVA term is the same as Los et al. (2016).
E16|Microeconomic Origins of Macroeconomic Tail Risks|Using a multisector general equilibrium model, we show that the interplay of idiosyncratic microeconomic shocks and sectoral heterogeneity results in systematic departures in the likelihood of large economic downturns relative to what is implied by the normal distribution. Such departures can emerge even though GDP fluctuations are approximately normally distributed away from the tails, highlighting the different nature of large economic downturns from regular business-cycle fluctuations. We further demonstrate the special role of input-output linkages in generating tail comovements, whereby large recessions involve not only significant GDP contractions, but also large simultaneous declines across a wide range of industries.
E16|Equivalence between input-output and value-added economies|I show that, under standard assumptions, input-output (or network) economies are equivalent to value-added ones. Using a generalized version of the model in Acemoglu et al. (Econometrica, 2012), I show that the degree of influence of a given sector is equal to its value added share. This occurs because --by using the input-output network-- the output of a given sector indirectly contributes to the production of the final consumption of the rest of the sectors, which constitutes the source of its value. Thus, value-added economies deliver the same aggregate response to sectoral shocks than input-output ones. Despite this equivalence, the Leontief multiplier, which applies to sales and gross output, is intact.
E16|Quantitative Easing and Asset Bubbles in a Stock-flow Consistent Framework|Ever since the Great Recession, central banks have supplemented their traditional policy tool of setting the short-term interest rate with massive buyouts of assets to extend lines of credit and jolt flagging demand. As with many new policies, there have been a range of reactions from economists, with some extolling quantitative easing's expansionary virtues and others fearing it might invariably lead to overvaluation of assets, instigating economic instability and bubble behavior. To investigate these theories, we combine elements of the models in chapters 5, 10, and 11 of Godley and Lavoie's (2007) Monetary Economics with equations for quantitative easing and endogenous bubbles in a new model. By running the model under a variety of parameters, we study the causal links between quantitative easing, asset overvaluation, and macroeconomic performance. Preliminary results suggest that rather than being pro- or countercyclical, quantitative easing acts as a sort of phase shift with respect to time.
E16|The ‘China shock,’ exports and U.S. employment: A global input–output analysis|This paper quantifies the impact on U.S. employment from imports and exports during 1995–2011, using the World Input–Output Database. We find that the growth in U.S. exports led to increased demand for 2 million jobs in manufacturing, 0.5 million in resource industries, and a remarkable 4.1 million jobs in services, totaling 6.6 million. Two‐thirds of those service sectors jobs are due to the export of services themselves, whereas one‐third is due to the intermediate demand from manufacturing and resource—or merchandise—exports, so the total labor demand gain due to merchandise exports was 3.7 million jobs. In comparison, U.S. merchandise imports from China led to reduced demand of 1.4 million jobs in manufacturing and 0.6 million in services (with small losses in resource industries), with total job losses of 2.0 million. It follows that the expansion in U.S. merchandise exports relative to imports from China over 1995–2011 created net demand for about 1.7 million jobs. Comparing the growth of U.S. merchandise exports to merchandise imports from all countries, we find a fall in net labor demand due to trade, but comparing the growth of total U.S. exports to total imports from all countries, then there is a rise in net labor demand because of the growth in service exports.
E16|An approach to the structural features of the socio-economic activity of a country based on a Social Accounting Matrix.Evidences and multiplier effects on distribution of income|A Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) is presented as a tool to study the socio-economic activity of a country. This activity involves the monetary or nominal flows that are measured by the National Accounts, as well as production (organized in factors, industries and goods and services) and institutions (organized in households, general government, non-financial and financial corporations, non-profit institutions serving households, and rest of the world). In order to contribute to the definition of a methodology that can contribute to improving the knowledge of the different aspects of this activity, the potentialities of a SAM for its reading and interpreting are explored, as well as for carrying out experiments regarding its functioning. Through a SAM-based approach, how to construct more or less complex networks of linkages of the above-mentioned flows is shown, from which structural features can be evidenced and the associated multiplier effects studied. Following an application to Portugal, it is shown that a numerical version of a SAM, enables an empirical description of the origin, use, and distribution of income, whereas, an algebraic version of a SAM allows one to carry out, for example, a deeper study of the multiplier effects associated with the institutional distribution of income. The crucial role of the factors of production accounts is identified in this study, namely when they establish the link between the generation and the distribution and use of income. In this process, the important role the complementary details that the Input-Output Matrix (IOM) can add is also identified. Thus, being the generation of income the result of the output of goods and services and the associated costs, on the one hand, an industry-by-industry IOM can add details regarding domestic and imported intermediate consumption by and between industries and, on the other hand, a product-by-product IOM can add details regarding the domestic and imported intermediate consumption of goods and services.
E16|Follow the Value Added: Tracking Bilateral Relations in Global Value Chains|Following the spread of global value chains new statistical tools, the Inter-Country Input-Output tables, and new analytical frameworks have been recently developed to provide an adequate representation of supply and demand linkages among the economies. Koopman, Wang and Wei propose an innovative accounting methodology to decompose a country's total gross exports by source and final destination of their embedded value added. However this decomposition presents some limitations and relevant inexactnesses in some of its components. We develop their approach further by deriving a fully consistent counterpart for bilateral trade flows, also at the sectoral level, addressing the main shortcomings of previous works. We also provide correct breakdown of the foreign content in total (world) trade flows and a brand new classification of these components that take the perspective of the exporting country. Finally, drawing on our methodology we derive for the first time a precise measure of international trade generated within global production networks. Two examples of empirical applications with relevant policy implications are also provided.
E16|Decomposition of Value-Added in Gross Exports:Unresolved Issues and Possible Solutions|To better understand trade in the context of global value chains, it is important to have a full and explicit decomposition of value-added in gross exports. While the decomposition proposed by Koopman, Wang and Wei (2014) is a first step in this direction, there are still three outstanding issues that need to be further addressed: (1) the nature of double counting in gross exports; (2) the calculation of the foreign value-added net of any double counting; and (3) the decomposition of gross exports at the industry level (the industry where exports take place). In this paper, we propose a new accounting framework that addresses these different issues and clarifies the definition of exports in inter-country input-output (ICIO) tables. It contributes to the literature: (i) by refining the definition of double-counted value-added in gross exports; (ii) by providing new expressions for the foreign value-added and double-counted terms; and (iii) by indicating how the new framework can be used to decompose exports at the industry level.
E16|Estimating the Revenue Impacts of Tax Harmonisation|This paper reviews studies that attempt to measure empirically, revenue gains from tax harmonisation. Three groups of studies emerge, those that use cross-country regression, partial equilibrium analysis, and applied general-equilibrium (CGE) models—they all suggest (explicitly or implicitly) that the relationship between tax rates and tax revenues is ambiguous. In some special circumstances, there are gains that can be realized from tax harmonization, but those gains are usually modest in scope. Tax harmonization tends to disadvantage certain countries especially when the participating countries are different in size, and disparities in their initial tax structures are wide.
E16|Disaggregation of the 2010 UK Social Accounting Matrix to report household income quintiles|Social Accounting Matrices (SAM) are used as the main data source for Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models, which in turn can be used to simulate economic shocks and study their economy-wide impact. However, SAMs usually include highly aggregated categories of final consumers, therefore preventing the use of CGE models to study the impact of economic shocks on economic agents with specific characteristics. For this type of analysis, it is necessary to disaggregate the economic agent of interest in the SAM. This paper presents an approach by which it is possible to disaggregate the households in the UK SAM in quintiles based on their gross weekly income. The necessary steps to disaggregate the households are presented in detail, along with the supporting datasets and variables required to replicate the disaggregation approach for future SAMs.
E16|Tracing Value-Added and Double Counting in Gross Exports: Comment|"In a recent contribution to the AER, Koopman, Wang, and Wei (2014) proposed a decomposition of a country's gross exports into value-added components and double-counted terms. It is motivated by complex manipulation of basic accounting identities. In this comment we provide an alternative framework based on ""hypothetical extraction."" This parsimonious approach provides a clear definition of domestic value added in exports and has a natural extension into decompositions of bilateral export flows."
E16|A 2011 Social Accounting Matrix for the West Bank with detailed representation of households and labour accounts| A detailed Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) for the West Bank is developed for the year 2011. The data used to build the SAM are obtained from various official sources in Palestine, mainly the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. Major data sets include the Palestinian national accounts, the supply and use table, the balance of payments, the labour force survey data, the expenditure and consumption survey data, the economic survey report, the living standards report and the demographics report. The SAM provides data on 49 activities, 83 commodities, 110 households, 59 production factors and 58 tax accounts. Driven by the specificity of the West Bank economy, this SAM has several features including the classification of the households and labour accounts according to the workplace (West Bank, Israel and rest of the world), which in turn considers associating each household and each labour category with their eligibility to work in Israel. In addition to dividing the labour force into eligible and not eligible to work in Israel, the SAM also considers various eligibility levels. Other features of the SAM include the separation of transactions with Israel from those with the rest of the world as well as the separation of taxes collected domestically from those collected by Israel on behalf of the Palestinian National Authority. Furthermore, this SAM takes proper account of the compensation of labour for the self-employed and of household income from unincorporated capital. It also includes an account for non-profit organisations serving households and a Zakat account, which is introduced for the first time in SAM literature.
E16|Impactos Económicos Regionales del “Shale Gas” en la Reforma Energética de México|El estudio tiene como objetivo estimar los impactos económicos de algunos aspectos de la Reforma Energética de 2013 en el Noreste de México, particularmente los relacionados con los recursos de gas de esquisto (lutitas) o de “shale gas”. En específico, el reporte presenta estimaciones preliminares de los efectos de los nuevos proyectos de construcción y operación de gasoductos en la región Noreste. Para medir dichos impactos se construyeron matrices insumo-producto y de contabilidad social regionales. Para ello, se partió de las matrices nacionales del Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía para el año 2012. Al análisis tradicional de insumo-producto se le ha añadido información de cuentas sociales que presentan las transacciones no sólo entre sectores industriales sino que además incluyen a instituciones como los hogares, las sociedades y los trabajadores por cuenta propia.
E16|Global value chains: new evidence and implications|The workshop entitled 'Global Value Chains: new evidence and implications' was held in Rome on the 22nd of June 2015. The workshop presented the results of a research project carried out by a group of economists from the Bank's Directorate General for Economics, Statistics and Research. The first session focuses on the structure of global value chains and how they function in the euro area economies. The second and third sessions examine the implications of global value chains on competitiveness and economic performance, respectively. The last session concentrates on specific countries, regions and firms.
E16|Unveiling the true value of across-strait trade: The global value chain approach|Due to the pervasive nature of value chains, an increasing amount of imported intermediate components and raw materials from other countries are entangled in Taiwan's exports to Mainland China. This circumstance leads to odd across-trait bilateral trade amounts and surpluses favorable towards Taiwan. The purposes of this paper are applying Johnson and Noguera (2012) to extricate value-added exports earned by Taiwan from China and Wang, Wei, and Zhu (2013) to decompose Taiwan's gross exports to China into various meaningful components. The two issues are related to trade in value added and value added in trade. Specifically, the former explores the value added embedded in the source country's exports to the absorbing country as final demand, regardless of whether those goods are directly or indirectly arriving at the absorbing country. The latter only looks where the value added is originated regardless of where it is ultimately absorbed. We show both concepts aim to measure a country's value added from its trades, but from different angles. Each has its own distinct meaning. They are related, but not completely the same.
E16|Regional bank efficiency and its effect on regional growth in “normal” and “bad” times|The financial crisis affected regions in Europe in a different magnitude. This is why we examine whether regions which incorporate banks with a higher intermediation quality grow faster in “normal” times and are more resilient in “bad” ones. For this purpose, we measure the intermediation quality of a bank by estimating its profit and cost efficiency while taking the changing banking environment after the financial crisis into account. Next, we aggregate the efficiencies of all banks within a NUTS 2 region to obtain a regional proxy for financial quality in twelve European countries. Our results show that relatively more profit efficient banks foster growth in their region. The link between financial quality and growth is valid in “normal” and in “bad” times. These results provide evidence to the importance of swiftly restoring bank profitability in euro area crisis countries through addressing high non-performing loans ratios and decisive actions on bank recapitalization.
E16|Cuantificación de los efectos de la disminución de remesas internacionales dirigidas a las regiones urbanas y rurales de México en 2002 mediante el uso de una matriz de contabilidad social|En este artículo, se estiman los efectos multisectoriales de una reducción de las remesas internacionales que recibieron los hogares mexicanos en 2002. Para ello, se usa una matriz de contabilidad social correspondiente a 1996 en la que se desglosan las regiones rurales de México, actualizada a 2002 y balanceada con el método de entropía. Los resultados muestran que los efectos fueron mayores en la producción sectorial de agriculturaganadería, manufactura alimentaria, comercio, servicios y transporte. Además, el factor productivo más afectado globalmente es el trabajo urbano ligado a los sectores comercio y transporte, otros servicios y servicios profesionales. Con una baja de 10% en las remesas, el PIB se reduce 1%. La mayor parte de la afectación total corresponde a la región urbana (0.27%) y marginalmente a las rurales (0.01%).
E16|Uninsured risk, stagnation, and fiscal policy|Japan is in the midst of a protracted spell of depressed economic activity. Japan's economic stagnation has occurred against a background of rising earnings risk. Occupational stability is falling as routine occupations disappear and implicit lifetime employment guarantees are gradually disappearing. At the same time, earnings in some high-skilled occupations have continued to grow. The resulting polarization in earnings has also been accompanied by an increase in wealth inequality. We develop a framework that relates these observations. In our model, an increase in uninsured earnings risk depresses output and increases wealth inequality. We then analyze the efficacy of alternative fiscal measures in terms of their ability to increase economic activity, reduce wealth inequality, and improve welfare. We find that a lower tax rate on capital achieves all of these objectives.
E16|Research Performance Based Funding Systems: a Comparative Assessment|Performance based funding is used by most EU Member States to increase the performance of their public research system. This report analyses the different nature of systems in EU Member States, selected associated and third countries. It aims to inform Member States which are in a process of mutual learning to improve the design of their allocation systems. â€¢ Research Performance based funding systems provide incentives to increase scientific performance and concentrates resources in well performing organisations â€¢ The nature of systems in place differs widely â€¢ The specific features of RPBF assessment designs can generate unintended consequences â€¢ The assessment suggests RPBF as a potential avenue for several Member States â€¢ The choice for specific designs, taking into accounts costs and potential benefits, should take into account the national context
E16|Social Accounting Matrices for the EU-27 in 2010. Building a new database for RHOMOLO|This paper describes the construction process of a new set of national social accounting matrices (SAMs) for the EU-27 in 2010 that will be regionalized and used in RHOMOLO, the regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model developed by the European Commission to evaluate the impact of cohesion policies. After a careful analysis of the input-output frameworks available in Eurostat and the World input-output database (WIOD), the latter has been used as the main data source, which is completed with information from national accounts in Eurostat. The structure of the SAM is determined by the sectoral disaggregation in WIOD. It includes a useful disaggregation of labour by skill levels and a disaggregation of the foreign sector in the EU and rest of the world. In the paper it is clearly described how to elaborate a symmetric input-output table product by product at purchasers' prices using supply and use tables and applying the industry technology. It is also described the reallocation of social contributions needed to properly assign tax revenues to government and avoid the problems generated by the second redistribution of income in national accounts. The description of the SAMs and their availability for the EU-27 can be very useful to researchers in applied economics and it may help to better understand the structure of RHOMOLO.
E16|Regionalisation of Social Accounting Matrices for the EU-28 in 2010. A regional database for RHOMOLO at NUTS 2 level|This paper presents the regionalisation methodology followed to build a regional database for RHOMOLO, the regional computable general equilibrium model developed by the European Commission to evaluate the impact of Cohesion Policy. This report describes the methodology used to develop two sets of regional Social Accounting Matrices for the EU-28 at NUTS 2 level, according to both the NUTS 2006 and the NUTS 2010 classifications. The starting point is the set of national SAMs developed for the model by Alvarez Martinez and Lopez Cobo (2016). The national SAMs are subsequently regionalised by means of non-survey techniques using the available regional statistical data from Eurostat, inter-regional bilateral trade flows developed ad hoc for this project and inter-regional transport cost data from the TRANSTOOLS project. The initial regional data prepared for RHOMOLO v2 included only the EU-27 and NUTS 2006, but following the adhesion of Croatia to the European Union on January 1st 2013, in this paper we also include a national SAM and two regional SAMs for Croatia.
E16|Conversion of regional data between NUTS classifications. Adapting the RHOMOLO database to different uses|This technical report presents the methodology followed to transform regional data between different NUTS classifications in RHOMOLO, the regional computable general equilibrium model developed by the European Commission to evaluate the impact of Cohesion Policy. This method has been designed for the conversion between NUTS 2006 and NUTS 2010 in both directions, but the same philosophy could be extended to transform data between any pair of NUTS classifications. It has been applied to the construction of two regional databases for RHOMOLO-v2 in 2010, one covering the EU-27 regions according to NUTS 2006, the other for the EU-28 regions according to NUTS 2010.
E16|The Informal Aspects of the Activity of Countries Studied Through Social Accounting and Socio-Demographic Matrices|Approaches based on Social Accounting Matrices (SAMs) and Socio-Demographic Matrices (SDMs) will be presented as a way of capturing relevant networks of linkages and the corresponding multiplier effects, which can subsequently be used for modelling the activity of the countries to be studied. Emphasis will be placed on the activity of household unincorporated enterprises, also known as informal enterprises. Based on methodological principles derived mainly from the works of Richard Stone, this study will be developed in a matrix format, including, on the one hand, people – represented by a SDM – and, on the other hand, activities, products, factors of production and institutions – represented by a SAM. The exposition will be accompanied by an application to Portugal, in which different scenarios will be briefly presented, involving changes in incomes and expenditures. The macroeconomic effects of these changes will be summarised in the form of changes in the macroeconomic aggregates: Gross Domestic Product, Gross National Income and Disposable Income.
E16|Les investissements chinois, une aubaine pour l'économie centrafricaine?|La Chine a récemment décidé d’investir 15 milliards de FCFA en République Centrafricaine pour développer la filière cotonnière, depuis la récolte jusqu’à l’égrenage et la filière textile. Nous tentons de capter les conséquences économiques d’un tel investissement sur la croissance économique centrafricaine dans un contexte ou le pays subit le contre coup de la dépréciation de l’euro par rapport au dollar (le FCFA étant en parité fixe avec l’Euro). Pour ce faire, nous construisons une matrice de comptabilité sociale 2012 en tenant compte de la réhabilitation du secteur textile et nous développons un modèle d’équilibre général calculable nommé CARCHINA basé sur le modèle PEP 1.1. Nous observons une augmentation de la production sectorielle, une amélioration des conditions de vie des ménages et une hausse du niveau du PIB réel. Tous ces effets sont amplifiés par la dépréciation de l’Euro.
E16|Inoperability and Income Distribution: the IEM Approach| In this paper an e ort is made to enrich the current Input-Output methodologies employed for studying the disruptive events, by extending the IO framework and including all the phases of the circular flow of income into the overall disaster impact. In this respect the Inoperability Extended Model is created and implemented in order to estimate the higher order effects in terms of value added percentage variations. The 2010 Social Accounting Matrix referred to the United Kingdom, is constructed and it is proposed as a starting point for assessing the effects of a system perturbation. The case of study is related to the eruption of the Volcano EyjafjallajÃ¶kull in mid April 2010 which became an international disruptive event heavily affecting the air transport services due to a full closure of British Air Space for several days. Finally the ranking of those commodities which are badly affected can provide guidance to the policy makers to minimize the overall impact on the economy
E16|Investissements Sociaux et Pauvreté en R.D.Congo: Une Approche en Équilibre Général<BR>[Social Investments and Poverty in the D.R.Congo : A General Equilibrium Approach]|This work examines the impact of social investments and poverty in the D.R.Congo. The general equilibrium approach was used. To this end, a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model was built and calibrated based on the 2013 Social Accounting Matrix. Three scenarios were considered in terms of simulations: in the first, an increase in investment expenditure in the education sector has been envisaged; in the second, the corresponding increase in the health sector has been considered and the last scenario combines the two aforementioned. The results show the extent of the implications of such investments on the output and poverty. They reveal also transmission channels by which stakeholders are likely to be affected, while emphasizing the order of magnitude of impacts. The study concludes with a contribution.
E16|Redundancy, Unilateralism and Bias beyond GDP – results of a Global Index Benchmark|Eight out of ten leading international indices to assess developing countries in aspects beyond GDP are showing strong redundancy, bias and unilateralism. The quantitative comparison gives evidence for the fact that always the same countries lead the ranks with a low standard deviation. The dependency of the GDP is striking: do the indices only measure indicators that are direct effects of a strong GDP? While the impact of GDP can be discussed reverse as well, the standard deviation shows a strong bias: only one out of the twenty countries with the highest standard deviation is among the Top-20 countries of the world, but 11 countries among those with the lowest standard deviation. Let’s have a look at the backsides of global statistics and methods to compare their findings. The article is the result of a pre-study to assess Social Capital for development countries made for the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. The study leaded to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG) project World Social Capital Monitor.
E16|Understanding of economic spillover mechanism by structural path analysis: a case study of interregional social accounting matrix focused on institutional sectors in Japan|Abstract The aim of this research is to introduce a multiregional social accounting matrix (SAM) in Japan evaluating the regional and interregional spillover effects of economic impacts and to show the impact flows of economic linkages based on SAM. While research on national and regional SAM has become common, examples of interregional SAM are rare currently. This study points out that there is a substantial need to build a small regional and interregional SAM because of economic sensitivity. Our work evaluates the economic effects of national and regional government behavior, such as changes of the local tax system and decentralization of power, on the regional economy by structural path analysis. This research finds the differential impact flows of local government expenditures to regional incomes between a remote area and the rest of Japan (ROJ), or the leakages of remote area’s money to ROJ via property income.
E16|Regional development, income distribution and gender in Bolivia: Insights from a 2012 Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) and Multiplier Analysis|This paper describes the construction of the most detailed, openly accessible Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) for Bolivia to date. In addition to allowing for “standard” socio-economic analysis common for SAMs - like assessing the linkages between production, factor income distribution and households’ incomes and expenditures – the SAM presented in this paper makes detailed economic assessments at the subnational level, by gender and at detailed agricultural subsector levels, possible. Sections 1-4 present the methodology and data sources used, explain assumptions and criteria adopted for SAM disaggregation, and discuss key findings with a focus on distributional features. Section 5 presents results from a simple SAM multiplier model and section 6 concludes. It is the authors’ hope that this SAM database can make a contribution to evidence-based policy making that helps to further reduce poverty and food insecurity in Bolivia.
E16|An agriculture-focused, regionally disaggregated SAM for Mexico 2008|This paper describes the construction of a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) for the Mexican economy for year 2008. It presents the methodology and data sources used, assumptions made, criteria adopted to disaggregate the SAM’s accounts and the main results obtained. The Mexico SAM was built as the main data base for the calibration of a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Model, used to investigate the quantitative effects of climate change on the Mexican economy, with emphasis on analyzing its distributional impacts. Since the effects of climate change are mainly transmitted to the economy through the agricultural sector and since impacts on agriculture differ across regions, the Mexico SAM presents a significant disaggregation in the accounts referred to the agricultural activities and to income distribution, redistribution and income spending across households and regions. The final disaggregated SAM is quite large and is included in the accompanying spreadsheet file.
E16|Sectoral Technology and Structural Transformation|We assess how the properties of technology affect structural transformation, i.e., the reallocation of production factors across the broad sectors of agriculture, manufacturing, and services. To this end, we estimate sectoral constant elasticity of substitution (CES) and Cobb-Douglas production functions on postwar US data. We find that differences in technical progress across the three sectors are the dominant force behind structural transformation whereas other differences across sectoral technology are of second order importance. Our findings imply that Cobb-Douglas sectoral production functions that differ only in technical progress capture the main technological forces behind the postwar US structural transformation. (JEL E16, E25, O33, O47)
E16|The socioeconomic impact derived from the oil royalty allocation on regional development| The aim of this work was to assess the socioeconomic impact derived from the oil royalty allocation on regional development, using a multi-sector model based on a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM), appropriately implemented for Basilicata region (Italy), the typical case of a region lagging behind in a developed economy. Our focus was on how political decisions have influenced the economic development of the region and how a different set of choices can be more effective in transforming public receipts into long-term benefits. Results clearly show that in the past the allocation of oil royalties to the regional government (as a whole €990 million) generated a much lower impact than expected, in terms of economic growth and employment. Given the structure of the regional economy, much of the impact of investments and running expenses financed by royalties has maybe been lost outside the regional boundaries. A greater effect on income and employment will not be possible unless resources are re-directed towards greater competitiveness of the regional economic system. Better balancing the use of royalties between social expenditure and production investments would probably be the first step towards a strategy of sustainable development of the regional economy.
E16|Follow the value added: bilateral gross export accounting|The diffusion of international production networks has challenged the capability of traditional trade statistics to provide an adequate representation of supply and demand linkages among the economies. To address this issue, new statistical tools (the Inter-Country Input-Output tables) and new analytical frameworks have been developed. Koopman, Wang and Wei propose an accounting methodology to decompose a country’s total gross exports by source and final destination of their embedded value added. We develop this approach further by deriving a fully consistent counterpart for bilateral trade flows, refining the original framework. Along with other contributions, our methodology completes the bridge between traditional trade statistics and the systems of national accounts and provides new tools for investigating global value chains. Here we present two empirical applications of two different versions of our decomposition of bilateral trade flows: one explores the forward linkages of Italian exports; the second derives a measure of the share of value-chain-related trade and assesses how its evolution since the mid-1990s has affected the relationship between world trade and income.
E16|Work Creation and Rearmament in Germany 1933-1938: A Revisionist Assessment of NS-Economic Policy Based on Input-Output Analysis|We try to measure the impact work creation programs and rearmament had on employment and production of the German economy before World War II. Theoretically based on an extended version of the conventional input-output analysis, our model or analytical framework integrates the Keynesian multiplier into Leontief´s traditional model. Empirically, we apply our recently presented input-output table of Germany for the benchmark year of 1936. Putting together the effects of both work creation proper and rearmament demonstrates that more than one million jobs were created here as early as 1933. And in 1934 and 1935, even three to four million people were employed in this manner. Several hundred thousand and later millions of jobs profited from the additional income spent on consumption. In the years from 1936 onwards, the enormous increase to five million and more for armament production alone was accompanied by additional employment and measures to restrict additional consumption. Of course one can speculate about the counterfactual scenario of whether or not such an upswing would have taken place without Hitler´s economic policy. It is true that the turning point of the business cycle had been passed in 1932, thus before Hitler had become chancellor and maybe it is also true that work creation programs and rearmament were not a necessary condition to achieve full employment as early as 1936/37. On basis of our reassessment, however, we can safely claim that they were a sufficient condition for this purpose. In more general terms, our reassessment rather supports the former view put forward, e. g. by Overy that the NS-regime introduced “a wide range of government policies designed to augment and speed up the existing recovery”. We would, however, modify his chronology, that rearmament became increasingly important from 1936 onwards: rearmament actually gathered momentum as early as 1934.
E16|Type II errors in IO multipliers|This paper compares methods for calculating Input-Output (IO) Type II multipliers. These are formulations of the standard Leontief IO model which endogenise elements of household consumption. An analytical comparison of the two basic IO Type II multiplier methods with the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) multiplier approach identifies the treatment of non-wage income generated in production as a central problem. The multiplier values for each of the IO and SAM methods are calculated using Scottish data for 2009. These results can be used to choose which Type II IO multiplier to adopt where SAM multiplier values are unavailable.
E16|Benefits and costs of electric vehicles for the public finances: An integrated valuation model based on input–output analysis, with application to France|The development of electro-mobility, with electric vehicles (EVs) replacing conventional vehicles (CVs), raises issues relating to the environment, energy and industry. Within a given country, it would have an economic impact in many areas, in particular on governments. Our objective is to quantify the respective impacts on the public finances of an electrically powered or petrol fuelled private car.
E16|Tracing CO2 emissions in global value chains|This paper integrates two lines of research into a unified conceptual framework: trade in value-added and embodied emissions in trade. This allows both value-added and emissions to be systematically traced at the country, sector, and bilateral levels through various routes in global value chains. By combining value-added and emissions accounting in a consistent way, the potential environmental cost along global value chains can be estimated from different perspectives like production, consumption, and trade. Using this unified accounting framework, we trace value-added and CO2 emissions in global production and trade networks among 41 economies in 35 sectors from 1995 to 2009 based on the World Input–Output Database, and show how they improve our understanding of the impacts of cross-border production sharing on the environment.
E16|The Roads Not Taken: Graph Theory and Macroeconomic Regimes in Stock-flow Consistent Modeling|"Standard presentations of stock-flow consistent modeling use specific Post Keynesian closures, even though a given stock-flow accounting structure supports various different economic dynamics. In this paper we separate the dynamic closure from the accounting constraints and cast the latter in the language of graph theory. The graph formulation provides (1) a representation of an economy as a collection of cash flows on a network and (2) a collection of algebraic techniques to identify independent versus dependent cash-flow variables and solve the accounting constraints. The separation into independent and dependent variables is not unique, and we argue that each such separation can be interpreted as an institutional structure or policy regime. Questions about macroeconomic regime change can thus be addressed within this framework. We illustrate the graph tools through application of the simple stock-flow consistent model, or ""SIM model,"" found in Godley and Lavoie (2007). In this model there are eight different possible dynamic closures of the same underlying accounting structure. We classify the possible closures and discuss three of them in detail: the ""standard"" Godleyâ€“Lavoie closure, where government spending is the key policy lever; an ""austerity"" regime, where government spending adjusts to taxes that depend on private sector decisions; and a ""colonial"" regime, which is driven by taxation."
E16|Impact assessment of European funds in Andalusia 2007-2013. A CGE approach|Ever since the accession of Spain to the European Economic Community, Andalusia has been a recipient of European Funds. Hence, this paper proposes an analysis that will reveal the economic impact of the Funds received by the Autonomous Community of Andalusia during the period 2007-2013. A Computable General Equilibrium Model (CGE) will be used to do so, which will assess the effects on the main macroeconomic indicators in different simulation scenarios. The results will highlight the significant contribution made by European Funds to regional growth in the period analysed.
E16|The Development of Fiscal Social Accounting Matrix for Indonesia|The Social Accounting Matrix (SAM), is a matrix to represent the transaction in a socio-economic system. It provides a comprehensive description of an economy with emphasis on social and distributive aspects. It describes the economic flows: income generation by production activities, income distribution, and the redistribution between economic agents. The SAM framework provides a useful tool for various policy analysis such as income distribution analysis and incidence studies. BPS-Statistics Indonesia develops SAM as a complementary of Input-Output Table in every five year. However, the standard SAM only offers a limited set of fiscal instruments. Fiscal policy instruments are important tools in policy analysis for government institutions, namely Fiscal Policy Agency (Badan Kebijakan Fiskal/BKF). BKF is a unit within the Indonesian Ministry of Finance that has the responsibility in the fiscal policy formulation. The purpose of this study is to develop the Fiscal SAM (FiSAM) for the year of 2008. The FiSAM features a more detail fiscal instrument of SAM framework. It captures the government’s indirect tax revenue and government’s transfer. The government’s indirect tax is disaggregated into more detail categories: value added taxes (VAT), sales taxes for luxury items, excises, import tax, property tax, stamp duty, and others (including local taxes). While the government’s transfer is disaggregated into: subsidy for poor students, food subsidy for the poor, conditional cash transfer, and other government’s transfer. With these extensions, the FiSAM has more capability to capture a wide range analysis of fiscal policies more precisely. The FiSAM may also serves as data for further development of Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models.
E16|Matrice de Comptabilité Sociale de 2013 pour la R.D.Congo<BR>[2013 Social Accounting Matrix for the D.R.Congo]|This work involves the construction of the 2013 Social Accounting Matrix for the D.R.Congo (MCS-CD2013). Three main sources of data were used namely Tables of Resources and Employment (TRE), the table of Integrated Economic Accounts (TCEI) for 2013, and data from the 1-2-3 survey on employment, the informal sector and household consumption for the year 2012. Given the nature of these data, we have resorted to the bottom-up approach to the development of this SAM and methods of RAS and cross-entropy for its balancing. After these steps, the obtained SAM past internal and external consistency tests. The results reflect macroeconomic accounting balances for the respective year. Therefore, this SAM is the basis for data Reference for macroeconomic studies and modeling of the Congolese economy.
E16|Public policies promoting the informal economy: effects on incomes, employment and growth in Burkina Faso|Since the 1990s, Burkina Faso has intensified the implementation of supporting policies to enhance the access to capital and liquidity in the informal economy. This paper analyzes the effects of these policies on incomes, employment and economic growth by taking into account the interactions between the informal sector, the formal sector and the agricultural sector. For that purpose, policy shocks are simulated through the Partnership for Economic Policy Network’s static computable general equilibrium model which is adapted to the structure of a 2008-based social accounting matrix developed by the International Food Policy Research Institute. Our results highlight mixed effects including a paradoxical contraction of the informal sector, the formal sector and economic growth as well as an improvement of the informal households and the farmers’ incomes.
E16|Efectos multiplicadores y eslabonamientos productivos en la economía peruana<BR>[Multiplier effects and productive linkages in the peruvian economy]|"In this paper we calculate the Keynesian multipliers of income, employment, imports and exports of the Peruvian economy for 101 economic activities based on information from the 2007 input-output table, taking into account the distinction between domestic origin and external of the goods and services of the intermediate demand and of the final demand. Likewise, this measurement is complemented with the analysis of the indicators of productive linkages of the different activities in the economy (""backward"" and ""forward""). Power and dispersion sensitivity indicators are also constructed, which allow identifying ""key"" activities based on the magnitude of their links within the economy. The results obtained are useful to simulate possible differentiated effects of different policy interventions for the promotion of productive development implemented by the government"

E16|European Structural Funds and Labor Force Requirement in Romania|The study focuses on the evaluation of the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) and provides a tool for analyzing the direct and indirect effects of the Operational Programme Large Infrastructure with reference to the 2014-2020 Programming Period for Romania. This analysis requires the construction of an accounting scheme, the SAM, which comprehensively includes the circular flow of income and also that takes into account the labor demand, providing a picture of the workforce. The paper therefore makes use of a dynamic multisectoral extended model taking into account the exogenous shocks of the programmed policy, where the requirement of labor depends on the production changes. The short-term dynamic model will be used for assessing the labor force growth for the seven years of programming when examining two hypothetical scenarios. The two solutions will provide an overall assessment of the impact of Large Infrastructure OP on the domestic labor requirement and on the main aggregates.
E16|Towards a more effective poverty reduction in Mexico: a general equilibrium assessment|Oportunidades, Mexico?s conditional cash transfer program, has proved to be an insufficient tool for poverty alleviation in a phase of low and uneven economic growth, and it has failed to achieve its intended goal to break the intergenerational transmission of poverty. In this context, what strategy would lead to a more effective poverty reduction without jeopardizing Mexico's economic development? This study carries out a general-equilibrium assessment in a bottom-up approach in the regional setting of Chiapas, the poorest state in Mexico. It finds that a policy set composed of a 20 per cent, 10 per cent, and 5 per cent increase in fixed investment in agriculture, construction, and manufacturing, respectively, as well as distributional changes in Oportunidades and other social transfers, pro-poor direct tax rate changes, a higher value-added tax rate and the elimination of labor and payroll taxes, may notably boost real GDP growth by 6 per cent. This economic strategy may also reduce informal employment, may ensure that formal labor income growth increases more than capital income, and may generate pro-poor growth, enhancing a process of structural transformation and rural change. Moreover, poverty would fall. The growth elasticity of poverty shows that for every one-percentage increase in GDP, poverty would decline by 2.95 per cent on average.
E16|The dynamics of leverage in a Minskyan model with heterogenous firms|This paper introduces heterogeneous microeconomic behavior into a demand-driven macroeconomic model in order to study the joint dynamics of leverage and capital accumulation. By identifying the links between firm level variables and aggregate quantities, the paper contributes toward a reformulation of the Minskyan formal analysis that explicitly considers the role of microeconomic factors in generating macroeconomic instability. The aggregation of heterogeneous agents is not only performed numerically, as in traditional agent-based models, but also by means of an innovative analytical methodology, originally developed in statistical mechanics and recently imported into macroeconomics. The distinctive feature is in that the joint analysis of the numerical and analytical solutions of the model sheds light on the effects of financial fragility at the firm level on the dynamics of the macroeconomy. In particular, the analysis of steady-state and stability properties of the system provide additional insights on the role of behavioral and size heterogeneity of firms for the stocks of aggregate debt and capital.

E16|Andalusian Economic Structure over Social Accounting Matrices from FES analysis perspective|Over the last 60 years, regional economic analysis has been interested in identifying common patterns and regularities of regional economic structure. The identification of such patterns suggests that there predictable relationships between different levels of structural regional development. Since Social Accounting Matrices (SAM) are database containing the total transactions in an economy, it is possible to use them to comparise the economic structure embedded in them. As regional SAM provide a detailed description of the economic structure, they provide a valid basis for this category of analysis. The aim of this paper is to determine those structural components and similarities in economic relationships within the regional economy (Andalusia) over a determined period of time (1990-2010), specifying the Fundamental Economic Structure (FES), quantifying and classifying their components both individual and holistic sense. The FES methodology applied in this paper is a set of complementary techniques, focused on revealing key components in the overall economy. Quantifying the features of each component will allow us ranking the core and the periphery ot the economic structure. The FES approach provide us those elements of the economy categorized like predictable, stable and important. And the features combination let us to classify the core components of the economy. The results show us the relevance of partitions related to tertiary activities. They have more probabilities to be predicted using a proxy of the size of the economy, specially in Commercial Services, Retail sales and Transport and Communications. Besides, the structure of Andalusian economy is quite stable in comparison with other regional analysis and the stability is focused in tertiary sector and some industrial activities like Electric energy, Chemical and Machinery, Refining or Mining and Steel. In terms of importance, the connectivity analysis provide that the principal interactions are brought about Retail sales, Transport and Comunications and Other Services located in tertiary-tertiary, secondary-tertiary and primary-tertiary partitions of the economy. There are also important cells in the secondary sector in this sense like Construction, Vehicles or Refining. This type of interactions between secondary and tertiary sectors, and absence of primary activities are the main characteristics of the andalusian economy structure, with no apreciable change over period of analysis. It can be concluded that there is a temporal FES for the regional economy in Andalusia in the period of analysis and under this methodology it is possible to identify not just relevant activities but key flows of interactions in the economy and let to estimate and forecast the cell values of the core of the economy determining the degree of development of the economy.
E16|Tracing Value-Added and Double Counting in Gross Exports|This paper proposes an accounting framework that breaks up a country's gross exports into various value-added components by source and additional double-counted terms. Our parsimonious framework bridges a gap between official trade statistics (in gross value terms) and national accounts (in value-added terms), and integrates all previous measures of vertical specialization and value-added trade in the literature into a unified framework. To illustrate the potential of such a method, we present a number of applications including re-computing revealed comparative advantages and the magnifying impact of multi-stage production on trade costs.
E16|La riqueza del narcotráfico y la desigualdad en Colombia: 1976-2012|Buscando comprender la trascendencia económica del narcotráfico sobre la concentración del ingreso en Colombia se estima la magnitud de la repatriación de riqueza del narcotráfico (W) desde la mitad de la década de los setenta, considerando las utilidades repatriables (UR) y su absorción a través de flujos de capitales encubiertos (FCE), a través del contrabando, la sobre/subfacturación del comercio y la inversión extranjera originada en paraísos fiscales. Las UR se calculan contablemente utilizando la información disponible de producción, precios y decomisos y supuestos documentados, mientras que los FCE contrastan cifras oficiales con registros del resto del mundo y estimativos según fundamentales. Así la W explicaría el repunte en la desigualdad del ingreso, controlando por el crecimiento de la economía, y daría alcance a otras manifestaciones del deterioro de la equidad que han sido atribuidas al narcotráfico. Un nexo de calado regional, considerando que allí la desigualdad se encuentra asociada con al crecimiento económico y a las incautaciones de bienes al narcotráfico. Un reto para las políticas públicas a juzgar por su inadecuado diseño y ambiguos resultados, tras el propósito de contener la riqueza de origen criminal y promover la economía legal.
E16|Las tensiones actuales de la economía argentina como resultado de la evolución de los determinantes estructurales de su ciclo económico|Luego de una década de importante crecimiento económico y mejoras de las condiciones de vida de la población, hacia el año 2013 la economía argentina ingresó en una etapa de estancamiento económico y retroceso en los niveles de empleo y salario real. Estas tensiones se expresan en el estrangulamiento externo de divisas y, en particular, en las disputas en torno al nivel del tipo de cambio. Las explicaciones más habituales al respecto se centran en la insuficiencia del cambio de la estructura productiva y/o en los desajustes macroeconómicos que condujeron a una apreciación de la moneda. En el presente artículo procuramos argumentar que aquellas tensiones evidenciadas en la coyuntura actual constituyen un momento propio de la reproducción del ciclo económico sobre la base de su menor productividad relativa internacional, característica estructural de nuestra economía.
E16|Instability, stationary utilization and effective demand: A structuralist model of endogenous cycles|Within the framework of an aggregative macro model with equilibrating output adjustment, Harrodian instability and a constant long-run utilization rate are reconciled with the principle of effective demand by endogenizing the capacity output-capital ratio. As stabilizing forces, distribution and debt dynamics are considered. Introducing non-linearities in the investment function, our model generates limit cycles consistent with empirical observations for the US, i.e. counter-clockwise in the utilization-wage share and utilization-debt space. We argue that with an endogenous capacity-capital ratio the principle of effective demand, the paradox of thrift as well as the paradox of cost may hold despite a constant long-run utilization rate.
E16|Income inequality and macroeconomic instability: a stock-flow consistent approach with heterogeneous agents|This paper introduces heterogeneous microeconomic behavior into a demand-driven stock-flow consistent model with endogenous credit creation, so as to study the joint dynamics of both the personal and the functional distribution of income, household debt and aggregate demand. The distinctive feature is in that the aggregation of heterogeneous agents is not performed numerically as in traditional agent-based models, but by means of an innovative analytical methodology, originally developed in statistical mechanics and recently imported into macroeconomics. Numerical and analytical results reveal that while boosting aggregate demand, a raise in the minimum wage and a reduction in wage inequality can also lead the economy toward more sustainable paths in both household debt and the degree of ’financialisation’. These results are shown to be the exact opposite to the observed responses of the economy to a raise in the interest rate charged on bank loans.
E16|Constructing an Energy-Disaggregated Social Accounting Matrix for Turkey|This paper outlines how a 2011 Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) with a rich disaggregation in the energy sectors is constructed for Turkey. The disaggregated SAM incorporates 38 production activities, 9 of which produce energy, 33 commodities, 2 factors of production as labor and capital, three institutional accounts as firms, households, and the government, a separate account for commodity and production taxes, a capital account, and finally the rest of the world (ROW) account. The data is extracted from a diverse range of sources including the Turkish Statistical Institute, Eurostat, OECD, and the International Energy Agency among others. The cross-entropy method has been used to balance both the aggregated and the disaggregated versions of the SAM. The SAM is the core element of the database of the dynamic CGE model currently being developed for Turkey for climate change, energy, and green growth issues. See above See above
E16|CO2 emissions and value added change: assessing the trade-off through the macro multiplier approach|Recently, political and scientific debate is strongly focused on issues questioning the economic sustainability of environmental policies at regional level. Following European directives and protocols and in accordance with the principles of sustainable development, the interventions designed by policy makers are required to aim at restructuring the final emissions. In this paper an effort is made to assess a new structure for the final demand which would be able to achieve a composite task: the economic sustainability and the environmental improvement. In this respect, the regional Social Accounting Matrix (SAM), referred to a typical region of the Mediterranean area, the Sardinia, will be integrated with the environmental accounting scheme in order to develop the regional multisectoral extended model. The resulting inverse matrix will be used to identify which composition of the final demand (policy control variable) is consistent with the complex emissions together with a positive variation of the aggregate total output (policy target variable). For this purpose the Macro Multipliers approach, through the use of a bidimensional decision-making index, will allow us to identify the convenient structures for both economic and environmental target and assessing the expected negative trade-off.
E16|Studying the informal aspects of the activity of countries with Social Accounting and Socio- Demographic Matrices|Social Accounting Matrices (SAMs) and Socio-Demographic Matrices (SDMs) are presented as tools that offer specific features for studying the activity of countries in several different areas, as well as for supporting policy decision processes. Based on methodological principles derived mainly from the works of Richard Stone, emphasis is placed on the desirability of working in a matrix format, which includes not only people (SDM), but also, at the same time, activities, products, factors of production and institutions (SAM). Approaches based on SAMs and SDMs will be presented as a way of capturing the relevant network of linkages and the corresponding multiplier effects, which can then be used for the subsequent modelling of the activity of the countries to be studied. As an example of socio-economic studies that can be undertaken using approaches based on both SAMs and SDMs, the study of the activity of household unincorporated enterprises, also described as informal, will be illustrated with an application to Portugal. In that application, three scenarios will be briefly presented, involving, on the one hand, two changes in incomes and, on the other hand, a change in expenditures. The macroeconomic effects of those changes will be summarised in the form of changes in the macroeconomic aggregates: Gross Domestic Product, Gross National Income and Disposable Income.
E16|Energy Dependency and Competitiveness|The main emphasis in the development of the EU economy over the past decade is placed on two challenges - globalization and the ageing population. The common basis for an adequate response to these challenges is the competitiveness of the European economy. On the one hand, the energy as a polyvalent resource plays an important role in the improvement of the competitiveness of each economic system. On the other hand, the provision of the economies with energy resources, i.e. their dependence on imported energy resources, is different. The possibilities of an economic system to increase its competitiveness while reducing its dependence on imported energy resources is determined by the ability to increase the efficiency with which energy resources are used. Energy efficiency is becoming a bridge between the competitiveness of an economic system and its dependence on imported energy resources.
E16|A Steindlian account of the distribution of corporate profits and leverage: A stock-flow consistent macroeconomic model with agent-based microfoundations|Post Keynesian economics has largely forgotten Steindl's insight that monopolisation of the corporate sector redistributes profits to those firms least likely to invest them productively. Agent-based methods can be used to incorporate Steindl's insights into a simple stock- flow consistent model of the monetary circuit. This model illustrates the `maldistribution of profits' and `enforced indebtedness' of heterogeneous firms alongside the tendency towards stagnation that occurs with rising monopolisation. The model also demonstrates Minsky's assertion that firms' leverage rises over the business cycle can be reconciled with Kalecki's macroeconomic identities showing that profits are `financed' by the investment expenditures of firms.
E16|Studying the Socio-Economics of Ageing using Social Accounting and Socio-Demographic Matrices. An application to Portugal|In looking for empirical evidence about the activity of countries, a proposal is made for studying (measuring and modelling) the activity of countries through the use of Social Accounting Matrices (SAMs) and Socio-Demographic Matrices (SDMs). SAMs and SDMs are presented as tools that have specific features for conducting studies in several different areas, particularly in the Socio-Economics of Ageing, as well as for supporting policy decision processes. Based on methodological principles that are derived mainly from the works of Richard Stone, emphasis is placed on the desirability of working in a matrix format, which includes not only people (SDM), but also, at the same time, activities, products, factors of production and institutions (SAM). This is considered to be a way of capturing the relevant network of linkages and the corresponding multiplier effects for the subsequent modelling of the activity of the countries studied. The exposition of this proposal is accompanied by an example applied to Portugal.
E16|Government Expenditure Determination on the Basis of Macroeconomics|Government expenditure is realized to be the exogenous variable and its change impacts national income through Aggregate Demand expression. The purpose of this study is to derive new macroeconomic expression based on Keynesian basis with SAM multiplier through mathematical approach. The study reveals that there are factors determined government spending including exogenous shock (government subsidy), taxation, and money supply.
E16|A regional agricultural SAM for Ireland 2007|The paper describes the construction of a regional agricultural Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) for Ireland for the year 2007. The SAM describes the full circular flow of money and goods in the Irish economy. The SAM includes 61 activities, 60 commodities, 40 factors of production, 7 households, 2 enterprises, government and investment/saving, 7 tax-related accounts, a trade and transport margin account and an external sector. Its construction starts from the Eurostat Supply and Use table for 2007. A prior unbalanced micro SAM with a regionalized agricultural sector is built with a variety of additional data sources. The final balanced SAM is estimated using the cross-entropy method.
E16|Environmentally Extended Social Accounting Matrix for Climate Change Policy Analysis for India|Linking economic growth and climate change is crucial policy issue for the developing economy and India is one among them. But to understand the implication of economic growth on GHG emission and input use efficiency improvement on economic growth, it requires an accounting framework which can integrate both the economic and environmental indicators. In this context this study has focused on construction of ESAM and further applied it to the ESAM multiplier model for impact analysis. The analysis presented in this study shows that 5% increase in overall export along with the 10% increase in efficiency in fertilizer, coal, petroleum and electricity use will boost the economic growth by around 2% and reduce CO2 emissions by around 11%. But this study also shows that the input use efficiency results cost advantages to the investors at a greater extent than employment generation and it cause further income inequality. However, the positive implication is that the efficiency improvement for input which are highly subsidised would improve economy’s fiscal health which can further be used for employment generation.
E16|General Equilibrium Analysis of Strategic Trade|Strategic trade refers to international trade under market imperfections. The purpose of the article is to comprehend general equilibrium implications of trade liberalization on Indian macroeconomic aspects under alternative market structures. We applied computable general equilibrium modelling as our relevant methodology following the work of Shoven and Whalley (1984). Constructing a four sector social accounting matrix for India, this article attempts to purport the effects of liberalized trade over different macroeconomic aspects under monopolistic competition and compares the results with the same obtained under benchmark perfect competition scenario. Our study reveals that trade under imperfect competition could not produce any greater domestic output, expansion of trade in terms of volume of export and import, and gains from trade as compared to standard perfect competition scenario.
E16|Accounting for Skill Premium Patterns during the EU Accession: Productivity or Trade?|In this article, we disentangle the relationship between the skill premium, trade liberalization and productivity changes in accounting for the skill premium patterns of transition economies that joined the European Union (EU) in 2004. To conduct our analysis, we construct an applied general equilibrium model with skilled and unskilled labor, and combining Social Accounting Matrices, Household Budget Surveys and the EU KLEMS Growth and Productivity Accounts database, we calibrate it to match Hungarian data, a transition economy wherethe skill premium consistently increased between 1995 and 2005. We then assess the role of the multiple factors that affected the patterns of the skill premium: trade liberalization reforms, factor and sector bias of technical change and capital deepening, and find that all the factors can jointly account for approximately 87% of the actual change in skill premium between 1995 and 2005. Individually, capital deepening accounts for the largest share of the rise in the skill premium, whereas trade liberalization accounts for a small portion of that increase. While productivity changes account for only a small fraction of the skill premium increases during 1995 and 2000, they significantly offset the impact of the capital deepening on the skill premium in the period between 2000 and 2005.

E16|Income Distribution and Current Account Imbalances|We develop a three-country, stock-flow consistent macroeconomic model to study the effects of changes in both personal and functional income distribution on national current account balances. Each country has a household sector and a non-household (corporate) sector. The household sector is divided into income deciles, and consumer demand is characterized by upward-looking status comparisons following the relative income hypothesis of consumption. The strength of consumption emulation depends on country-specific institutions. The model is calibrated for the United States, Germany and China. Simulations suggest that a substantial part of the increase in household debt and the decrease in the current account in the United States since the early 1980s can be explained by the interplay of rising (top-end) household income inequality and institutions. On the other hand, the weak domestic demand and increasing current account balances of Germany and China since the mid-1990s are strongly related to shifts in the functional income distribution at the expense of the household sector.
E16|Data Needs for Regional Modelling: A Description of the Data used in Support of RHOMOLO|RHOMOLO is a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model aimed at investigating the impact of policy instruments developed according to the objectives of Cohesion Policy. In doing so, this model attempts to cover a broader set of economic variables mostly related to an economic geography setting while aiming at a complete regional and sectoral coverage for the EU 27 – by means of a dataset covering 267 EU NUTS2 regions with 6 NACE Rev. 1.1 sectors. This working paper aims at describing the data used in the EU27 RHOMOLO Model.
E16|Socio-Economic Studies with Social Accounting and Sociodemographic Matrices. An application to Portugal|In looking for empirical evidence about the activity of countries, a proposal is made for studying (measuring and modelling) the activity of countries through the use of Social Accounting Matrices (SAMs) and Socio-Demographic Matrices (SDMs). SAMs and SDMs are presented as tools that have specific features for conducting studies in several different areas, as well as for supporting policy decision processes. Based on methodological principles that are derived mainly from the works of Richard Stone, emphasis is placed on the desirability of working in a matrix format, which includes not only people (SDM), but also, at the same time, activities, products, factors of production and institutions (SAM). This is considered to be a way of capturing the relevant network of linkages and the corresponding multiplier effects, which can be used for the subsequent modelling of the activity of the countries studied. A method will be proposed for the construction of these matrices. In the case of the SAMs, it is proposed that their design and construction should adopt, at least as their starting point, the latest version of the System of National Accounts (2008 SNA) and the corresponding results of its adoption/adaptation by different countries. The exposition of this proposal is accompanied by an example applied to Portugal.

E16|Instability, stationary utilization and effective demand: A synthesis of Harrodian and Kaleckian growth theory|Within a Kaleckian framework, Harrodian instability and a constant long-run utilization rate are reconciled with the principle of effective demand by endogenizing the capacity output-capital ratio. Its change over time is argued to be a positive function of the utilization rate. As stabilizing forces, distribution and debt dynamics are considered. We argue that, with plausible non-linearities in the investment function, limit cycles consistent with empirical observations for the US can be generated by our model with reasonable parameter values and functional forms. With an endogenous capacity-capital ratio, the paradox of thrift as well as the paradox of cost may hold despite a constant long-run utilization rate.
E16|Analyse de l'économie congolaise à travers la matrice de comptabilité sociale de 2005<BR>[Analysis of the D.R.Congo economy through the social accounting matrix of the year 2005]|This work presents features of the Congolese economy through the Social Accounting Matrix of the year 2005 (MCS-RDC2005). It gives an idea on the structure of production and the international trade as well as on its international specializations. This study is suitable to all work of modelling applied to the Congolese economy in what it gives an indication on its structural particularities helpful to functional forms choices and calibration.
E16|Learning from the past: Which of the past/current development strategies are best suited to deal with the ‘quadruple crisis’?|During the last decade, the world economy has experienced a worsening in financial stability, food prices, income inequality and environmental conditions. Seven development strategies are evaluated to determine which could help solve ‘quadruple crisis’. These strategies are assessed using a common methodology which first documents the economic, social, environmental and food security policies adopted, and then assesses their outcomes using 11 performance indicators. The strategies are then ranked on the basis of their overall success score. While all strategies produced some positive results, the East Asian Miracle and the new Latin American development approach generated the greatest number of favourable outcomes.
E16|Une Matrice de Comptabilité Sociale pour la R.D. Congo : MCS-RDC2005<BR>[A 2005 Social Accounting Matrix for D.R.Congo]|This work highlights key features of the 2005 Social Accounting Matrice for D.R.Congo (2005 DRC-SAM). Two main sources of information have been exploited for its compilation: the Input and Output Table (IOT), and the Integrated Economic Accounts (IEA) both from the 2005 National Accounts. The particularity of “2005 DRC-SAM” is that it bases upon the 1993 System of National Accounting (1993 SNA), and gives a detailed presentation of transactions and transfers that took place in the Congolese economy during the year 2005. It offers flexibility in the level of factors, institutional sector and activities disaggregation, and it constitutes a basis for data analysis and a policy analysis tool for policymakers.
E16|Intellectual Capital Evaluation Models|The evaluation and measurement of intellectual capital is an issue of increasing importance for companies because of the staleness of the traditional accounting systems which do not provide relevant information regarding the value of a company. Thus, specialists are working to identify a model for assessing intellectual capital that can be easily implemented and used. The large number of proposed models but also the major differences between them emphasizes the fact that the specialists are still far from having reached a consensus. Still, there is no model accepted by most of the companies. The article aims to achieve a brief description of some of the most important models in intellectual capital.
E16|A 2007 social accounting matrix (SAM) for Vietnam|This paper documents a Vietnam Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) for the year 2007. The national SAM is based on newly estimated supply-use tables, national accounts, state budgets, and balance of payments. The SAM reconciles these data using cross-entropy estimation techniques. The final SAM is a detailed representation of Vietnam’s economy. It separates 63 activities and commodities; rural/urban labor by different education levels; and households by rural/urban areas and farm/nonfarm expenditure quintiles. Labor and household information is drawn from the 2006 Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey. Finally, the SAM identifies government, investment and foreign accounts. It is therefore an ideal tool for economywide impact assessments, including SAM-based multiplier analysis and computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling.
E16|Investigating double counting terms in the value-added decomposition of gross exports|In the input-output framework, the concept of ‘double counting’ comes from the measurement of intermediate inputs. Output is equal to (domestic) value-added plus intermediate inputs. But intermediate inputs are also produced with (domestic or foreign) value-added and other intermediate inputs. Double counting terms can be regarded as a subset of intermediate inputs in output decomposition. When it comes to value-added in exports, there is no consensus yet on the definition of double counting terms. Some authors, such as Koopman et al. (2014), Nagengast and Stehrer (2016) and Borin and Mancini (2017) propose to base the definition on the number of international border crossings. Also, Los and Timmer (2018) point out that the double counted domestic value-added is the sum of the bilateral domestic value-added across all partners minus the unilateral one (i.e. with partner world). Moreover, they indicate that the allocation of value-added to gross flows is ‘arbitrary’. Alternatively, Miroudot and Ye (2018) rely on a supply-side input-output model. In their framework, double counting terms can be measured by the second and later input rounds in the generation of value-added in exported goods using the Ghosh decomposition. In this paper, we investigate more closely the concept of ‘double counting’ in the decomposition of gross exports. First, we show that while domestic value-added can be indeed ‘double counted’ in the domestic content of exports, the concept of foreign double counting is more complicated and does not always imply value-added counted twice from the point of view of the exporting economy. When talking about ‘double counting’ in gross exports, it is important to distinguish the global level (world) from the country level. We provide separate frameworks and introduce different terms based on the global-consistency and country-consistency of the decomposition in order to shed light on the distribution of GDP in the global/country export flows. We thus clarify the meaning of double counting terms in the different decompositions of gross exports.
E16|Wheat Facts and Futures 2009| For nearly half a century, the international wheat breeding system has delivered improved high yielding varieties of wheat that created (along with rice) the Green Revolution and underpinned strong growth in wheat productivity in irrigated and rainfed, developed and underdeveloped, regions. Future priorities for breeding and complementary sciences will still include yield but will also diversify in response to changing market demands and growing environments, particulary in developing countries. It is argued that in the coming decades research on wheat quality characteristics will become increasingly important to plant breeders, whose work will be supported by the development of markers and advanced tools from molecular biology. Breeders will have to contend with increased heat stress and variability stemming from climate change, which is expected to create regional winners, as the northern high latitudes grow warmer and moister, and losers, as the sub-tropics and tropics increasingly suffer from heat stress and drought. Yield response of improved varieties in farmers’ fields depends to a very great degree on sustainable systems management, which also is essential to reverse the ongoing degradation of agricultural resources. Finally, the importance of expanding the systems lens from farmers to policy makers, and of linking farmers, commerce, science, and policy is illustrated for the rice-wheat farming systems of South Asia.
E16|An analysis of the bottlenecks affecting the production and deployment of maize seed in Eastern and Southern Africa| The publication describes outcomes of a study conducted in 2007/08 to analyze the bottlenecks affecting the production and deployment of maize seed in eastern and southern Africa. The objectives of the study were to provide a better understanding of the factors limiting the production and deployment of improved maize seed in Africa, and to contribute to increasing the efficiency of variety release, seed production and seed dissemination for new drought tolerant maize varieties. The study identified a number of institutional bottlenecks affecting the maize seed value chain, in particular in the area of policy, credit availability, seed production, germplasm and marketing. To address these bottlenecks and improve the efficiency of seed production and deployment to African farmers, the authors recommended a coordinated effort from policy makers, private and public organizations and farmers. The study was supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Howard G. Buffett Foundation
E16|Multiplier Decomposition, Inequality and Poverty in a SAM Framework|The aim of this paper is to show how and why it is possible to assess both direct and indirect effects of exogenous income injections on mean income of different household groups using a new approach based on the decomposition of SAM-based multipliers. The approach we propose allows analyzing the level of inequality in the distribution of income linking the formation of household income to the features of country’s productive structure. After deriving the “accounting price multipliers matrix”, we introduce a new technique (Pyatt, Round, 2006) in order to decompose each element of the total multiplier matrix which enlighten in “microscopic detail” the linkages between each household group’s income and other accounts whose income has been exogenously injected. The meaning and the relevance of the multiplier decomposition method will be illustrated with an application to the Italian economic system.
E16|The integration of the non-profit sector in a Social Accounting Matrix: methodological issues, empirical evidences and employment effects for Italy|This work presents a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) for Italy including, for the first time, an economic account of the non-profit sector (or “third sector”). The year it refers to is 1999. In the first part of this article I address statistical definition of the non-profit sector and how I include it in the SAM framework. I then go on to set out the main results of my analysis. Two kinds of results will be considered, referring respectively to comment on the principal descriptive coefficients of the SAM, and to a simple simulation analysis to test the impact of fiscal policy (public expenditure and public transfers) on the level of employment generated within and through the third sector activity.
E16|L’impatto delle politiche fiscali attraverso l’integrazione fra un modello di micro simulazione ed un modello biregionale macro/mesoeconomico|This study aims at testing an integrated model to estimating the economic impact of fiscal policies. The integration relies on linking a micro simulation model and a macro/meso model based on a biregional SAM (Tuscany-Rest of Italy). This connection represents an attempt to overcome the limits of both models, when they are separately running. Indeed micro models do not take into account all the interactions amongst institutional sectors while macro/meso models estimates those flows but they are not able to capture the direct effects on income distribution within households properly. In this article the two models have been connected simultaneously, unlike the majority of the approaches found in the literature, where this linkage has been performed recursively. The integrated model has been utilized to estimate the impact on both income distribution and growth of a flat income tax rate reform. The exercise has shown that the linked model provides a more complete impact estimate than the results coming from the two models running separately.
E16|Adoption and Impacts of Zero-Tillage in the Rice-Wheat Zone of Irrigated Haryana, India| This study documents the adoption and impacts of zero-tillage (ZT) wheat in the rice-wheat systems of India’s Haryana State primarily drawing on a detailed empirical survey of 400 rice-wheat farmers. Our random stratified sample revealed 34.5% to be ZT wheat adopters and a quarter of the wheat area in the surveyed communities to be under ZT. The study suggests the potential for further diffusion but also flags the issue of disadoption (10%). ZT adopters, non-adopters, and disadopters differ significantly in terms of their resource bases, with adopters typically showing the most favorable values. ZT drastically reduces tractor operations in farmers’ ZT wheat fields from an average of 8 passes to a single pass, implying a saving of 6 tractor hours and 36 liters of diesel per hectare. At 4.4 tons per hectare, ZT achieved the highest wheat yields in the survey year, a significant 4.0% yield increase over conventional tillage. The higher yield and lower water use resulted in significantly higher water productivity indicators for ZT wheat. ZT did not have any significant spillover effect on the subsequent rice crop. The combination of a significant “yield effect” and “cost-saving effect” makes ZT adoption worthwhile and is the driving force behind its rapid spread and widespread acceptance, providing a much needed boost to economic returns to wheat cultivation. Based on these findings, the study provides a number of recommendations for research and development in Haryana’s rice-wheat systems.
E16|Impact of Zero Tillage in India's Rice-Wheat Systems| To date, the most widely adopted resource conserving technology (RCT) in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP)has been zero-tillage (ZT) for wheat after rice, particularly in India. This report reviews and synthesizes the experience with zero tillage in the Indian IGP. Zero tillage of wheat after rice generates significant benefits at the farm level, both in terms of significant yield gains (6–10%, particularly due to timelier planting of wheat) and cost savings (5–10%, particularly tillage savings). These benefits explain the widespread interest of farmers and the rapidity of the diffusion across the Indian IGP, further aided by the wide applicability of this mechanical innovation. The study subsequently reports on the findings of village-level focus-group discussions in Punjab, Haryana and Eastern Uttar Pradesh (UP). These typically corroborate the findings reported in the reviewed literature. They also highlight the significant extent and speed of ZT adoption in each village as well as the attendant substantial cost savings and yield increases. A conservative ex-ante assessment of supply-shift gains alone (excluding other social and environmental gains), shows that the investment in zero tillage/reduced tillage (ZT/RT) research and development by the Rice-Wheat Consortium of the Indo-Gangetic Plains (RWC) and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, Mexico (CIMMYT) was highly beneficial with a benefit-cost ratio of 39, a net present value (NPV) of US$ 94 million and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 57%. The study highlights the potential gains from successful technology transfer and adaptation in natural resources management (NRM).
E16|Adoption and Impacts of Zero-Tillage in the Rice-Wheat Zone of Irrigated Punjab, Pakistan| This study documents the adoption and impacts of zero-tillage (ZT) wheat in the ricewheat systems of Pakistan’s Punjab province primarily drawing on a detailed empirical survey of 458 rice-wheat farmers. Our random stratified sample revealed 19% to be ZT wheat adopters and a similar share of the wheat area in the surveyed communities to be under ZT. The study suggests that diffusion has stagnated and also flags the issue of disadoption (14%). ZT adopters, non-adopters, and disadopters differ significantly in terms of their resource bases, with adopters typically showing the most favorable values. ZT drastically reduces tractor operations in farmers’ ZT wheat fields from an average of 8 passes to a single pass, implying a saving of 7 tractor hours and 35 liters of diesel per hectare. ZT did not have any significant effect on the mean farmer estimated wheat yield of 3.3 tons per hectare. ZT also had no significant effect on water productivity for wheat or spillover effect on the subsequent rice crop. ZT primarily appears to be a cost-saving technology for wheat in Pakistan’s Punjab. Based on these findings, the study provides a number of recommendations for research and development in Pakistan Punjab’s rice-wheat systems.
E16|Issues in the Implementation of Interregional Commodity by Industry Input-Output Models|A number of procedures for generating interregional commodity by industry accounts have been developed recently (Canning and Zhi, 2005; Robinson and Liu, 2006; Jackson et al, 2006; Lindall, Olsen and Alward 2006). While each approach shares a common organizational framework, very little attention has been devoted to the use of these accounts in impacts assessment application. This paper presents the common organizational framework for the data and introduces relevant issues by briefly reviewing its lineage. The paper then addresses a number of issues surrounding many-region modeling applications and demonstrates the implications of adopting different assumptions and approaches.
E16|Russia from Bust to Boom: Oil, Politics or the Ruble?|This paper develops and estimates a small macroeconomic model of the Russian economy. The model is tailored to analyze the impact of the oil price, the exchange rate, and political stability on economic performance. The model does very well in explaining Russia???s economic history in the period 1995-2002. We then use the model to simulate two sets of scenarios, one with various oil price scenarios and one with various adverse shocks. The simulations suggest that the Russian economy is still very vulnerable to oil price swings, and that these swings have asymmetric effects. Indeed the cost of a downward swing of oil prices seems to be larger than the benefit of an upward swing. We also find that the aggregate effects of an oil price collapse are comparable to these of renewed political instability. Although their propagation mechanism is quite different, both adverse shocks do have a similar effect on real GDP. A real exchange rate appreciation on the other hand has relatively mild effects on real GDP. All in all, it is suggested that Russia should reduce its vulnerability to adverse oil price shocks and maintain political stability.

E16|The Vietnamese Socio-economic Development Plan Revisited: Application of the 2003 Merged Model for Vietnam|This paper investigates the Vietnamese Socio-economic Development Plan (2006-10) using the 2003 Merged Model for Vietnam, which was developed in Jensen & Tarp (2007). Initialization and calibration of the model is based on a financial 2003 SAM framework and an auxiliary 2002-2003 data set. Furthermore, an auxiliary 2004-2005 data base was used to run the model forward and target 2005 starting values for the 2006-2010 development plan projections. The paper sets out a so-called ‘SEDP Base Scenario’, which is based on constant calibrated Merged Model parameter values. The base scenario turns out to be internally inconsistent, as indicated by divergent behaviour among the four model-specific focal variables. Dynamic (time-dependent) adjustments to parameter values subsequently allows for the derivation of the ‘SEDP Consistent Scenario’. This scenario is internally consistent, in the sense that the model-specific focal variables settle down around sensible growth paths. The necessary parameter adjustments provide an indication of the structural assumptions underlying the SEDP development plan. These assumptions include (i) a strong initial drop in capital factor productivity (increasing capital-output ratio), (ii) a strong continuous drop in government foreign borrowing relative to export earnings, and an accompanying need to increase the government’s reliance on domestic capital markets, (iii) the continuation of a very high import elasticity with respect to GDP throughout the planning period, and (iv) the pursuit of a long run target for official foreign exchange reserves amounting to 9 weeks of imports.
E16|The Seed Industry for Dryland Crops in Eastern Kenya| The development and promotion of improved crop varieties as well as efficient seed production, distribution, and marketing systems have contributed significantly to increased agricultural production and food security in Kenya. However, these impacts have not been replicated in the semi-arid midlands due to climatic, soil, and institutional factors. Following the liberalization of agriculture in the late 1980s, there has been greater participation of the private sector, non-governmental organizations, and voluntary agencies in the area. This study examined the extent to which these developments affected farmers’ access to dryland crops. The study found that the low quantity of seed traded, high cost of production, and high seed supply prices constrained the development of local seed trade. It recommended developing and offering a range of varieties to farmers to increase demand, training to strengthen farmers’ capacity to manage seed on-farm, and reduction of high production and distribution costs through further research and institutional improvements. In addition, the “seed loans” model, which has been very effective in the area, should be strengthened.
E16|Adoption of Maize Production Technologies in the Coastal Lowlands of Kenya| Maize is the major food crop grown in the coastal region of Kenya and constitutes a major component of the diet of the population in the region. However, average yields are far below the potential for the region and low production levels create serious food deficits. Over the years, new technologies have been introduced but adoption has remained low, especially for fertilizer. This paper examined current maize-farming practices and technological and socioeconomic factors that influenced adoption in the Kilifi and Kwale Districts of the Coast Province, that together account for half of maize production in the region. The study found low adoption levels for improved maize varieties and technology, especially fertilizer, among farmers in the area. Farmers cited poor availability of improved varieties, high cost, lack of knowledge, and unfavourable characteristics of improved varieties as reasons for non-adoption. The high price and poor availability of fertilizers, farmers’ inexperience with them, and their perception that soils were already fertile were among reasons given for low fertilizer use. The low levels of adoption of improved varieties indicate that they are not meeting farmers’ needs. The authors recommend that researchers communicate with and include farmers’ criteria when breeding varieties. In addition, alternative options should be extended to farmers who are not able to use inorganic fertilizers. Finally, given the major influence of the institutional environment found in the study, it is recommended that extension services be strengthened, especially where lack of knowledge was cited as a hindrance to adoption.
E16|A Standard Bank-Fund Projection Framework with CGE Features|We present a SAM-methodology for integrating simple macroeconomic and CGE models, which is applied to integrate standard versions of the merged and static CGE model frameworks. The integrated model accounts for relative prices and income distribution. A set of integrated model projections is compared with a set of merged model projections. While relative price changes generally benefit poor rural households, in particular, the accompanying capital deepening of the economy benefits urban households in relative terms. The integrated model projections imply that the previous set of merged model projections overlook an undesirable - but likely -distributional impact.
E16|Skill premium divergence: the roles of trade, capital and demographics|"We construct an applied general equilibrium model to account for diverging patterns of the skill premium. Our framework assesses the roles of various factors that a ect the demand and supply of skilled and unskilled labor|shifts in the skill composition of the labor supply, changes in the terms of trade and the complementarity between skilled labor and equipment capital in production. We nd that increases in the relative skilled labor supply due to demographic changes lead to a decline in the skill premium, while equipment capital deepening raises the relative demand for skilled labor which in turn increases the skill premium. In addition, terms of trade changes lead to the reallocation of resources towards sectors in which countries enjoy comparative advantages. Since our model incorporates multiple factors simultaneously, it can generate either rising or falling skill premium paths. When we parametrize the model to the Baltic states|countries that were similar along many dimensions at the onset of their transition from centrally-planned to market-oriented economies|our model can closely account for the diverging patterns of skill premia for the period between 1995 and 2008."
