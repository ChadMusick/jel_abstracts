J40|Lying and Shirking Under Oath|This study explores whether an oath to honesty can reduce both shirking and lying among crowd-sourced internet workers. Using a classic coin-ip experiment, we rst show that a substantial majority of Mechanical Turk workers both shirk and lie when reporting the number of heads ipped. We then demonstrate lying can be reduced by rst asking each worker to swear voluntarily on his or her honor to tell the truth in subsequent economic decisions. The oath, however, did not reduce shirking as measured by time- at-coin-ip-task, although it did increase the time they spent answering a demographic survey. Conditional on response, MTurk shirkers and liars were less likely to agree to an ex post honesty oath. Our results suggest oaths may help elicit more truthful behavior in on-line crowd-sourced environments.
J40|(In)visibility, care and cultural barriers: the size and shape of women’s work in India|Based on primary data from a large household survey in seven districts in West Bengal in India, this paper analyses the reasons underlying low labor force participation of women. In particular, we try to disentangle the intertwined strands of choice, constraints posed by domestic work and care responsibilities, and the predominant understanding of cultural norms as factors explaining the low labor force participation as measured by involvement in paid work. We document the fuzziness of the boundary between domestic work and unpaid (and therefore invisible) economic work that leads to mis-measurement of women’s work and suggest methods to improve measurement. We find that being primarily responsible for domestic chores lower the probability of “working”, after accounting for all the conventional factors. We also document how, for women, being out of paid work is not synonymous with care or domestic work, as they are involved in expenditure saving activities. We also find that religion and visible markers such as veiling are not significant determinants of the probability of working. Our data shows substantial unmet demand for work. Given that women are primarily responsible for domestic chores, we also document that women express a demand for work that would be compatible with household chores.
J40|Is There a Gender Wage Gap in Online Labor Markets? Evidence from Over 250,000 Projects and 2.5 Million Wage Bill Proposals|We explore whether there is a gender wage gap in one of the largest EU online labor markets, PeoplePerHour. Our unique dataset consists of 257,111 digitally tradeable tasks of 55,824 hiring employers from 188 countries and 65,010 workers from 173 countries that made more than 2.5 million wage bill proposals in the competition for contracts. Our data allows us to track the complete hiring process from the employers' design of proposed contracts to the competition among workers and the final agreement between employers and successful candidates. Using Heckman and OLS estimation methods we provide empirical evidence for a statistically significant 4% gender wage gap among workers, at the project level. We also find that female workers propose lower wage bills and are more likely to win the competition for contracts. Once we include workers’ wage bill proposals in the regressions, the gender wage gap virtually disappears, i.e., it is statistically insignificant and very small in magnitude (0.3%). Our results also suggest that female workers’ higher winning probabilities associated with lower wage bill proposals lead to higher expected revenues overall. We provide empirical evidence for heterogeneity of the gender wage gap in some of the job categories, all job difficulty levels and some of the worker countries. Finally, for some subsamples we find a statistically significant but very small “reverse” gender wage gap.
J40|The Real U.S. Unemployment Rate Is Twice the Official Rate, and the Phillips Curve|The official unemployment rate has become an inadequate measure of labor market conditions. This poses a major challenge for basic research as well as for the formulation of adequate economic policy. We propose a new definition of the unemployment rate by weighing part-time workers with 62.5%, the proportion of the time they work relative to full-time workers. We provide new monthly estimates of the unemployment rate for the period 1994-2019 and find that their average during this 25-year period was 10.1% or 4.4 percentage points above the average of the official rate of 5.7%. The gap between the two rates fluctuated between 3.6 and 5.6 percentage points and rose in wake of the recession of 2008 reaching a peak in 2014 only to decrease slowly thereafter back to its pre-recession level of 4 percentage points. The Phillips curve is investigated with the new unemployment rate as well as with U3 and U6 in seven specifications for the period 2008-2019 confirming the very shallow slope found in other studies. However, in one of the specifications the slope is much steeper, mysteriously reminiscent of the coefficients estimated for the 1970s providing a conundrum for further study.
J40|Lying and Shirking Under Oath|This study explores whether an oath to honesty can reduce both shirking and lying among crowd-sourced internet workers. Using a classic coin-flip experiment, we first show that a substantial majority of Mechanical Turk workers both shirk and lie when reporting the number of heads flipped. We then demonstrate lying can be reduced by first asking each worker to swear voluntarily on his or her honor to tell the truth in subsequent economic decisions. The oath, however, did not reduce shirking as measured by time-at-coin-flip-task, although it did increase the time they spent answering a demographic survey. Conditional on response, MTurk shirkers and liars were less likely to agree to an ex post honesty oath. Our results suggest oaths may help elicit more truthful behavior in on-line crowd-sourced environments.
J40|Shaping individual preferences for social protection: the case of platform workers|Workers who perform their occupations through platforms are becoming an increasing share of the labour force. The debate is polarized between those arguing for platforms as an instrument to increase flexibility and labor force participation, and those who see it as a further mechanism to increase Non Standard Work (NSW). This debate is policy relevant because in either case, platform participation is associated to a difference in terms of willingness to contribute to the social security system. Nevertheless, the evidence is scant because we lack reliable data sources. In this contribution, we use a dedicated survey to estimate Willingness to Pay (WTP) for social security and estimate the causal impact of platform participation using a selection on observable strategy. We found that platform workers are less disposed to contribute to social security, although perception of accessibility and adequacy are not affected. Results are robust to specifications and multiple hypotheses testing.

J40|Contratos laborales en el Perú: dinámica y determinantes|Más allá del binomio formalidad/informalidad comúnmente explorado, este estudio contribuye a comprender la dualidad del mercado laboral formal en el Perú, determinada por el tipo de contrato utilizado. Se encuentra que el 70% de los trabajos formales iniciados entre el 2012 y el 2016 involucró un contrato temporal; el 19%, uno por tiempo indeterminado; y el resto, otras modalidades. Asimismo, el estudio halla que las empresas con una mayor proporción de trabajadores cualificados, ejecutivos y más experimentados tienen una mayor probabilidad de usar contratos por tiempo indeterminado. Por otra parte, se evidencia que, solo por haber sido contratado después del 2000, un trabajador tienen una probabilidad de obtener un contrato por tiempo indefinido de 31 puntos porcentuales menos que si hubiera empezado antes de dicho año, y de 63 puntos porcentuales menos si fue contratado a partir del 2010. Además, los empleos temporales presentan elevadas tasas de rotación, consistentes con una menor duración del empleo y las transiciones hacia contratos por tiempo indefinido son bastante limitadas.
J40|Real wages, labour conditions and the standard of living in Denmark: 1500-1900|It is well established that Denmark is one of the richest economies in the world nowadays with high living standards and wages. But what about earlier times? This paper makes three contributions: firstly, it creates and describes a new and rich data set on historical wage developments in Denmark, based on data gathered by the Danish Price History Project for the period 1660‐1800; secondly, it tests the traditional view of Denmark being very poor during that period by offering insight into eighteenth century Danish living standards; and thirdly, it tests whether the country followed the traditional story of the Little Divergence by constructing a long run real wage series for 1500‐1900. Comparing real wages across Europe, I find incomes in the countryside actually converged in the sixteenth century. In this context, Denmark moved from being poor, to an average income level, becoming rich only in the nineteenth century. An analysis of the eighteenth century shows that the value of the skill premium was higher than that of leading countries in Europe, but the gender wage gap tended to close towards the end. Married women in skilled occupations earned more than unmarried ones, but no difference was seen for unskilled occupations.
J40|Firms and wage inequality in Central and Eastern Europe|Recent studies show that firms are playing an increasingly important role in shaping wage inequality in advanced economies. We contribute to this literature by analysing wage inequality patterns and their firm dimension in Central and Eastern European countries. We use large, linked employer-employee datasets with data from the 2002-2014 period. We find that unlike in many other advanced economies, wage inequality levels have decreased in CEE countries, and particularly in those countries that previously had the highest wage inequality levels. The relative size of the between-firm component varied substantially across countries, and was largest in countries with the highest wage inequality levels. We further estimate the recentered influence function (RIF) regression and the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition in order to investigate the micro-level determinants of wage inequality. Our findings indicate that the changes in wage inequality levels were mainly attributable to returns to workplace characteristics.

J40|Digital Labour Platforms in Europe: Numbers, Profiles, and Employment Status of Platform Workers|This report explores three issues related to the growing phenomenon of Digital Labour Platforms: firstly, how to measure platform work as a form of employment incorporating elements such as regularity of provision, time allocated and income generated; on this basis, and drawing on a new dedicated survey (COLLEEM), the article quantifies and categorises platform work into sporadic, secondary and main. Secondly, it provides an empirical investigation of the association between individual characteristics, such as gender, age, family composition, education and motivation, and the probability of carrying out particular types of platform work, such as microtasking, creative services, software development, transportation and so on. The analysis highlights substantial heterogeneity in the attributes and motivations of the workers performing different tasks. Finally, it discusses the employment status of platform workers and provides some descriptive statistics suggesting that a large share of platform workers perceive themselves as employees, even though they are in most cases legally considered self-employed.

J40|Spatial variations and clustering in the rates of youth unemployment and NEET|We investigate the â€˜determinantsâ€™ of spatial variations in youth unemployment and NEET rates, and the presence of spatial clusters, for Italy, Spain and the UK. Using Labour Force Survey data for the period 1993-2011 at a â€˜regionalâ€™ level we obtain broadly consistent measures of quarterly youth unemployment and NEET rates. Our findings suggest that youths are sensitive to aggregate labour market conditions with older youths being more cyclically sensitive than are teenagers. We find a discouraged worker effect, again larger for older youths than for teenagers. In the UK and Spain, temporary jobs are preferred to part-time jobs, perhaps as a way of avoiding unemployment, whereas in Italy the opposite occurs. There is evidence of spatial clustering of youth unemployment and NEET rates. Our paper concludes with a discussion of the implications for regional and labour market policies.
J40|Gig economy platforms: Boon or Bane?|The rapid emergence of gig economy platforms that use digital technologies to intermediate labour on a per-task basis has triggered an intense policy debate about the economic and social implications. This paper takes stock of the emerging evidence. The results suggest that gig economy platforms’ size remains modest (1-3 per cent of overall employment). Their growth has been most pronounced in a small number of services industries with high shares of own-account workers, suggesting that thus far they have been a substitute for traditional self-employment rather than dependent employment. New evidence provided in this paper is consistent with positive effects of platform growth on overall employment and small negative or insignificant effects on dependent employment and wages. While most empirical studies suggest that platforms are more efficient in matching workers to clients, reductions in barriers to work could offset such productivity-enhancing effects by creating employment opportunities for low-productivity workers. Fully reaping the potential benefits from gig economy platforms while protecting workers and consumers requires adapting existing policy settings in product and labour markets and applying them to traditional businesses and platforms on an equal footing.
J40|Knocking on employment’s door: internships and job attainment<BR>[Llamando a las puertas del Empleo: prácticas en empresa e inserción laboral]|Las prácticas académicas externas (PAEs) han ganado mucha popularidad entre los estudiantes, universidades, gobiernos y empresas desde la creación del Espacio Europeo de Educación Superior. Sin embargo, la evidencia empírica acerca de la relación entre las PAEs y la inserción laboral de los graduados es todavía muy escasa, particularmente en España. Este trabajo analiza si las PAEs mejoran los resultados en el mercado laboral tanto en el corto plazo (primer empleo después de graduarse) como en el medio/largo plazo (empleo 4 años después de la graduación). Para ello, se estiman modelos de probabilidad lineal y modelos probit a partir de los datos de la Encuesta de Inserción Laboral de los Titulados Universitarios 2014 del INE. Adicionalmente se implementa una técnica econométrica novedosa para evaluar la sensibilidad de los resultados al sesgo de variables omitidas en las estimaciones. En concreto, se analiza el efecto de las PAEs en: (i) la velocidad de encontrar el primer empleo; (ii) la adecuación horizontal, vertical y de habilidades técnicas con el primer empleo; (iii) la probabilidad de estar empleado en el medio y largo plazo; (iv) la adecuación horizontal y vertical con el empleo actual; y (v) los quintiles de salario del empleo actual. Los resultados muestran que las prácticas académicas en empresas suavizan y favorecen la transición de la universidad al mercado laboral de los graduados españoles. Aunque los efectos de las PAEs no desaparecen totalmente en el medio y largo plazo, existe una débil evidencia de efectos positivos en la adecuación al trabajo actual y en los salarios de los graduados tras 4 años de graduación.
J40|How Local Economic Conditions Affect School Finances, Teacher Quality, and Student Achievement: Evidence from the Texas Shale Boom|Whether improved local economic conditions lead to better student outcomes is theoretically ambiguous and will depend on how schools use additional revenues and how students and teachers respond to rising private sector wages. The Texas boom in shale oil and gas drilling, with its large and localized effects on wages and the tax base, provides a unique opportunity to address this question that spans the areas of education, labor markets, and public finance. An empirical approach using variation in shale geology across school districts shows that the boom reduced test scores and student attendance, despite tripling the local tax base and creating a revenue windfall. Schools spent additional revenue on capital projects and debt service, but not on teachers. As the gap between teacher wages and private sector wages grew, so did teacher turnover and the percentage of inexperienced teachers, which helps explain the decline in student achievement. Changes in student composition did not account for the achievement decline but instead helped to moderate it. The findings illustrate the potential value of using revenue growth to retain teachers in times of rising private sector wages.

El debate está polarizado entre los que abogan por las plataformas como instrumento para aumentar la flexibilidad y la participación de la fuerza laboral, y los que las ven como un mecanismo más para aumentar el trabajo no estándar. Este debate es relevante para la política porque, en cualquier caso, la participación en la plataforma está asociada a una diferencia en términos de voluntad de contribuir al sistema de seguridad social. Sin embargo, las pruebas son escasas porque carecemos de fuentes de datos fiables. En esta contribución, utilizamos una encuesta dedicada para estimar la Disposición de Pago de la seguridad social y estimamos el impacto causal de la participación en la plataforma utilizando una estrategia de selección por variables observables. Encontramos que los trabajadores de las plataformas están menos dispuestos a contribuir a la seguridad social, aunque la percepción de accesibilidad y adecuación no se ve afectada. Los resultados son robustos a las especificaciones y a las pruebas de hipótesis múltiples.
J40|Knocking on Employment´s Door: Internships and Job Attainment|Undergraduate internships have gained popularity among students, universities, government and firms since the creation of the European Higher Education Area. However, empirical research on the relationship between internships and labour market performance of graduates is still scarce, particularly in Spain. This paper examines whether internships improve the job attainment in the short run (first employment after graduation) and in the medium /long term (employment four years later). We use the first Spanish University Graduate Job Placement Survey (2014) to estimate linear probability models and probit models. A novel econometric technique is also implemented to evaluate the sensitivity of our findings to omitted variable bias. We disentangle the internship effect on: (i) the speed to find the first job; (ii) the vertical, horizontal and skill/competence matching with the first job; (iii) being employed in the medium/ long term; (iv) the vertical and horizontal matching with the current employment; and (v) wage quintiles of the current job. Our results show that the internship experience smooths the university-to-work transition for Spanish graduates. Although internships effects on employment do not vanish in the medium/long term, there is weak evidence of positive effects on matching or wages four years after graduation.
J40|Wer gewinnt? Wer verliert? Die Entwicklung auf dem deutschen Arbeitsmarkt seit den frühen Jahren der Bundesrepublik bis heute|Seit der Gründung der Bundesrepublik Deutschland haben verschiedene Megatrends die Entwicklungen auf dem deutschen Arbeitsmarkt maßgeblich beeinflusst. Insbesondere die voranschreitende Globalisierung hat zur weiteren Öffnung der deutschen Volkwirtschaft geführt und den sektoralen Strukturwandel, das heißt den Wandel von der Industrie- zur Dienstleistungsgesellschaft beschleunigt. Gleichzeitig hat das durchschnittliche Wirtschaftswachstum seit den 1950er-Jahren bedeutend nachgelassen. Auf dem Arbeitsmarkt wurden zudem schon Jahrzehnte vor der Einführung der Hartz-Reformen Flexibilisierungsmaßnahmen durchgesetzt, um einem Anstieg der Arbeitslosigkeit entgegenzuwirken. Insgesamt unterlag der Arbeitsmarkt in den vergangenen 60 Jahren einem starken Wandel. Wir identifizieren Gewinner und Verlierer dieser Entwicklung in einer multidimensionalen Betrachtung der Entwicklung in den Bereichen Bildung, Arbeitsmarkbeteiligung, Qualifikationsniveau der Beschäftigung und Einkommensentwicklung. Die Analyse wird mit harmonisierten Mikrodaten (Mikrozensus 1962-2013) auf Individualebene und auf dem Haushaltslevel durchgeführt.
J40|Personality Traits and Performance in Online Labour Markets|In this paper we investigate the impact of non-cognitive skills on the quality of task-specific outcomes by conducting a quasi-experiment on a well-known online crowdsourcing platform. We show that a worker’s performance varies with personality traits, gender, human capital, crowdsourcing experience and work effort. Regarding the effects of non-cognitive skills, we find that workers’ performance in online microtasks is positively related to extraversion and agreeableness. The positive impact of extroverts is also revealed when performance is adjusted for task completion time. These findings provide implications regarding the integration of selection mechanisms in online labour matching platforms aiming in uncovering microworkers soft skills to improve performance and consequently the allocation of resources in online microtasks.
J40|Informal employment relationships and the labor market: Is there segmentation in Ukraine?|One of the most important factors that determine individuals’ quality of life and wellbeing is their position in the labor market and the type of jobs that they hold. When workers are rationed out of the formal segment of the labor market against their will, i.e., the labor market is segmented, their quality of life is limited, and their wellbeing is reduced. When they can freely choose between a formal or informal employment relationship, i.e., the labor market is integrated, their wellbeing can reach high levels even in the presence of informal employment. We, therefore, test whether the Ukrainian labor market is segmented along the formal-informal divide, slicing the data by gender and age. The analysis that we perform consist in the analysis of short-term and medium-term transitions between five employment states, unemployment and inactivity. We also analyze wage gaps of mean hourly earnings and across the entire hourly earnings distribution, controlling for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. According to our results segmentation is present for dependent employees: for a large part of informal employees informal employment is used as a waiting stage to enter formal salaried employment and is not voluntarily chosen. As far as self-employment is concerned the evidence is mixed regarding segmentation in the Ukrainian labor market. This heterogeneity in outcomes implies that not all informal work is associated with a low quality of life and reduced wellbeing in post-transition economies.
J40|'Wage', 'Salary' & 'Remuneration': A Genealogical Exploration of Juridical Terms & Their Significance for the Employer's Power to Make Deductions from Wages|The Supreme Court in Hartley v King Edwards VI College (2017) has confirmed that an employee who refuses to work in accordance with his contract forfeits his right to be paid for the duration of the breach. The decision extends to professional employees paid a periodic salary the principle established in Miles v Wakefield MDC (1987). The present article sheds new light on these decisions by situating them within a broader debate concerning the function of the wage and the proper relationship between work and payment. Drawing on insights from economic theory, and engaging in a genealogical analysis of legal concepts, the article shows how this debate has, over time, conditioned the use of concepts such as the 'wage', 'the salary' and 'remuneration' in legislation and case law concerning deductions. It shows that the legal concept of the 'wage' is closely related to the economic idea of the wage as the price of a commodity, while the legal concepts of 'salary' and 'remuneration' are more closely analogous to the economic idea of the wage as the cost of subsistence. The courts' tendency to confuse these concepts, and to analyse the employer's power to deduct as a right to withhold wages for non-performance of the contract, tells us much about the implicit assumptions underpinning cases such as Miles and Hartley, and how they have shaped the path of the law.
J40|Using Social Network Activity Data to Identify and Target Job Seekers|An important challenge for many firms is to identify the life transitions of its customers, such as job searching, being pregnant, or purchasing a home. Inferring such transitions, which are generally unobserved to the firm, can offer the firm opportunities to be more relevant to its customers. In this paper, we demonstrate how a social network platform can leverage its longitudinal user data to identify which of its users are likely job seekers. Identifying job seekers is at the heart of the business model of professional social network platforms. Our proposed approach builds on the hidden Markov model (HMM) framework to recover the latent state of job search from noisy signals obtained from social network activity data. Specifically, our modeling approach combines cross-sectional survey responses to a job seeking status question with longitudinal user activity data. Thus, in some time periods, and for some users, we observe the “true” job seeking status. We fuse the observed state information into the HMM likelihood, resulting in a partially HMM. We demonstrate that the proposed model can not only predict which users are likely to be job seeking at any point in time, but also what activities on the platform are associated with job search, and how long the users have been job seeking. Furthermore, we find that targeting job seekers based on our proposed approach can lead to a 42% increase in profits of a targeting campaign relative to the approach that was used at the time of the data collection.
J40|The Cyclicality of the Stepping Stone Effect of Temporary Agency Employment|This paper investigates whether the stepping stone effect of temporary agency employment moves over the business cycle. Using German administrative data for the period 1985-2012 and an estimation framework based on the timing-events model, we construct a time series of in-treatment and post-treatment effects and estimate their relationship to the aggregate unemployment rate. We find evidence for a strong lock-in effect of temporary agency employment that is even more pronounced in tight labor markets. This suggests that firms do not use agency employment as a screening device when unemployment is low. Moreover, we find a noticeable countercyclical positive post-treatment effect indicating that workers might be able to activate networks established while being in treatment. We further document that the treatment effects are non-linear over the business cycle.
J40|Measuring the Gig Economy: Current Knowledge and Open Issues|The rise of the “gig economy” has attracted wide attention from both scholars and the popular media. Much of this attention has been devoted to jobs mediated through various online platforms. While non-traditional work arrangements have been a perennial subject of debate and study, the perception that new technology is producing an accelerated pace of change in the organization of work has fueled a resurgence of interest in how such changes may be affecting both workers and firms. This paper provides a typology of work arrangements and reviews how different arrangements, and especially gig activity, are captured in existing data. A challenge for understanding recent trends is that household survey and administrative data paint a different picture, with the former showing little evidence of the growth in self-employment that would be implied by a surge in gig activity and the latter providing evidence of considerable recent growth. An examination of matched individual-level survey and administrative records shows that a large and growing fraction of those with self-employment activity in administrative data have no such activity recorded in household survey data. The share of those with self-employment activity in household survey data but not administrative data is smaller and has not grown. Promising avenues for improving the measurement of self-employment activity include the addition of more probing questions to household survey questionnaires and the development of integrated data sets that combine survey, administrative and, potentially, private data.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J40|To what extent do policies contribute to self-employment?|Using cross-country time series panel regressions for the last two decades, this paper seeks to identify the main policy and institutional factors that explain the share of self-employment across European countries. It looks at the aggregate share of self-employed as well as its breakdown by age, skill and gender. The generosity of unemployment benefits, and to a lesser extent, spending on active labour market policies appear to be robust determinants of the long-term share of self-employed in European countries. No significant relation is found between the stringency of employment protection and aggregate self-employment. However, there are significant, and oppositely signed, impacts on high- and low-skilled self-employed separately. Both the tax wedge and the minimum wage appear to be positively related to the share of self-employed in the long term, but the relation holds for some categories of workers only.
J40|Increasing inclusiveness for women, youth and seniors in Canada|Women, youth and seniors face barriers to economic inclusion in Canada, with considerable scope to improve their labour market outcomes. There has been no progress in shrinking the gender employment gap since 2009, and women, particularly mothers, continue to earn significantly less than men, in part due to a large gap in unpaid childcare responsibilities. Outside the province of Québec, low (but increasing) rates of government support for childcare should be expanded considerably, as should fathers’ low take-up of parental leave. Skills development should be prioritised to arrest declining skills among youth and weak wage growth among young males with low educational attainment. Fragmented labour market information needs to be consolidated to address wage penalties associated with the widespread prevalence of qualifications mismatch. Growth in old-age poverty should be tackled through further increases in basic pension payments over time. Linking changes in the age of eligibility for public pensions to life expectancy would boost growth by increasing employment of older Canadians still willing and able to work. For all three groups, well-targeted expansions of in-work tax benefits and active labour market spending have the potential to increase employment.
J40|The regional effects of professional sports franchises: Causal evidence from four European football leagues|We use the locational pattern of clubs in four major professional football leagues in Europe to test the causal effect of changes in premier league membership on regional employment and output growth at the NUTS 3 level. We rely on the relegation mode of the classical round-robin tournament in the European model of sport to develop a regression-discontinuity design. The results indicate small and significant negative short-term effects on regional employment and output in the sports-related economic sector when clubs are relegated from the premier division of the respective football league. In addition, we find small negative effects on overall regional employment growth. However, total regional gross value added remains unaffected, indicating that in the main it is the less productive jobs that disappear in the short-term.
J40|The Effect of Labor Market Polarization on the College Students' Employment|This paper aims to assess the effect of the labor market environment on various aspects of college students' job market related behaviors. In some cases, college students hide or evade their unemployment status by extending school registration or transferring to another school. By estimating the effect of the macroeconomic variables on college students' labor market related outcomes, it is found that labor market polarization has a significant effect on both the nominal unemployment and the hidden actions of college students. It implies that the labor market structure is a key element in understanding youth employment, and the youth labor policy should focus more on micro and institutional level of labor market reform.
J40|The potential output gains from using optimal teacher incentives: An illustrative calibration of a hidden action model|This paper examines the potential output gains from the implementation of optimal teacher incentive pay schemes, by calibrating the Hölmstrom and Milgrom (1987) hidden action model using data from Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2011), a teacher incentive pay experiment implemented in Andhra Pradesh, India. Findings suggest that the introduction of optimal individual incentive-pay schemes could result in very large increases in output, about six times the size of the (significant) results obtained in the experiment.
J40|Intégration européenne et politiques du marché du travail : quel consensus entre parlementaires français et allemands ?|This paper presents the results of a survey on the future of European integration conducted in the national parliaments of both France and Germany. In particular, we collected the opinions of members of national parliaments on more involvement of the European Union in labor market policies of Member States. We also asked them about their views on the creation of a common unemployment insurance and whether more flexibility is needed in national labor markets. After reporting descriptive and summary statistics, we show that for the majority of questions the answers reflect more of an ideological (left/right) division than a French/German one.
J40|Individual Motives or Organisational Support? Exclusive Breastfeeding Behaviour Among Women Workers in Indonesia |"""Objective – This study aims to measure the knowledge and attitudes towards exclusive breastfeeding among women workers in Indonesia as well as their expectation to the company’s supports to enable the practice. Methodology/Technique – This research is cross sectional and was conducted in three manufacturing companies located in West Java, which the percentage of exclusive breastfeeding only reached 35.3% compared to the national percentage which reached 55.7 %. Research was conducted in HF, CI and CMW involving 290 respondents. Findings – The results showed that respondents do not understand the definition of exclusive breastfeeding. In addition, the main supports expected by women workers to be provided by the company include: longer maternity leave and designated nursery room with sufficient facilities. Novelty – This research suggests that companies should have a thorough policy and facilities for working mothers to enable them giving exclusive breastfeeding for their babies. As the number of women entering the workforce is steadily increasing, this kind of policy would be a necessary benefit provided by the companies. """
J40|Does One Size Fit All? Investigating Different Empowerment Orientations in the Heterogeneous Workforce of the Swedish Retail Sector|Empowerment research and practice is guided by the idea that empowered employees perform better due to a greater sense of self-efficacy and capability. Underlying this idea, there often seem to be two tacit, unexamined assumptions: first, that employees generally would prefer an empowered workplace to a less empowered one; and second, that all employees can be empowered by means of the same measures and changes as defined by empowerment research. The main research question asked in this study is whether those aspects typically associated with structural and psychological empowerment efforts at the workplace are indeed perceived as desirable and positive by all types of employees. Employees’ attitudes toward the success of empowerment efforts, and the relevance of such attitudes, are investigated by analyzing survey data from 268 employees in the Swedish retail sector. Results indicate that age and work intensity (part-time vs. full-time) as well as cohabitation have significant impacts on how empowerment efforts are viewed by employees in the sample.
J40|Raising and mobilising skills to boost productivity and inclusiveness in Belgium|A highly educated and skilled workforce has been an important driver of productivity performance and prosperity in Belgium. This paper examines skills policies that could help improve productivity and inclusiveness. An increased focus on lifelong learning, improved and more flexible working conditions for older workers, and a more efficient allocation of students and skills would benefit productivity growth. Improving inclusiveness requires increasing access and participation in tertiary education, especially for students with disadvantaged backgrounds. Digitalisation holds the promise of large gains in labour productivity, but is disrupting the nature of employment relationships. It calls for measures that encourage information and communication technology (ICT) upskilling and for adapting tax and benefit systems to the rise of on-demand jobs linked to the use of e-platforms.
J40|The Economics of Altruism ? The Old, the Rich, the Female|This study examines whether certain observed characteristics are associated people's altruistic feelings and behaviors. The paper utilizes a National Mental Health Survey that gathered questions about respondents' self-reported altruism along with their demographic, labor force, and income information. The empirical results reveal that (1) older people are more altruistic; (2) higher income people are more altruistic; and (3) women are more altruistic. The results are robust once the potential endogeneity problem of the income variable is eliminated by the use of the instrumental variable estimation method.
J40|The Local Effects of the Texas Shale Boom on Schools, Students, and Teachers|This study explores how the Texas shale boom affected schools, students, and teachers. Using variation in geology across school districts and oil prices over time, the evidence shows that test scores and attendance in the average shale district declined despite the boom tripling the tax base and creating a revenue windfall. Greater spending went to capital projects and servicing debt, not to teachers. Although higher wages may not have affected completion rates, a growing gap in wages between the private and education sectors contributed to greater teacher turnover and more inexperienced teachers, which help explain the declines in student achievement.
J40|The World’s Oldest Profession? Employment-Age Profiles from the Transactional Sex Market|Standard labor market models predict that the likelihood of employment increases, hours worked increase, and individuals transition from less-skilled and temporary jobs to more skilled and more stable employment as they age. I examine the association between age and transactional sex work using national household surveys from Zambia, one of the few settings with general population surveys asking women about transactional sex and a relatively high documented prevalence of employment in transactional sex. My results indicate that the likelihood of employment in transactional sex sharply falls with age. Increased employment opportunities outside of transactional sex do not appear to explain the transactional sex employment-age profile and marital status appears to explain only a portion of it. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that clients prefer younger females and suggest that interventions designed to reduce client demand younger females may be particularly effective at reducing transactional sex.
J40|Insurance Between Firms: The Role of Internal Labor Markets|We investigate how Internal Labor Markets (ILMs) allow complex organizations to accommodate positive and negative shocks calling for costly labor adjustments. Adverse shocks affecting one unit in the organization are shown to increase workers' mobility to other units rather than external firms, with stricter employment protection in the adversely hit unit causing an additional increase in internal mobility. The ILM response to adverse shocks is also stronger when the receiving units in the organization are more productive and have a better financing capacity. We also find that affiliated units faced with positive shocks to their growth opportunities rely on the ILM for new hires, especially managers in the top layers of the organization and other high-skilled workers, thus overcoming human capital bottlenecks that may curb growth. ILMs therefore emerge as a co-insurance mechanism within organizations, allowing them to bypass both firing and hiring frictions, and providing job stability to employees as a by-product.

J40|A Comparative Study Of Training In The Private And Public Sectors: Evidence From The United Kingdom And The United States|" type=""main"" xml:id=""coep12120-abs-0001""> Formal training programs are one of the main channels through which workers become more productive and experience wage growth. So far, however, most of the results on the effects of employer-provided training come from studying the training received by private sector workers only. We extend the literature by identifying and comparing the effects of private-employer-provided and public-employer-provided training in the United States and the United Kingdom. We address this question using two independent data sets from the British Household Panels Surveys and the American National Longitudinal Survey of Youth of 1979. (JEL J24, J31, J40)"
J40|Testing the Labor Market Dualism in Korea|The existence of the dual labor market in Korea is tested under the two different definitions of the labor market dualism. First, the estimation results from widely used tools such as Heckman's sample selection model support the existence of two wage equations, advocating the presence of labor market dualism in Korea. Second, the labor market dualism index suggested by Hudson (2007) supports that there is some degree of bifurcation between the good job conditions and bad job conditions.
J40|Labor Market Sorting in Germany|This paper analyzes how workers are allocated to jobs in Germany. Our main contribution is to show how labor market sorting has evolved over time across worker types and how these developments are related to wages and wage inequality. We show direct empirical evidence that wages are not necessarily increasing in the productivity of the firm a worker is matched with. This feature of the data is predicted by theoretical models of labor market sorting (Shimer and Smith, 2000; Eeckhout and Kircher, 2011). We use a structural search model and the identification procedure proposed by Hagedorn et al. (2014) to empirically identify worker and firm rankings as well as the bivariate density of matches in Germany. We compute rank correlations and find that low-type workers have become increasingly sorted into low-type firms in our period of observation (1998-2008), especially out of unemployment. Sorting of high-type workers into high-type firms has, if anything, slightly decreased during our period of observation.
J40|The Effects of Student Composition on Teacher Turnover: Evidence from an Admission Reform|This paper examines the effects of student ability on teacher turnover using data from Stockholm high schools and an admission reform that led to the exogenous reshuffling of pupils. The results indicate that a 10-percentile-point increase in student credentials decreases the probability of a separation by up to 10 percentage points. These effects vary across different groups of teachers and are found mainly for mobility between schools rather than out of the profession. Teachers react mostly to direct measures of student ability (grades from compulsory school) rather than to other correlated characteristics (immigrant status, parental income or paternal cognitive skills). Finally, the data do not support the compensating wage differentials hypothesis.
J40|Characterization of job stress for the employed population that lives in Cali: an empirical study using multiple correspondence analysis and a model generalized multinomial ordered|The economic contexts where the people (employees) participante as part of labor market affect directly the development of their skills and abilities. In economic theory this situation is motivated by the compensation that the employees obtain for their efforts in despite of their leisure time. However, there are situations in the organizational context that could affect individual's performance like professional stress.This research aims to analize, by means of qualitative and quantitative methods, social, economic and demographic factors associated with professional stress in the working population living in Cali. For this purpose, two econometric techniques are proposed: The first one refers to multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) that is used to construct a professional sress Index (PSI) taking into consideration a collection of variables that have been preliminarily selected. The second one technique is used for estimating an ordinal multinomial model that could be useful to characterize the employees who has a high profile professional stress. The database used for the statistical and econometric analysis came from the Employment and Quality of Life Survey applied in the city of Cali by the Ministry of Labour and the Municipality of Santiago de Cali in the period November 2012 - January 2013.
J40|The advantage of hierarchy: Inducing responsibility and selecting ability?|We theoretically and experimentally investigate team production with and without a leading member of the team (called allocator) who has discretion over the input of all team members including herself. In a further extension of the allocator game, a superior (called principal) is introduced who is interested in high production and who can exchange the allocator. Team production and remuneration are modeled as a linear public good game with a finite number of periods. The main results are that (a) the appointment of a random allocator improves production so that average incomes of all workers, including the allocator, are higher when compared with voluntary contributions, (b) the introduction of a principal further improves production as well as satisfaction and fairness ratings. (a) and (b) describe the advantage of a tiered hierarchy. We provide a formal model of hierarchical decisions as well as derive and test various behavioral hypotheses.
J40|Out-migration and attrition of physicians and dentists before and after EU accession (2003 and 2011): the case of Hungary|Abstract This paper employs a large-scale, individual-level, panel dataset to analyse the effect of EU accession on the probability of out-migration on the part of Hungarian physicians and dentists between 2003 and 2011. The study uses event history modelling and competing risk models. The results show that EU accession did not at the time affect the probability of out-migration while after the end of the transitional period of restrictions on the free movement of labour from the new EU member states to Austria and Germany, the probability of doctors’ migration increased considerably. Relative wages and peer pressure also exercise a significant role in the out-migration decisions of young medical doctors. We also find that more than half of those medical doctors who left the country during the observation period returned some time later. The data furthermore suggest a massive flow of doctors to domestic jobs outside the health care system.
J40|Does political ideology hinder insights on gender and labor markets?|Sociology is a field where a large majority of professors lean left. The left-leaning ideology is visible in studies of gender differences in labor markets. In such studies, a left-feminist ideology of equality is taken to be self-evident. Defining equality to equate to slim-outcome difference, however, pre-destines all differences to be seen as outcomes of culturally defined social constructions and discrimination. In this chapter it is hypothesized that this has produced tabooed topics in the field. One such taboo is the acknowledging of differences between men and women. Such differences challenge the left-feminism’s notion of equality in terms of slim-outcome-difference. Research on evolution and preferences is downplayed in favor of cultural explanations. Cultural explanations interpret differences between men and women in labor market behavior as constructed, as largely driven by gender stereotypes and discrimination. The notion that differences can stem from biology or from the choices made by individuals pursuing a lifestyle different than those prescribed by gender researchers is seldom entertained. I hypothesize that the situation stems from gender sociology being dominated by left-feminist ideology.
J40|The impact of internal displacement on destination communities: Evidence from the Colombian conflict|More than ten percent of the population of Colombia has been forced to migrate due to civil war. This study employs an enclave IV strategy, which exploits social distance between origin and destination locations, as well as conflict-induced migration, to estimate the impact that the arrival of displaced individuals has on the wages of local residents. I compare the effects on four different subgroups of the population, partitioned by skill (low-skilled versus high-skilled) and by gender. The analysis suggests that a conflict-induced increase in population leads to a short-run negative impact on wages, but that subsequent out-migration from receiving municipalities helps to mitigate these effects. Though the impact tends to dissipate over time, it persists for low-skilled women, suggesting that this group is particularly vulnerable to the arrival of forced migrants.
J40|Missing Men: World War II Casualties and Structural Change|This paper investigates the long-term consequences of violent conflict and the associatedhuman casualties on economic development. Using the World War II casualties suffered in Austrian municipalities as a natural experiment, I find a significant negative causal effect of human losses on economic activity, as measured by the current total wage bill in the affected communities today. The underlying determinants of this reduction in output are traced back to a lower number and density of firms, along with a smaller work force. However, this is only true for the service sector and not the manufacturing sector. As I demonstrate, the likely channel through which the effect persisted over time is through its impact on the structural composition of the work force. Specifically, greater human losses increased the fraction of employment in manufacturing at the expense of agriculture until the 1970s and services from then onwards. A simple model shows that structural change can translate a lower labor share in agricultural production into less participation of service sector growth at a later time.
J40|Occupation coding during the interview|"""Currently, most surveys ask for occupation with open-ended questions. The verbatim responses are coded afterwards, which is error-prone and expensive. We describe an alternative approach that allows occupation coding during the interview. Our new technique utilizes a supervised learning algorithm to predict candidate job categories. These suggestions are presented to the respondent, who can in turn choose the most adequate occupation. 72.4% of the respondents selected an occupation when the new instrument was tested in a telephone survey, implicating potential cost savings. To aid further improvements, we identify a number of factors how to increase quality and reduce interview duration.""

J40|"The Unintended Consequences on Crime of ""Pennies from Heaven"""|This paper examines how an infrastructure investment policy, implemented nationwide at the local level, has affected local crime rates. This policy, developed in the wake of the global recession of 2008-09, was designed to boost local economies through job creation. Using monthly figures from the Spanish region of Catalonia's more than 900 municipalities, the paper exploits geographic and time variation in the Spanish Ministry of Public Administration's random approvals of local investment policies, to estimate their impact on both (un)employment and crime. The combination of difference-in-differences and IV estimates makes it possible to precisely assess both the size and timing of the policy's impact on the local labor market and on municipal-level crime rates. While the policy apparently did not tackle the economic recession over the long run, local public finances did experience a boost over the short term, resulting in a temporary reduction in local unemployment rates (as legally required by the policy), as well as a significant drop in crime rates.
J40|Collective Bargaining and the Evolution of Wage Inequality in Italy|Italian male wage inequality has increased at a relatively fast pace from the mid‐1980s until the early 2000s, while it has been persistently flat since then. We analyse this trend, focusing on the period of most rapid growth in pay dispersion. By accounting for worker and firm fixed effects, it is shown that workers' heterogeneity has been a major determinant of increased wage inequalities, while variability in firm wage policies has declined over time. We also show that the growth in pay dispersion has entirely occurred between livelli di inquadramento, that is, job titles defined by national industry‐wide collective bargaining institutions, for which specific minimum wages apply. We conclude that the underlying market forces determining wage inequality have been largely channelled into the tight tracks set by the centralized system of industrial relations.
J40|Testing for the Ratchet Effect: Evidence from a Real-Effort Work Task|"The ""ratchet effect"" refers to a phenomenon where workers whose compensation is based on productivity strategically restrict their output, relative to their capability, because they rationally anticipate that high levels of output will be met with increased or ""ratcheted-up"" expectations in the future. While there is ample anecdotal evidence suggesting the presence of the ratchet effect in real workplaces, it is difficult to actually empirically identify output restriction among workers. In this study, we implement a novel experimental design using a real-effort work task and a piece-rate incentive scheme to directly test for the presence of the ratchet effect using two different methods for evaluating productivity: (i) when productivity is evaluated based on the output of each individual worker, and (ii) when productivity is evaluated collectively based on the output of a group of workers. We find strong evidence of the ratchet effect when productivity is evaluated at the individual-level. However, we find very little evidence of the ratchet effect when productivity is evaluated collectively at the group-level. We attribute the latter result to the free-riding incentive that emerges when productivity is evaluated at the group-level. Furthermore, we find the ratchet effect re-emerges if workers are able to communicate. Our experimental design, combined with using a real-effort work task, also allows us to shed light on an important dynamic implication of the ratchet effect that has not yet been examined in the literature – the role of the ratchet effect on future productivity via learning-by-doing."

Migration and attrition of physicians and dentists in Hungary between 2003 and 2011]|A tanulmány nagymintás, egyéni paneladatokra alapozva azt vizsgálja, hogy miként változott a magyarországi orvosok külföldre vándorlásának és más okból történt pályaelhagyásának valószínűsége 2003 és 2011 között. Az eseménytörténeti elemzés, a versengő kockázati modellek eredményei azt mutatják, hogy először az EU-csatlakozást követően, majd 2010 tavaszától, végül az osztrák és német munkavállalási korlátozások feloldása után felgyorsult az orvosok migrációja. Az eredmények arra is felhívják a figyelmet, hogy Magyarországon az orvosok külföldre vándorlása mellett ugyanolyan súlyú probléma a belföldi pályaelhagyás is, tehát az, hogy az orvosok itthon helyezkednek el más állásban. Emellett - ha időszakosan is - az is fokozza az orvoshiányt, hogy a fiatal orvosok jelentős része átmenetileg inaktív státusba kerül. A tanulmány korcsoportonként külön is bemutatja a különböző irányú pályaelhagyás vagy a migráció valószínűségének változását és az orvosok jellemzőinek hatását ezekre a kockázatokra.

J40|Factors Influencing Female Labor Force Participation in Egypt and Germany: A Comparative Study|This paper aims to identify the major factors influencing female labor force participation (FLFP) in Egypt and Germany. On a narrow scope and given the unclear relationship between educational attainment and Egyptian FLFP, this paper seeks to examine the effect of educational attainment on the Egyptian FLFP while considering other personal and household factors. On a broader scope, the literature on FLFP illustrates that certain personal and household characteristics determine FLFP. However, the question remains, to what extent these determinants differ between Egypt and Germany. This paper attempts to shed light on understanding if and how specific demographic factors affect the Egyptian FLFP in comparison with the German FLFP. Limited dependent variable technique; Probit model is utilized to determine which factors influence FLFP in both countries. The cross sectional analysis is conducted through the use of the 2012 Egyptian Labor Market Panel Survey (ELMPS) in collaboration with Egypt’s Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) and the 2012 German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). Findings indicate that indeed higher educational attainment increases the Egyptian female’s predicted probability of participating in the labor market. Additionally, the comparative study showed that number of factors affect FLFP in both countries, some of which has a positive influence as years of schooling and age while others with a negative impact as being a married women, living in urban areas and number of children. On the other hand some other variables impact each country differently as wealth. Additionally, it was evident that years of schooling has a higher marginal impact on Egyptian FLFP yet, age, being married and number of children have a higher marginal effect on German FLFP.
J40|Augmenting the Human Capital Earnings Equation with Measures of Where People Work|We augment standard log earnings equations for workers in US manufacturing with variables reflecting measured and unmeasured attributes of their employer. Using panel employee-establishment data, we find that establishment-level employment, education of coworkers, capital equipment per worker, and firm-level R&D intensity affects earnings substantially. Unobserved characteristics of employers captured by employer fixed effects also contribute to the variance of log earnings, although less than unobserved characteristics of individuals captured by individual fixed effects. The observed and unobserved measures of employers mediate the effects of individual characteristics on earnings and increase earnings inequality through sorting of workers among establishments.
J40|Augmenting the Human Capital Earnings Equation with Measures of Where People Work|We augment standard ln earnings equations with variables reflecting unmeasured attributes of workers and measured and unmeasured attributes of their employer. Using panel employee-establishment data for US manufacturing we find that the observable employer characteristics that most impact earnings are: number of workers, education of co-workers, capital equipment per worker, industry in which the establishment produces, and R&D intensity of the firm. Employer fixed effects also contribute to the variance of ln earnings, though substantially less than individual fixed effects. In addition to accounting for some of the variance in earnings, the observed and unobserved measures of employers mediate the estimated effects of individual characteristics on earnings and increasing earnings inequality through the sorting of workers among establishments.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J40|Aggregate wages of players and performance in Italian Serie A|Abstract This paper investigates the relationship between players’ wages and sport performance in the Italian top professional football league—Serie A. The analysis focuses on 14 seasons from 2001/2002 to 2014/2015. Findings show that aggregate wage expenditure is a robust predictor of success for Italian professional football teams. We first exploited a fixed-effects panel data and eventually we addressed the problem of endogeneity by providing a dynamic IV specification of the model. Based on the System-GMM framework, we employed a model including lagged terms of dependent variables and covariates as instruments to control for endogeneity as well as alternative exogenous instruments to control for geographical/environmental factors and socio-economic factors that could be the actual predictors of performance through an indirect effect on payroll.
J40|Online labour index: Measuring the online gig economy for policy and research|Labour markets are thought to be in the midst of a dramatic transformation, where standard employment is increasingly supplemented or substituted by temporary work mediated by online platforms. Yet the scale and scope of these changes is hard to assess, because conventional labour market statistics and economic indicators are ill-suited to measuring this “online gig work”. We present the Online Labour Index (OLI), an experimental economic indicator that approximates the conventional labour market statistic of new open vacancies. It measures the utilization of online labour across countries and occupations by tracking the number of projects and tasks posted on major online gig platforms in near-real time. The purpose of this article is to introduce the OLI and describe the methodology behind it. We also demonstrate how it can be used to address previously unanswered questions about the online gig economy. To benefit policymakers, labour market researchers and the general public, our results are published in an interactive online visualisation which is updated daily.
J40|Local Labor Markets And Natural Resources: A Synthesis Of The Literature|A primary way that natural resources affect a locality is through the demand for labor, with greater extraction requiring more workers. Shifts in labor demand can be measured through changes in employment and earnings, the main labor market outcomes, or through changes in the population and income, more generally. These changes may spillover into the nonresource economy, leading to greater overall effects or possibly crowd out; be spread unequally across the population, thereby altering the distribution of income and the poverty rate; or influence educational attainment, as people choose between additional schooling and work. In this review, the literature linking natural resources to local labor markets is synthesized by organizing existing studies according to their resource measurement and the outcomes that they consider. This synthesis provides an accessible guide to a literature that has boomed in recent years. It also identifies promising avenues for future research and lays a foundation to further generalize the evidence through an eventual metaâ€ analysis.
J40|"""Sometimes you don't make enough to buy food"" - an analysis of South African street waste pickersâ€™ income"|In this paper we use income data of 873 street waste pickers in South Africa to assess whether their income is sufficient to make a living and to identify the possible factors that may influence their income. The results can assist policy makers to make informed decisions in designing and implementing policies aimed at improving the street waste pickersâ€™ income earning potential. The results of a linear and logistic regression analysis show that street waste pickersâ€™ income is low and many of the street waste pickers in South Africa are trapped in persistent and chronic poverty. The findings further show that the only variables under the direct control of street waste pickers that may have a small positive effect on their income are the use of a trolley and the number of hours worked. Most of the variance in the daily income is explained by the prices of, access to, and the quality of recyclable waste collected over which the street waste pickers have little or no control. This leaves street waste pickers with little scope to improve their income and consequently their socio-economic conditions. Local governments can, however, create an environment and infrastructure in which higher levels of quality waste are made accessible to the street waste pickers.
J40|Search and matching frictions and business cycle fluctuations in Bulgaria|In this paper we investigate the quantitative importance of search and matching fric- tions in Bulgarian labor markets. This is done by augmenting an otherwise standard real business cycle model a la Long and Plosser (1983) with both a two-sided costly search and fiscal policy. This introduces a strong propagation mechanism that allows the model to capture the business cycles in Bulgaria better than earlier models. The model performs well vis-a-vis data, especially along the labor market dimension, and in addition dominates the market-clearing labor market framework featured in the stan- dard RBC model, e.g Vasilev (2009), as well as the indivisible labor extension used in Hansen (1985).
J40|Organizational power: Should remuneration heterogeneity mirror hierarchy?|Abstract We model and experimentally investigate effort levels in team production as a public good game with heterogeneous remuneration. In a hierarchically organized firm, team leaders (allocators) determine the effort levels of all team members. When the allocator receives equal payment or twice as much as the other workers, this results in the same team production, but when the allocator receives only half of what the other workers receive, team production is diminished.
J40|Employment, Capital and Seasonality in Selected Mediterranean Countries|The paper examines the influence of tourism industry on GDP, employment and capital investments in selected Mediterranean countries (Croatia, France, Greece, Italy and Spain). It points out important contribution which tourism has on economic activity and capital investment of selected economies and labour market. The analysis highlights the importance of tourism strength in generating employment. It synthesizes data on tourism employment and employment according to educational level. The results show that the quality of human capital is increasing but at the same time indicating gender discrimination in tourism labour market. Despite women being the majority of higher education degree holders in tourism, men hold upper-management and decision-making positions more often than women do. Lastly the paper indicates strong contribution of tourism sector in GDP and total employment in selected countries showing strong problem of seasonality. JEL Classification: J40, J70, Z30

J40|Human Capital Accumulation over the Life-Cycle: Evidence from Germany’s Reunification|We study and compare the importance of human capital acquired at different stages of the life-cycle. We exploit Germany’s unique reunification episode and the sudden restructuring of East Germany’s labor market institutions and education system. We show graphical evidence that earnings, employment and wages for each East German birth cohort—scaled by the same outcomes for West German cohorts—change linearly with age at reunification. These linear exposure effects display structural breaks, i.e., changes in slope, around the ages 18 and 30 at reunification for both genders, and age 35 for females: there are significant gender differences. Exposure effects are by far the strongest for males between ages 20 and 30, where relative earnings decline at a rate of 2% per year for older cohorts. Around 40% of this effect is explained by higher college graduation rates for younger cohorts, while the remaining 60% underscores the impor- tance and long lasting impact of early career effects. For females, earnings differences are almost completely explained by employment. We document reverse exposure effects for East German women between age 5 and 30 at reunification: employment and labor force participation rates increase linearly with each additional year spent in the socialist East. This trend is reversed after age 30, with older cohort’s earnings and employment declining with each additional year spent in the East.
J40|Structural Transformation, the Push-Pull Hypothesis and the Labour Market|This paper proposes a small-scale general equilibrium model of structural transformation with a non-agricultural labour market characterized by search frictions. The model is used to investigate the role of sectoral TFPs as main drivers of structural change and a new growth accounting exercise gives a quantitative reassessment of the importance of the labour reallocation bonus in structural transformations in the presence of labour market frictions. The model is calibrated to data for post-war Spain and its transition from dictatorship to democracy. Counterfactual simulations point towards productivity improvements in agriculture as the main driver, while modifications in labour market institutions affect mainly the labour market itself, with only a modest effect on structural change.
J40|Apprenticeship, Vocational Training and Early Labor Market Outcomes - in East and West Germany|We study the returns to apprenticeship and vocational training for three early labor market outcomes all measured at age 25 for East and West German youths: non-employment (i.e., unemployment or out of the labor force), permanent fulltime employment, and wages. We find strong positive effects of apprenticeship and vocational training. There are no significant differences for different types of vocational training, minor differences between East and West Germany and males and females, and no significant changes in the returns over time. Instrumental variable estimations confirm the regression results. The positive returns hold up even in poor labor market situations.
J40|On the Allocation of Time - A Quantitative Analysis of the U.S. and France|We study the allocation of time in the U.S. and in Europe during 1960–2010. We find that market hours decreased and leisure increased most in France and least in the U.S. Contrary to what standard theory predicts, home hours changed comparatively little. We show that the growth model with home production can account for the patterns in France and the U.S. if we feed in taxes and labor productivities. To obtain this result it is crucial to measure the labor productivity of home production in a comparable way in both countries, instead of calibrating these productivities like the literature does.
J40|A Statistical Analysis of Heterogeneity on Labour Markets and Unemployment Rates in Colombia|In this paper, we study the structural factors that determine the differences in unemployment rates and in labour market performance for Colombian cities. Using cross-sectional data for 23 metropolitan areas, we apply an extension of a principal axes method—Multiple Factor Analysis for Multiple Contingency Tables (MFACT)—in order to identify unobservable factors that are relevant when disentangling the heterogeneity observed among groups of variables considered explanatory of regional unemployment differentials. Our findings suggest that differences in qualified labour supply levels, participation incentives and age structure are important when it comes to understanding regional heterogeneity in terms of labour markets and unemployment rates in Colombia. In addition, clustering methods reveal that cities that display high unemployment rates do not necessarily share the same structural characteristics; that is, labour market frictions that give rise to unemployment are not the same across Colombian cities.

J40|Factores asociados a las empresas con potencial de crecimiento en la universidad EAN|Resumen El presente artículo tiene como objetivo aportar en la discusión sobre los factores asociados a la creación de empresas dinámicas o con potencial de crecimiento productivo, al analizar los factores relacionados a la empresarialidad con potencial de crecimiento tomando como estudio de caso, las empresas registradas en el censo empresarial de la Universidad EAN en el año 2013. Se realizó un análisis cuantitativo mediante el uso de un modelo logístico binomial para medir el nivel de asociación entre ciertas variables de control sustentadas en la teoría y la empresarialidad con potencial de crecimiento productivo. Entre los principales hallazgos se encontró que la antigüedad de la empresa, la pertenencia a redes empresariales y el desarrollar su actividad productiva en el sector de manufactura aumentan considerablemente la probabilidad de que una empresa tenga potencial de crecimiento productivo.
J40|Apprenticeship, Vocational Training and Early Labor Market Outcomes in East and West Germany|We study the returns to apprenticeship and vocational training for three early labor market outcomes all measured at age 25 for East and West German youths: non-employment (i.e., unemployment or out of the labor force), permanent fulltime employment, and wages. We find strong positive effects of apprenticeship and vocational training. There are no significant differences for different types of vocational training, minor differences between East and West Germany and males and females, and no significant changes in the returns over time. Instrumental variable estimations confirm the regression results. The positive returns hold up even in poor labor market situations.
J40|Impact of the Great Recession on unemployed and NEET individuals’ labour market transitions in Ireland|The impact that the Great Recession has had on countries’ labour markets has been well documented. In Ireland, the contraction in economic activity that took place resulted in the country's overall unemployment rate increasing from 4.6% in 2006 to 15% in 2012. The country's youth unemployment rate rose from 9.9% to 33% over the same time period, while the proportion of NEETs increased from 10.1% in 2006 to 18.7% in 2012. Policymakers are aware of the unemployment rates of young and prime-aged people as well as the NEETs rate. However, little is known about these groups’ profiles, whether their profiles have changed since the recession and also their labour market transition patterns pre and post the Great Recession. Given the importance of this information in the design of effective activation measures to assist unemployed and NEET individuals, this paper examines each of these issues in turn. Overall, the study found for all three groups examined that the rate of transition to employment fell dramatically between 2006 and 2011. The analysis showed that the drop in the groups’ transition rates was not due to changes in the underlying sub-group population structures but to changes in the external environment that resulted in the impact of possessing certain characteristics changing over the recession. For example, education and nationality have become more important in finding a job in Ireland over the course of the recession, while there has been a fall in the scarring impact of unemployment durations.
J40|Game, set, and match: Do women and men perform differently in competitive situations?|This paper analyzes potential gender differences in competitive environments using a sample of over 100,000 professional tennis matches. Focusing on two phenomena of the labor and sports economics literature, we find robust evidence for (i) the hot-hand effect (an additional win in the most recent ten matches raises the likelihood of winning by 3.2–3.4 percentage points) and (ii) the clutch-player effect, as top players are excelling in Grand Slam tournaments, the most important events. Overall, we find virtually no gender differences for the hot-hand effect and only minor distinctions for the clutch-player effect.
J40|Gestión empresarial y dinámica laboral en España|The aim of this paper is to propose some reflections about the recent labour dynamics in the Spanish economy under labour market segmentation theory. From this perspective, the problems and the status in the labour market are due to a combination of factors related to business management practices rather by market dynamics or contractual arrangements. From our point of view it is necessary to overcome the restricted analytical framework of conventional economic approach and introduce other dimensions going further for a better understanding of labour problems. In this sense, we consider key aspects the production structure, business strategies and institutional framework in which the economic activity is taking place.
J40|Is There An Infırmal Employment Wage Penalty in Egypt?|This paper considers the private sector wage earners in Egypt and examine their wage distribution during 1998-2012 using Egyptian Labor Market Panel Survey. We first estimate Mincer wage equations both at the mean and at different quantiles of the wage distribution taking into account observable characteristics. Then we make use of the panel feature of the data and estimate models taking into account unobservable characteristics. We also consider the possibility of nonlinearity in covariate effects and estimate a variant of matching models. In all cases we find a persistent informal wage penalty in the face of extensive sensitivity checks. It is smaller when unobserved heterogeneity is taken into account and larger at the top than at the bottom of the conditional wage distribution. We also examine the informal wage penalty over time during the study period and in different groups according to experience and education. The informal wage penalty has increased recently over time and is larger for the better educated but smaller for the more experienced.
J40|Occupational Skills and the Evolution of Wages|The US and many European countries are witnessing substantial changes in the wage structure (Autor et al. 2006; Dustmann et al., 2009). Previous research has focused on changing returns to education and experience (Katz and Murphy, 1992), changes in the workforce composition (Lemieux, 2006), or the decline in unionization (DiNardo et al., 1996) as possible explanations for the observed changes. Until recently, little attention has been paid to the potential role of the returns to skills. However, the demand for different skills has shown vivid dynamics both within and between industries (Autor et al., 2003). A prominent idea in the more recent literature is that structural changes have depressed the relative demand for certain types of tasks performed on the job. A common finding is that returns to routine tasks have been decreasing over time, while returns to abstract tasks have been increasing. Yet, measuring and defining different types of task categories has been proven to be empirically difficult (Autor, 2013). In our study, we avoid potential measurement issues by using a skill approach as opposed to a task approach to characterize occupations. Instead of focusing on the tasks performed on the job, we examine the skills that individuals acquire during their education. For our empirical analysis we use the Sample of Integrated Labour Market Biographies (SIAB), a sample of social security records in Germany from 1975 through 2008. The information on skills taught in an occupation come from the BIBB/IAB Employment Survey, a representative worker survey. We construct occupation-specific skill portfolios and identify changes in the skill portfolios over the observed time period. We then match the skill portfolios to the corresponding occupations in the SIAB, thereby following the procedure utilized in Gathmann and Sch nberg (2010). In the descriptive analysis, we provide evidence that both the wage level across occupations and the skill portfolios within the same occupation have changed substantially over the observed time period. Then, we investigate whether the observed are related. Following Firpo et al. (2011), we run regressions of wage changes on the base period wage for each percentile of the within-occupation wage distribution and link the estimated intercepts and slopes to the skill portfolios of each occupation. Our results suggest that overall skills that used to be valuable in low-wage occupations have decreased in value, while the opposite has happened in high-wage occupations. Finally, we use a decomposition method based on the re-centered influence function regression approach by Firpo et al. (2007; 2009) to explicitly quantify the contribution of the skill portfolios to changes in the wage structure. Quantifying the contribution of single skills to the evolution of wages allows us to better understand why some occupations have experienced sharp decreases in wages, while others have experienced sharp increases. We thereby contribute to the recent literature on wage inequality. Finally, calculating skill prices can provide guidance for policy makers on how to design training curricula.
J40|Determinants of Transitions across Formal/Informal sectors in Egypt|Informality is a salient feature of labor market in Egypt as it is the case with many developing countries. This is the first study of the determinants of worker transitions between various labor market states using panel data from Egypt. We first provide a diagnosis of dynamic worker flows across different labor market states. We develop transition probabilities by gender across different labor market states utilizing Markov transition processes. Next we identify the effects of individual, household, job characteristics and location on different mobility patterns by estimating a multinomial logit regression. The results point to the highly static nature of the Egyptian labor market. Government employment and the out of labor force are the most persistent labor market states. Further, only a few of the explanatory variables except high levels of education are found to have predictive power in explaining the transitions from formal wage, informal wage, self-employment, unemployment government employment and out of labor market states.
J40|What drives the language proficiency of immigrants?|Language proficiency is a key driver of immigrant integration. It increases job opportunities and facilitates social and political participation. However, despite its vital importance, many immigrants never reach adequate proficiency in the host country language. Therefore, insights into the underlying processes and associated factors are crucial for designing measures to improve language acquisition. Empirical evidence shows that immigrants differ in their ability to learn languages, in their experience of everyday language usage, and their incentives to learn host country languages. This offers a range of opportunities for public policy intervention.

J40|Power Distribution in the Field of the Virtual Labour Market|The study presents empirical results of the dissertation “Bulgarian Virtual Labor Market and Transformation of Power”. Looking at the labour market as socio-economic field of relations and interactions between labour and capital with running two parallel processes of supply and demand of performance and jobs, the virtual labour market is considered as a network of these same relations and interactions performed in an informational, communicational and technological– virtual environment. Its researched whether and to what extent each of the participants in the labour market are included and participate in the virtual space, do they contribute to its formation or just use what so far has been created by others. The research problem was related to the distribution of power between the individual and collective actors involved in the virtual labour market. The study presents specific aspects of the functioning of the virtual labour market in Bulgaria and the transformation of power generated by the interpretatio and analysis of the empirical data from the research conducted by the author.
J40|Skills Mismatch Of The Young People At The European Level|Transition from school to work is a main issue with many fields of study. Studies on transition from school to work, have highlight the importance of two categories of factors at the level of the individual formal proceedings which may affect how easy it is to graduate to integrate into the labor market: 1) so far as the educational systems are transmitting specific competences as compared with those general and 2) so far as there are direct links between employers and the education system. In this way, are reduced the costs of selection and allocation for employers. A poor articulation between educational institutions and the labor market produce a high level of unmatched competences of assimilated by formal education and competencies required of the labor market (skill mismatch) (Parodi et al., 2012). The surveys with European employers reflect particular difficulties that they are experiencing in employment vacancies. Investigation on the European companies in the spring of 2013 found that 40% of the firms in the EU have difficulty in finding employees with suitable qualification (CEDEFOP-European Center for the Development of the Vocational Training, 2014). Skills mismatch is a generic term that refers to various types of imbalances between skills and competences offered and those required in the labor market. Concept has become one intensely discussed and submitted to measurement in international research on the background concerns the under-utilization human resource. Numerous opinion polls with employers come to the same unexpected conclusion - that despite high unemployment many posts can't find occupants satisfactorily prepared and identify the causes: most of them criticized the lack of skills of the candidates or the absence of skills specific to the workplace. Based on the latest studies on international databases have built a set of questions that, through secondary analysis, we tried to find answers. Questions that we try to give answer are: What are the main types of skills mismatch? What are the main ways to measure skills mismatch? What are the indicators of skills mismatch? What is the level of over-education and under-education in European countries? How to calculate skills mismatch between demand and supply of labor at European level? What factors explain the different labor market chances of young people compared to adults? What are the predictors at the macro level and individual level of skills mismatch?
J40|Isolating the Determinants of Temporary Agency Worker Use by Firms: An Analysis of Temporary Agency Workers in Australian Aged Care|Despite a reasonable amount of literature on firms’ reasons for using agency workers we contend that the firms which are users of agency workers are not well understood. Temporary agency work is interesting in the context of understanding the functioning of labour markets. Temporary agency work is of particular interest in Australia which already has a high level of casual employment offering employers considerable flexibility in managing their workforce by other means. We use a unique Australian employer survey in an industry with a higher than usual share of agency workers in the constrained worker supply context, to highlight and explore the differentiating features between those firms that do and do not use agency workers. The analysis enables better identification of the economic conditions under which firms use agency workers. We gain insight into aspects of the aged care sector that encourage temporary agency worker usage by firms.
J40|Spoleczny system produkcji w Niemczech – model na przyszlosc?|The concept of social system of production is one of the research perspectives by which the institutional arrangements of modern market economies are being analyzed. On this basis considerations can be made on distinctive arrangements in given countries, in line with the thesis of Variety of Capitalism approach, as well as explorations can be undertaken of issues of sustainability of institutional configurations and of the complementarity of their components. The study raises these issues in theory and carries out their preliminary verification on the example of Germany's social system of production, with special regard to the labor market. Based on the critical literature review a set of specific features of the German model was selected, as proposed by the concept of the social system of production, divided in four main categories: institutions, organizations, social values and economic policy. Then, using a secondary statistical data and qualitative analysis, the trends affecting these elements are identified, in order to verify the thesis of complementarity and the stability of the German social production system.
J40|Social system of production in Germany – a model for future?|The concept of a social system of production (SSP) is one of the cognitive perspectives by which the institutional arrangements of modern market economies could be analysed. It allows reflections on the autonomy of institutional arrangements in each country, in line with the assumption put by the Variety of Capitalism approach, as well as to investigate problems of stability of the given institutional configuration and the complementarity of their components. The following study raises these issues on theoretical basis and carries out their preliminary verification on the example of German SSP, with special regard to the labour market. Basing on the critical study of literature a set of specific features of the German model is proposed, structured according to the concept of SSP in four main categories: institutions, organizations, social values and economic policy. Then, using a secondary statistical data and qualitative analysis, some trends has been identified occurring within these elements in order to verify the thesis of complementarity and the stability of the German social production system.

J40|The Labor Market and School Finance Effects of the Texas Shale Boom on Teacher Quality and Student Achievement|Resource booms can affect student achievement through greater labor demand, where rising wages pull students or teachers out of schools, and through an expanded tax base, where increased school spending alters teacher quality or student productivity. Using shale depth variation across Texas school districts with annual oil and gas price variation, this study finds that resource development slightly decreased student achievement despite providing schools with more money. Vocational and economically disadvantaged students were pulled into the labor market, while teacher turnover and inexperience increased. Schools responded to the tax base expansion by spending more on capital projects but not on teachers.

J40|The South African labour market, 1995-2013|This paper investigates the changes in the South African labour market in the post-apartheid period in 1995-2013 by updating the work by Oosthuizen (2006) and Yu (2008). The three main data sources used are the October Household Survey of 1995, the Labour Force Survey of September 2004 and the Quarterly Labour Force Survey of 2013 Quarter 4. It was found that while unemployment has risen over the period, employment has also increased. Nonetheless, the extent of employment increase was not rapid enough to absorb all net entrants in to the labour force, resulting in increasing unemployment, or an employment absorption rate of below 100 per cent. Unemployment continues to be concentrated in specific demographically and geographically defined groups, most notably blacks, the poorly educated and the youngsters residing in Gauteng. Unemployment is a chronic problem for the youth in particular, as nearly three quarters of them never worked before. Finally, the employment absorption rate was the highest in some less developed provinces like Northern Cape, Mpumalanga and Limpopo, thereby suggesting the possible success of the governmentâ€™s efforts to promote the development in the poorer provinces.
J40|Participation in School Sport and Post-School Pathways: Evidence from Ireland|We examine the impact of participation in sport at secondary school on post-school pathways using a survey of Irish school-leavers, distinguishing between those who dropped out of sport during their secondary school years and those who continued playing in their final school years. We find that members of this latter group are, on completion of secondary schooling, significantly and substantially more likely to continue their education rather than to join the labour market. This effect survives controlling for individual background traits, school characteristics, attachment to the school and academic achievement. Our results are also robust to the use of propensity score matching to control for selection into participation in sport based on observable characteristics. We relate our findings to previous work on the potential labour market benefits of participation in sport and to the emerging literature on the role of consumption value in educational choice.
J40|Complicating the Labor Market as a Social Institution|Economic analyses of labor markets in the URPE tradition developed several key observations that have challenged mainstream analysis. First was the recognition that production is a social process that enmeshes its participants in conflicted social relationships based on power. Workers and employers meet in labor markets not simply as individuals but as classes. Furthermore, labor markets are segmented systematically by race and gender. The labor process is also divided between productive and unproductive labor. In the context of social structures of accumulation, the labor process and labor markets undergo periodic qualitative changes as capitalism resolves deep crises. These understandings have contributed to challenges to the supposed link between labor productivity and wages and the claimed power of education as a force to dissolve class differences. The paper concludes with a consideration of the role of anti-communism in shaping labor studies in the United States after World War II and a critique of the supposed sharp distinction between positive and normative economics.
J40|Aboriginal Labour Market Information in Canada: An Overview|This report, prepared for the Friendship Centres of Canada, provides a detailed overview and assessment of available sources of labour market information (LMI) on Aboriginal Canadians. The Friendship Centres play a pivotal role in community and economic development by providing training and employment opportunities, facilitating social development, and building human and resource capacity for Aboriginal Canadians. Better labour market information, and better use of existing LMI, can facilitate their work. The three most important sources of LMI for Aboriginal Canadians are the Labour Force Survey, National Household Survey, and Aboriginal Peoples Survey. The report identifies the exclusion of the Aboriginal population living on reserve in all Statistics Canada surveys except the National Household Survey and the Census as the most important lacuna in Canadian Aboriginal labour market information. The report concludes that despite the many gaps, there is a wealth of Aboriginal LMI available in Canada, at the national, regional and local levels, that can be used by Friendship Centres to better develop and target programs and services to the urban Aboriginal population.
J40|Review of Best Practices in Labour Market Forecasting with an Application to the Canadian Aboriginal Population|The Friendship Centres in Canada play a pivotal role in community and economic development by providing training and employment opportunities, facilitating social development, and building human and resource capacity for Aboriginal Canadians. The availability of occupational projections may facilitate the work of the Friendship Centres by providing valuable information concerning future labour market outcomes, allowing their programs to more appropriately prepare Aboriginal Canadians with the required skills, training and education to meet expected labour demand. By surveying the best practices in labour market demand and supply modeling used by national, sub-national and sectoral organizations, this report will help provide a stronger understanding of the potential power of labour market forecasting, while acknowledging the difficulties and obstacles inherent in any projection process. Furthermore, this report will discuss methodologies that could be implemented by the Friendship Centres to estimate the prospective occupational labour supply and demand facing Aboriginal Canadians.
J40|On the employment effects of outward FDI: the case of Spain, 1995-2011| In this article, we analyse the impact on domestic employment resulting from outward FDI performed by Spanish firms, using industry data for the period 1995-2011. Together with the effects on the total employment, we differentiate the effects according to the particular groups of countries and activities to which those FDI outflows are addressed. In addition, the impact of outward FDI on the demand for labour is also analysed separately for high and low skill levels of the labour force.
J40|Global Inequality of Opportunity: How Much of Our Income Is Determined by Where We Live?|Suppose that all people in the world are allocated only two characteristics over which they have (almost) no control: country of residence and income distribution within that country. Assume further that there is no migration. We show that more than one-half of variability in income of world population classified according to their household per capita in 1% income groups (by country) is accounted for by these two characteristics. The role of effort or luck cannot play a large role in explaining the global distribution of individual income. © 2015 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
J40|Entrepreneurship and Urban Growth: An Empirical Assessment with Historical Mines|We study entrepreneurship and growth through the lens of U.S. cities. Initial entrepreneurship correlates strongly with urban employment growth, but endogeneity bedevils interpretation. Chinitz (1961) hypothesized that coal mines near cities led to specialization in industries, like steel, with significant scale economies and that those big firms subsequently damped entrepreneurship across several generations. Proximity to historical mining deposits is associated with reduced entrepreneurship for cities in the 1970s and onward in industries unrelated to mining. We use historical mines as an instrument for our modern entrepreneurship measures and find a persistent link between entrepreneurship and city employment growth. © 2015 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
J40|Investimento em infraestrutura logística, comércio internacional e crescimento econômico de longo prazo: uma análise a partir de simulações computacionais|"The study aims to develop a model of economic growth compatible with Thirlwall's Law (1979). The model originally developed by Thirlwall disregards the lack of infrastructure as a limiting factor to the flow of trade and therefore economic growth. The hypothesis of this study is that the continuous public investment in transport infrastructure is crucial for sustained growth. Thus, we intend to move forward in the theoretical debate introducing the infrastructure gap in the original model. Also, we made numeric simulations in order to test the validity of ""Thirlwall's Law"" as well as identify the impacts of public investment in infrastructure over the long-term growth, in order to propose economic policies to improve the foreign Brazilian trade."
J40|Strong Wage Growth Amidst Rising Unemployment in Bulgaria|The Bulgarian labour market adjustment during the economic crisis stands out by significant job losses, but at the same time strong average wage growth. The predominance of job cuts over wage cuts is most problematic for vulnerable groups, sectors and regions. Wage adjustments have hardly helped limiting unemployment. Strong increases in unit labour costs (ULC) and real effective exchange rates (REER) seem not (yet) to have eroded external competitiveness as exports have remained strong. This can be explained by economic convergence, lower wage growth in tradable sectors and possibly only temporarily favourable export price developments on world markets. Rapid wage growth is influenced by a combination of factors. At first sight the institutional features of the Bulgarian labour market seem rather flexible. Some factors only impact the statistical average even without actual wage increases (like job cuts being concentrated in low paid jobs and a reduction in undeclared wages). However, actual wages have probably also increased, impacted by convergence from the lowest wage levels in the EU, skills and regional mismatches. One of the key features identified in this paper is a unique system of hundreds of different minimum income thresholds across sectors and occupations applied for the calculation of social security taxes. These thresholds are set close to the average wages prevalent in the same sectors and occupations, especially for the low-wage segment where unemployment is also the highest. To minimise the negative implications for employment, the minimum social security thresholds might usefully be reviewed. Recalibration of the thresholds could be combined with a wider set of labour market measures (ALMPs, training and education policies) to improve the employability of crisis-hit employees.
J40|Occupational Tasks and Wage Inequality in West Germany: A Decomposition Analysis|This paper investigates the role of occupational tasks in driving changes in the West German wage structure. Using administrative wage data matched with task data, we run RIF regression-based decompositions to quantify the contribution of cognitive, interactive, and manual tasks to changes in wage inequality from 1978 to 2006. We find that until the 1990s, changing returns to education and experience were driving wage inequality. Occupational tasks started playing a role only in the 1990s. During this period, increasing returns to cognitive tasks widened both upper-tail and lower-tail inequality. Conversely, decreasing returns to manual tasks were uniformly decreasing inequality. Furthermore, in the 2000s, we find an important role for interactive tasks in driving lower-tail inequality.

J40|Search Frictions, Financial Frictions, and Labor Market Fluctuations in Emerging Markets| This article examines the role of the extensive and intensive margins of labor input in the context of a business cycle model with a financial friction. We document significant variation in the hours worked per worker for many emerging-market economies using manufacturing data. Both employment and hours worked per worker are positively correlated with each other and with output. We show that a search-theoretic context in a small open-economy model requires a small wealth effect to explain these regularities at the expense of a smaller wage response. On the other hand, introducing a financial friction in the form of a working capital requirement can explain the observed movements of labor market variables such as employment and hours worked per worker, as well as other distinguishable business cycle characteristics of emerging economies. These include highly volatile and cyclical real wages, labor share, and consumption.
J40|Gender, productivity, and the nature of work and pay: evidence from the late nineteenth-century tobacco industry|" type=""main""> Women have typically been paid less than men throughout history. We investigate earnings in Swedish cigar making around 1900. Strength was unimportant, yet the gender wage gap was large. Differences in characteristics, such as age and experience, and different jobs within firms, account for two-thirds of the gap overall, and the entire gap for piece-rate workers. Firms were as willing to employ women as men in the better-paying piece-rate section, and women were willing to take those jobs. In contrast, discrimination was extensive in the time-rate section. Men in this section benefited from greater outside opportunities and customary wages elsewhere. Theory holds that labour market discrimination will reduce profitability, and make firm survival harder, a proposition that has never been tested historically. We find that cigar firms that feminized their workforces most extensively were most likely to survive. Product market competition prevented firms employing (overpaid) men to any great extent. We argue that economic historians must interpret industry-specific gender wage differentials in the context of workers' outside opportunities, and in the context of product markets, which can—and in this case did—limit firms' room for manoeuvre."
J40|Study On Organizational Pathology And Implications On Human Resources Job Satisfaction, Also On The Employment Of The Labor Market|People need to face the demands resulting induced neurotic styles of their leaders. The result is lower morale, affect behavior, dissatisfaction at work. This paper aims to present the point of view of theoretical and practical implications of failures in the organization on job satisfaction of employees. The practical part of this article is the analysis of statistically labor employment level , and a marketing research field, a survey using questionnaire as the main instrument. The main objectives during the research aims: knowledge labor employment in Romania, identify employee satisfaction on labor relations between managers and subordinates, knowledge of the involvement of the manager in providing a suitable work environment, to determine the extent the problems arising in the workplace creates dissatisfaction which ultimately rebounds on return. The main results drawn as a result of research carried out show that existing pathology in an organization is felt on one side by the employee the aggression and persecution has implications for morale, and on the other hand these disturbances are felt at employment in that workplace, stress employees resign and this leads to higher unemployment.
J40|An Exploratory Analysis of Heterogeneity on Regional Labour Markets and Unemployment Rates in Colombia: An MFACT approach|In this paper we study the structural determinants of differentials in unemployment rates and labour markets’ performance for colombian cities. Following the framework proposed by Elhorst (2003) and using cross-sectional data for 23 metropolitan areas, we apply an extension of a principal axes method proposed by B´ecue-Bertaut and Pag`es (2004, 2008), Multiple Factor Analysis for Multiple Contingency Tables (MFACT), in order to establish unobserved factors that are relevant when disentangling the heterogeneity captured by groups of variables that are considered to explain regional unemployment differentials. Our findings suggest that differences on qualified labour supply levels, participation incentives and age structure are important to understand regional heterogeneity on labour markets and unemployment rates. In addition, we find that cities that display high unemployment rates do not necessarily share the same characteristics, that is, frictions that originate unemployment are not the same across colombian cities.

Para ello se aborda una metodología basada en Batesse y Coelli (1995) que se ajusta al objetivo del estudio en tanto: a) permite explotar la dimensión de datos panel con los que se cuenta, como se explica más adelante, para la estimación de las fronteras estocásticas; b) permite obtener medidas de eficiencia técnica, y c) identifica la posible asociación entre la eficiencia y un conjunto de variables, y en particular, las vinculadas a variables de política como capacitación, crédito y asistencia técnica agropecuaria.
J40|How Far Away Is a Single European Labor Market?|A Single European Labor Market, particularly involving the free movement of workers within Europe, has been a goal of the European community since the 1950s. Whereas it may entail opportunities and drawbacks alike, the benefits – such as greater economic welfare for most citizens – are supposed to outweigh the losses. However, over fifty years after the aim was first established, a Single European Labor Market has not yet been achieved. This paper gives an overview of current European macroeconomic trends, with a particular focus on the Great Recession, and also explores the drivers of and obstacles to labor mobility. Complementarily, it analyzes the results of a unique opinion survey among labor market experts, as well as formulates policy recommendations to enhance mobility. The development of a Single European Labor Market is also discussed in relation to the German model.
J40|Empleo y carreras laborales en el servicio de Correos de España, 1890-1935|This paper studies the organization of the internal labour market of postal services in Spain from 1890 to 1935. The paper discusses the evolution of total employment in relation to postal traffic and average nominal and real wages. The paper then analyses the operation of the internal labour market for civil servants. There is an unsurprising steep wage-age gradient, in line with theories of deferred compensation in large, service firms. Voluntary or disciplinary separations were extremely rare. A career in the postal services offered higher entry wages, a growing wage over the life cycle and a secure job until retirement. There were two downsides to pursuing a career in the postal services. Firstly, entry and promotion depended crucially on the expansion of total employment for administrative personnel, which in turn depended on the fiscal position of the state. Secondly, nominal wages were upward rigid in the event of inflationary episodes, leading to substantial deterioration of real wages during the years of WW1.
J40|Economic Policy in South Africa: Past Present and Future|As the 20th anniversary of the transition to democracy approaches in 2014, the economic policy debates in South Africa are in full flow. The forthcoming Oxford Companion to the Economics of South Africa contributes to the policy and analytical debate by drawing together perspectives on a range of issues – micro, macro, sectoral, country wide and global – from leading economists working on South Africa.
J40|Heimarbeit: immer weniger Menschen in Deutschland gehen ihrem Beruf von zu Hause aus nach|In 2012, almost five million people, or roughly 10 percent of the labor force in Germany, worked from home most or some of the time. Of these home workers, 2.7 million were employees, i.e., eight percent of the labor force. It is primarily highly qualified employees such as managers, academics, lawyers, publicists, engineers, or teachers who work from home; the majority has a university degree. However, there are also a large number of occupations with very few people working from home as the job is largely unsuitable for this mode of work. The discrepancies between men and women or different age groups remain small. In households with children, the mother or father are somewhat more likely to work from home. However, the decisive factor is the occupation itself. At the turn of the millennium, the number of people working from home initially increased, but dropped significantly from 2008 on and has been declining at double-digit rates in almost all professions since then. Yet overall employment in Germany has increased, as has the percentage of employees working from home in the European Union as a whole. Compared with other EU countries, Germany is somewhat below average when it comes to home working; in Scandinavia, and the remaining western and central European states, working from home is far more widespread. Knapp fünf Millionen Erwerbstätige haben ihren Beruf im Jahr 2012 hauptsächlich oder gelegentlich zu Hause ausgeübt. Das entspricht zwölf Prozent aller Erwerbstätigen. Davon waren 2,7 Millionen abhängig beschäftigt - acht Prozent aller Arbeitnehmer. Vor allem hoch qualifizierte Arbeitnehmer wie Manager, Wissenschaftler, Juristen, Publizisten, Ingenieure oder Lehrer arbeiten in den eigenen vier Wänden; die Mehrheit hat einen Hochschulabschluss. Es gibt jedoch auch viele Berufsgruppen, in denen sehr wenige Beschäftigte ihrem Job von zu Hause aus nachgehen, da sich ihre Tätigkeiten kaum dazu eignen. Die Unterschiede zwischen Männern und Frauen oder verschiedenen Altersgruppen sind gering. Leben Kinder im Haus, arbeiten Vater oder Mutter etwas häufiger von zu Hause aus. Entscheidend aber ist der jeweilige Beruf. Nachdem es nach der Jahrtausendwende zunächst immer mehr Heimarbeiter gab, ging ihre Zahl ab 2008 in fast allen Berufsgruppen mit zweistelligen Raten zurück. Die Beschäftigung insgesamt nahm hingegen zu. Anders als in Deutschland ist der Anteil zu Hause berufstätiger Arbeitnehmer in der Europäischen Union gestiegen. Im EU-Vergleich bewegt sich die Bundesrepublik bei der häuslichen Erwerbstätigkeit im unteren Mittelfeld; in Skandinavien, den westeuropäischen und übrigen mitteleuropäischen Staaten ist sie weitaus stärker verbreitet.
J40|Economics of co-authorship|Starting with the literature on the rising incidence of co-authorship in economics, this paper presents a theoretical model to analyze choices of co-authorship based on the assumption that authors are motivated to optimize the returns to publications. The model analyzes two pay structures, one that is proportional to the number of authors, and one that is not. The heterogeneity of the researchers implies for the policy-maker a trade-off between the objective of maximizing effort and that of selecting better researchers. The trade-off is more relevant when low-quality researchers choose opportunistic behavior in order to collaborate with high-quality researchers.
J40|Looking beyond the bridge: The effect of temporary agency employment on labor market outcomes|We perform a comprehensive analysis of the stepping-stone effect of temporary agency employment on unemployed workers. Using the timing-of-events approach, we investigate not only whether agency employment is a bridge into regular employment but also its effect on post-unemployment wages and job stability for unemployed Danish workers. We find evidence of large positive treatment effects, particularly for immigrants and for individuals considered less employable. Our results show that agency employment is in tendency effective in tight labor markets, where firms use agency employment primarily to screen potential candidates for regular posts. Finally, our results suggest that agency employment may improve subsequent match quality in terms of wages.
J40|The link between unemployment and labor force participation rates in Japan: A regional perspective|This paper explores the co-integrating relationship between unemployment and the labor force participation rate in Japan from a regional perspective. The univariate co-integration tests indicate that the “no co-integration” hypothesis cannot be rejected in Northern-Kanto, Hokuriku and Kyusyu. Because the univariate co-integration approach might suffer from low power we employed a panel version of the co-integration test recently developed by Westerlund (2006) that also considers the possibility of multiple structural breaks in the level of individual co-integrating equations. The test results lend support for an overwhelmingly long-run relationship between the two variables across regions. Accordingly, this finding is not in line with the unemployment invariance hypothesis. As a result a nationally orientated employment policy aimed at improving the unemployment and labor force participation rates might be preferred over a region-specific employment policy in Japan.
J40|Linguistic barriers in the destination language acquisition of immigrants|There are various degrees of similarity between the languages of different immigrants and the language of their destination country. This linguistic distance is an obstacle to the acquisition of a language, which leads to large differences in the attainments of the language skills necessary for economic and social integration in the destination country. This study aims at quantifying the influence of linguistic distance on the language acquisition of immigrants in the US and in Germany. Drawing from comparative linguistics, we derive a measure of linguistic distance based on the automatic comparison of pronunciations. We compare this measure with three other linguistic and non-linguistic approaches in explaining self-reported measures of language skills. We show that there is a strong initial disadvantage from the linguistic origin for language acquisition, while the effect on the steepness of assimilation patterns is ambiguous in Germany and the US.
J40|Neo-mercantilism, inequality, financialisation and the euro crises|This paper considers three aspects of the euro zone crises. It begins by a discussion of the roles of current account imbalances and the pursuit of neo-mercantilist type policies particularly by Germany. It then moves on to the ways in which inequality has played a role in the crisis, and in particular the role of ‘structural reforms’ in the labour market and elsewhere as the perceived route out of crisis but which will likely generated further inequality. In the final main section some of the developments in the financial sector are related with the euro crisis.
J40|Immigration & Ideas: What Did Russian Scientists 'Bring' to the US?|"This paper examines how high-skilled immigrants contribute to knowledge diffusion using a rich dataset of Russian scientists and US citations to Soviet-era publications. Analysis of a panel of US cities and scientific fields shows that citations to Soviet-era work increased significantly with the arrival of immigrants. A difference-in-differences analysis with matched paper-pairs also shows that after Russian scientists moved to the US, citations to their Soviet-era papers increased relative to control papers. Both strategies reveal scientific field-specific effects. Ideas in high-impact papers and papers previously accessible to US scientists were the most likely to ""spill over"" to natives."
J40|Antecedents And Consequences Of Organizational Commitment Among Russian University Teachers|The aim of this study is to examine the specific antecedents and consequences of the commitment of university teachers to their university. Academia has specific features that distinguish universities from other types of organizations: universities have the opportunity to hire their own graduates (academic inbreeding); university teachers are able to work in several higher education institutions or combine teaching with work in business; university teachers have the opportunity to combine several professional roles (teaching, administrative work, research, etc.); university teachers have several options to change their job; publication activity is an important indicator of the efficiency and competitiveness of university teachers. This study is an online survey of 317 teachers of different disciplines from several types of state higher education institutions from different regions of Russia. The results of the regression analysis show that antecedents of affective commitment include belonging to a group of insiders (working in university from which they graduated), having an additional administrative position, role clarity, and role conflict. Structural equation modelling shows that an additional administrative position had a direct positive effect and an indirect negative effect (through role conflict) on the affective commitment to the university. Having work experience at another university predicts only a normative commitment to the university. The affective component of commitment to the university was a better negative predictor of the intention to leave the position, profession and institution. No components of the commitment predict publication activity.
J40|Lifetime Inequality Measures For An Emerging Economy: The Case of Chile|Cross-section and lifetime measures of inequality are different. While the latter reflects long run resources available to individuals, the former does not. This emphasizes the dynamic dimension of inequality. Many studies have analyzed and compared economies using this lifetime perspective, however, they all focus on the United States, Canada or Europe. Since the literature is scarce for emerging economies, this paper seeks to fill this gap focusing on the analysis of lifetime inequality for an emerging economy using a search-theoretic framework. The model, which is structurally estimated with Chilean data, uses career simulations to construct lifetime measures of inequality. A set of experiments are also performed to isolate the mobility and distribution effects on inequality, the marginal effect on inequality of individual parameters, and the importance of the different ages. Results indicate that inequality is not only high in a cross-section perspective, but also in a lifetime perspective. Low mobility is the main source of lifetime inequality in the Chilean labor market being the older workers who experience the lowest degree of mobility. Finally, regulation of the labor market is important because it affects the degree of mobility in the labor market.
J40|Between Light and Shadow: Informality in the Russian Labour Market|Economic growth in Russia in the first decade of this century almost doubled the country's GDP but was accompanied by substantial reallocation of labor to the unregulated sector while formal employment was on gradual decline. The paper overviews evolution of the Russian labour market during the period of 2000-10 and discusses most general implications of informality to employment and earnings as well as the associated political economy challenges and consequences.

J40|Selective Firing and Lemons|This paper uses the Austrian Social Security Register (ASSD) to explore what information firms infer from the three common types of displacement: individual layoffs, individuals displaced due to a closure and individuals displaced due to a mass layoff. I bring together two strands of the literature, namely signaling and sorting and contribute to it in three ways. First I test whether the individual layoffs are the least productive, second I investigate whether individual layoffs are perceived as “lemons” (with a specific focus on the high ability individuals) and third I raise the question whether the “lemon” exists in the resulting matching pattern. Using the Abowd et al. (1999) model I show that the individual layoffs are the least productive measured by the person fixed effect. I confirm the signaling argument of Gibbons and Katz (1991) that individual layoffs are perceived as “lemons” also for high ability individuals, but I reject the argument of Gibbons and Katz (1991) against the matching model (Becker, 1973). Using three different measures of sorting, I find that the matching changes differentially for the different layoff groups. This leads to the tentative conclusion that both sorting and signaling take place after an individual job loss.
J40|Informal Employment in Russia: Definitions, Incidence, Determinants and Labour Market Segmentation|"This paper takes stock of informal employment in Russia analysing its incidence and determinants. Using the regular 2003-11 waves and an informality supplement of the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS) it develops several measures of informal employment and demonstrates that the incidence varies widely across the different definitions. We also show that the determinants of informal employment are roughly stable across the different measures: workers who are males, relatively young, unskilled and employed in construction and trade and related services have a higher likelihood to have an informal job. We also take a look at the issue of labour market segmentation along the informal-formal divide by estimating an informal-formal wage gap at the means and across the entire wage distributions. We find only weak evidence for labour market segmentation in Russia when estimating an informal-formal wage gap for salaried workers at the mean. The results of quantile regressions show a wage penalty in the lower half of the distribution and no gap in the upper half for informal employees. In contrast, informal self-employed and entrepreneurs have conditional mean wages that are higher than the mean wages for the formally employed. Across the entire wage distribution, however, we find a negative wage gap in the lowest quartile and a strongly positive wage gap in the highest quartile, pointing to a segmented informal sector with a lower free entry tier and an upper rationed tier. This Working Paper relates to the 2014 OECD Economic Survey of the Russian Federation (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/russia). L'emploi informel en Russie : Définitions, incidence, déterminants et segmentation du marché du travail Ce document de travail propose un bilan sur l'emploi informel en Russie et analyse son incidence et ses déterminants. En utilisant les données régulières 2003-11 et un supplément sur l'informalité de l'Enquête ""Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey"" (RLMS), nous suggérons plusieurs mesures de l'emploi informel et démontrons que l'incidence varie considérablement selon les différentes définitions. Nous montrons également que les déterminants de l'emploi informel sont à peu près stables avec les différentes mesures: les travailleurs hommes, relativement jeunes, non qualifiés et employés dans la construction et le commerce et les services connexes ont une probabilité plus élevée d'avoir un emploi informel. Nous examinons également la question de la segmentation du marché du travail en terme de division entre marché formel et informel en estimant l'écart de salaire entre secteurs en moyenne et sur l'ensemble de la distribution des salaires. Nous ne trouvons que de faibles signes de segmentation du marché du travail en Russie pour l'estimation à la moyenne. Les résultats des régressions par quantile montrent une pénalité salariale pour les employés informels dans la moitié inférieure de la distribution et pas de différence dans la moitié supérieure. En revanche, les indépendants et les entrepreneurs du secteur informel ont des salaires moyens conditionnels plus élevés que les salaires moyens pour l'emploi formel. Sur l'ensemble de la distribution des salaires, cependant, nous constatons un écart salarial négatif dans le quartile inférieur et un écart salarial fortement positive dans le quartile le plus élevé, indiquant un secteur informel segmenté avec libre entrée dans le bas et du rationnement dans le haut. Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l’Étude économique de l’OCDE 2014 sur la Fédération de Russie (www.oecd.org/etudes/russie)."
J40|Overcoming Vulnerability of Unemployment Insurance Schemes|Unemployment insurance is a key tool for risk sharing and redistribution and also a prominent automatic stabiliser. It is a volatile spending item by design, which can lead to vulnerabilities. This paper explores various shocks and sources of vulnerability of the unemployment insurance schemes of OECD and BRIICS countries. Policies that boost both financial resilience and benefit adequacy as well as policy trade-offs are explored. Four country clusters are identified with key similarities in the overall policy mix that can shed light on why some countries boast generous benefits and at the same time display high economic efficiency, while other countries face a much more pronounced trade-off. Surmonter les vulnérabilités des systèmes d'assurance chômage L’assurance chômage est un instrument clé de mutualisation des risques et de redistribution, et c’est aussi un stabilisateur automatique majeur. C’est, fondamentalement, un poste de dépenses volatile, ce qui peut entraîner des vulnérabilités. Ce document examine divers chocs et sources de vulnérabilité pour les systèmes d’assurance chômage des pays de l’OCDE et pays BRIICS. Les politiques de nature à améliorer à la fois la résilience financière et le caractère suffisant des prestations, ainsi que les choix à opérer, y sont examinés. Quatre groupes de pays présentant d’importantes similitudes de par l’éventail des politiques mises en oeuvre y sont identifiés, ce qui permet de mieux comprendre pourquoi certains pays enregistrent à la fois des prestations généreuses et de faibles inégalités de revenu en même temps qu’un haut niveau d’efficience économique, tandis que, dans d’autres, ces situations apparaissent beaucoup plus difficiles à concilier.
J40|Reforming Korea's Migration Policy|In the era of globalization, the notion of the migrant worker is not an unfamiliar one, albeit not a welcomed notion by countries intent on maintaining the semblance of a homogeneous society. As one of the earlier industrialized countries in East Asia, the Republic of Korea experienced firsthand the benefits of having migrant workers. It would certainly not be an understatement to state that the migrant worker has played an integral role in helping the Korean economy recover from the Asian economic crisis in the late 1990s and sustain itself in recent years. With the number of migrant workers only expected to grow in years to come, the impact of the migrant worker on Korean society will no longer be economical, but also social, political, and cultural. No longer is the migrant worker a temporary solution to overcome labor shortages but rather, it is, and has become a permanent part of today's Korean society. It would therefore seem imperative that the Korean government devise long-term strategies as to how it will address these issues. This paper seeks to highlight the emergence and evolution of the migrant worker in the Republic of Korea, discuss consequences and implications for Korea's continued migration policy, and make recommendations for reforming Korea's migration policy.
J40|Income Insecurity, Job Insecurity and the Drift towards Self-employment in SSA|This study contributes to the explanation to growing informality by proposing and testing a simple framework that link income insecurity to the proliferation of informal enterprise through job insecurity in selected SSA countries. The study adopted a quantitative approach and used ANOVA analysis to analyze a uniform firm level data on informal enterprises in Ghana, Kenya and the DRC. The analyses suggested that income insecurity exist in the form of significant seasonal variations in sales returns. Enterprises that employ more than one worker, on the average, cut employment significantly during the slowest months as compared to employment in the busiest months. Thus a link is established between income insecurity and job insecurity which deters the informal enterprises from increasing permanent employment and hence remains small overtime. Instead firms resort to casual workers and unpaid workers to facilitate production. The insecurity in the informal sector paid employment drive paid employees into self-employment after learning the employer’s trade and hence multiply the number of enterprises in a locality which in turn keep returns fairly normal in the sector. The major recommendation of that study is that owners of informal enterprises must be regulated in their current jobs and assisted to build capacity to deal with sales variations and other employment uncertainty after which the demand for formality and growth in decent employment shall be a natural course of action to the firms.
J40|Longitudinal Evidence of Firm Size Effect on Wage Premium and Wage Differential in Korean Labor Market|This study analyzes the firm size effect on wage determinant mechanism and wage differential between large firms and small firms. The empirical methodology, based on Fixed Effect estimation, Probit estimation and Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition estimation, be utilized to measure wage determinant factors exclude unobservable characteristics heterogeneity and permits to obtain endowment or discrimination proportion of wage gap. Firm size wage premium mostly be attributed to efficiency wage, compensation wage differential, skill complementarity, monitoring cost, prevent union organization, rent sharing and internal market. However, there are no completely explanatory for firm size wage premium. Estimated results suggest that more educated employees are easily to find in large firms, it is consistent with the hypothesis that higher wages paid by large firms can be explained by efficiency theory. Endowment differential is main reason for wage gap between large firms and small firms. Employees have lower turnover rate in large firms than small firms. This phenomenon can be explained by internal labor market theory which means employees have higher probability of promotion and higher costs of turnover in large firms.

J40|Convergence Across Provincial Economies in Canada: Trends, Drivers, and Implications|Canada has long been characterized by significant regional disparities. Such inequalities can create and exacerbate regional tensions and lead to demands for further redistribution of wealth. The objective of this study is to report on the current state of provincial differences in twenty-five economic variables related to income, productivity, the labour market, well-being and fiscal capacity, and to analyze trends toward or away from convergence for these economic variables. This report also examines the factors influencing these trends and discusses the implications for the federation.
J40|Adjusting the Labour Supply to Mitigate Violent Shocks: Evidence from Rural Colombia| We study the use of labour markets to mitigate the impact of violent shocks on households in rural areas. Because the incidence of violent shocks is not exogenous, the analysis uses instrumental variables. As a response to violent shocks men decrease the time they devote to off-farm agricultural activities and increase off-farm non-agricultural activities, while women decrease their leisure time and increase the time they devote to household chores and childcare. Labour markets appear unable to fully absorb the additional labour supply. Policies in conflict-affected countries should aim to prevent labour markets from collapsing.
J40|R&D Subsidies and Company Performance: Evidence from Geographic Variation in Government Funding Based on the ERDF Population-Density Rule|Despite the prevalence of R&D support programs, evaluation studies based on explicit differences in support allocation are rare. In this paper, the identification of the causal effect of R&D support on company performance is based on geographic variation in government funding arising from a population-density rule. I find positive impacts on R&D investment, employment, and sales among the participants who were granted an R&D subsidy as a result of additional aggregate R&D support funding in their region. Although there are no instantaneous impacts on productivity, the study provides evidence of long-term productivity gains. © 2014 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
J40|Anmerkungen zum Monopson am Arbeitsmarkt II|Der vorliegende Beitrag untersucht für den Fall eines sowie für den Fall zweier variabler Produktionsfaktoren, wie sich Mindestlöhne im nicht diskriminierenden Monopson auf Beschäftigung bzw. Kapitalintensität auswirken. Dabei kann der Mindestlohn in Höhe des hypothetischen Konkurrenzlohns oder in Höhe der Grenzkosten der Arbeit oder schließlich noch darüber liegen. Von besonderem Interesse ist die Situation mit zwei variablen Produktionsfaktoren: Es stellt sich eine nicht-lineare Budgetrestriktion ein und es können - neben der 'reinen Monopsonlösung' - drei weitere mögliche Betriebsoptima bestimmt werden. Alle vier Lösungen werden unter Verwendung einer Cobb-Douglas-Produktionsfunktion numerisch exakt bestimmt. Anschließend wird die theoretische Analyse noch verfeinert, indem eine CES-Produktionsfunktion unterstellt wird. Auch hier existiert eine exakte Lösung für das Monopson. In der Regel lassen sich aber die Lösungsbedingungen nur implizit und über geeignete Näherungsverfahren bestimmen. Es wird gezeigt, wie hoch ein Mindestlohn ausfallen muss, damit die vom Monopsonisten gewählte Kapitalintensität höher ausfällt als diejenige, die er im unreglementierten Monopson wählt. Schließlich wird in einer Sensitivitätsanalyse gezeigt, wie stark sich die Variation des Parameters μ aus der CES-Funktion auf die Optimallösung beim Monopson auswirkt. Für die wirtschaftspolitische Diskussion um das Für und Wider von Mindestlöhnen zeigt sich, dass Mindestlöhne tendenziell existierende Monopsone auf dem Arbeitsmarkt stabilisieren, dass für die Abschätzung der Beschäftigungseffekte von Mindestlöhnen keine Aussagen ohne Kenntnis der Substitutionselastizitäten möglich sind, und dass es von der Höhe des gewählten Mindestlohns letztlich abhängt, ob ein Monopsonist am Arbeitsmarkt seine bisherige Kapitalintensität beibehält, senkt oder sogar erhöht. Darüber hinaus wäre zu prüfen, ob die ins Feld geführten Beschäftigungsvorteile des Mindestlohns bei Vorliegen eines Monopsons sich nicht besser mit marktgerechten Instrumenten (Besteuerung des Monopsonisten und/oder Subventionierung des Arbeitsangebots) erreichen lassen.
J40|Role of Non-Farm Sector in Sustaining Rural Livelihoods in Punjab| The role of non-farm sector has been examined in promoting rural livelihoods in the state of Punjab, especially of the landless and marginal farm households who are often poor and derive a sizeable proportion of their income from non-farm activities. The non-farm income sources have been found to contribute towards reduction in income inequality. Owing to their lower level of education, lack of skills and capital, these households are engaged in relatively less-remunerative activities. The determinants of participation in non-farm activities have been identified and it has been found that larger family size, higher dependency ratio, small landholdings and social backwardness motivate farm households to participate more in the non-farm sector. Improvement in education and skills and creation of productive assets are crucial for enhancing their participation in more remunerative income-generating non-farm activities.
J40|Agricultural Labour Market Flexibility in the EU and Candidate Countries|Factor markets that function well are a crucial condition for the competitiveness and growth of agriculture. Institutions and regulation may give rise to agricultural labour market heterogeneity, which could have important effects on the functioning of the labour market and other agricultural factor markets in EU member states. This paper first defines the institutional framework for the labour market, and then presents a brief literature review of previous studies of labour market institutional frameworks. Based on the literature, a survey to characterise agricultural labour markets was undertaken, which was implemented for a selection of EU27 and EU candidate countries, with responses based on expert opinion. The survey data were then used to construct indices of labour market flexibility/rigidity for the countries examined. These indices were used to make inter-country labour market comparisons and to draw inferences about the institutions and functioning of the agricultural labour market.
J40|Agricultural Labour Market Flexibility in the EU and Candidate Countries: Paper| Well functioning factor markets are a crucial condition for the competitiveness and growth of agriculture. In the case of labour, institutions and regulation may give rise to agricultural labour market heterogeneity which could have important effects on the functioning of the labour market and other agricultural factor markets in EU Member States. At the same time, the functioning of the labour market and markets for other factors of production are influenced by changes in agriculture and the rural economy and in EU policies. This paper first defines the institutional framework for the labour market. Following on from this a brief literature review of previous studies of labour market institutional frameworks is presented. The paper identifies the most important elements of the labour market institutional framework to be further analysed. Based on the literature, a survey to characterise the agricultural labour markets was undertaken. This survey was implemented for a selection of EU27 and EU candidate countries, with responses based upon expert opinion. In turn the survey data was used to construct indices of labour market flexibility/rigidity for the countries examined. These indices were then used to make inter-country labour market comparisons and to draw inferences about the institutions and functioning of the agricultural labour market.

J40|The determinants of lifelong learning incidence across European countries (evidence from EU-SILC dataset)|The aim of this paper is to explore the potential of EU-SILC data to deepen our understanding of the determinants of workers’ formal lifelong learning (LLL) incidence in Europe. To this purpose, a twofold procedure is adopted here: first, LLL incidence is estimated for the total number of men and women taken separately, regardless of their country of residence; second, the information on the country where they live is taken into account and 21 country-specific equations are computed. Again, this is made for both sexes. This procedure allows us to shed light on cross-country gender differences. In the whole sample, our results show that for both men and women formal LLL incidence is significantly higher among young, better-educated, part-time and temporary workers, and lower among those who changed their job in the preceding year, are employed in small firms and have low-skilled occupations. When the above-mentioned separate equations are estimated for each country and for both sexes, relevant results emerge in the case of Scandinavian countries. Those results seem to be consistent with the implementation of the well-known “flexicurity” policy.
J40|Apprenticeship Training and Early Labor Market Outcomes in East and West Germany|We study the returns to apprenticeship and vocational training for three early labor market outcomes all measured at age 25 for East and West German youths: non-employment (i.e., unemployment or out of the labor force), permanent fulltime employment, and wages. We find strong positive effects of apprenticeship and vocational training. There are no significant differences for different types of vocational training, minor differences between East and West Germany and males and females, and no significant changes in the returns over time. Instrumental variable estimations confirm the regression results. The positive returns hold up even in poor labor market situations.
J40|Social Networks In The Boardroom|This paper provides empirical evidence consistent with the facts that (1) social networks may strongly affect board composition and (2) social networks may be detrimental to corporate governance. Our empirical investigation relies on a large dataset on executives and outside directors of corporations listed on the Paris stock exchange over the 1992-2003 period. This data source is a matched employer employee dataset providing both detailed information on directors/CEOs and information on the firm employing them. We first find a very strong and robust correlation between the CEO's network and that of his directors. Networks of former high ranking civil servants are the most active in shaping board composition. Our identification strategy takes into account (1) firm and directors' fixed effects and (2) matching of firms and director along one observable and one unobservable characteristic. We then turn to real effects of such network activity. We find that firms where these networks are most active are less likely to change CEO when they underperform. This suggests that social networks in the board room impair corporate governance.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

Nemecko voči pracovníkom z týchto krajín, označovaných ako EÚ 8, využilo maximálne 7-ročné prechodné obdobie, počas ktorého postupne otváralo pracovný trh až po jeho úplnú liberalizáciu. Autori prechádzajú od krátkeho historického úvodu cez situáciu na pracovnom trhu po roku 2004, predstavujú prognózy a scenáre vývoja po otvorení pracovného trhu v máji 2011 a aktuálne výsledky mapujúce stav na trhu práce v Nemecku dva roky po jeho otvorení.
J40|La reproducción de las cooperativas de agricultura familiar y economía solidaria: el caso de la unión nacional de cooperativas de la agricultura familiar y economía solidaria (UNICAFES)|Uno de los desafíos de las investigaciones sobre el rural brasileño es construir diagnósticos que evalúen la complejidad de las bases sociales y culturales donde ellos son desarrollados. Este texto presenta un diagnóstico de los principales desafíos enfrentados por las cooperativas de agricultura familiar vinculadas a la Unión Nacional y a los movimientos sociales de los agricultores familiares creados en 2005. En Brasil las cooperativas surgieron al inicio del siglo XX, no obstante, a pesar de su importancia para el desarrollo, la participación de ellas en la economía y en la sociedad brasileña es aún muy pequeña comparada con otras naciones, las iniciativas de cooperativas de agricultura familiar y economía solidaria fueron descuidadas por el modelo adoptado en el país desde los años de 1970, de esta manera para enfrentar dicho problema, sectores populares vinculados a los movimientos sociales de la agricultura familiar crearon la UNICAFES, entidad que articulaba y organizaba las experiencias productivas de la economía popular que estaban siendo creadas en todo el territorio nacional y no encontraban apoyo en el cooperativismo tradicional. Este artículo presenta el resultado de los análisis realizados del cooperativismo solidario en Brasil en los últimos cinco años.
J40|The market for CEOs: An empirical analysis|We investigate empirically a market-based explanation for the rise in recent years in external CEO hiring and compensation and find, consistent with the market-based theory, that firms in industries relying on general managerial skills are more likely to hire CEOs externally than firms in industries relying less on such skills. We show that firms relying on internal CEOs have on average higher profits than external-CEO firms and that the difference in profits decreases as general skills become more important in the industry. We relate managerial skills to compensation and show that CEO general skills induce better firm performance and higher compensation.
J40|Entrepreneurs, institutional entrepreneurship and institutional change|"The intersection of entrepreneurship research and institutional theory has begun to attract increasing scholarly attention. While much recent research has studied ""institutional entrepreneurs"" credited with creating new or transforming existing institutions to support their projects, less attention has been paid to the institutions that constitute the menus from which choices are made, and delineate resources for entrepreneurial or other agentic activities. While models of institutionalization frequently break down the process into different categorical stages, how an evolving context affords changing agentic latitude for actors merits more attention. We study the institutionalization of 'temporary work', a new employment practice led by temporary work organizations, a new organizational form in the Netherlands from the 1960s to 2008. Our account suggests an 'ecological' imagery of institutionalization; rather than entrepreneurs' with predetermined agendas shaping and reshaping institutions, we observed distributed institutional entrepreneurship – entrepreneurs seeking change in concert and in conflict with other interdependent actors simultaneously creating, disrupting and maintaining institutions. By examining how an evolving context influences the role of ""actor configurations"", whose actions, interactions and counteractions can collectively lead to change, but also unintended outcomes, we highlight the non-teleological nature of institutionalization. Finally, our findings suggest that while the legitimacy of a novel practice grows with increasing institutionalization, legitimacy contests may recur and that increasing institutionalization may provide the backdrop for novel practices to emerge."
J40|Agricultural Labour Market Flexibility in the EU and Candidate Countries| Factor markets that function well are a crucial condition for the competitiveness and growth of agriculture. Institutions and regulation may give rise to agricultural labour market heterogeneity, which could have important effects on the functioning of the labour market and other agricultural factor markets in EU member states. This paper first defines the institutional framework for the labour market, and then presents a brief literature review of previous studies of labour market institutional frameworks. Based on the literature, a survey to characterise agricultural labour markets was undertaken, which was implemented for a selection of EU27 and EU candidate countries, with responses based on expert opinion. The survey data were then used to construct indices of labour market flexibility/rigidity for the countries examined. These indices were used to make inter-country labour market comparisons and to draw inferences about the institutions and functioning of the agricultural labour market.

J40|The effect of local labour market conditions on educational choices: a cross country comparison|The present paper argues that we are witnessing an increase of the tensions between the three main goals of social security systems (poverty alleviation, securing living standards and prevention) and that, as a consequence, the poverty-reducing capacity of social transfers has come under pressure. The paper focuses on the working age population in 25 EU countries and on the good years before the crisis. Three different data sources are used: ECHP, its successor EU-SILC and the German SOEP. The paper augments the traditional pre-post approach by considering more direct policy indicators such as spending levels, observed average benefit levels and theoretical tax benefit packages and by focussing on the distinction between work-poor and work-rich households. We find that in many countries the relative decline in poverty reduction has primarily affected work-poor households. This observation is confirmed by more direct policy indicators. It may support the hypothesis that in many countries the poverty alleviation function of social protection has come under pressure as a consequence of a shift of attention towards preventing benefit dependency by recommodification on the one hand and ‘securing living standards’ for working families on the other hand.
J40|Migration and Increasing Wage Inequality: Can Imperfect Competition Explain the Link?|In this paper, we test two hypotheses as regarding potential effects of domestic and international migration on wage inequality. One related to the possibility of wage competition, and another alternative hypothesis related to fixed set-up costs and indivisibilities for different types of industries within the local labour market. Using detailed information on Swedish local labour markets, derived from Swedish full population data, for 1993 and 2003, a panel model of percent changes in inequality is estimated. Thereby controlling for local level fixed effects as well as other competing explanations, the results suggest that positive net migration may affect income dispersion regardless of possible negative wage competition.
J40|Workplace Heterogeneity and the Rise of West German Wage Inequality| We study the role of establishment-specific wage premiums in generating recent increases in West German wage inequality. Models with additive fixed effects for workers and establishments are fit into four subintervals spanning the period from 1985 to 2009. We show that these models provide a good approximation to the wage structure and can explain nearly all of the dramatic rise in West German wage inequality. Our estimates suggest that the increasing dispersion of West German wages has arisen from a combination of rising heterogeneity between workers, rising dispersion in the wage premiums at different establishments, and increasing assortativeness in the assignment of workers to plants. In contrast, the idiosyncratic job-match component of wage variation is small and stable over time. Decomposing changes in mean wages between different education groups, occupations, and industries, we find that increasing plant-level heterogeneity and rising assortativeness in the assignment of workers to establishments explain a large share of the rise in inequality along all three dimensions.

J40|Re-defining Informal Employment and Measuring its Determinants: Evidence from Russia|Informal activities impact countries' economic development and overall growth. However, studying informal employment is not easy and it is crucial to provide a valid definition of it. This paper contributes to the recent discussion of the measures of informality by taking advantage of a rich dataset on Russia over the period 2003 - 2011, that is before and after the economic downturn, together with a special supplement on informality that allows to construct different measures of informal employment and to analyze its determinants. We demonstrate that the incidence of informal employment varies across the different definitions. However, the determinants of informal employment are roughly stable across the different measures as long as we exclude firm size as a criterion. We also show that risk-averse individuals, as expected, are less likely to select themselves into informal employment.
J40|Sorting via Screening versus Signaling: A Theoretic and Experimental Comparison|Similar to Kübler et al. (2008, GEB 64, p. 219-236), we compare sorting in games with asymmetric incomplete information theoretically and experimentally. Rather than distinguishing two very different sequential games, we use the same game format and capture the structural difference of screening and signaling only via their payoff specification. The experiment thus relies on the same verbal instructions. Although the equilibrium outcomes coincide, greater efficiency losses off the equilibrium play due to sorting under signaling, compared to screening, is predicted and confirmed experimentally.
J40|You Are Who Your Friends Are: An Experiment on Trust and Homophily in Friendship Networks|We study the existence of homophily (i.e. the tendency for people to make friends with people who are similar to themselves) with respect to trustworthiness. We ask whether two friends show similarly trustworthy behavior towards strangers, and whether this is anticipated by outsiders. We develop a simple model of bayesian learning in trust games and test the derived hypotheses in a controlled laboratory environment. In the experiment, two trustees sequentially play a trust game with the same trustor, where the trustees depending on treatmen are either friends or strangers to each other. We affirm the existence of homophily with re- spect to trustworthiness. Trustors' beliefs about the trustees' trustfulness are not affected by the knowledge about the (non-)existent friendship between the trustees. Behaviorally, however, they indirectly reciprocate the (un-)trustworthy behavior of one trustee towards his/her friends in later interactions.

This paper reviews research on the integrate between religion and work by examining issues of concept, definition, measurement, and reviewing research that examines the relationship of work and religion with respect to: different times, types of people, organize human interactions and sources of knowledge. We then discuss the methodological requirement for reintegrating work studies into social institutional theory and indicate what the conceptual payoffs of such integration might be. These payoffs include breaking new conceptual ground, resolving theoretical puzzles and envisioning the nature of new social institutions Copyright Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2013

J40|Private Returns to Education in Urban Cameroon|Earlier studies on the impact of education on earnings highlighted a declining pattern of the private returns in developing countries. However, recent research has argued that failing to account for the segmented structure of the labour market could be misleading. This study aims to estimate private returns to education in Cameroon, focusing on how they vary across the different segments of the Cameroon labour market. The data used in this study are drawn from the 2005 Employment and Informal Sector Survey, which is nationally representative and comprehensive survey providing information over 8,540 households and 38,599 individuals around the country. The estimation of wage equations corrected from selectivity bias reveals that there are convex rates of return to education in all the segments of the labour market. As far as the private sector is concerned, it is found that those who graduated from primary school earn no returns compared to those who never attended school. The fact that only degrees are rewarded on the Cameroon labour market evidences the existence of a sheepskin effect in Cameroon and may serve as a confirmation of the signalling role of education in this context.
J40|The Process of Wage Adjustment: An Analysis Using Establishment-Level Data|This article presents a study of the influences on the factors that shape wage adjustments. The cost of living, comparability with other firms' wages, the fulfilment of collective agreements at sector level, the need to recruit and retain employees, the performance of the organisation, and the climate of industrial relations are included as factors of interest. The analysis was carried out using a sample of Spanish manufacturing plants. Our results show that the structural characteristics of the establishment such as its size or foreign ownership, as well as the wage setting arrangements and trade unions, play a role in explaining the importance of the factors mentioned in shaping wage adjustments. The human resource management policies adopted by the employer seem to be less relevant, although the qualification of workers and the use of pay for performance have a significant impact on the process of wage adjustment.
J40|Youth Labour Market Performance in Spain and its Determinants: A Micro-Level Perspective|This paper provides both descriptive and empirical evidence about the main youth labour market problems in Spain. Using the experiences of other EU economies as a benchmark, we document the performance of Spain as regards a wide set of youth labour market dimensions. These include employment and unemployment rates, youth wages, decisions to work and study, youth mobility, type of employment contract, time to find a first job, skill mismatch, etc. Cross-country econometric evidence from different micro-datasets is reported to understand the role played by several underlying supply/demand factors which might explain the difficulties faced by the Spanish youth labour market (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/Spain). L'insertion des jeunes sur le marché du travail espagnol : résultats et facteurs déterminants - une perspective microéconomique Le présent document apporte des éléments descriptifs et empiriques sur les problèmes principaux auxquels sont confrontés les jeunes sur le marché du travail en Espagne. Nous comparons les résultats de l'Espagne avec ceux d’autres États membres de l’UE au regard de multiples indicateurs de l’emploi des jeunes, notamment les taux d’emploi et de chômage, le salaire des jeunes actifs, les décisions relatives au travail et aux études, la mobilité des jeunes, les types de contrat de travail, la durée nécessaire pour trouver un premier emploi, l’inadéquation des compétences, etc. Des données économétriques internationales, tirées de plusieurs micro-bases de données, sont utilisées pour mieux comprendre le rôle joué par plusieurs facteurs sous-jacents de l’offre et de la demande pouvant expliquer les difficultés du marché du travail des jeunes en Espagne (www.oecd.org/eco/etudes/Espagne).
J40|Labour Market Analysis using Time Series Models: Russia 1999-2011|We investigate the relationship between the main indicators of the labour market in Russia. We try to construct a model of the Russian labour market and identify key relationships. Our special attention is drawn to the impact of the crisis on the Russian labour market and influence of oil price on labor market indicators. We estimated two types of models. They are systems of simultaneous equations model (SEM) and VECM. We received that real wage in Russia are more flexible than employment. During the crisis period real wage was decreasing. SEM model shows that real wage positively depends on real oil price. While the number of employed and unemployment donâ€™t depend on real oil price.
J40|African Jobless Growth Morphology:Vulnerabilities and Policy Responses|As by product of economic growth, jobs are indeed transformational. In other words, efficiency increases as workers get better at what they do (as more productive jobs appear and less productive one disappear). In fact societies flourish as jobs bring together people from different ethnic and social backgrounds while providing alternatives to conflict. Unfortunately, in many African countries, unemployment rates are low and growth is seldom jobless. Regrettably, most of the poor work long hours and cannot make ends meet while the violation of basic human rights is not uncommon. Again, youth unemployment and unmet job expectations are alarming. Consequently, this paper provides a framework that cuts across sectors and shows that the best policy responses vary across African countries (depending on their levels of development, endowments, demography and institutions). Thus, at all stages of development, forcing economic production to spread evenly across areas is both elusive and expensive. Policy makers should therefore identify and execute strategies that balance development outcomes across areas by means of domestic integration instruments. However, in places where integration is hardest, the policy response should be comprehensively total: institutions that unite, infrastructure that connects, interventions that target, incentives that motivate as well as information and communication technologies that enables or drives.
J40|Comparative Perspectives in Employment Relations Research|This article discusses the historical trajectories of employment research in the U.S. and Germany. Both countries exemplify very different research traditions, which have their origins in the 19th and early 20th century and are shaped not only by the field of inquiry (different national employment institutions and practices), but also by different social scientific traditions and political philosophies, for example the different inter-pretation of what constitutes industrial democracy or employees’ rights at work. I con-clude that current research still differs across countries and that we would do well to endorse this plurality rather than assuming an inevitable convergence to US research styles.
J40|Effects of informality in Albania's small enterprises|Employment is a major concern for Albania, while it transitioned from a centralized economy to a market economy. Labor conditions are an important factor of showcasing the economic wellbeing of the country as a whole. The main concern regarding the labor market is tied to the effects informal employment brings in the economy. Informality in Albania may be as high as 50 percentS of its official Gross Domestic Product, or even higher. When manifested in the economic sphere, informality plays a critical role for creation of jobs and reduction of poverty. Seizing informal economy and especially in the labor market is no easy task. But when achieved it provides visibility to those employed by the sectors, and the contribution they bring to the economy. Informality in the labor market mirrors informality in economy. The paper will focus on effects of employment in the Albanian informal economy, and provide results on a survey held in one of its capital main streets, targeting small businesses.

It aims at providing an informed view of the potential for increased migration flows and their consequences as a result of possible changes in the migration policies of the European Union with regard to Azerbaijan. The Report is comprised of 7 Chapters. Chapters 1 and 2 provide a discussion of relevant developments in the economy and labour market in the period since independence, with emphasis on developments over the last ten years or so. Chapter 3 provides a detailed discussion of trends in migration, and discusses the labour migration profile. Chapter 4 analyses remittances and their impact on income, investment and consumption. Chapter 5 provides a discussion of the available evidence on the costs and benefits of labour migration, emphasising the economic, social and demographic costs and consequences. Chapter 6 discusses current migration policies and institutions, while Chapter 7 discusses various factors that may be useful in forecasting key migration trends in the future."
J40|Costs and Benefits of Labour Mobility between the EU and the Eastern Partnership Partner Countries. Country report: Armenia|The purpose of this study is to explore and assess the costs and benefits of labour migration in Armenia and the potential of migration for contributing to the countryâ€™s development. We also examine how policy can be effectively formulated and implemented so that Armenia can get the most out of its migration experience. Lastly, we analyse how a phenomenon that emerged because of limited opportunities for employment â€“ migration â€“ evolved into a strategy towards development and prosperity. Based on this analysis, this paper makes a strong argument in favour of implementing programs in Armenia that involve the active collaboration of government institutions and the Armenian Diaspora, duly considering the unusual influence the latter has on Armeniaâ€™s economic and human development.
J40|Costs and Benefits of Labour Mobility between the EU and the Eastern Partnership Partner Countries. Country report: Belarus|"Labour migration does not appear to have the same magnitude and socio-economic importance in Belarus as in other EaP countries. It is one of the few post-socialist economies that have preserved the dominance of the state sector and built complicated systems of subsidisation and economic support for the population designed to manage the political-business cycle (see Chubrik, Shymanovich, Zaretsky (2012)). This model has allowed the economy to grow quite steadily until recently. However, the distorted system of incentives that was created for enterprises and households has resulted in the need for a ""correction"", which happened in the form of a balance of payments crisis in 2011. The impact of this factor on migration has not been fully visible yet. At the same time the relatively long period of stability and gradual, but steady, increase in welfare payments has played a role as a migration-restraining factor. In order to estimate cost and benefits of labour migration between EU and Belarus, this study utilises publically available literature as background and relies where possible on micro-data: Census-2009, Household Budget Survey (HBS), as well as relevant official data and data from polls related to the topic. Additionally, some sections of this report rely on information collected in the course of a focus group meeting with labour migrants and a series of in-depth interviews with officials from state, international, and non-governmental agencies dealing with migration. Lastly, in some cases anecdotal evidence was collected to support some of the new trends that have not yet been recorded in the statistics."
J40|Costs and Benefits of Labour Mobility between the EU and the Eastern Partnership Partner Countries. Country report: Georgia|This study provides an analysis of the costs and benefits of emigration for Georgia, with an emphasis on emigration to the EU. In the concluding section we dwell on the consequences of a possible liberalization of EU migration policies with regard to Eastern Partnership (EaP) countries, and how such a policy change would affect the flow and composition of migration from Georgia to the EU. The study estimates the costs and benefits of migration through the prism of recent economics developments in Georgia and in particular the sweeping liberalization reforms of recent years. While Georgia remains a poor country, its geopolitical position as a Western outpost in the Caucasus and Central Asian region, its role as a key trade and transportation hub, the superior quality of its bureaucracy, lack of corruption, etc., provide a very different context for migration processes, turning migration into a circular phenomenon, a major factor in modernizing the Georgian economy, society, and politics. The EU should give due consideration to this phenomenon as it (re)considers its policy on migration with regard to Georgia and, potentially, other EaP countries.
J40|Costs and Benefits of Labour Mobility between the EU and the Eastern Partnership Partner Countries. Country report: Ukraine|Ukraine is a migration-intensive country, with an estimated 1.5-2 million labour migrants (about 5% of the working-age population). Slightly over a half of these migrants travel for work to the EU. This study discusses the impact of this large pool of migrants on both the sending and receiving countries. It also assesses how liberalisation of the EU visa regime, something that the EU is currently negotiating with Ukraine, will affect the stream of Ukrainian labour migrants to EU countries. Our study suggests that the number of tourists will increase substantially, whereas the increase in the number of labour migrants is unlikely to be very large. We also suggest that the number of legal migrants is likely to increase, but at the same time the numer of illegal migrants will decline because currently only a third of migrants from Ukraine have both residence and work permits in the EU, while about a quarter of them stay there illegally.

J40|The Wage Curve Reconsidered: Is It Truly An 'Empirical Law Of Economics'?|The negative relationship between wages and unemployment, embodied within the so-called wage curve, has an extensive literature and has been referred to as ‘an empirical law of economics’. However there are newer alternative theories that seek to explain the variation in wages without reference to unemployment rates, namely Urban Economics (UE) and New Economic Geography (NEG). The present paper considers the relative success of non-nested models of wage determination from the perspective of Great Britain’s 408 local authorities over the period 1998-2010.
J40|Are Children “Normal”?| We examine Becker's (1960) contention that children are “normal.” For the cross-section of non-Hispanic white married couples in the United States, we show that when we restrict comparisons to similarly educated women living in similarly expensive locations, completed fertility is positively correlated with the husband's income. The empirical evidence is consistent with children being “normal.” In an effort to show causal effects, we analyze the localized impact on fertility of the mid-1970s' increase in world energy prices, an exogenous shock that substantially increased men's incomes in the Appalachian coal-mining region. Empirical evidence for that population indicates that fertility increases with men's income. © 2013 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
J40|Connecticut Coastal Community Unemployment and Economic Damage Attributable to Hurricane Sandy|By using dynamic regression analysis and BLS data starting from 1990, CCEA was able to determine that 7,103 private sector job-years may be lost (and attributable to) Hurricane Sandy, between November 2012 and December 2014, of which roughly half or 3,551 job losses, can be expected within small businesses. The BLS population subset of coastal NECTAs covers manufacturing, trade, transportation and utilities, professional and business services, and tourism services, while not reporting on information, financial services, health or education sectors, thus a reduced number from CT's total FTEs.
J40|The labor market impact of mobility restrictions: Evidence from the West Bank|Using data on Israeli closures inside the West Bank, we provide novel evidence on the labor market effects of conflict-induced restrictions to mobility. To identify the effects we exploit the fact that the placement of physical barriers by Israel was exogenous to local labor market conditions. Check-points have a significant negative effect on employment, wages and days worked, while other barriers have small positive effects on employment and no discernible effects on other variables. We provide evidence that only a very small portion of these effects is due to direct restrictions on the mobility of workers. According to our estimates the labor market costs of the barriers amounted in 2007 to between 4% and 4.4% of GDP.
J40|Inequality at Work: The Effect of Peer Salaries on Job Satisfaction| We study the effect of disclosing information on peers' salaries on workers' job satisfaction and job search intentions. A randomly chosen subset of University of California employees was informed about a new website listing the pay of University employees. All employees were then surveyed about their job satisfaction and job search intentions. Workers with salaries below the median for their pay unit and occupation report lower pay and job satisfaction and a significant increase in the likelihood of looking for a new job. Above-median earners are unaffected. Differences in pay rank matter more than differences in pay levels. (JEL I23, J28, J31, J64)
J40|Firm Size, Technical Change, and Wages in the Pork Sector, 1990-2005| This study investigates worker shares of the returns to scale and returns to technology adoption on U.S. hog farms. The wage analysis controls for a matching process by which workers are linked to farms of different sizes and technology uses. Using four surveys of employees on hog farms collected in 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005, we find persistent large wage premiums are paid to workers on larger farms and on technologically advanced farms that remain large and statistically significant even after controlling for differences in observable worker attributes and in the observed sorting process of workers across farms.
J40|What Drives the Demand for Temporary Agency Workers?|Temporary agency employment has grown steadily in most European countries over the past three decades as part of the general trend towards increased employment flexibility. Yet to this day, it remains an open question what drives the demand for temporary agency workers. The paper examines, first, whether the deregulation of temporary agency employment is responsible for the growth of the flexible staffing industry. Second, we investigate the cyclical behavior of temporary agency employment. Using monthly data for Germany covering the period 1973-2008, we show that the continuous liberalization of this sector is not responsible for the surge in temporary agency employment. Our analysis reveals, moreover, that temporary agency employment exhibits strong cyclical behavior and correlates with main economic indicators in real time. Since most European countries promoted the use of temporary agency employment in a similar way, we believe that our results may be interesting from an international perspective as well.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J40|The Polish Growth Miracle: Outcome of Persistent Reform Efforts|Since the beginning of transition in 1990 from a centrally planned to a market oriented economy, the performance of Poland’s economy has been outstanding if we take GDP growth as our measure. It is not specific reforms that can explain this performance but the radical (“big bang”) reforms at the beginning of transition in conjunction with persistent efforts during the two decades by all governments to keep on a reform path, no matter what their political orientation. Reforming a centrally planned economy that has very serious macroeconomic disequilibria requires reforms that can be done immediately but also structural or systemic reforms that require years to implement. Both types of reforms will be discussed. In a democratic context reforms can only be undertaken in a sustained way if a majority of voters favours such reform efforts. Even when reform-friendly governments were voted out of office, the new governments in Poland never reversed reforms undertaken by the previous government. This continuous reform stance over two decades is the main cause of the Polish growth miracle. The reasons for the ability of Polish policy makers to pursue economic and administrative reforms in spite of short-run costs to large sections of society will be discussed extensively.
J40|Dynamically Consistent Noise Infusion and Partially Synthetic Data as Confidentiality Protection Measures for Related Time Series|The Census Bureau's Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) provide detailed quarterly statistics on employment measures such as worker and job flows, tabulated by worker characteristics in various combinations. The data are released for several levels of NAICS industries and geography, the lowest aggregation of the latter being counties. Disclosure avoidance methods are required to protect the information about individuals and businesses that contribute to the underlying data. The QWI disclosure avoidance mechanism we describe here relies heavily on the use of noise infusion through a permanent multiplicative noise distortion factor, used for magnitudes, counts, differences and ratios. There is minimal suppression and no complementary suppressions. To our knowledge, the release in 2003 of the QWI was the first large-scale use of noise infusion in any official statistical product. We show that the released statistics are analytically valid along several critical dimensions { measures are unbiased and time series properties are preserved. We provide an analysis of the degree to which confidentiality is protected. Furthermore, we show how the judicious use of synthetic data, injected into the tabulation process, can completely eliminate suppressions, maintain analytical validity, and increase the protection of the underlying confidential data.
J40|Sexism at work|Women have, on average, been less well-paid than men throughout history. Prior to 1900, most economic historians see the gender wage gap as a reflection of men's greater strength and correspondingly higher productivity. This paper investigates the gender wage gap in cigar making around 1900. Strength was rarely an issue, but the gender wage gap was large. Two findings suggest that employers were not sexist. First, differences in earnings by gender for workers paid piece rates can be fully explained by differences in experience and other productivity-related characteristics. Second, conditioning on those characteristics, women were just as likely to be promoted to the better paying piece rate section. Neither finding is compatible with a simple model of sex-based discrimination. Instead, the gender wage gap can be decomposed into two components. First, women were typically less experienced, in an industry in which experience mattered. Second there were some jobs that required strength, for which men were better suited. Because strength was so valuable in the other jobs at this time, men commanded a wage premium in the general labour market, raising their reservation wage. Hiring a man required the firm to pay a 'man's wage'. This implies that firms that were slow to feminise their time rate workforce ended up with a higher cost structure than those that made the transition more quickly. We show that firms with a higher proportion of women in their workforce in 1863 were indeed more likely to survive 35 years later.
J40|Brain drain in the age of mass migration: Does relative inequality explain migrant selectivity?|Brain drain is a core economic policy problem for many developing countries today. Does relative inequality in source and destination countries influence the brain-drain phenomenon? We explore human capital selectivity during the period 1820–1909.We apply age heaping techniques to measure human capital selectivity of international migrants. In a sample of 52 source and five destination countries we find selective migration determined by relative anthropometric inequality in source and destination countries. Other inequality measures confirm this. The results remain robust in OLS and Arellano–Bond approaches. We confirm the Roy–Borjas model of migrant self-selection. Moreover, we find that countries like Germany and UK experienced a small positive effect, because the less educated emigrated in larger numbers.
J40|Job Characteristics and Labor Turnover: Assessing the Role of Preferences and Opportunities in Teacher Mobility|Abstract Job characteristics can affect worker turnover through their effect on utility and through their effect on outside job opportunities. We separately identify and estimate the roles of these two channels. Our method exploits information on job changes and relies on an augmented sample selection correction. Taking our approach to an exhaustive register of Dutch primary school teachers, and using arguably plausible exclusion restrictions, we show a detailed picture of preferences for school characteristics. We also study how preference estimates may be biased when ignoring information on job opportunities and discuss the implications for the analysis of teacher turnover.
J40|Connections and performance in bankers’ turnover|In this paper we study the impact of the connections of the top executives (Presidents, CEOs and General Managers) of Italian banks on their turnover and on bank performance. We measure managers’ connections by the kilometer distance between the province of the bank's headquarter and the manager's province of birth. We show that top managers tend to be local in the sense that the distribution of this distance is heavily skewed towards zero. On the basis of this evidence we investigate whether connections affect the duration of the appointment at the bank, and whether connections entrench managers at the expense of the bank's performance. We find that connections generally decrease the probability of bank manager’s turnover, and that the positive effect of performance on tenure is strongly attenuated once connections are taken into account. Furthermore we find that for any bank type performance does not increase with connections. On the contrary, we show that having connected managers hurts performance in Mutual, Cooperative and Rural banks. Overall these findings suggest that connections are collusion devices to share and maintain rents at the expenses of bank performance.
J40|The elusive and expensive green job|The United States, Europe, and non-governmental international organizations are seeking to encourage the creation of green jobs and the use of non-hydropower renewable energy. This paper discusses the challenge in defining green jobs and reviews definitions across different countries, states, and NGOs. The paper describes some of the costs the United States has faced in creating jobs through programs funded by the Departments of Labor and Energy. The paper concludes by comparing the experiences of China and the United States in the use of renewable energy.
J40|Gender differences in a market with relative performance feedback: Professional tennis players|Recent studies have found that females are less competitive than men. These studies have all relied on a similar framework where individuals have little information about their relative abilities compared to other potential competitors. It has also been found that performance feedback leads to more efficient choices for students and in experimental settings. Professional athletes competing in individual sports typically have access to performance feedback and good information about the quality of their potential competitors when choosing to enter competitive tournaments. In this paper, I use data from the International Tennis Federation (ITF) on tournament entry decisions by professional players to study gender differences in tournament entry and preferences in this competitive labor market.
J40|Measuring the (income) effect of disability insurance generosity on labour market participation|We analyze the employment effect of a law that provides for a 36% increase in the generosity of disability insurance (DI) for claimants who are, as a result of their lack of skills and of the labour market conditions they face, deemed unlikely to find a job. The selection process for treatment is therefore conditional on having a low probability of employment, making evaluation of its effect intrinsically difficult. We exploit the fact that the benefit increase is only available to individuals aged 55 or older, estimating its impact using a regression discontinuity approach. Our first results indicate a large drop in employment for disabled individuals who receive the increase in the benefit. Testing for the linearity of covariates around the eligibility age threshold reveals that the age at which individuals start claiming DI is not continuous: the benefit increase appears to accelerate the entry rate of individuals aged 55 or over. We obtain new estimates excluding this group of claimants, and find that the policy decreases the employment probability by 8%. We conclude that the observed DI generosity elasticity of 0.22 on labour market participation is mostly due to income effects since benefit receipt is not work contingent in the system studied.
J40|Intimations of Keith Hart's 'Informal Economy' - In the Work of Henry Mayhew, P T Bauer and Richard Salisbury|This paper considers the idea of informality in market exchange, as introduced into the economic development literature by Keith Hart in the 1970s. In addition to Hart (1971, 1973) it will discuss three writers who may be considered his intellectual forerunners. Each, to a greater or less degree, anticipated the idea of informal economic activity and described it in a particular historical period and place. They are the mid-Victorian journalist Henry Mayhew (London, c.1850), the libertarian economist P. T. Bauer (British West Africa, c.1948) and the economic anthropologist R. F. Salisbury (colonial New Guinea, c.1952-1963). The principal texts relied upon are Mayhew's monumental London Labour and the London Poor (4 vols, 1851-61), Bauer's Economics of Under-Developed Countries (1957) and Salisbury's From Stone to Steel (1962) and Vunamami: Economic Transformation in a Traditional Society (1970).
J40|Labor mobility across the formal/informal divide in Turkey: Evidence from individual-level data|Purpose - This paper, the first one to use individual-level Turkish panel data, examines the labor market transitions in Turkey along the formal/informal employment divide. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the limited body of empirical evidence available on mobility and informality in the Turkish labor market. Design/methodology/approach - Toward this end, the authors use Turkish income and Living Conditions Survey panel data for 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 to compute the Markov transition probabilities of individuals moving across six different labor market states: formal-salaried (FS), informal-salaried, formal self-employed, informal self-employed, unemployed and inactive. In order to examine the nature of mobility patterns in more detail, the authors then estimate six multinomial logit models individually for each transition adopting a number of individual and employment characteristics as explanatory variables. Findings - The authors find evidence that mobility patterns are fairly similar across different time spans, the probability of remaining in initial state is higher than the probability of transition into another state for all the labor market states, except for unemployment, there is only very limited mobility into the FS state. Gender, education and sector of economic activity are observed to display significant effects on mobility patterns. The results reveal several relationships between the covariates and likelihood of variant transitions. Research limitations/implications - This study provides a comprehensive and detailed diagnosis of the Turkish labor market. The market is observed to display a rather static structure throughout the period considered. The results indicate that a well recognition of underlying dynamics may help policy makers to produce various effective tools for addressing informality. Originality/value - First study to analyze labor market mobility across formal/informal sectors using newly available panel data.
J40|Are temporary work agencies stepping-stones into regular employment?|This paper estimates the causal effect of temporary work agency (TWA) employment on the subsequent probability of employment in the regular labor market. The main purpose is to estimate the stepping-stone effect separately for natives and immigrants, where the latter group potentially benefits the most from TWA employment. Since no quasi-experiment is available, individual Differences-in-Differences and matching is used to deal with the potential selection bias. The results point at a negative regular employment effect, which slowly fades away over a couple of years. Thus no evidence of a stepping-stone effect is found. When conditioning on immigrants this negative effect is absent. A long-run significant effect is found on overall employment probability (including TWA employment), there is even a long-run positive effect on annual earnings (mainly driven by women). Unemployment probabilities decreased, however the results in the estimation were less stable over time compared to the employment estimates, suggesting that the TWAs might keep individuals from exiting the labor market. Stratification on gender showed that the negative regular employment effect on women persisted for two more years compared to men.
J40|The Formal/Informal Employment Earnings Gap: Evidence from Turkey|Abstract This study investigates the formal/informal employment earnings gap in Turkey. We focus on the earnings differentials that can be explained by observable characteristics and unobservable time-invariant individual heterogeneity. We first, estimate the standard Mincer earnings equations using ordinary least squares (OLS), controlling for individual, household, and job characteristics. Next we use, panel data and the quantile regression (QR) techniques in order to account for unobserved factors which might affect the earnings and the intrinsic heterogeneity within formal and informal sectors. OLS results confirm the existence of an informal sector penalty almost half of which is explained by observable variables. We find that formal-salaried workers are paid significantly higher than their informal counterparts and of the self-employed confirming the heterogeneity within the informal employment. QR results show that pay differentials are not uniform along the earnings distribution. In contrast to the mainstream literature which views informal self-employment as the upper-tier and wage-employment as the lower-tier, we find that self-employment corresponds to the lower-tier in the Turkish labor market. Finally, fixed effects estimation indicates that unobserved individual characteristics combined with controls for observable characteristics explain the pay differentials between formal and informal employment entirely in the total and the female sample. However, informal sector penalty persists in the male sample.
J40|Creating New Administrative Data to Describe the Scientific Workforce: The STAR METRICS Program|In common with many countries, the substantial United States investment in R&D is characterized by limited documentation of the nature and results of those investments (MacIlwain 2010, Marburger 2005). Despite the increased calls for reporting by key stakeholders, current data systems cannot meet the new requirements; indeed, the conclusion of the Science of Science Policy interagency group's Federal Research Roadmap (National Science and Technology Council 2008) was that the science policy data infrastructure was inadequate for decision-making. In response to this need, a new data system is being built (STAR METRICS) drawing from administrative records; this paper describes the initial results of that effort – focusing on documenting the scientific workforce supported by expenditures during the 2011 Federal fiscal year from awards made by the National Science Foundation. The contribution of the paper is threefold. First it describes in a non-technical fashion how these new data can contribute to our understanding of the initial results of science investments. Second, it shows how new computational technologies can be used to go beyond the traditional methods of manual reporting and administrative program coding to capture information at the most granular units of analysis possible. Finally, it discusses the lessons learned for the collection and analysis of data. The most important is leveraging existing data, not relying on surveys and manual reporting; the deficiencies of each have been well documented (Lane 2010).
J40|The Polish growth miracle: outcome of persistent reform efforts|Since the beginning of transition in 1990 from a centrally planned to a market oriented economy, the performance of Poland’s economy has been outstanding if we take GDP growth as our measure. In our opinion it is not specific reforms that can explain this performance but the radical (“big bang”) reforms at the beginning of transition in conjunction with persistent efforts during the two decades by all governments, no matter what their political orientation, to keep on a reform path. Reforming a centrally planned economy that has very serious macroeconomic disequilibria implies reforms that can be done immediately but also structural or systemic reforms that require years to implement. Both types of reforms will be discussed. In a democratic context reforms can only be undertaken in a sustained way if a majority of voters favours such reform efforts. Even when reform-friendly governments were voted out of office in the Polish case, the new governments in Poland never reversed reforms undertaken by the previous government. This continuous reform stance over two decades is the main cause of the Polish growth miracle. The reasons for the ability of Polish policy makers to pursue economic and administrative reforms in spite of short-run costs to large sections of society will be discussed extensively

J40|Del pasmo al marasmo: El sector de la construcción y su relación con la crisis del empleo/The Construction Sector and its Relationship With the Employment Crisis|Este artículo examina la evolución del sector de la construcción desde la perspectiva de la ocupación. Para ello, se adoptan dos puntos de vista relevantes: uno de ellos es el temporal, lo que lleva a analizar cómo ha evolucionado la estructura sectorial, en general, y el nivel de empleo de la construcción y ramas afines, en particular, en España en las últimas décadas; la otra perspectiva es la internacional, lo que implica comparar a España con otros países, sobre todo europeos, y preguntarse si el caso español ha sido muy diferente al del resto. This article examines the evolution of the construction sector using the employment perspective. For that, it adopts two relevant points of view: one is temporal, which leads to the analysis of the evolution of the sectoral structure, in general, and of the employment level of construction and related economic activities, in particular, in Spain during the last decades; the other perspective is the international, which implies comparing Spain with other countries (especially, European countries) and inquiring whether the Spanish case has been so different from the rest.
J40|Abstract: Illegal Migration, Wages, and Remittances: Semi-Parametric Estimation of Illegality Effects|We consider the issue of illegal migration from Mexico to the US, and examine whether the lack of legal status causally impacts on outcomes, specifically wages and remitting behavior. These outcomes are of particular interest given the extent of legal and illegal migration, and the resulting financial flows. We formalize this question and highlight the principal empirical problem using a potential outcome framework with endogenous selection. The selection bias is captured by a control function, which is estimated non-parametrically. The framework for remitting is extended to allow for endogenous regressors (e.g. wages). We propose a new reparametrisation of the control function, which is linear in case of a normal error structure, and test linearity. Using Mexican Migration project data, we find considerable and robust illegality effects on wages, the penalty being about 12% in the 1980s and 22% in the 1990s. For the latter period, the selection bias is not created by a normal error structure; wrongly imposing normality overestimates the illegality effect on wages by 50%, while wrongly ignoring selection leads to a 50% underestimate. In contrast to these wage penalties, legal status appears to have mixed effects on remitting behavior.

J40|Coordinating Healthcare and Pension Policies: An Exploratory Study|Rapid ageing of the population globally represents an unprecedented historical trend. As pension and healthcare costs are positively correlated with rising incomes, ageing, urbanization, and a shift from communicable to life-style diseases, managing these costs is a major challenge. There are many linkages between healthcare and pension arrangements—in terms of costs, exposure to risks, and as they jointly impact on crucial policy decisions. This paper discusses the rationale for coordination between various programs to better manage the cost of ageing. The current difficult macroeconomic environment, including fiscal stringency conditions, strengthens the case for such coordination.
