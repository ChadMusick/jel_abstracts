L96|Enhancing ICT for Quality Education in Sub-Saharan Africa|This research assesses the relevance of information and communication technology (ICT) in primary education quality in a panel of 49 Sub-Saharan African countries for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS) and Instrumental Quantile regressions (IQR). From the 2SLS: (i) mobile phone and internet penetration rates reduce poor quality education and enhancing internet penetration has a net negative effect of greater magnitude. From the IQR: (i) with the exception of the highest quantile for mobile phone penetration and top quantiles for internet penetration, ICT consistently has a negative effect on poor education quality with a non-monotonic pattern. (ii) Net negative effects are exclusively apparent in the median and top quantiles of internet-related regressions. It follows that enhancing internet penetration will benefit countries with above-median levels of poor education quality while enhancing internet penetration is not immediately relevant to reducing poor education quality in countries with below-median levels of poor education quality.
L96|The mobile phone,information sharing and financial sector development in Africa: A quantile regressions approach|This study investigates linkages between the mobile phone, information sharing offices (ISO) and financial sector development in 53 African countries for the period 2004-2011. ISO are private credit bureaus and public credit registries. The empirical evidence is based on contemporary and non-contemporary quantile regressions. Two main hypotheses are tested: mobile phones complement ISO to enhance the formal financial sector (Hypothesis 1) and mobile phones complement ISO to reduce the informal financial sector (Hypothesis 2). The hypotheses are largely confirmed. This research adds to the existing body of literature by engaging hitherto unexplored dimensions of financial sector development and investigating the role of mobile phones in information sharing for financial sector development.
L96|Linkages and spillover effects of South African foreign direct investment in Botswana and Kenya|In recent decades, the impact of South African foreign direct investment in Africa has been captured by research and policy. This paper investigates linkages and spillover effects of South African foreign direct investment in Botswana and Kenya. The study uses primary data to investigate qualitative implications. The findings reveal that South African firms operate in sectors including retail, food-processing, and information and communication technology. Linkages forged in these sectors include supply, employee, joint venture, service, and institutional nexuses. Supply and service linkages create observable spillovers which point to the fact that younger local firms tend to benefit from South African firms in terms of technology transfer and training opportunities. Host country policymakers are therefore encouraged to provide favourable incentives for foreign direct investment to promote entrepreneurship. Other policy implications are also discussed.

L96|Foreign direct investment,information technology and economic growth dynamics in Sub-Saharan Africa|The research assesses how information and communication technology (ICT) modulates the effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) on economic growth dynamics in 25 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa for the period 1980-2014. The employed economic growth dynamics areGross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, real GDP and GDP per capita while ICT is measured by mobile phone penetration and internet penetration. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalised Method of Moments. The study finds that both internet penetration and mobile phone penetration overwhelmingly modulate FDI to induce overall positive net effects on all three economic growth dynamics. Moreover, the positive net effects are consistently more apparent in internet-centric regressions compared to ?mobile phone?-oriented specifications. In the light of negative interactive effects, net effects are decomposed to provide thresholds at which ICT policy variables should be complemented with other policy initiatives in order to engender favorable outcomes on economic growth dynamics. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.

L96|Electronic wallet technology and the enabling environment of smallholder farmers in Nigeria|Purpose â€“ The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the impact of growth enhancement support scheme (GESS) on the enabling environment of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Its special focus is to investigate the GESS impact on access to rural farm credit and transport cost of smallholder farmers in the agricultural transformation agenda (ATA) in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach â€“ This paper adopts a survey research technique, aimed at gathering information from a representative sample of the population, as it is essentially cross-sectional that describes and interprets what exist at present. A total of one thousand, two hundred farmers were sampled across the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. Findings â€“ Results from the use of a double-hurdle model indicate that the GESS has a significant impact on farmersâ€™ access to credit, but does not significantly affect rural farm transport cost, which subsequently influence the price of food in the country. Practical implication â€“ This implies that if the federal government of Nigeria is to work towards an ideal agricultural transformation agenda, transport networks should be closely aligned with the GESS priorities to provide connectivity to rural areas that provide most of the countryâ€™s agricultural output. Originality/value â€“ This research adds to the literature on agricultural and rural development debate in developing countries. It concludes that embracing rural finance and transportation infrastructure should form the foundation of the ATA in Nigeria, which in turn would provide the enabling environment for more widespread rural economy in sub-Saharan Africa.
L96|Information Technology, Governance and Insurance in Sub-Saharan Africa|Purpose â€“This study investigates the role of ICT in modulating the effect of governance on insurance penetration in 42 sub-Saharan African countries using data for the period 2004-2014. Design/methodology/approach â€“Two insurance indicators are used in the analysis, namely: life insurance and non-life insurance. The three ICT modulating dynamics employed include: mobile phone penetration, internet penetration and fixed broadband subscriptions. Six governance channels are also considered, namely: political stability, â€œvoice & accountabilityâ€ , regulation quality, government effectiveness, the rule of law and corruption-control. The empirical evidence is based on generalized method of moments. Findings â€“The following main findings are established. First, mobile phone penetration does not significantly modulate governance channels to positively affect life insurance while it effectively complements â€œvoice & accountabilityâ€ to induce a positive net effect on non-life insurance. Second, internet penetration complements: (i) governance dynamics of political stability, government effectiveness and rule of law to induce positive net effects on life insurance: and (ii) corruption-control for an overall positive effect on non-life insurance. Third, the relevance of fixed broadband subscriptions in promoting life insurance is apparent via governance channels of regulation quality, government effectiveness and the rule of law while fixed broadband subscriptions do not induce significant overall net effects on non-life insurance though the conditional effects are overwhelmingly significant. Orginality/value â€“ To the best our knowledge, studies on the relevance of ICT in promoting insurance consumption through governance channels are sparse, especially for a region such as sub-Saharan Africa where insurance penetration is low compared to other regions of the world.
L96|The role of ICT in modulating the effect of education and lifelong learning on income inequality and economic growth in Africa|This study assesses the role of ICT in modulating the impact of education and lifelong learning on income inequality and economic growth. It focuses on a sample of 48 African countries from 2004 to 2014. The empirical evidence is based on the generalised method of moments (GMM). The following findings are established. First, mobile phone and internet each interact with primary school education to decrease income inequality. Second, all ICT indicators interact with secondary school education to exert a negative impact on the Gini index. Third, fixed broadband distinctly interacts with primary school education and lifelong learning to have a positive effect on economic growth. Fourth, ICT indicators do not significantly influence inequality and economic growth through tertiary school education and lifelong learning. These main findings are further substantiated. Policy implications are discussed.
L96|Explaining the Interplay Between Merchant Acceptance and Consumer Adoption in Two-Sided Markets for Payment Methods|Recent consumer and merchant surveys show a decrease in the use of cash at point-of-sale (POS). Increasingly, consumers and merchants have access to a growing array of payment innovations as substitutes for cash. The market for payments is two-sided, meaning that a method of payment can be used only if both consumers and merchants adopt/accept it. This paper develops a model to assess how innovations affect consumers’ adoption and merchants’ acceptance of various payment instruments, and their usage patterns at the POS. We model this interdependence in two stages. First, consumers and merchants decide on which methods of payment to adopt and accept, respectively. Second, consumers and merchants meet at the POS, and the consumer chooses their preferred method of payment given what the merchant accepts. Estimates from our model suggest that both sides of the market can benefit from accepting all means of payment. Further, our model predicts that merchants are much more sensitive to an increase in their payment costs than consumers. We use our model to predict what would happen under three scenarios. First, increasing merchants’ cost of using credit cards would significantly reduce merchant acceptance of this payment instrument in favour of debit. Second, the cost of using cash would have to increase substantially on both sides of the market for cash usage to fall below 1 percent of transaction volume. Finally, even if all consumers/merchants adopted/accepted all methods of payment, cash would fall but would remain at 20 percent of transaction volume. These findings suggest a completely cashless society is unlikely in the foreseeable future.
L96|Digital vulnerability and performance of firms in developing countries|This paper provides evidence of large positive effects of Internet use on local firm performance, using a sample of some 30,000 firms from 38 developing and transition countries. We adopt an IV approach emphasizing firm’s digital vulnerability to seismic shocks upon the telecommunications submarine cable network, and find that a 10% increase in Internet incidence raises by 36% their total annual sales, by 26% sales per worker, by 12% the number of permanent workers. Contrary to other studies on the effect of ICT adoption on trade, we do not find significant evidence on firms’ exports. A greater use of Internet by manufactures is also found to increase their number of production (unskilled) workers in a larger extent than non-production workers, which nuances recent evidence on a skilled-biased digital revolution. The concern for omitted variable bias, reverse causality or measurement error is lowered by proceeding to a wide range of restrictions upon the sample composition and the instrument set calibration, and by controlling for location, sector, year, country-by-year fixed effects.
L96|Informal Sector and Mobile Financial Services in Developing Countries: Does Financial Innovation Matter?|This paper investigates the impact of mobile financial services - MFS (mobile money, and mobile credit and savings) on the informal sector. Using both parametric and non-parametric methods on panel data from 101 emerging and developing countries over the period 2000-15, we find that MFS negatively affect the size of the informal sector. According to estimates derived from propensity score matching, MFS adoption decreases the informal sector size in a range of 2.4 – 4.3 percentage points of GDP. These formalization effects may stem from different possible transmission channels: improvement in credit access, increase in the productivity/profitability of informal firms attenuating subsistence constraints typical of entrepreneurship in the informal sector, as well as possible induced growth of firms already in the formal sector. The robustness of these results is supported by the use of an alternative estimation approach (instrumental variables). These findings lay the groundwork for the scarce literature on the macroeconomic impact of mobile financial services, a major dimension of the growing drive towards economic digitalization transiting through industry-level MW.
L96|Benefits of Regulation vs. Competition Where Inequality Is High: The Case of Mobile Telephony in South Africa|We test for the distributional effects of regulation and entry in the mobile telecommunications sector in a highly unequal country, South Africa. Using six waves of a consumer survey of over 134,000 individuals between 2009-2014, we estimate a discrete-choice model allowing for individual-specific price-responsiveness and preferences for network operators. Next, we use a demand and supply equilibrium framework to simulate prices and the distribution of welfare without entry and mobile termination rate regulation. We find that regulation benefits consumers significantly more than entry does, and that high-income consumers and city-dwellers benefit more in terms of increased consumer surplus.
L96|Narrowing the 'Digital Divide': The Role of Complementarities Between Fixed and Mobile Data in South Africa|We study substitution between fixed and mobile broadband services in South Africa using survey data on 134,000 individuals between 2009 and 2014. In our discrete-choice model, individuals choose fixed or mobile voice and data services in a framework that allows them to be substitutes or complements. We find that voice services are complements on average but data services are substitutes. However, many consumers see data services as complements. Our results show that having a computer and access to an internet connection at work or school are more important than reducing mobile data prices by 10% in driving broadband penetration.
L96|The European Framework for Regulating Telecommunications: A 25-year Appraisal|Abstract The European telecommunications sector has been radically transformed in the past 25 years: from a group of state monopolies to a set of increasingly competitive markets. In this paper we summarize how this process has unfolded—for both fixed and mobile telecommunications—by focusing on the evolution of the regulatory framework and by drawing some parallels with the evolution of the sector in the US. Given the major strategic importance of the sector, we highlight some of the challenges that lie ahead.

L96|NIESIM: A Simulation-based Application for Estimating the Value of Information in Mobile Network Management|In this paper we introduce NIESIM (Network Information Economics SIMulation), a software for simulating a mobile communications scenario and studying the value of information in the context of mobile network management. The modelling principles and the simulation strategy used to design and develop NIESIM software are introduced, along with simulation results. We consider an application of NIESIM to support the definition of the grade of service in a network that is exposed to failures. An exploratory discussion of the findings and their implications to future work is also presented.
L96|Net neutrality and asymmetric platform competition|Abstract In this paper we analyze the interplay between access to the last-mile network and net neutrality in the market for Internet access. We consider two competing Internet service providers (ISPs), which act as platforms between Internet users and content providers (CPs). One of the ISPs is vertically integrated and provides the other (non-integrated) ISP with access to its last-mile network. We study the impact of the access price on the termination fees charged by the ISPs to CPs for carrying their traffic. First, we show that the termination fee set by the integrated ISP decreases with the access price, whereas the termination fee of the non-integrated ISP can either increase or decrease with it. Second, we show that there exists a negative relationship (“waterbed effect”) between the access price and the total termination fee paid by the CPs. As a consequence, it may be socially optimal for the regulator to set the access price above cost when termination fees are left to the market.
L96|Determinants of Mobile Broadband Use in Developing Economies: Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa|Broadband is seen as a vector of economic growth and social development. In the developing world, mobile technologies are widely adopted and mobile broadband is progressively rolled-out with high expectations on its impact on the countries' development. We highlight what the determinants of mobile broadband use are in four Sub-Saharan countries. Using micro-level data coming from household surveys over 5 years, from 2013 to 2017, we show that SIM card ownership and being part of an online social community has a strong positive impact on mobile broadband use. We also highlight a positive correlation between digital inclusion and financial inclusion as mobile money users and bank account users are found to be more inclined to use mobile broadband. However, beyond apparent similarities, mobile broadband is used in different ways according to countries specificities. For instance, among the non-mobile owners in Nigeria, the unemployed are the most likely to use mobile broadband, most probably for job search practices, while it is rather used by students for information gathering in other countries. Finally we show that those excluded from mobile broadband use are the eldest, those with the lowest level of education, and women.
L96|Technology Assessment Of Iot Wireless Network Technologies For The Telecommunication Sector|Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are of particular interest for telecommunication companies that can significantly affect the interaction of economic agents. As a result of the growth in the number of connected devices, the introduction of cloud services and business applications it became possible to combine equipment, information systems and management systems into a single communication network which in turn gave impetus to the development of the Internet of Things. The basis for the development of the Internet of Things is modern data transmission technologies including IoT Wireless Networks. There are, currently, a number of wireless IoT technologies which have different characteristics. In this regard, it is of interest to identify the most promising technologies that will form the basis of the infrastructure for the development of the IoT ecosystem. This paper develops an assessment model for the application potential of IoT wireless network technologies for the telecommunication sector. LPWAN, 4G and Wi-Fi were identified as the most promising technologies. The majority of the assessment criteria are applicable to other telecommunication technologies.
L96|Security Analysis of Machine Learning Systems for the Financial Sector|The use of artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning (ML), is being extensively discussed in the financial sector. ML systems, however, tend to have specific vulnerabilities as well as those common to all information technology systems. To effectively deploy secure ML systems, it is critical to consider in advance how to address potential attacks targeting the vulnerabilities. In this paper, we classify ML systems into 12 types on the basis of the relationships among entities involved in the system and discuss the vulnerabilities and threats, as well as the corresponding countermeasures for each type. We then focus on typical use cases of ML systems in the financial sector, and discuss possible attacks and security measures.
L96|Access to Electricity and ICT Usage: A Country-level Assessment on Sub-Saharan Africa|While several determinants of ICT usage has been investigated in the literature, the impact of access to electricity has been so far overlooked. In this paper, we rely on countrylevel data on the penetration rates of mobile telephony, Internet and smartphones, as well as average revenue per user (ARPU) to evaluate the impact of access to electricity on ICT usage in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using a panel of 40 countries from 2000 to 2016 and a logistic diffusion model, we find a positive and statistically significant impact of access to electricity on the penetration rate of the Internet and smartphones, but no significant effect on the diffusion of basic mobile telephony. Accounting for both the extensive and intensive margins, we find that ICT usage increases by 0.43 US dollar per connected user, meaning that mobile ARPU would have declined by 0.1 percentage point more per year without the expansion of access to electricity. These findings are robust to the measurement of access to electricity, and to the inclusion of controls for income, education, urbanization, price, competition and network investment.
L96|Determinants of Mobile Broadband Use in Developing Economies: Evidence from Nigeria|Using micro-level data coming from household surveys over 5 years, from 2013 to 2017, we analyse what are the determinants of mobile broadband adoption in developing economies. We provide empirical evidence on the presence of a learning effect stemming from mobile money use, which by providing a higher experience in using mobile phone increases mobile broadband use. The ownership of a mobile phone is also positively correlated with mobile broadband use. However, for those not owning a mobile phone the ownership of an active SIM card is a prerequisite for using mobile broadband. We highlight that the population left behind is mainly composed of poor households living in rural areas.
L96|Technological Change and its Impact on the Labor Market in Egypt|The current study aims at analyzing the impact of technological change and innovations on the labor market in Egypt. Using the panel data of Egyptian Labor Market Panel Survey (ELMPS) 1998, 2006, and 2012 as well as the initial year of ELMPS 1988, a quadratic form of equation for employment is estimated and two approaches were applied. The first one is collaborated by applying the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimation method and taking the difference between the rounds of the ELMPS database; three regressions were estimated for the following, namely total labor force (males and females), a regression for male workers as well as another regression for female workers on wage and wage squared. The second approach is estimated by applying the panel model techniques using the Fixed Effects Model as well as the Random Effects Model to analyze the impact of technological change on the Egyptian labor market. Results of the study reveal that the impact of technological change on employment is evident in the years 2006 and 2012 causing job polarization in the Egyptian labor market as revealed in the first approach. Moreover, the findings show that in the second approach there exists a J-shaped relationship between employment growth and wage and wage squared as control variables. The present study provides an overview of the related literature; moreover, it addresses and analyzes the impact technological change has on the labor market. Finally, the paper provides policy recommendations for forward-looking labor market policies in Egypt.
L96|Happily ever after? Vertical and horizontal mergers in the U.S. media industry|This paper provides an economic analysis of recent vertical and horizontal mergers in the U.S. industry for audiovisual media content, including the AT&T-Time Warner and the Disney-Fox mergers. Using a theory-driven approach, we examine economic effects of these types of mergers on market competition, focusing on digital media content distribution. In doing so, we address three research questions: (i) Is the current development of analyzing industry with its recent merger activity concerning? (ii) Would vertical or horizontal integration be more preferable for overall welfare and competition in this industry? (iii) What are implications for antitrust policy? We conclude from our analysis that in the already highly horizontally concentrated U.S. market for audiovisual content the process of further vertical integration creates concerns from a competition policy perspective. Moreover, even though horizontal concentration on some of the market stages may be anticompetitive as well, vertical integration is likely to be more harmful. As a consequence, we recommend a stricter approach to vertical merger control in this industry, as well as a more active abuse control against already vertically-integrated media companies.
L96|Net neutrality regulation: Much ado about nothing?|The economics literature on Net Neutrality (NN) has been largely critical of NN regulation on the basis of theoretical findings that NN violations can be both welfare improving and welfare deteriorating, depending on the circumstances of the case in question. Thus, an ex post competition policy approach would be preferable to a strict ex ante prohibition of NN violations. In contrast, the current paper argues that NN regulation is largely ineffective, in particular, when it comes to the prohibition of fast lanes and other quality of service (QoS) differentiations, and to a lesser extent, when it comes to the zero price rule. NN regulation is effective only in preventing the blocking of specific content and in preventing the favoring of ISP owned content and in preventing some price discriminations. These are also areas where NN regulations are more likely to be welfare-enhancing. Where they are ineffective, NN regulations are likely to create inefficiencies through the cost and allocative inefficiencies caused by NN bypass. The paper ends with a call for theoretical and empirical economic analyses of NN circumvention techniques.
L96|A retrospective study on the regional benefits and spillover effects of high-speed broadband networks: Evidence from German counties|There is still hardly any empirical evidence on how divergent broadband technologies, and, by extension, bandwidth levels, influence GDP growth, or on the extent of spatial externalities at a regional level. Our study aims to assess the economic benefits of high-speed broadband networks within and across neighbouring counties in Germany. Utilizing a balanced panel dataset of 401 German counties with data from 2010-2015 as well as different panel estimation techniques, we find that the availability of high-speed broadband (which enables transfer rates of 50 Mbit/sec and higher) has a small but significant positive effect on regional GDP growth in the average German county, when compared to normal broadband availability. Furthermore, we find that broadband deployment in German counties induces substantial economic benefits in terms of direct effects and regional externalities. According to our main estimation results, an increase in bandwidth coverage of 50 Mbit/sec and higher by one percentage point induces arise in regional GDP of 0.05%. This effect is almost doubled if we also take regional externalities into account and is of particular relevance for urban counties. Furthermore, our cost-benefit analysis suggests substantial efficiency gains, as the total economic benefits of subsidy programs to encourage broadband expansion substantially exceeded their associated costs.
L96|Digitalization and the performance of micro and small enterprises in Yogyakarta, Indonesia|The world is going digital. Little is known about how this digitalization affects the performance of micro and small enterprises, one of the major foundations of the economy in developing countries but with relatively low productivity. This paper examines the causal impact of internet utilization, as a part of digitalization, on enterprise performance. We conducted a field survey among micro and small enterprises in Yogyakarta, the densest micro and small enterprise population province in Indonesia. The identification strategy exploits the fact that the differences in geographic topography produce conceivably exogenous variations in the strength of cellular signal that micro and small enterprises in various areas can receive to connect to the internet. We find that internet utilization has enabled micro and small enterprises to engage in the digital economy and has improved labor productivity and exports.
L96|Does deregulation drive innovation intensity? Lessons learned from the OECD telecommunications sector|The channel between innovation and industry regulation constitutes a non-lasting debate among the economists and researchers within the recent years. Despite the significant contributions on this field, mostly made from the empirical standpoint, the existing literature is still incomplete. This might be attributed to the fact that existing studies fail to combine a strong theoretical framework with the empirical scrutiny in order to exemplify and decompose the relationship between regulation intensity and innovation activity. We attempt to shed light on this limitation by theoretically modeling the telecommunications sector, in which access regulation impacts the non-separable activity in process and product innovation. We then empirically test our model by deploying an efficient panel threshold technique along the lines of Hansen (1999). Our balanced panel dataset comprises of 32 OECD countries over the period 1995-2012. The empirical results unveil a non-monotonic relationship of an “inverted V-shaped” form between regulation and innovation. We argue that beyond certain thresholds increasing the regulatory stringency further results in decreasing sector innovation. Our findings survive robustness checks after the inclusion of two alternative threshold variables (market structure and entry regulation) incurring significant implications for the policy makers and government officials.
L96|Business Dynamics, Knowledge Economy, and the Economic Performance of African Countries|This paper develops a framework (a) to examine whether or not the African business environment hinders or promotes the knowledge economy (KE), (b) to determine how the KE affects economic performance, and (c) how economic performance relates to the inequality-adjusted human socioeconomic development (IHDI) of 53 African countries during the 1996-2010 time period. We estimate the linkages with three related equations. The results support a strong correlation between the dynamics of starting and doing business and variations in KE. The results also show that there exists a weak link between KE and economic performance. Nonetheless, KE-influenced performance plays a more important role in socioeconomic development than some of the conventional control variables like foreign direct investment (FDI), foreign aid, and even private investment.
L96|Enhancing ICT for Quality Education in Sub-Saharan Africa|This research assesses the relevance of information and communication technology (ICT) in primary education quality in a panel of 49 Sub-Saharan African countries for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS) and Instrumental Quantile regressions (IQR). From the 2SLS: (i) mobile phone and internet penetration rates reduce poor quality education and enhancing internet penetration has a net negative effect of greater magnitude. From the IQR: (i) with the exception of the highest quantile for mobile phone penetration and top quantiles for internet penetration, ICT consistently has a negative effect on poor education quality with a non-monotonic pattern. (ii) Net negative effects are exclusively apparent in the median and top quantiles of internet-related regressions. It follows that enhancing internet penetration will benefit countries with above-median levels of poor education quality while enhancing internet penetration is not immediately relevant to reducing poor education quality in countries with below-median levels of poor education quality.
L96|The diffusion of public eServices in European cities|Using a novel dataset on the diffusion of public eServices at the city level in EU 15, this paper contributes to extant empirical literature in three ways. First, it extends the coverage of public eServices beyond eGovernment, investigating four service categories: Infomobility, eProcurement, eGovernment and eHealth. Second, it provides information for both a cross-country and cross-municipality comparison. Third, on the methodological side, it also extends the literature on composite indicators at a municipal level. Cities exhibiting the highest diffusion of public eServices are found to be medium-large, highly endowed with well-educated human capital, and characterised by a lively industrial atmosphere favoured by a reasonable number and variety of production and service activities. The relative performance of the European cities helps identify plausible directions to be taken for policies aimed at favoring the diffusion of public service innovation in Europe.
L96|The Mobile Phone, Information Sharing and Financial Sector Development in Africa: A Quantile Regressions Approach|This study investigates linkages between the mobile phone, information sharing offices (ISO) and financial sector development in 53 African countries for the period 2004-2011. ISO are private credit bureaus and public credit registries. The empirical evidence is based on contemporary and non-contemporary quantile regressions. Two main hypotheses are tested: mobile phones complement ISO to enhance the formal financial sector (Hypothesis 1) and mobile phones complement ISO to reduce the informal financial sector (Hypothesis 2). The hypotheses are largely confirmed. This research adds to the existing body of literature by engaging hitherto unexplored dimensions of financial sector development and investigating the role of mobile phones in information sharing for financial sector development.
L96|Foreign Direct Investment, Information Technology and Economic Growth Dynamics in Sub-Saharan Africa|The research assesses how information and communication technology (ICT) modulates the effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) on economic growth dynamics in 25 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa for the period 1980-2014. The employed economic growth dynamics areGross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, real GDP and GDP per capita while ICT is measured by mobile phone penetration and internet penetration. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalised Method of Moments. The study finds that both internet penetration and mobile phone penetration overwhelmingly modulate FDI to induce overall positive net effects on all three economic growth dynamics. Moreover, the positive net effects are consistently more apparent in internet-centric regressions compared to â€œmobile phoneâ€ -oriented specifications. In the light of negative interactive effects, net effects are decomposed to provide thresholds at which ICT policy variables should be complemented with other policy initiatives in order to engender favorable outcomes on economic growth dynamics. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.
L96|Ratings Design and Barriers to Entry|" I study the impact of consumer reviews on the incentives for firms to participate in the market. Firms produce goods of heterogeneous, unknown quality that is gradually revealed via consumer reviews, and face both entry and exit decisions. A platform combines past reviews to construct firm-specific ratings that help guide consumer search. When the platform integrates all reviews into ratings - full transparency - consumers form queues at the highest-rated firms. This demand cliff induces an S-shaped continuation value for firms as a function of ratings, generating both low entry rates as well as unwanted selection effects - high-quality firms exit early. Whereas firms prefer more feedback when starting out and less feedback when established, equilibrium induces precisely the reverse profile. I then study the design of ratings systems. The platform must balance the need to provide consumers with accurate information against the need to encourage high-quality firms to enter and remain active. The key insight is that optimal rating systems involve upper censorship, i.e. the suppression of reviews from highly-rated firms' ratings, as a means of incentive provision. This makes the task of ""climbing the ratings hill"" less daunting, stimulating participation. An exploratory calibration using data provided by Yelp! estimates a consumer welfare gain of roughly 7% from adopting the optimal policy."
L96|Steering Incentives and Bundling Practices in the Telecommunications Industry| We model mixed-bundle pricing by internet service providers (ISPs) to study their incentive to steer consumers across different subscription options and influence usage decisions. Using unique panel data from an ISP, we test predictions from the model. We find that the ISP's introduction of internet usage allowances and overage charges steered internet-only consumers into bundled TV and internet subscriptions; this effect was greatest for heavy users of streaming services most similar to conventional TV. Internet usage growth –- especially in streaming video services –- was curtailed for consumers who added TV subscriptions, and it also fell for consumers who did not upgrade their internet usage allowances. We discuss the implications of these findings for antitrust and regulatory issues in the telecommunications industry.
L96|Referral, Learning and Inventory Decision Making in a Social Network| We examine the impact of social learning in a referral program where customers' preferences are correlated in a social network. We characterize customers purchasing strategies based on their information and their types, and derive the demand distributions when customers are involved in social learning in a referral program. We find that the bias and variance trade-off in the demand distribution. The existence of uninformed customers will bring more bias to the demand. Social learning can moderate this effect at the expense of increasing demand variance. We investigate the firm's inventory decision in a referral program. We find that the stock-out of one product will influence the demand of the other product when customers are involved in social learning. Multiple referral reduces the effect of stock-out but dramatically increase the demand variance. We design the optimal referral so that it generates sufficient market exposure without incurring too much on the inventory cost.
L96|Walking and Talking: The Effect of Smartphone Use and Group Conversation on Pedestrian Speed|By testing the walking speed of groups of pedestrians and of phone users, followers of groups and of phone users, and of people uninfluenced by phone users and groups, from different sites it could been seen that groups of people and phone users, and often followers of phone users, walk significantly slower than people uninfluenced by phone. In a narrow path people in groups and phone users not only slow themselves down but also slow the people behind. The rise of the smartphone correlates with a reduction in walking speed.
L96|Remittances, ICT and Doing Business in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study examines how linkages between information and communication technology (ICT) and remittances affect the doing of business. The focus is on a panel of 49 sub-Saharan African countries for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments. While we establish some appealing results in terms of net negative effects on constraints to the doing of business (i.e. time to start a business and time to pay taxes), some positive net effects are also apparent (i.e. number of start-up procedures, time to build a warehouse and time to register a property). We also establish ICT penetration thresholds at which the unconditional effect of remittances can be changed from positive to negative, notably: (i) for the number of start-up procedures, an internet level of 9.00 penetration per 100 people is required while (ii) for the time to build a warehouse, a mobile phone penetration level of 32.33 penetration per 100 people is essential. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess linkages between ICT, remittances and doing business in Sub-Saharan Africa.
L96|Information asymmetry, financialization, and financial access|This study investigates whether information sharing channels that are meant to reduce information asymmetry have led to an increase in financial access. The study employs a Generalized Method of Moments technique using data from 53 African countries during the period from 2004 to 2011 to examine this linkage. Information sharing channels are theoretically designed to promote the formal financial sector and discourage the informal financial sector. The study uses two information sharing channels: private credit bureaus and public credit registries. The study found that both information sharing channels have a positive and significant impact on financial access. The study also found that public credit registries complement the formal financial sector to promote financial access. Policy implications are discussed.
L96|Ict In Reducing Information Asymmmetry For Financial Sector Competition|In this study, we examine the role of information and communication technology in complementing information sharing bureaus (or private credit bureaus and public credit registries) for financial sector competition. Hitherto unexplored dimensions of financial sector competition are employed, namely: financial sector dynamics of formalization, informalization and non-formalization.
L96|Responsible use of crop protection products and Nigeria’s growth enhancement support scheme|We examine the impact of the federal government of Nigeria’s (FGN) growth enhancement support scheme (GESS) on responsible use of crop protection products (CPPs) in rural Nigeria. Results from the use of logistic regressions show that GESS significantly impact on farmers’ access to CPPs, but does not significantly impact on farmers’ knowledge and skill of CPP application, and in several cases the misuse has led to deterioration of soil fertility. Findings suggests that embracing information on recommended CPPs, dose rates, dilutions, timing, frequency of applications and precautions should form the foundation of GESS activity attributable to CPPs in sub-Saharan Africa.
L96|The impact of e-wallet on informal farm entrepreneurship development in rural Nigeria|Transforming agriculture from a largely subsistence enterprise to a profitable commercial venture is both a prerequisite and a driving force for accelerated development and sustainable growth in sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this investigation is to assess the impact of the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) e-wallet programme on informal farm entrepreneurship development in rural Nigeria. Informal sector farmers are those that are not legally registered at the national level though could be connected to a registered association. The research is motivated by the absence of literature focusing on the problem statement or objective of study. One thousand, one hundred and fifty-two rural farmers were sampled across the six geo-political zones of Nigeria. Results from the use of a bivariate probit model indicate that the mobile phone-based technology via the e-wallet programme is a critical factor that has enhanced farm entrepreneurship in rural Nigeria. However, results also show that the impact of mobile phones (as a channel to accessing and using modern agricultural inputs) is contingent on how mobile networks are able to link farmers who live in rural areas and work mainly in farming. The results suggest that increasing mobile phone services in rural Nigeria enhances farmers’ knowledge, information and adoption of improved farm inputs and by extension, spurs rural informal sector economic activities in sub-Saharan Africa. Implications for practice, policy and research are discussed.
L96|Challenges of Doing Business in Africa: A Systematic Review| This paper provides a systematic review of challenges to doing business in Africa. It complements the extant literature by answering two critical questions: what are the linkages between the ease of doing business and economic development; and what are the challenges to doing business in Africa? In providing answers to these questions, the nexus between the ease of doing business and economic development is discussed in six main strands, namely: wealth creation and sharing; opportunities of employment; balanced regional and economic development; Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and GDP per capita; standards of living and exports. Moreover, challenges to doing business are articulated along the following lines: (i) issues related to the cost of starting a business and doing business; (ii) shortage of energy and electricity; (iii) lack of access to finance; and (v) high taxes and low cross-border trade.
L96|Optimum location of DG units considering operation conditions|The optimal sizing and placement of Distributed Generation units (DG) are becoming very attractive to researchers these days. In this paper a two stage approach has been used for allocation and sizing of DGs in distribution system with time varying load model. The strategic placement of DGs can help in reducing energy losses and improving voltage profile. The proposed work discusses time varying loads that can be useful for selecting the location and optimizing DG operation. The method has the potential to be used for integrating the available DGs by identifying the best locations in a power system. The proposed method has been demonstrated on 9-bus test system.
L96|Net Neutrality, Prioritization and the Impact of Content Delivery Networks|We analyze competition between Internet Service Providers (ISPs) where consumers demand heterogeneous content within two Quality-of-Service (QoS) regimes, Net Neutrality and Paid Prioritization, and show that paid prioritization increases the static efficiency compared to a neutral network. We also consider paid prioritization intermediated by Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). While the use of CDNs is welfare neutral, it results in higher consumer prices for internet access. Regarding incentives to invest in network capacity we show that discriminatory regimes lead to higher incentives than the neutral regime as long as capacity is scarce, while investment is highest in the presence of CDNs.
L96|Hunting the Big Five: Twenty-first Century Antitrust in Historical Perspective|Voices along the whole of the political spectrum are calling for heightened scrutiny of American information-technology companies, especially the Big Five of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. One of the principal themes of this uprising is that present-day antitrust policy, forged in the rusty era of steel, oil, and cars, is now obsolete. We are in the age of information, which ipso facto calls for new rules. A second animating theme is that the antitrust thinking of the Chicago School, which came to prominence in the last quarter of the last century, must be completely overthrown. Proponents of this new antitrust ground their arguments by returning to the historical roots of American antitrust policy. My contention, however, is that the new antitrust gets this history wrong. It both misconceives the nature of the competitive process and deliberately refuses to confront the political economy of antitrust. In so doing, it adopts some of the worst traits of the Chicago School it criticizes while manifesting few of that school’s many virtues.
L96|Zero-rating, network effects, and capacity investments|We consider internet service providers? incentives to zero-rate, i.e. do not count towards data allowances, the consumption of certain services, in the absence of payments from content providers. In a general model with various types of network effects, service substitutes or complements, monopoly and duopoly, we show that ISPs adopt zero-rating and that it increases consumer surplus and total welfare if network effects are strong enough. Capacity investment increases (decreases) with network effects if services are complements (substitutes). Under competition, the decision to zero-rate depends the residual network effect, which includes the impacts of spillovers and brand differentiation. JEL codes: D21, L51, L96
L96|Auction design and auction outcomes|We study the impact of spectrum auction design on the prices paid by telecommunications operators for two decades across 85 countries. Our empirical strategy combines information about competition in the local market, the level of adoption and a wide range of socio-economic indicators and process specific variables. Using a micro dataset of almost every mobile spectrum auction performed so far—both regional and national—we show that auction design affects final prices paid. Two designs (SMRA with augmented switching and CCA with core pricing) result in auctions with systematically higher normalized returns. Further, we document that spectrum ownership appears to affect prices paid in subsequent auctions. We discuss the mechanisms of cost minimization and foreclosure faced by operators in different regulatory environments. Our findings have implications for policy-makers and regulators.
L96|Cooperative investment, access, and uncertainty|This paper compares the impacts of traditional one-way access obligations and the new regulatory scheme of co-investment on the roll-out of network infrastructures. We show that compulsory access leads to smaller roll-out, first because it reduces the returns from investment, and second because in the presence of uncertainty it provides access seekers with an option whose exercise hurts investors. Co-investment without access obligations leads to risk sharing and eliminates the access option, implying highest network coverage. Allowing for access on top of co-investment actually decreases welfare if the access price is low.
L96|Transition from copper to fiber broadband: The role of connection speed and switching costs|We estimated a mixed logit model using data on the broadband technologies chosen by 94,388 subscribers of a single European broadband operator on a monthly basis between January and December 2014. We found that consumers have similar valuation of DSL connection speeds in the range between 1 and 8 Mbps. Moreover, in January 2014, the valuation of FttH connections with a speed of 100 Mbps was not much higher than of DSL connections with a speed of 1 to 8 Mbps, but it has increased quickly over time and became significantly higher at the end of the period in December 2014. The small initial difference in the valuation of DSL and FttH connections may be because consumers’ basic Internet requirements such as browsing, emailing, reading news, shopping, and even watching videos online could be satisfied with a connection speed below 8 Mbps. We also found that consumers face significant switching costs when changing broadband tariff plans, which are substantially higher when switching from DSL to FttH technology. According to counterfactual simulations based on our model, switching costs between technologies are the main factor which slows down consumer transition from DSL to FttH.
L96|Impact Of Competition, Investment, And Regulation On Prices Of Mobile Services: Evidence From France|In this paper, we assess the impact of competition, investment, and regulation on prices of mobile services in France. We estimate hedonic price regressions using data on tariff plans offered by the main mobile telecommunications operator in France between May 2011 and December 2014. In this time period, the obtained quality‐adjusted price index decreased by about 42.8% as compared to a decline in weighted average prices without quality‐adjustment of 8.7%. In a second step, we relate the quality‐adjusted prices to a set of competition, investment, and regulation variables and find that the launch of 4G networks by mobile operators was the main driver of price reductions for classic tariffs with commitment. Low‐cost tariffs without commitment which were introduced to pre‐empt the entry of low‐cost competitor declined at the time of entry. Moreover, we find that regulation, which is approximated by the level of mobile termination charges and international roaming price caps for voice and data, has a joint significant impact on quality‐adjusted prices. In percentage terms, competition is responsible for about 23.4% of total price decline and investments in 4G for 56.1%. We conclude that the reduction in quality‐adjusted prices in the last years was largely caused by competition between operators for a new 4G technology and by entry of a fourth low‐cost operator.

L96|Threshold of Preference for Collusion and Interconnection Fees in Different Market Structures : the Tunisian Mobile Market Case|We present a Cournot model that compares the critical threshold of collusion in Duopoly and Oligopoly Markets where the actors are private, mixed or public. We assume that the incentive critical threshold for collusion depends on the interconnection fees. The different threshold values calculated in each Market structure are then estimated, using the OLS method, with variables related to the Tunisian market structures and prices. The Econometric estimation of the different threshold values is consistent with our theoretical results. Our findings can be used by the decision makers to control collusion, by acting on the level of interconnection fees for each market structure and by implementing the suitable market liberalization policies in this sector.
L96|Do digital information technologies help unemployed job seekers find a job? Evidence from the broadband internet expansion in Germany|This paper studies effects of the introduction of a new digital mass medium on reemployment of unemployed job seekers. We combine data on high-speed (broadband) internet availability at the local level with individual register data on the unemployed in Germany. We address endogeneity by exploiting technological peculiarities in the network that affected the roll-out of high-speed internet. The results show that high-speed internet improves reemployment rates after the first months of the unemployment spell. This is confirmed by complementary analysis with individual survey data suggesting that online job search leads to additional formal job interviews after a few months in unemployment.

L96|Is internet on the right track? The digital divide, path dependence, and the rollout of New Zealand’s ultra-fast broadband|Using data on internet access for New Zealand’s 46,637 meshblocks, we examine issues of path dependence and the digital divide. We test whether areas that had the best railway access in the 1880s also have best access to new fibre internet infrastructure. Results suggest strong path dependence with respect to topography: people in areas that lacked 19th century rail due to remoteness or terrain are much less likely to have prioritised fibre access and slightly less likely to have current or (planned) future fibre access. Next, we examine path dependence with respect to ethnicity, given that 19th century railways deliberately avoided predominantly M?ori areas. The results suggest weak path dependence: countrywide, M?ori are slightly less likely to get fibre access than other New Zealanders, though are slightly more likely to have access within urban areas. Finally, we examine whether the rollout of fibre is increasing or decreasing the digital divide in access between rich and poor. Results show that those in more deprived areas are the most likely to benefit from fibre access, because these areas also tend to be denser and density was a factor in determining the path of the fibre rollout.
L96|Sustainable economic policy and well-being: The relationship between adjusted net savings and subjective well-being|We analyse the relationship between subjective wellbeing (SWB) and the World Bank’s measure of a country’s economic sustainability, adjusted net savings (ANS). We model SWB at individual level and at aggregated group level as a function of past ANS levels, after controlling for a country’s initial levels of SWB. The empirical models utilise World Values Surveys (WVS) data for self-reported life-satisfaction (our proxy for SWB). Our results show that ANS is negatively associated with future SWB outcomes over relatively short timespans (10-15 years) but this relationship is neutralised, or even reversed, for a longer timespan (20 years). The results demonstrate an important challenge in political economy. Governments that choose to save less in the short term may be able to spend more on the well-being of the current generation (i.e. current voters) but they diminish the reserves available to improve future generations’ well-being. At a more technical level, our results reinforce the concept that ANS is a useful sustainability indicator for infinite (or at least very long) time horizons, but it is not a good indicator of well-being developments over short time horizons.

L96|Inequality, ICT and financial access in Africa|This study investigates the role of information and communication technology (ICT) on income inequality through financial development dynamics of depth (money supply and liquid liabilities), efficiency (at banking and financial system levels), activity (from banking and financial system perspectives) and size, in 48 African countries for the period 1996 to 2014. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments. While both financial depth and size are established to reduce inequality contingent on ICT, only the effect of financial depth in reducing inequality is robust to the inclusion of time invariant variables to the set of strictly exogenous variables. We extend the analysis by decomposing financial depth into its components, namely: formal, informal, semi-formal and non-formal financial sectors. The findings based on this extension show that ICT reduces income inequality through formal financial sector development and financial sector formalization as opposed to informal financial sector development and financial sector informalization. The study contributes at the same time to the macroeconomic literature on measuring financial development and responds to the growing field of addressing post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) inequality challenges by means of ICT and financial access.

L96|Does state aid for broadband deployment in rural areas close the digital and economic divide?|We evaluate the impact of a major European state aid programme for speed upgrades in broadband internet availability applied to rural areas in the German state of Bavaria throughout 2010 and 2011. We use a matched difference-in-differences estimation strategy that compares treated and untreated municipalities that are balanced with respect to funding criteria. We find that aided municipalities have a significantly higher broadband coverage at higher speed than non-aided municipalities. This increase in broadband coverage does not, on average, benefit the local population in terms of increase in local jobs per resident or wages. However, these effects are heterogeneous across skill groups. Furthermore, we find positive effects on the employment rate among residents. Taking these results together suggests that an increase in broadband coverage through state aid protects rural areas from depopulation (while residents work at other locations), but does not contribute to a further closing of the economic divide in the form of creating new jobs.
L96|Communications Technology and Terrorism|By facilitating the flow of information in society, communications technology (CT; e.g., newspapers, radio, television, the internet) can help terrorists to (i) spread their message, (ii) recruit followers, and (iii) coordinate among group members. However, CT also facilitates monitoring and arresting terrorists. This paper formulates the hypothesis that a society’s level of CT is systematically related to terrorism. We introduce a simple theoretical framework, suggesting that terrorism first becomes more attractive with a rise in CT, but then decreases, following an inverted U-shape. Accessing data for 199 countries from 1970-2014, we find evidence for these predictions: Terrorism peaks at intermediate ranges of CT and corresponding magnitudes are sizeable. Our estimations control for a range of potentially confounding factors, as well as country- and year-fixed effects. Results are consistent throughout a battery of robustness checks and placebo regressions. Finally, we find no evidence of a potential reporting bias explaining our findings.
L96|Unbundling the Incumbent and Deployment of High-Speed Internet: Evidence from France|In this paper, we study the impact of competition on the legacy copper network on the deployment of high-speed broadband. We first develop a theoretical model, which shows that the relation between the number of competitors and investment in a quality-improving technology can be positive if the quality of the new technology is high enough, and is negative otherwise. We test these theoretical predictions using data on broadband deployments in France in more than 36,000 local municipalities. First, using panel data over the period 2011-2014, we estimate a model of entry into local markets by alternative operators using local loop unbundling (LLU). Second, using cross-sectional data for the year 2015, we estimate how the number of LLU entrants impacts the deployment of high-speed broadband, controlling for the endogeneity of LLU entry. We find that a higher number of LLU competitors implies lower incentives to deploy and expand coverage of fast broadband, with speed of 30Mbps or more. By contrast, a higher number of local competitors has a positive effect on the incentive to deploy super-fast broadband, with speed of 100Mbps or more, but has no significant effect on the incentive to expand coverage of this technology.
L96|Prioritization vs zero rating: Discrimination on the internet|This paper analyzes two business practices on the mobile internet market, paid prioritization and zero-rating. Both violate the principle of net neutrality by allowing the internet service provider to discriminate different content types. In recent years these practices have attracted considerable media attention and regulatory interest. The EU, and until recently the US have banned paid prioritization but tolerated zero-rating under conditions. With prioritization, the ISP delivers content at different speeds and it is equivalent to a discrimination in terms of quality. With zero-rating, the ISP charges different prices for content and it is equivalent to a discrimination in terms of prices. We first show that neither of these practices lead to the exclusion of a content provider, a serious concern of net neutrality advocates. The ISP chooses prioritization when traffic is highly valuable for content providers and congestion is severe, and zero-rating in all other cases. Furthermore, investment in network capacity is suboptimal in the case of prioritization and socially optimal under zero-rating.
L96|Telecommunication Submarine-Cable Deployment and the Digital Divide in Sub-Saharan Africa|The recent deployment of fibre-optic submarine cables (SMCs) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) raised the prospects for the digital economy expansion and the whole sub-continent take-off, but also exposed countries and populations to new sources of vulnerability. This paper provides empirical evidence on the ambivalent effect of SMC deployment on the digital divide in 46 SSA countries. On the one hand, results show that the laying of SEACOM, MainOne and EASSy cables in 2009-2010 has yielded a three percentage points increase in internet penetration rates. This is a huge increase, meaning that the deployment of these cables has almost doubled the penetration of Internet in the sub-continent’s population. On the other hand, exogenous sources of telecommunication disruptions related to SMC laying – the country’s exposure to SMC outages and digital isolation – are found to reduce internet and mobile penetration rates, to lower investments in ICTs, and to increase mobile-cellular tariffs and the wireline network instability. Therefore, while SMC arrival in SSA has reduced the digital divide, this divide would be lower if SSA countries were less digitally vulnerable.
L96|Estimating Consumer Inertia in Repeated Choices of Smartphones|In this paper, we use a unique database on switching between mobile handsets in a sample of about 5,000 subscribers using tariffs without commitment from a single mobile operator on monthly basis between March 2012 and December 2014. We estimate discrete choice model in which we account for disutility from switching to a different operating systems and handset brands and for unobserved time-persistent preferences for operating systems and brands. Our estimation results indicate presence of significant state-dependency in the choices of operating systems and brands. We find that it is harder for consumers to switch from iOS to Android and other operating systems than from Android and other operating systems to iOS. Moreover, we find that there is significant time-persistent heterogeneity in preferences for different operating systems and brands, which also leads to state-dependent choices. We use our model to simulate market shares in the absence of switching costs and conclude that the market share of Android and smaller operating systems would increase at the expense of the market share of iOS.
L96|Prioritization vs Zero-Rating: Discrimination on the Internet|This paper analyzes two business practices on the mobile internet market, paid prioritization and zero-rating. Both violate the principle of net neutrality by allowing the internet service provider to discriminate different content types. In recent years these practices have attracted considerable media attention and regulatory interest. The EU, and until recently the US have banned paid prioritization but tolerated zero-rating under conditions. With prioritization, the ISP delivers content at different speeds and it is equivalent to a discrimination in terms of quality. With zero-rating, the ISP charges different prices for content and it is equivalent to a discrimination in terms of prices. We first show that neither of these practices lead to the exclusion of a content provider, a serious concern of net neutrality advocates. The ISP chooses prioritization when traffic is highly valuable for content providers and congestion is severe, and zero-rating in all other cases. Furthermore, investment in network capacity is suboptimal in the case of prioritization and socially optimal under zero-rating.
L96|Market Entry, Fighting Brands and Tacit Collusion: The Case of the French Mobile Telecommunications Market|We study a major new entry in the French mobile telecommunications market, followed by the introduction of fighting brands by the three incumbent firms. Using an empirical oligopoly model with differentiated products, we show that the incumbents' launch of the fighting brands can be rationalized only as a breakdown of tacit collusion. In the absence of entry the incumbents successfully colluded on restricting their product variety to avoid cannibalization; the new entry of the low-end competition made such semi-collusion more difficult to sustain because of increased business stealing incentives. Consumers gained considerably from the added variety of the new entrant and the fighting brands, and to a lesser extent from the incumbents' price response to the entry.
L96|Access and Cooperative Investment under Asymmetric Infrastructure Competition|We introduce a model of asymmetric competition where two network operators with different investment costs may build an internet access infrastructure and where a virtual operator provides services through third-party access. We show that the virtual operator requests access from the low cost network operator, because it reduces the geographical area where both network operators build an infrastructure. We also show that potential entry of a virtual operator increases welfare if the access price and the cost asymmetry between the network operators is high enough. Finally, regardless of whether a virtual operator is allowed to enter the market or not, standard access regulation leads to broader infrastructure coverage than co-investment if and only if the profit of a network operator that builds a monopolistic infrastructure is higher than the total profit two network operators that both invest.
L96|Estimating Consumer Inertia in Repeated Choices of Smartphones|In this paper, we use a unique dataset on switching between mobile handsets in a sample of about 8,623 subscribers using tariffs without handset subsidies from a single mobile operator on a monthly basis between July 2011 and December 2014. We estimate a discrete choice model in which we account for disutility from switching to different operating systems and handset brands and for unobserved time-persistent preferences for operating systems and brands. Our estimation results indicate the presence of significant inertia in the choices of operating systems and brands. We find that it is harder for consumers to switch from iOS to Android and other operating systems than from Android and other operating systems to iOS. Moreover, we find that there is significant time-persistent heterogeneity in preferences for different operating systems and brands, which also leads to state-dependent choices. We use our model to simulate market shares in the absence of switching costs and conclude that the market shares of Android and smaller operating systems would increase at the expense of the market share of iOS.
L96|The Nature and Magnitude of the Effects of Asymmetric Regulation of Mobile Termination Rates on the Mexican Retail Prices|"In theory, network profits are independent of the reciprocal termination rates when operators charge nondiscriminatory call prices (Laffont, Rey and Tirole, 1998). Additionally, termination rates can be used to subsidize subscriber acquisition cost. This issue is typically known as a ""waterbed effect"", where a reduction (increase) in termination rates leads to corresponding increase (reduction) in subscription fees to consumers. We are using a practical case for testing the effects in the final prices for regulatory policy with several changes in mobile termination rates based on an asymmetric price access regulation. In our example, the termination rates have been part of a vertical restriction strategy. The observed network-base price discrimination implemented by the major network (Telcel) resulted in deadweight efficiencies lost and created barriers to new entrance and blocked growth for the small networks OECD (2012). Historically, profits margins and mobile prices comes down whenever regulator have reduced termination rates; following the income effects in subscription (Tangeras, 2014). Having in mind this fact, regulators would diminish termination rates in order to pushdown mobile prices and stimulate competition, rest on a cost-based asymmetric price regulation. The further research allows a statistical assessment of the asymmetric price regulation implemented by the Mexican regulatory authority during January 2013 to June 2017. This paper evaluates if asymmetric regulation brings a better impact in the Mexican consumer welfare, driving the retail prices of mobile services down, also the effectivity of this policy for the next years, taking in to account that there is not significant change in the market share among all mobile networks."
L96|Go for gigabit? First evidence on economic benefits of (ultra-)fast broadband technologies in Europe|"The literature on the effects of telecommunications infrastructure investments find positive macroeconomic effects, however, it is severely constrained because it could hitherto only analyze investment up to ""basic"" broadband but not up to the newer generations of ""fast"" and ""ultra-fast"" broadband; in particular there is no such evidence available at the EU level so far. Utilizing a comprehensive panel dataset of EU27 member states for the period from 2003-2015, we estimate a small but significant effect of fiber-based ultra-fast broadband over and above the effects of basic broadband on GDP. Adoption of hybrid-fiber fast broadband is incrementally to basic broadband insignificant. Our cost-benefit analysis implies that policy intervention - as foreseen by the European Commission in its public policy targets - is only justified for coverage and adoption levels of around 50% of fast or ultra-fast broadband, whereas for 100% coverage levels we find net losses to society. Thus, it appears that - for the time being and according to the policy principle of ""technological neutrality"" - a combination of basic broadband, fast and ultra-fast broadband entails the largest economic net benefits to society."
L96|Public Policy Targets in EU Broadband Markets: The Role of Technological Neutrality|The European Commission has recently sought to substantially revise how it regulates the telecommunication industry, with a key goal being to incentivise investment in high-speed broadband networks. Ambitious goals have been set regarding the availability and quality of broadband across the European Union, initially in the 'Digital Agenda for Europe' and more recently in its 'Gigabit strategy'. These goals reflect the view of many that there are widespread and significant socio-economic benefits associated with broadband. Our analysis explores the consequence of target setting at a European level, in terms of encouraging investment and picking which technology should be adopted within the context of technological neutrality. We demonstrate that while public policy targets favour specific technologies, especially when the target is defined with regards to fast broadband speeds, the technological choices that occur within a Member State are shaped by the complex and dynamic interaction between a series of path dependencies that may vary significantly across as well as within Member States. Furthermore, taking into account the ecosystem's tremendous evolution, the technological choices that are made within markets reflect both demand and supply uncertainties. To assist with understanding the interaction between those forces that shape, to lesser or greater extent, the choice of one technology over another, we propose a four-phase framework. This framework is not a definitive statement of the relationships that we have identified, but rather serves as a mechanism that illustrates the challenges associated with adopting and then sticking with technological neutrality in policy making.
L96|The Impact of Broadband Internet on Employment in France|The impact of broadband Internet on employment is ambiguous, but empirical evidence is still limited. In this paper, we exploit data on a massive adoption of broadband Internet in France to investigate the impact of broadband Internet on employment. Using a fuzzy difference-in-difference estimation strategy, we find that broadband Internet destroy jobs, although the unemployment rate seems not to be affected. This job destruction occurs in manufacturing activities, contrary to the service sector where broadband Internet adoption creates jobs. In addition, we find that raising the level of education in urban areas tends to alleviate the negative impact of broadband Internet on employment.
L96|Analysis of People's Willingness to Use Personalization Services in Times of Disaster|Japan has experienced major earthquake disasters in the past. The Great East Japan Earthquake of March 11, 2011 caused enormous damage. Subsequently, in April 2016, a major tremor centered in Kumamoto Prefecture in Kyushu also occurred. In the event of such a disaster, it is important to ensure that medical services are available and that a lifeline is secured. The use of information and communication technology, or ICT, is essential in implementing such efforts in an efficient manner. For example, ICT is very helpful in searching for evacuation routes, locating evacuation sites, tracking supply shortages, and understanding the situation at medical facilities. The use of ICT for such purposes requires personal information. Users can find their evacuation routes precisely because their locations are confirmed with GPS. People will also be able to locate medical facilities to receive special treatment if they register beforehand their pre-existing conditions. Thus, personal information utilization services are extremely effective in times of disaster. On the other hand, the use of personal information could raise concerns about privacy violations. While the use of personal information may allow for valuable services, privacy could be violated if data are leaked or handled in an inappropriate manner.
L96|Estimating the impact of co-investment in fiber to the home coverage|Does co-investment enhance fiber to the home (FTTH) coverage? We combine several French municipality-level datasets to answer this question. We find that a 1% co-financing share by co-investors leads to an increase in FTTH coverage by 0.8% during the 2013-2016 study period and a 0.6% annual progression. This result is robust to changes in the specification and instrument and is consistent with the outcome of a simple difference-in-differences analysis comparing FTTH coverage in co-investment areas with areas with no co-investment ceteris paribus. In addition, we find that a 1% co-investment increases FTTH adoption among Orange's fixed broadband customers by 1.2% and decreases Orange's total fixed broadband penetration for asymmetric digital subscriber lines (ADSL) plus FTTH coverage by 1.1%, which benefits competitors. Our findings confirm that co-investment supports the policy objectives of coverage, adoption and competition and should be supported by regulation.
L96|Zukunftsfaktor 5G: Eine ökonomische Perspektive|"Der Megatrend Digitalisierung erfasst immer mehr Bereiche von Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft. Laut Bundesministerium für Verkehr und digitale Infrastruktur werden beide Bereiche bald vollständig von Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien durchdrungen sein. Doch diese Verbindung der analogen und digitalen Welt wird nur mit Hilfe einer geeigneten Infrastruktur gelingen. Ein Kernbestandteil ist dabei 5G. Darunter wird die ""kommende Mobilfunkgeneration"" verstanden (BMVI, 2017, 2). Doch 5G ist nicht bloß eine Weiterentwicklung von 4G beziehungsweise LTE, dem aktuellen Mobilfunkstandard. 5G führt gegenüber LTE zu einem wesentlich verbesserten mobilen Breitband, ermöglicht eine umfassende Maschine-Maschine-Kommunikation und auch allgemein eine zuverlässige und verzögerungsfreie Kommunikation (Fuest et al., 2018, 20). Des Weiteren geht 5G ebenfalls mit einer hohen Energieeffizienz einher (Andrews et al., 2014) und ermöglicht das sogenannte Network Slicing (Deutsche Telekom, 2018). Network Slicing beschreibt die Eigenschaft, ein Netz in verschiedene Netze aufzusplitten. Diese virtuellen Netze können sogar zu unterschiedlichen Zwecken eingesetzt werden. Zu diesen zählen beispielsweise die Echtzeit-Kommunikation mittels Video-Chat und einer hohen Datenrate oder das Internet der Dinge mittels Sensoren und einer niedrigen Datenrate. Die Aufteilung des Netzes kann zudem schnell variiert werden. (...)"
L96|Mobile telephony in emerging markets: The importance of dual-SIM phones|A substantial share of customers in emerging markets use dual-SIM phones and subscribe to two mobile networks. A primary motive for so called multi-simming is to take advantage of cheap on-net services from both networks. In our modelling effort, we augment the seminal model of competing telephone networks á la Laffont, Rey and Tirole (1998b) by a segment of flexible price hunters that may choose to multi-sim. According to our findings, in equilibrium, the networks set a high off-net price in the linear tariffs to achieve segmentation. This induces the price hunters to multi- sim. We show that increased deployment of dual-SIM phones may induce a mixing equilibrium with high expected on-net prices. Thus, somewhat paradoxically, deployment of a technology that increases substitutability, and thereby competition, may end up raising prices.

L96|Do Digital Information Technologies Help Unemployed Job Seekers Find a Job? Evidence from the Broadband Internet Expansion in Germany|This paper studies effects of the introduction of a new digital mass medium on reemployment of unemployed job seekers. We combine data on high-speed (broadband) internet availability at the local level with individual register data on the unemployed in Germany. We address endogeneity by exploiting technological peculiarities in the network that affected the roll-out of high-speed internet. The results show that high-speed internet improves reemployment rates after the first months of the unemployment spell. This is confirmed by complementary analysis with individual survey data suggesting that online job search leads to additional formal job interviews after a few months in unemployment.
L96|G20 safeguards digital economy vulnerabilities with financial sector focus|The G20 can ensure a secure, resilient, sustainable and responsible digital economy, especially in the financial sector, by removing vulnerabilities in Internet infrastructure, encouraging cross-border cooperation, providing guidance to telecommunications regulators and implementing norms regarding cyber-attacks.
L96|Interconnection and Prioritization|We analyze pricing and competition under paid prioritization within a model of interconnected internet service providers (ISPs), heterogeneous content providers (CPs) and heterogeneous consumers. We show that prioritization is welfare superior to a regime without prioritization (network neutrality) but yields lower incentives for investment in network capacities. As ISPs price discriminate between on-net and off-net CPs, their bottleneck property is propagated and competition for consumers increases resulting in a potential prisoner's dilemma when deciding whether to offer prioritization. We show that peering for prioritized traffic emerges as a collusive outcome and present off-net prices as a further collusive instrument.
L96|Electronic Health Records Prospects in Egypt: A Demand-Side Perspective|The present study sheds light on the expected factors that would impact the Electronic Health Records (EHR) service in Egypt from the demand-side perspective, i.e. the health care consumer. This empirical study is motivated by the widespread use of EHR as a method of promoting health services globally, where it is considered as an efficiency enhancing, cost effective technology. Moreover, the healthcare sector in Egypt is gaining momentum, especially that the comprehensive healthcare and social insurance law are expected to be discussed in the Egyptian Parliament in the near future. The underlying theoretical framework of this study implicates the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology in Consumer Context (UTAUT2). It also applies an integrated framework from multifaceted perceptions to explain the expected adoption decision or behavior of the Egyptian consumer of EHR. The study relies on primary data, a survey of 559 respondents. Responses were collected by a telephone-based nationwide survey of respondents who completed college education or above. Their opinions were collected towards the EHR and the best way to apply this system in Egypt. The sample covered urban governorates, Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt, and it was collected in December 2015. Logistic regression results reveal that statistically significant constructs include the following: whether or not EHR is useful, willingness to pay for it, the gender perspective, the person in charge for uploading results, expected difficulties in using EHR, and the interaction term between gender and internet usage. Finally, more insight and recommendations are provided to policy makers.
L96|Speeding up the internet: Regulation and investment in the European fiber optic infrastructure|In this paper, we study how the coexistence of access regulations for legacy (copper) and fiber networks shapes the incentives to invest in fiber-based network infrastructures. To this end, we first develop a theoretical model that extends the existing literature by, among other things, considering alternative firms with proprietary legacy network (e.g., cable operators) and the presence of asymmetric mandated access to networks. In the empirical part, we test the theoretical predictions using a novel panel data from 27 EU member states pertaining to the last decade. Our main finding is that, in line with the theoretical results, stricter access regulations (i.e., a decrease in access price to legacy network and the adoption of fiber regulation) decrease the incumbent operators’ fiber investments. On the other hand, cable operators are not affected by access regulation. Our paper thus provides policy insights for the on-going revision of the EU regulation framework for the electronic communications industry.
L96|Impact of competition and regulation on prices of mobile services: Evidence from France|In this paper, we assess the impact of competition and regulation on prices of mobile services in France. We estimate hedonic price regressions using data on tariff plans offered by the main mobile telecommunications operator in France between May 2011 and December 2014. In this time period, the obtained quality-adjusted price index decreased by about 51% as compared to a decline in average prices without quality adjustment of 8.9%. In a second step, we relate the quality-adjusted prices to a set of competition and regulation variables and find that the launch of 4G networks by mobile operators was the main driver of price reductions for classic tariffs with commitment. Low cost tariffs without commitment which were introduced to pre-empt the entry of low cost competitor declined at the time of entry. Moreover, we find that regulation, which is approximated by the level of mobile termination charges and international roaming price caps for voice and data, has jointly a significant impact on quality-adjusted prices. In percentage terms, competition is responsible for about 68% of total price decline. We conclude that the reduction in quality-adjusted prices in the last years was largely caused by competition between established operators and by entry of fourth low cost operator.
L96|Tariff diversity and competition policy: Drivers for broadband adoption in the European Union|While second-degree price discrimination is standard in commercial practice in many industries, consumer advocates and public interest groups have reacted with skepticism against tendencies to move away from flat rates and introduce greater tariff diversity. This paper provides an empirical analysis how the differentiation of broadband tariffs with respect to retail prices affects fixed broadband subscription using time-series data. The empirical analysis is based on a unique dataset of 10,200 retail broadband offers spanning the 2003-2011 period and including 23 EU member states. Results show that an increase in tariff diversity provides a significant impetus to broadband adoption, wherefore demands by some public interest groups to limit price discrimination in broadband markets should be viewed with some caution as reduced price discrimination may come at the cost of lower penetration rates.
L96|Analysis of glamorous acquisitions in the telecommunications sector: Overvaluation or success?|This article analyses the performance and value creation of the glamorous operations of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the telecommunications sector, trying to understand if the glamour company´s M&A operations conduct to the stockholder wealth maximization, and the role of acquirer´s characteristics and its behaviour as glamour firm. After calculating the abnormal returns of telecommunications M&A from 2000 to 2010 and evaluating the value creation/destruction of these operations, we conclude that glamour tends to be opposite to value creation in the long run. The glamour firms show significant value destruction in certain timeframes and worse performance than non-glamour firms. From our analysis, it is evident that certain acquirers´ characteristics, such as size, are determinant in the glamour behavior. Related to this, the influence of the intangible assets (and particularly the intangible ratio) is a new contribution from this analysis.
L96|OTT-Messaging and Mobile Telecommunication: A Joint Market? An Empirical Approach|OTT-messenger such as facebook, WhatsApp have gained wide popularity among mobile users while traffic of text messaging has been in strong decline in several countries. This work is the first to provide an empirical analysis how consumption of OTT-messengers affects demand for text messaging and mobile telephony services. Our findings suggest that social and messaging apps may complement demand for text messaging and mobile voice services. More generally we identify the different nature of mobile telecommunication services as key element to explain why reductions of text messaging traffic have been so drastic in some countries and why an analogue development for mobile voice is rather unlikely.
L96|Bundling, consumer retention and entry: evidence from fixed broadband market|This paper answers two empirical questions. First, we analyze how fixed-mobile (quadruple-play) bundling impacts retention of consumers in fixed broadband market. Second, we assess how bundling by the incumbent operator impacts the market share and number of entrants who provide broadband services using incumbent's infrastructure. To address these questions we use a complete database of about 9.5 million subscribers to incumbent fixed broadband operator in a European country between March 2014 and February 2015. This data is combined with information on the market share and number of entrants in about 36,000 municipalities in this country. We find that consumers who bundle fixed and mobile services from the same provider are less likely to churn. Without quadruple-play bundling the annual retention of fixed broadband consumers would increase from 8.4% to 9.2%. Next, we find that the share of consumers having quadruple-play bundles with the incumbent has a negative impact on the market share and number of entrants. In the absence of quadruple- play bundling, the market share of entrants would be higher by about 6.8 percentage points. Quadruple-play bundling has also negative impact on the number of LLU entrants, which is bigger in the case of small LLU operators who cannot provide bundled offers themselves. This suggests that firms which cannot sell fixed-mobile bundles are disadvantaged in competition.
L96|Impact of Very High-Speed Broadband on Local Economic Growth: Empirical Evidence|I estimate the impact of very high-speed broadband networks on some measures of local economic growth in France. I use panel data estimations with time- and municipal-fixed effects. I show that municipalities with a very high-speed broadband network tend to be more attractive for companies. I find a positive impact on the number of companies of all non-farm market sectors operating locally, along with a positive impact on company creation. In addition, municipalities with a very high-speed broadband network provide a more favorable environment for entrepreneurship, as it has a positive effect on the creation of sole proprietorships. The estimation results also show a positive impact on unemployment reduction.
L96|Identifying the Effect of Mobile Operating Systems on the Mobile Services Market|Modern economic theory predicts that tying can serve as a tool for leveraging market power. In line with this economic theory, competition authorities regulate the tying of Microsoft Windows with its Media Player or Internet browser in the EU and Japan. The authorities also take note of the market power of mobile handset operating systems (OSs) over competition in the app and services markets. However, no empirical evidence has thus far been presented on the success of government intervention in the Microsoft case. To assess the effectiveness of government intervention on mobile handset OSs, we identify the extent to which complementarity and consumer preferences affect the correlation between mobile handset OSs and mobile service app markets (mail, search, and map). We find significant positive complementarity between the mail, search, and map services, and mobile handset OSs. However, the elasticities of the mobile handset OS?mobile service correlations are rather small. We conclude that taking action to restrict mobile handset OSs is less effective than acting on mobile services market directly.
L96|Information Value and Interregional Input-Output Structure|This paper establishes an economic theory of information value and volume that differs from Shannon’s mathematical theory of communication (Shannon, 1948). The economics of information should be recognized as an important frontier field of economics to explore the 4th industrial revolution including Internet of the things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). However, we need to construct an fundamental way to analyse information flow and stock. Because of this, the value of information goods as a non-market or market good is measured as agents’ willingness to pay (WTP) for travel and telecommunication from the overall viewpoint of transportation and telecommunication economics. And we construct an economic model for analysing the information flow between head and branch offices. This firms’ total profit is maximized by optimally imputing the amount of time which employees devote to collecting and processing internal and external information. Here, factors of production are internal and external information flows and stock information. Finally we propose information inputoutput table explaining inter-regional information flow of the sample economic model.
L96|The contribution of services trade policies to connectivity in the context of aid for trade|This paper examines how services trade and policies contribute to connectivity. It highlights the economic relevance of services and identifies some key channels through which trade in services contributes to physical and digital connectivity. The paper examines the impact of services trade policies on connectivity in view of recent research showing their impact on sectoral performance, economic welfare and development. Finally, it discusses the positive contribution that aid for trade can make in support of services policies. The paper finds that services sectors play a multifaceted and significant role in connecting countries to the international trading system, and matter greatly to economic development and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Services significantly affect connectivity by: (i) providing the basic infrastructure to support trade in goods; (ii) facilitating supply chains and entering trade as value added embodied in goods; (iii) providing the backbone that enables e-commerce and the on-line supply of services; (iv) and enhancing export diversification through their cross-border electronic supply. The paper underscores that services trade policies have a fundamental impact on connectivity. Restrictions to investment and cross-border trade in services remain high and widespread. But an enabling policy environment - promoting competition, openness to trade and investment, and adequate regulatory frameworks - can enhance connectivity, lower trade costs, and foster growth and economic performance. For example, improving the policy environment for services sectors can help attract the FDI required to meet the SDGs and develop the ICT infrastructure needed to bridge the digital divide. Aid for Trade can play a supportive role in this regard.
L96|The European Electronic Communications Code: A critical appraisal with a focus on incentivizing investment in next generation broadband networks|In September 2016, the European Commission (EC) published its proposal for a directive establishing the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) – with one key aim being the provision of sufficient incentives for infrastructure investments into high-speed communication networks. Based on a detailed review of the theoretical and empirical literature of the most relevant regulatory measures – that is, co-investment models as well as different types of access regulation – we provide a critical appraisal of the respective provisions in the EECC. We find that, although the EECC can generally be seen as a step into the right direction, the expected effects on investment incentives as well as substantial implementation challenges in combination with a high degree of complexity of the envisaged measures contain substantial potential for improvement.
L96|The internet effects on sex crime and murder: Evidence from the broadband internet expansion in Germany|This paper studies the effects of the introduction of a new mass medium on criminal activity in Germany. The paper asks the question of whether highspeed internet leads to higher/lower sex crime offences and murder. I use unique German data on criminal offences and broadband internet measured at the municipality level to shed light on the question. In order to address endogeneity in broadband internet availability, I follow Falck et al. (2014) and exploit technical peculiarities at the regional level that determine the roll-out of high-speed internet. In contrast to findings for Norway (Bhuller et al., 2013), this paper documents a substitution effect of internet and child sex abuse and no effect on rape incidences. The effects on murder increase under the instrumental variable approach however remain insignificant. Overall, the estimated net effects might stem from indirect effects related to differences in reporting crime, a matching effect, and a direct effect of higher and more intensive exposure to extreme and violent media consumption. After investigating the potential channel, I do find some evidence in favor of a reporting effect suggesting that the direct consumption effect is even stronger. Further investigation of the development of illegal pornographic material suggests that the direct consumption channel does play a significant role in explaining the substitution effect.
L96|Static or dynamic efficiency: Horizontal merger effects in the wireless telecommunications industry|This paper studies five mergers in the European wireless telecommunication industry and analyzes their impact on prices and capital expenditures of both merging carriers and their rivals. We find substantial heterogeneity in the relationship between increases in concentration and carriers’ prices. The specifics of each merger case clearly matter. Moreover, we find a positive correlation between the price and the investment effects; when the prices after merger increase (decrease), the investments increase (decrease) too. Thus, we document a trade-off between static and dynamic efficiencies of mergers.
L96|Fiber deployment in Spain|Abstract Next generation access networks will be critical for future economic growth and access to these infrastructures will have major consequences for territorial and social cohesion. This paper examines the economic and competition determinants that serve as incentives for operators to invest in fiber-to-the-home technology. We draw on a dataset comprising 6603 Spanish municipalities with access to broadband services to examine the incumbent’s (Telefónica) deployment of fiber in the period 2010–2013. We show that local loop unbundling competition had a strong positive impact on Telefónica’s fiber deployment, while bitstream competition had a negative effect. Moreover, the incumbent was more likely to invest in municipalities with a large presence of cable operators. We also consider how the municipalities’ sociodemographic characteristics affected the operator’s deployment decision. While market size and population density had a positive effect on investment, the level of unemployment and the percentage of elderly population had a negative impact.
L96|Evaluating mobile number portability policy in the Thai mobile telecommunications market|Abstract Mobile number portability (MNP), which allows consumers to retain their mobile numbers when switching service providers, is expected to promote competition by lowering switching costs. This paper estimates switching costs and switching costs reduction from the MNP policy in Thailand using the mixed logit model with preference heterogeneity on a nationwide survey of mobile telecommunications service usages. The estimation result shows that the MNP policy reduces switching costs by 37% on average and that this benefit is heterogeneous across consumers. The considerable and persistent switching costs call for additional measures to facilitate switching.

L96|Identification in Ascending Auctions, with an Application to Digital Rights Management|This study provides new identification and estimation results for ascending (traditional English or online) auctions with unobserved auction-level heterogeneity and an unknown number of bidders. When the seller's reserve price and two order statistics of bids are observed, we derive conditions under which the distributions of buyer valuations, unobserved heterogeneity, and number of participants are point identified. We also derive conditions for point identification in cases where reserve prices are binding (in which case bids may be unobserved in some auctions) and present general conditions for partial identification. We propose a nonparametric maximum likelihood approach for estimation and inference. We apply our approach to the online market for used iPhones and analyze the effects of recent regulatory changes banning consumers from circumventing digital rights management technologies used to lock phones to service providers. We find that buyer valuations for unlocked phones dropped after the unlocking ban took effect.
L96|Competition and Product Misrepresentation| This paper examines the effect of competition on product quality when product quality is unobserved before purchase. Using a dataset that records the actual broadband internet speed consumers receive as well as the speed the provider claims is being delivered, I find that an additional broadband competitor raises the ratio of actual to claimed speeds for incumbents by between 23 and 32 percent within the first 6 months, but that this effect attenuates after 18 months. This increase is due to improvements in the actual speed, and not just reductions in the claimed speed. I recover the causal effect of competition on product misrepresentation by leveraging the launch of a broadband-capable satellite in mid-2012 and exploiting exogenous variation in the suitability for satellite internet across U.S. counties. I provide suggestive evidence that the reduction in firms’ strategic misrepresentation of their products led to reduced misallocation of consumers across internet plans.
L96|Social Media and the News Industry| The growing influence of internet platforms acting as content aggregators is one of the most important challenges facing the media industry. We develop a parsimonious model to understand the impact of content bundling by a social platform. In our model consumers can access news either directly through a newspaper's website, or indirectly through a platform, which also offers social content. Even though the platform shares revenues with newspapers whose content it publishes, content bundling harms newspapers. Its effect on news quality and news consumption depends on the media market structure and on whether the platform can personalize the content bundle.
L96|Scoping for: Competition in Network Industries: Evidence from Mobile Telecommunications in Rwanda| Many modern technologies have network effects, and as a result lead to industries with natural monopolies. How should societies discipline these industries? This is a preliminary paper that analyzes the scope for competition to affect welfare and investment in the Rwandan mobile phone network during a 4.5 year period of dramatic growth. I use transaction data from nearly the entire network of Rwandan mobile phone subscribers at the time. I use the method and estimates of Bjorkegren (2017), which identify network effects based on usage after adoption. The Rwandan government eventually allowed competition; I evaluate what may have happened had competition been introduced at an earlier stage of the network’s growth. Had the monopolist simply charged the eventual competitive prices, welfare would have risen substantially. However, only a fraction of the revenue from building the rural tower network came from calls within rural areas; as a result, had the rest of the network been split among providers, there may have been lowered incentives to invest. A subsequent version of this paper will simulate the effects of competition under different policy regimes.
L96|The effect of switching costs on prices: an application to the Peruvian mobile phone market|" Based on a game theoretical model I previously developed, I present some evidence of the effect of the unlocked-handset policy recently implemented in Peru based on market analysis and reduced form empirical methods using consumer panel data. From the market analysis, declining prices are observed with the implementation of the policy in January 2015, also the switching rate rocketed since then. To retain consumers and attract rival's consumers, companies responded also with very low on-net prices through their ""private network"" with unlimited minutes, which may have increased the network effects in the market. From my estimation, I found a significant negative effect of switching costs on demand for voice traffic (which suggest a positive effect of the unlocked-handset policy on demand) and positive network effects on the demand."
L96|Net effects of Net Neutrality: The case of Amazon’s Twitch.tv| Net neutrality encourages content provision but also creates congestion externalities from the increase in data traffic. I study the consequences of net neutrality in Twitch.tv, a popular internet platform, by estimating a two-sided market model that considers the interactions between content provision, its consumption and congestion. The platform is non-neutral because it gives preference to the most popular content providers by compressing their data, which makes them accessible to more consumers. I use the estimated preferences and technological parameters to study the counterfactual where net neutrality is imposed in the platform. Consumer welfare would drop 3 percent. The platform would need to significantly increase its investment in its physical infrastructure to compensate consumers for the drop. The drop will be underestimated if congestion is ignored. Content provision does not increase but its quality drops.
L96|A Comparison of Approaches to Deflating Telecoms Services Output|The telecommunications services industry has experienced very large technological progress in the past decades, as measured by technological output metrics. However, the industry’s economic output statistics do not appear to reflect this. Between 2010 and 2015, for example, data usage in the UK expanded by around 900% but real Gross Value Added (GVA) for the industry fell by 4%. While the direction of growth in Telecoms GVA is not the same for all countries, there nonetheless appears to be a wider disconnect between the technological performance and economic measurement of the industry in the UK. This paper argues this can be primarily resolved through strengthening the deflators that are applied to nominal output to produce real GVA. This paper contrasts two methodologically distinct options to estimate the potential bias in the current deflator, informed by both an economic and engineering perspective. Our findings indicate that the current deflator is upward biased and that telecommunications services prices could have fallen between 35% and 90% between 2010 and 2015, considerably more than the current deflator, suggesting the need for continued research in this area.
L96|Austria’s digital transition: The diffusion challenge|Austria’s transition to a digital economy and society is slower than in other high-income small open European economies. The rate and pace of utilisation of eight main ICT applications shows that Austrian firms follow peer country counterparts with a gap, which has widened in most areas in recent years. Two dynamics drive digital transitions and Austria has room for progress in both of them. First, the potential for digitalisation in all firms, and especially in the smaller ones (where gaps are largest) should be freed-up by upgrading the full range of ICT-generic, ICT-specific and ICT-complementary skills. Second, Austria needs to make its business environment more conducive to firm entry and exit. The rate of entry of new firms and their growth are crucial for the diffusion of new business models and ICT innovations but fall behind peer countries. The adoption of ICT innovations by households also follows a staggered path: young and highly educated Austrians adopt ICT applications in similar ways to their counterparts in peer countries, while middle and older age cohorts display noticeable gaps. This calls for policies to help lagging groups become more acquainted with innovations. A whole-of-government approach, including large-scale utilisation of e-government applications in enterprises and households, should help to embrace change and facilitate the flourishing of innovative businesses, work practices and lifestyles throughout Austria. This Working Paper relates to the 2017 OECD Economic Survey of Austria (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-austria.htm)
L96|Consumer switching intentions for telecoms services: evidence from Ireland|Despite long-standing market liberalisation and efforts to reduce switching costs, many consumers have never switched telecoms provider. This paper investigates how consumer and service characteristics relate to switching intentions, using a sample of fixed-line broadband, mobile telephony and landline telephony customers from a 2015 survey conducted by ComReg, Ireland’s National Regulatory Authority. We add to previous work by examining a rich array of personal and service characteristics while controlling for both bill shock and expected gains from switching. We find that long-standing subscribers who have never switched are exceptionally resistant to switching. Bill shock is strongly associated with intention to switch, especially among those more inclined to switch. A similar effect arises for expected gains, especially gains over 20%. These results are consistent with both a preference for fair treatment and with behavioural barriers to switching that require large gains to overcome. The effects of bundling and of the few socioeconomic, supplier or application use characteristics that are statistically significant are smaller and not consistent across markets. This implies that willingness to switch is not simply a characteristic of certain social groups, but is more complex and context dependent.
L96|The synergy of financial sector development and information sharing in financial access: Propositions and empirical evidence|This study assesses the role of information sharing in financialization (or coexistence of financial sub-systems) for financial access. The empirical evidence is based on contemporary and non-contemporary Fixed Effects and Quantile regressions on 53 African countries for the period 2004–2011. The positive complementarity of information sharing offices (ISOs) and financial formalization is an increasing function of financial activity (or access to credit) whereas the negative complementarity of ISOs and financial informalization is a decreasing function of financial activity. In order to leverage on the synergy between ISO and financial formalization for enhanced financial access, some policy measures are proposed.
L96|ICT, Financial Sector Development and Financial Access|Abstract This study assesses the role of ICT (internet and mobile phone penetration) in complementing financial sector development (financial formalization and informalization) for financial access. The empirical evidence is based on generalized method of moments with 53 African countries for the period 2004–2011. The following findings are established from linkages between ICT, financial sector development and financial activity. First, the interaction between ICT and financial formalization (informalization) decreases (increases) financial activity. Second, with regard to net effects, the expected signs are established for the most part. In spite of the negative marginal effects from financial informalization, the overall net effects are positive. Third, the potentially appealing interaction between ICT and informalization produces positive thresholds that are within ranges. Policy implications are discussed in three main strands. They include implications for (i) mobile/internet banking, (ii) a quiet life and (iii) ICT in reducing information asymmetry and surplus liquidity.
L96|ICT, information asymmetry and market power in African banking industry|This study assesses how market power in the African banking industry is affected by the complementarity between information sharing offices and information and communication technology (ICT). The empirical evidence is based on a panel of 162 banks consisting of 42 countries for the period 2001–2011. Three estimation techniques are employed, namely: (i) instrumental variable Fixed effects to control for the unobserved heterogeneity; (ii) Tobit regressions to control for the limited range in the dependent variable; and (iii) Instrumental Quantile Regressions (QR) to account for initial levels of market power. Whereas results from Fixed effects and Tobit regressions are not significant, with QR: (i) the interaction between internet penetration and public credit registries reduces market power in the 75th quartile and (ii) the interaction between mobile phone penetration and private credit bureaus increases market power in the top quantiles. Fortunately, the positive net effects are associated with negative marginal effects from the interaction between private credit bureaus and mobile phone penetration. This implies that mobile phones could complement private credit bureaus to decrease market power when certain thresholds of mobile phone penetration are attained. These thresholds are computed and discussed.
L96|Information asymmetry and conditional financial sector development|Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the role of reducing information asymmetry (IA) on conditional financial sector development in 53 African countries for the period 2004-2011. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical evidence is based on contemporary and non-contemporary quantile regressions. Instruments for reducing IA include public credit registries (PCRs) and private credit bureaus (PCBs). Hitherto unexplored dimensions of financial sector development are used, namely, financial sector dynamics of formalization, informalization, semi-formalization and non-formalization. Findings - The following findings are established. First, the positive (negative) effect of information sharing offices (ISO) on formal (informal) financial development is consistent with theory. Second, ISOs consistently increase formal financial development, with the incidence of PCRs higher in terms of magnitude, and financial sector formalization, with the impact of PCBs higher for the most part. Third, only PCBs significantly decrease informal financial development and both ISOs decrease financial sector informalization. Policy implications are discussed. Originality/value - The study assesses the effect of reducing IA on financial development when existing levels of it matter because current studies based on mean values of financial development provide blanket policy implications which are unlikely to be effective unless they are contingent on prevailing levels of financial development and tailored differently across countries with high, intermediate and low initial levels of financial development.
L96|Improving financial access in Africa: insights from information sharing and financial sector development|The study investigates interactions between information sharing offices, the coexistence of financial sub-systems and financial access. The empirical evidence is based on Quantile regressions in order to articulate countries with low, intermediate and high levels of financial access. The scope of the study is on 53 African countries for the period 2004-2011. The following main results are established. First, the positive association between â€œinformation sharing offices (ISOs)â€ and â€œformal financial sector developmentâ€ consistently increases with improvements in initial levels of credit access. Second, the negative linkage between ISOs and â€œinformal financial sector developmentâ€ consistently decreases with increasing levels of credit access. In summary, we establish that the positive complementarity of ISOs and financial formalization is an increasing function of financial activity (or access to credit) whereas the negative complementarity of ISOs and financial informalization is a decreasing function of financial activity.
L96|Bank Size, Information Sharing and Financial Access in Africa|Purpose - This study investigates how bank size affects the role of information asymmetry on financial access in a panel of 162 banks in 39 African countries for the period 2001-2011. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical evidence is based on instrumental variable Fixed Effects regressions with overlapping and non-overlapping bank size thresholds to control for the QLH (Quiet Life Hypothesis). The QLH postulates that managers of large banks will use their privileges for private gains at the expense of making financial services more accessible to the general public. Financial access is measured with loan price and loan quantity whereas information asymmetry is implicit in the activities of public credit registries and private credit bureaus. Findings - The findings with non-overlapping thresholds are broadly consistent with those that are conditional on overlapping thresholds. First, public credit registries have a decreasing effect on the price of loans with the magnitude of reduction comparable across all bank size thresholds. Second, both public credit registries and private credit bureaus enhance the quantity of loans. Third, compared with public credit registries, private credit bureaus have a greater influence in increasing financial access because they have a significantly higher favourable effect on the quantity and price of loans Fourth, the QLH is not apparent because large banks are not associated with lower levels of financial access compared to small banks. Originality/value - Studies of public credit registries and private credit bureaus in Africa are sparse. This is one of the few to assess linkages between bank size, information asymmetry and financial access.
L96|ICT, conflicts in financial intermediation and financial access: evidence of synergy and threshold effects|Abstract In this study we investigate the role of information and communication technology (ICT) in conflicts of financial intermediation for financial access. The empirical evidence is based on contemporary (or current values) and non-contemporary (or lagged by a year) quantile regressions in 53 African countries for the period 2004-2011. The main findings are: First, the net effect of ICT in formalization for financial activity in the banking system is consistently beneficial with positive thresholds. The fact that corresponding, unconditional and conditional effects are persistently positive is evidence of synergy or complementary effects. Second, the net effect of ICT in financial informalization for financial activity in the financial system is negative with a consistent negative threshold. Hence, the positive (negative) complementarity of ICT and financial formalization (informalization) is an increasing (decreasing) function of financial activity. Policy measures on how to leverage the synergy or complementarity between ICT and financial formalization in order to enhance financial access are discussed.
L96|Risk and systemic risk perception in the telecommunications sector in Brazil: an investor perspective assessment|This article approaches the risk perception towards the Brazilian telecommunications sector and how it might affect the flow of data driven investment in the country. Empirical evaluations are carried out with risk assessment metrics, Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CoVaR), for a sample of telecommunications companies. Such approach is complemented by a descriptive review of the sector´s potential sources of risk and contagion channels. Results present own risk for each company in the sample and their individual contribution to the systemic risk in the sector. Besides, findings suggest that systemic risk perception might play an important role on investors´ decision to invest in the telecommunications sector in Brazil. Final remarks include notes on the potential benefits of adopting risk metrics as a tool to improve governance in the sector.

L96|The Impact of Telecommunication Regulatory Policy on Mobile Retail Price in Sub-Saharan African Countries|This paper examines the eect of regulatory policies on mobile retail prices. Using quarterly data for 8 African countries for the period 2010:Q4 to 2014:Q4 we estimate structural demand and supply equations. We nd that mobile termination rates (MTR) have significant positive impact on mobile retail prices. A decline in average MTR of 10% decreases average mobile retail prices by 2.5%. On the other hand, mobile number portability (MNP) has an insignicant eect on price and subscriptions in selected African countries. This may be due to inadequate implementation of MNP and consecutively low demand for porting numbers. The average market conduct in mobile telecommunications industry for selected African countries can be approximated by Cournot Nash equilibrium, while price elasticity of demand is on average -0.27.

Aber die technischen Anforderungen an das Netz sind gewachsen und dünn besiedelte Regionen abgehängt. Damit Unternehmen und Haushalte gigabitfähig werden, ist die rasche Schließung der verbleibenden Glasfaserlücke unabdingbar. Doch der lange Zeit gelobte Netzwettbewerb ist buchstäblich auf den letzten Metern zum Stillstand gekommen.

L96|OTT-messaging and mobile telecommunication: A joint market? - An empirical approach|OTT-messenger such as facebook, WhatsApp have gained wide popularity among mobile users while traffic of text messaging has been in strong decline in several countries. This work is the first to provide an empirical analysis how consumption of OTT-messengers affects demand for text messaging and mobile telephony services. Our findings suggest that social and messaging apps may complement demand for text messaging and mobile voice services. More generally we identify the different nature of mobile telecommunication services as key element to explain why reductions of text messaging traffic have been so drastic in some countries and why an analogue development for mobile voice is rather unlikely.
L96|Tariff Diversity and Competition Policy: Drivers for Broadband Adoption in the European Union|While second-degree price discrimination is standard in commercial practice in many industries, consumer advocates and public interest groups have reacted with skepticism against tendencies to move away from flat rates and introduce greater tariff diversity. This paper provides an empirical analysis how the differentiation of broadband tariffs with respect to retail prices affects fixed broadband subscription using time-series data. The empirical analysis is based on a unique dataset of 10,200 retail broadband offers spanning the 2003–2011 period and including 23 EU member states. Results show that an increase in tariff diversity provides a significant impetus to broadband adoption, wherefore demands by some public interest groups to limit price discrimination in broadband markets should be viewed with some caution as reduced price discrimination may come at the cost of lower penetration rates.

L96|The Impact of Petrol Prices on Stock Prices of Energy Companies: A Panel Data Analysis for Turkey|The aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of petrol prices on the stock prices of energy companies traded in Istanbul Stock Exchange. To achieve this objective, daily panel data for 9 energy companies are examined for the period between 01/02/2008 and 02/26/2016. For the estimations, random effects and fixed effects panel data estimation methods are used. According to the results, changes in petrol prices effects stock prices of energy companies, negatively. Interest rates and M2 money supply affect stock prices of the energy companies, negatively. In addition to the macro variables, ROA and capital growth are the micro variables affecting stock prices of energy companies.
L96|Merger Effects with Product Complementarity: Evidence from Colombia’s Telecommunications|Mergers of firms producing complementary products have ambiguous effects on consumer welfare. Consumers benefit if the firm, motivated by the internalized profits created by the complementarity, lowers prices. Consumers are hurt if the firm uses bundles to exert price discrimination, making standalone products more expensive. To assess which effect dominates, I use an administrative dataset, which records prices, market shares, and plan attributes of the universe of Colombia’s telecom carriers. I estimate a random coefficients discrete choice model of demand for bundled and standalone telecom products, in which the degree of substitutability or complementarity among products is an essential parameter of interest. I find that major telecom products display a mix of substitutability and complementarity, but in general hardwired and mobile services are complements. Counterfactual experiments using the estimated model indicate positive net effects of mergers with complements: despite a small increase in the price of standalone goods, consumer surplus increased by around 11 million dollars per quarter after the Claro merger. On the other hand I find evidence that mergers between ISPs and mobile carriers reduce the likelihood of poorer households adopting faster broadband.
L96|Liberation Technology: Mobile Phones and Political Mobilization in Africa|Can digital information and communication technology (ICT) foster mass political mobilization? We use a novel geo-referenced dataset for the entire African continent between 1998 and 2012 on the coverage of mobile phone signal together with georeferenced data from multiple sources on the occurrence of protests and on individual participation in protests to bring this argument to empirical scrutiny. We find that mobile phones are instrumental to mass mobilization during economic downturns, when reasons for grievance emerge and the cost of participation falls. Estimated effects are if anything larger once we use an instrumental variable approach that relies on differential trends in coverage across areas with different incidence of lightning strikes. The results are in line with insights from a network model with imperfect information and strategic complementarities in protest provision. Mobile phones make individuals more responsive to both changes in economic conditions - a mechanism that we ascribe to enhanced information - and to their neighbors’ participation – a mechanism that we ascribe to enhanced coordination. Empirically both effects are at play, highlighting the channels through which digital ICT can alleviate the collective action problem.
L96|Evaluating market consolidation in mobile communications|We study the dual relationship between market structure and prices and between market structure and investment in mobile telecommunications. Using a uniquely constructed panel of mobile operators’ prices and accounting information across 33 OECD countries between 2002 and 2014, we document that more concentrated markets lead to higher end user prices. Furthermore, they also lead to higher investment per mobile operator, though the impact on total investment is not conclusive. Our findings are not only relevant for the current consolidation wave in the telecommunications industry. More generally, they stress that competition and regulatory authorities should take seriously the potential trade-off between market power effects and efficiency gains stemming from agreements between firms.
L96|The exclusion of competing one-way essential complements: Implications for net neutrality|We analyze the incentives of internet service providers (ISPs) to break net neutrality by excluding competing one-way essential complements, i.e. internet applications competing with their own products. A typical example is the exclusion of VoIP applications by telecom companies offering internet and voice services. A monopoly ISP may want to exclude a competing internet app if it is of inferior quality and the ISP cannot ask for a surcharge for its use. Competition between ISPs never leads to full app exclusion but it may lead to a fragmented internet where only one ISP offers the application. We show that, both in monopoly and duopoly, prohibiting the exclusion of the app and surcharges for its use does not always improve welfare.

To assess these success factors, we opted to conduct a case study on Mobilink, Pakistan’s leading telecommunications provider. Using our literature reviews, we devised a novel methodology that paired an external source-based assessment model, known as the butterfly model, and found that of the total 76 mechanisms outlined in the butterfly model, only 12 were not at all present at Mobilink, with a further 6 being unclear whether or not they were present also 47% of respondents agreed that grievances expressed by product consumers are a vital factor for thinking of and producing improved products, while another 40% mentioned that they thoroughly scrutinized the suggestions received by their customers before starting the major phase of the product development process. Around 37% of the respondents agreed that Mobilink encourage their customers to contribute in new and better products. The study concludes with some future directions by involving company stakeholders and academic researchers in CKM strategies
L96|Raising rivals’ cost in multi-unit auctions|The objective many telecom regulators want to achieve when they decide to auction spectrum is that acquiring firms pay a market price (based on the opportunity cost principle). The simultaneous ascending auction may fail in this respect, as it provides bidders with an opportunity to engage in strategic demand reduction. This paper asks whether the combinatorial clock auction (CCA) fares better in this respect. We show that the answer to this question depends on the objectives bidders have. If bidders have only the slightest preference to raise rivals’ cost, they will use the opportunities the CCA provides them to engage in strategic demand expansion. This is even the case when the clock phase ends with excess demand.
L96|The prospects for smart energy prices: Observations from 50 years of residential pricing for fixed line telecoms and electricity|This study focuses on how energy and communications have evolved over the last 50 years and what we can learn from history in order to examine the prospects for smart energy pricing by 2050. We begin by discussing the nature of energy and telecoms products and why price discrimination should be expected. We then review various business and pricing strategies that have evolved in the two industries. We find that business models for both the telecoms and energy sectors have changed from the traditional services business model (i.e., offering of calls and messages for telecoms, and utility supply services for energy) to more dynamic, integrated and complex business models. These new business models include the managed services provider model, the bundled services model, and the prosumer business model, among others. Similarly, several changes in pricing structure have evolved. There has been a reduction in the number of distanced-based and increasing time-based price differentiation in fixed line telecoms and the abolition of residential floor area-based differentiation in electricity pricing. We conclude with a discussion on how the rollout of the next generation of electricity meters (smart and advanced meters) may further shape electricity pricing in the future.

Regional Efficiency of the Imperial German Postal, Telegraph, and Telephone Service|Using the regional productivity of the Reichspost, the postal service of the German Empire, I investigate whether a public monopolist operates with uniform regional productivity. Using DEA efficiency scores we derive the relative productivity of the post, telegraph and telephone sectors from 1891 to 1908. Results show a fairly stable system with substantial raw productivity differences between postal districts and that the expansion of the service offset technological productivity increases for the mail service.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

L96|Mobile Phone Penetration, Mobile Banking and Inclusive Development in Africa|The study assesses the role of mobile phones and mobile banking in decreasing inequality in 52 African countries. The empirical procedure involves first, examining the income-redistributive effect of mobile phone penetration and then investigating the contribution of mobile banking services in this relationship. The findings suggest an equalizing income-redistributive effect of ‘mobile phone penetration’ and ‘mobile banking’, with a higher income-equalizing effect from mobile banking compared to mobile phone penetration. Poverty alleviation channels explaining this difference in inequality mitigating propensity are discussed.
L96|The role of ICT in reducing information asymmetry for financial access|This study assesses the role of ICT in complementing private credit bureaus (PCB) and public credit registries (PCR) in reducing information asymmetry for financial access. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments with 53 African countries for the period 2004–2011. The following findings are established. First on financial access: (i) the marginal effects from interactions between ICT and PCR (PCB) are consistently positive (negative); (ii) net effects from interactions are negative with the higher magnitude from PCR and (iii) only thresholds corresponding to interactions between PCR and internet penetration are within range. Second, findings on financial allocation efficiency reveal positive marginal and net effects exclusively for mobile phones and PCR. Third, allocation efficiency may be constrained by increasing financial deposits. Overall, the complementarity between information offices and ICT in boosting financial access is still very limited. Policy implications are discussed with emphasis on improving the engaged complementarity and fighting surplus liquidity.
L96|Information Sharing and Financial Sector Development in Africa| This study investigates the effect information sharing has on financial sector development in 53 African countries for the period 2004 to 2011. Information sharing is measured with private credit bureaus and public credit registries. Hitherto unexplored dimensions of financial sector development are employed, namely: financial sector dynamics of formalization, informalization, and non-formalization. The empirical evidence is based on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). The following findings are established. Information-sharing bureaus increase (reduce) formal (informal/non-formal) financial sector development. In order to ensure that information-sharing bureaus improve (decrease) formal (informal/non-formal) financial development, public credit registries should have between 45.45 and 50% coverage while private credit bureaus should have at least 26.25% coverage.
L96|Reducing Information Asymmetry with ICT: A critical review of loan price and quantity effects in Africa|This study investigates loan price and quantity effects of information sharing offices with ICT, in a panel of 162 banks consisting of 42 African countries for the period 2001-2011.The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments and Instrumental Quantile Regressions. Our findings broadly show that ICT with public credit registries decrease the price of loans and increase the quantity of loans. While the net effects from the interaction of ICT with private credit bureaus do not lead to enhanced financial access, corresponding marginal effects show that ICT can complement private credit bureaus to increase loan quantity and decrease loan prices when certain thresholds of ICT are attained. We compute and discuss the ICT thresholds that are required to make this possible.
L96|Information asymmetry and market power in the African banking industry|This study investigates the role of information sharing offices and its association with market power in the African banking industry based on a panel of 162 banks from 42 countries for the period 2001–2011. Five simultaneity-robust estimation techniques are employed: Two Stage Least Squares; Instrumental Fixed Effects to control for unobserved heterogeneity; Instrumental Tobit regressions to control for the limited range in the dependent variable; Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) to control for persistence in market power; and Instrumental Quantile Regressions (QR) to account for initial levels of market power.
L96|Essential information sharing thresholds for reducing market power in financial access: a study of the African banking industry|Abstract This study investigates the role of information sharing offices (public credit registries and private credit bureaus) in reducing market power for financial access in the African banking industry. The empirical evidence is based on a panel of 162 banks from 42 countries for the period 2001–2011. Three simultaneity-robust empirical strategies are employed, namely (1) Two Stage Least Squares with Fixed Effects in order to account for simultaneity and the unobserved heterogeneity, (2) Generalised Method of Moments to control for simultaneity and time-invariant omitted variables and (3) Instrumental Variable Quantile regressions to account for simultaneity and initial levels of financial access. In order to ensure that information sharing offices influence market power for loan price (quantity) to decrease (increase), public credit registries should have between 3.156% and 3.3% coverage, while private credit bureaus should have between 1.443 and 18.4% coverage. The established thresholds are cut-off points at which information sharing offices completely neutralise the negative effect of market power on financial access. The thresholds are contingent on the dimension (loan price versus loan quantity) and distribution (conditional mean versus conditional distribution) of financial access.
L96|Is information diffusion a threat to market power for financial access? Insights from the African banking industry|This study assesses how information diffusion dampens the adverse effect of market power on the price and quantity of loans provided by a panel of 162 banks from 39 African countries for the period 2001–2011. First, from the Generalised Method of Moments results, a mobile phone penetration rate of 54.29, rising to 57 per 100 people are predicted to neutralise the adverse effect of market power on the average loan price and quantity respectively. Second, from the Quantile Regressions, mobile phone penetration rates of 56.20, 52.04 and 42.76 per 100 people is needed to nullify the negative effect of market power on loan quantity at the 10th decile, 25th quartile and 90th decile respectively. Third, a considerably lower internet penetration rate of 9.49 per 100 people is required to counteract the negative impact of market power on loan quantity at the 90th decile. Policy implications are discussed.
L96|Determinants of Mobile Phone Penetration: Panel Threshold Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa|Despite the evolving literature on the development benefits of mobile phones, we still know very little about factors that influence their adoption. Using twenty five policy variables, we investigate determinants of mobile phone penetration in 49 Sub-Saharan African countries with data for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on contemporary and non-contemporary OLS, Fixed effects, System GMM and Quantile regression techniques. The determinants are classified into six policy categories. They are: (i) macroeconomic, (ii) business/bank, (iii) market-related, (iv) knowledge economy, (v) external flows and (vi) human development. Results are presented in terms of threshold and non-threshold effects. The former has three main implications. First, there are increasing positive benefits in regulation quality, human development, foreign investment, education, urban population density and internet penetration. Second, there is evidence of decreasing positive effects from patent applications. Third, increasing negative impacts are established for foreign aid and return on equity. Non-threshold tendencies are discussed. Policy implications are also covered with emphasis on policy syndromes to enhance more targeted implications for worst performing nations.
L96|Fiber to the People: The Development of the Ultra-Broadband Network in Italy|In this paper, we firstly revise the main technological solutions for ultra-fast broadband connections and summarize the main economic literature (both theoretical and empirical) on the role of regulation to support infrastructure investment in broadband networks in profitable areas. We then move to the core of our analysis, that is to assess the relative positioning of the Italian market today in terms of deployment and penetration of broadband access, and then analyse the main relevant policy issues involved in the current Italian plans for broadband deployment. Our goal is to propose a policy framework for fostering the deployment of the Italian ultra-fast broadband network and evaluate the Government master plan. The analysis will also give the opportunity to provide our contribution to the current debate and to suggest how industrial policies in a market-oriented perspective should be reconsidered.
L96|Price Discrimination, Entry, And Switching Costs In Network Competition|This paper reviews theoretical models of network competition in telecommunications. We will discuss two alternative approaches. The first approach assumes Hoteling’s horizontal differentiation and the second approach is based on switching costs. We will first analyse spatial competition with linear prices and continue with price discrimination between onnet and off-net calls. Price discrimination can also be used to deter entry to the market. We will also deal with the regulator’s optimal choice of access price, which should be designed to induce entry of new firms. Furthermore, pricing of roaming services and the switching cost approach to network competition will be considered. Finally, we will illustrate the theoretical results with data from the Serbian mobile and fixed telephony market.
L96|Empirical Evidence on the Relationship between Mobile Termination Rates and Firms' Profits| The theoretical literature on mobile termination rates (MTRs) is inconclusive on how the level of MTRs affects overall consumer charges and firms' profits. We show that when firms offer bundles with fixed included usage – a tariff structure that has become more common in recent years – an identical change in all MTRs does not affect firms' retail prices or profits. We use a panel dataset from saturated European markets to estimate the effect of MTRs on mobile operators' profits. As predicted by the theoretical model, we cannot reject the fact that firms' profits are unaffected by an identical change in all MTRs.
L96|What Do Regulators Value?|In a pioneering article entitled “Taxation by Regulation,” Judge Richard Posner challenged the prevailing orthodoxy that regulation emulates competition along the lines of the Public Interest Theory of regulation. He argued that regulation is best viewed as a branch of public finance in which the power of the state is leveraged to achieve non-competitive outcomes. We develop an indirect test of Posner’s theory by specifying the regulator’s welfare function as a convex combination of consumer surplus, profits shared with the regulator and profits retained by the regulated firm. The welfare weights cannot be observed directly, but can be inferred from the regulator’s behavior in equilibrium. To wit, when the regulator permits the regulated firm to earn positive profits and authorizes higher prices in response to a greater degree of profit sharing this establishes both an upper bound on the consumer surplus weight and a higher weight on shared profits than on profits retained by the regulated firm. Applying this test to the implementation of the 1996 Telecommunications Act lends support to Posner’s theory.
L96|Customer Loyalty Using Customer Relationship Management|"Customer Relationship Management has developped into a major element of the business strategy of many companies and is based on creation and development of personalized relationships with customers to increase their profitability. A Customer Relationship Management strategy enables a firm organizational behavior rapid adaptation to changes occurring in the market and thus the company will be able to satisfy the wishes and demands much better clients. Managers of companies performing rationale ""is difficult to conquer a customer than to keep an existing one,"" come to support this research on the costs of these alternatives; those determined by winning a new client are 3 to 15 times higher by branch and product than those implied by an existing customer loyalty. Customer orientation means that everything that makes a company must be based on its care of you fulfill all requirements, whether internal or external customer, whether public sector or a non-profit organization. This should mean that everything is made-setting priorities, making decisions, participating in meetings or discussions with management - to consider customers requests and demanding . This paper aims to address system - Customer Relationship Management customer service perspective as the reason why there are organizations, organization and its leadership must adopt a customer orientation and to show more attention to its demands."
L96|Operational Risk & Cybersecurity|The impact of the Internet has had strong growth in the last two decades. The entire economy depends on ICT. The open and free cybernetic space, promoted social and political inclusion allowing easily interaction and exchange of information between communities and citizens from different countries. The Information and communication technology has become the backbone of our economy determining economic growth. Complex systems in key sectors of the economy such as finance, healthcare, energy and transport use powerful computer systems. Meanwhile many business models are built on the continuous availability of the Internet and the proper functioning of the informatics systems. The online environment requires high reliability, protection incidents, malicious activity or abuse. Cyber ??criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to steal critical data or economic espionage activities in cyber space. All these factors explain why governments worldwide have begun to develop strategies and act properly in cyberspace as an important international issue. The paper has a special goal, to approach informatical security segments concerning operational risks generated by the informatic systems used by regulated entities authorized / approved and / or supervised by the FSA.
L96|True Investment-GDP Ratio in a World Economy with Investment in Information & Communication Technology|The nominal investment-GDP ratio is playing a key role in the economic debate in the US and in the EU. However, this analysis is largely misleading as a rising share of overall investment is in the form of ICT investment: The price of ICT investment goods has been falling for decades so that it is adequate to consider the “real effective” investment-GDP ratio calculated on the basis of real ICT investment relative to real GDP. The gap between the two ratios is about 3-6 percentage points for the USA and Germany, and indeed some other EU countries, so that effective investment-GDP ratios in both the United States and Germany are seriously underestimated if nominal-GDP ratios are used – as the DIW, Berlin, did for Germany and other EU countries. There are, of course, critical implications for the debate about how large the investment gap is in Germany, France, Italy, Spain and other countries; this analysis is also highly relevant for the issue of overcoming slow growth and high unemployment rates. As regards Germany, there is only a small private investment gap, while that gap is much larger in Italy and Spain – judging by the real effective investment ratio of 2007 compared to the previous periods. In countries where the real effective investment-output ratio is quite different from the nominal investment-GDP ratio, the implication is that the savings rate and the current account position in the uses side of GDP in the System of National Accounts also need to be recalculated. The IMF should take the new methodology into account for the debate about international current account imbalances.
L96|Strukturwandel in der Europäischen Union am Beispiel ausgewählter Leitmärkte mit besonderem Bezug auf die Innovationstätigkeit der Mitgliedsländer|The present study examines the position of the EU28 member states and the comparative advantage of each vis-à-vis the other states in the EU28 market using four particular chosen leading markets; Renewable Energies, Biotechnology, Information and Communication Technologies and the Recycling sector. Within the framework of this study, two modified versions of a Revealed Comarative Advantage Indicator are employed, both of which are derived herein. It can be shown that ICT and Recycling are already established sectors, for which there is evidence of only a low level of structural dynamics within the EU28. On the contrary, for Renewable Energies and Biotechnology a different picture emerges: Established centers of production and innovation are indeed established, however the transformation process for these two sectors has not been completed and they better fulfil their function as leading markets than ICT or Recycling.

L96|What makes consumers switch mobile phone tariffs?|The potential psychological pain of nasty surprises on mobile phone bills is a great motivator to switch tariffs, according to research by Christos Genakos and colleagues. Their study notes that navigating through thousands of tariff plans for mobile phones to find the best one is not easy in today's telecoms market - and having an 'expert friend' calculate the contract with the biggest savings definitely helps. But the findings suggest that regulators cannot rely on price comparison sites to discipline the market since savings are not necessarily the first thing even well informed consumers are looking for. Rather, it is their desire to avoid psychological losses.
L96|Liberation Technology: Mobile Phones and Political Mobilization in Africa|Can digital information and communication technology (ICT) foster mass political mobilization? We use a novel geo-referenced dataset for the entire African continent between 1998 and 2012 on the coverage of mobile phone signal together with geo-referenced data from multiple sources on the occurrence of protests and on individual participation in protests to bring this argument to empirical scrutiny. We ﬁnd that mobile phones are instrumental to mass mobilization during economic downturns, when reasons for grievance emerge and the cost of participation falls. Estimated effects are if anything larger once we use an instrumental variable approach that relies on differential trends in coverage across areas with different incidence of lightning strikes. The results are in line with insights from a network model with imperfect information and strategic complementarities in protest provision. Mobile phones make individuals more responsive to both changes in economic conditions - a mechanism that we ascribe to enhanced information - and to their neighbors’ participation - a mechanism that we ascribe to enhanced coordination. Empirically both effects are at play, highlighting the channels through which digital ICT can alleviate the collective action problem.
L96|Returns to ICT Skills|How important is mastering information and communications technology (ICT) in modern labor markets? Previous research offers no guidance in assessing the labor-market returns to ICT skills, primarily because skill data have been unavailable. We draw on unique data that provide internationally comparable information on ICT skills in 19 countries. Using an instrument that leverages cross-country variation in the technologically determined probability of having Internet access, we find that ICT skills are substantially rewarded in the labor market. Placebo estimations show that exogenous Internet availability cannot explain numeracy or literacy skills, suggesting that our identifying variation is independent of a person s general ability.
L96|Market Consequences of ICT Innovations|Die vorliegende Arbeit wurde von Constantin Mang während seiner Tätigkeit am ifo Institut verfasst. Sie wurde 2014 abgeschlossen und von der volkswirtschaftlichen Fakultät der Universität München als Dissertation angenommen. Die Arbeit besteht aus einer kurzen Einführung und vier eigenständigen Kapiteln, die IKT-Innovationen in unterschiedlichen Märkten beleuchten. Kapitel 1 gibt eine kurze Einführung in das Thema und erläutert einige methodische Aspekte, welche in den übrigen Kapiteln Anwendung finden. In Kapitel 2 wird der Effekt von Breitband Internet auf den Wohnungsmarkt betrachtet, um den Wert eines Breitbandzugangs in Form eines Preisaufschlages auf Wohnungsmieten zu quantifizieren. Methodisch werden hierzu Mikrodaten von Deutschlands größter Online-Plattform für Wohnungsanzeigen verwendet, um ein hedonisches Mietpreismodell zu schätzen. In Kapitel 3 wird der Zusammenhang zwischen Online-Jobsuche und Matching-Qualität mit Hilfe von Daten des Sozio-ökonomischen Panels (SOEP) untersucht. Dazu wird die Matching-Qualität des Arbeitnehmers am neuen Arbeitsplatz mit der des alten Arbeitsplatzes verglichen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Arbeitnehmer, die ihre neue Stelle im Internet gefunden haben, besser zu dieser Stelle passen als Arbeitnehmer, die traditionelle Wege der Jobsuche verwendet haben. Kapitel 4 betrachtet die Effektivität des Einsatzes von Computern im Schulunterricht über unterschiedliche Länder hinweg. Mit Hilfe von Daten des internationalen Schülerleistungstests TIMSS, wird der Effekt von Computernutzung im Unterricht auf die Schülerleistung gemessen und ein positiver Effekt für einige der Computeraktivitäten sowie ein negativer Effekt für andere Computeraktivitäten gefunden. In Kapitel 5 wird der Effekt eines technologischen Ausbaus des Mobilfunknetzes auf die Nutzung ortsbezogener Dienste untersucht. Mit Hilfe von Daten der größten deutschen Online-Plattform für Restaurantbewertungen, wird ein positiver Effekt des Ausbaus auf die Anzahl der Restaurantbewertungen sowie den Anteil der Bewertungen, welche von einem Smartphone abgegeben wurden gefunden.
L96|Eine Agenda für Wirtschaftsreformen in Kroatien: ein umfassendes wirtschaftspolitisches Reformpaket im Auftrag der kroatischen Staatsstiftung|Seit der Finanzkrise hat Kroatien negative Wachstumsraten. Der Brain Drain hochqualifizierter Arbeitskräfte nimmt stetig zu. Die Wirtschaft hat schon seit längerer Zeit starke Einbußen ihrer Wettbewerbsfähigkeit erfahren. Kroatien rangiert diesbezüglich am Ende der Skala der EU-Mitglieder. Das Land befindet sich in einem Reformstau, der überwunden werden muss, damit Kroatien wieder auf einen nachhaltigen Wachstumskurs gelangt. Dieser Sammelband beschreibt eine wirtschaftspolitische Reformagenda für Kroatien. Schwerpunkt der Analysen bilden die Reformfelder Auslandsdirektinvestitionen und Exporte, Wechselkurse, Arbeitsmärkte, private Verschuldung, öffentliche Haushalte, Regulierungen für Unternehmen, Sozialsysteme und Alterssicherung, Humankapital, Technologie und Innovation sowie Infrastruktur mit dem Schwerpunkt Energie. Die zu den einzelnen Bereichen verfassten Analysen wurden in mehreren Workshops unter Beteiligung kroatischer Wissenschaftler und Stakeholder diskutiert und abschließend zu einem integrierten schlüssigen Reformkonzept zusammengefasst.
L96|Wie viel ist genug? Breitbandausbau in Deutschland|Der Weg in die Gigabitgesellschaft: Wie sollen Breitbandziele in Deutschland über das Jahr 2018 hinaus konkret definiert, umgesetzt und finanziert werden? Dorothee Bär, Bundesministerium für Verkehr und digitale Infrastruktur, weist darauf hin, dass das BMVI gleich zu Beginn der aktuellen Legislaturperiode mit der Netzallianz Digitales Deutschland eine Plattform der innovations- und investitionsbereiten Unternehmen gegründet hat. Peter Knauth, Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie, stellt die Maßnahmen des BMWi im Rahmen seiner umfassenden Digitalen Strategie 2025 vor, die von der Unterstützung von Start-ups, einer innovations- und investitionsorientierten Optimierung des Ordnungsrahmens, der intelligenten Vernetzung zentraler Sektoren, einer neuen Datenpolitik und der Unterstützung von KMU reichen. Wilhelm Eschweiler, Bundesnetzagentur, möchte den vielfältigen Herausforderungen des Breitbandausbaus mit einem flexiblen Regulierungsansatz begegnen, der regionale Marktverhältnisse berücksichtigt und Investitionsanreize erhält. Für Wolfgang Kopf, Deutsche Telekom AG, muss die Verhinderung einer digitalen Spaltung zwischen städtischen und ländlichen Räumen Vorrang haben vor Maximalbandbreiten für einige wenige Prozent der Bevölkerung in den Ballungsräumen und ausgewählten Gebieten. Nach Ansicht von Valentina Daiber, Telefónica Germany, benötigt Deutschland einen digitalen Quantensprung und eine mutige, ambitionierte Zielsetzung für seine digitale Agenda 2030. Aus Sicht von Wilhelm Dresselhaus, Nokia Deutschland, wird es sich beim Netz für die Gigabitgesellschaft um eine Mischung aus Festnetz- und Mobilfunktechnologien handeln, in dem Endkunden unterbrechungsfrei zwischen den verschiedenen Zugangstechnologien hin und her wechseln können. Auch für Iris Henseler-Unger und Christian Wernick, WIK-Consult GmbH, Bad Honnef, sollte der Ausbau flächendeckender Gigabitnetze, möglichst bis 2025, im Mittelpunkt stehen. Sie empfehlen ein politisches Ziel zu definieren, das das Breitbandziel der Bundesregierung für das Jahr 2018 ersetzt. Justus Haucap, Ulrich Heimeshoff und Mirjam Lange, Universität Düsseldorf, merken an, dass es nicht ausreicht, noch mehr und schnelleres Breitband zu vergraben, wenn die Rahmenbedingungen nicht stimmen, um interessante Dienste und Inhalte zu entwickeln. Die kommende Bundesregierung sollte eine neue Deregulierungskommission einsetzen, die die Blockaden für die Entwicklung digitaler Geschäftsmodelle analysiert. Oliver Falck und Andreas Mazat, ifo Institut, bemerken, dass der aktuelle Bandbreitenbedarf hinter seiner Verfügbarkeit zurückbleibt. Sowohl von Privathaushalten als auch von Unternehmen werden verfügbare Bandbreiten häufig nicht genutzt. Sie warnen deshalb vor überhöhten Bandbreitenzielen und schlagen stattdessen eine Orientierung des Breitbandausbaus an lokalen, technologischen Gegebenheiten vor.

L96|The Economics of Zero-Rating and Net Neutrality|This paper studies zero-rating, an emerging business practice consisting in a mobile internet service provider (ISP) excluding the data generated by certain content providers (CPs) from its consumers' monthly data cap. Being at odds with the principle of net neutrality, these arrangements have recently attracted regulatory scrutiny all over the word. I analyze zero-rating incentives of a monopolistic ISP facing a capacity constraint in a two-sided market where consumption provides utility for homogeneous consumers as well as advertising revenue for CPs. Focusing on a market with two CPs competing with each other and all other content which is never zero-rated, I identify parameter regions in which zero, one or two CPs are zero-rated. Surprisingly, the ISP may zero rate content when content is either very unattractive or very attractive for consumers, but not in the intermediary region. I show that zero-rating harms consumers if content is unattractive, whereas it improves social welfare in the case of attractive content.

L96|Local Loop Unbundling in the UK Does Not Affect Broadband Penetration - but It Does Lead to Better Service|Under an open access policy, incumbent broadband providers in all EU countries are required to let new market entrants access their networks through bitstream or local loop unbundling (LLU). This type of regulatory provision aims to increase competition among all broadband providers, and is strongly recommended in markets where the prohibitively high cost of setting up a distribution network means that market power is concentrated in the hands of a few players - or even one single player (such as in the case of telecommunications). This analysis uses data from the UK to investigate whether such a policy stimulates market entry and broadband penetration and/or leads to an increase in broadband quality. In contrast to what is commonly believed LLU does not increase internet penetration significantly or sustainably. It does, however, stimulate market entry as well as investments that substantially increase service quality. Thus this open access policy does not contribute to a digital divide in access. Although these results are based solely on experiences in the UK, they do point to the general advantages of infrastructure-based competition (based on LLU) over service-based competition (based on bitstream).

This type of regulatory provision aims to increase competition among all broadband providers, and is strongly recommended in markets where the prohibitively high cost of setting up a distribution network means that market power is concentrated in the hands of a few players - or even one single player (such as in the case of telecommunications). This analysis uses data from the UK to investigate whether such a policy stimulates market entry and broadband penetration and/or leads to an increase in broadband quality. In contrast to what is commonly believed LLU does not increase internet penetration significantly or sustainably. It does, however, stimulate market entry as well as investments that substantially increase service quality. Thus while this open access policy does not contribute to a digital divide in access, it does clearly contribute to a divide in broadband quality. Although these results are based solely on experiences in the UK, they do point to the general advantages of infrastructure-based competition over service-based competition. In allen EU-Ländern sind die ehemals monopolistischen Breitbandanbieter im Rahmen einer Open-Access-Politik verpflichtet, neuen Anbietern über sogenannten Bitstrom oder die Entbündelung der TeilnehmerInnenanschlussleitung (Local Loop Unbundling, LLU) Zugang zu ihren Netzen zu gewähren. Diese Art der Regulierung soll für mehr Wettbewerb zwischen den Breitbandanbietern sorgen und wird besonders in Märkten wie der Telekommunikationsbranche empfohlen, in denen die hohen Kosten für die Errichtung eines Verteilnetzes die Konzentration der Marktmacht in den Händen weniger, wenn nicht sogar nur eines Marktteilnehmers begünstigen. Die vorliegende Analyse untersucht anhand von Daten aus Großbritannien, ob eine solche Politik stimulierend auf den Markteintritt, die Breitbandverbreitung und die Breitbandqualität wirkt. Anders als allgemein angenommen wird die Internetverbreitung durch Local Loop Unbundling nicht signifikant und nachhaltig erhöht. LLU fördert jedoch den Markteintritt und Investitionen, die die Qualität der Dienste erheblich verbessern. Somit trägt die Entbündelung der Anschlussleitungen nicht zu einer digitalen Kluft beim Internetzugang bei. Auch wenn die Ergebnisse auf den Erfahrungen in Großbritannien basieren, weisen sie auf den allgemeinen Vorteil hin, den ein infrastrukturbasierter Wettbewerb (LLU) im Vergleich zu einem dienstbasierten Wettbewerb (auf Grundlage von Bitstrom) haben kann.

L96|Interconnection and Prioritization|We analyze pricing and competition under paid prioritization within a model of interconnected internet service providers (ISPs), heterogeneous content providers (CPs) and heterogeneous consumers. We show that prioritization is welfare superior to a regime without prioritization (network neutrality) and yields higher incentives for investment in network capacities. As ISPs price discriminate between on-net and off-net CPs, their bottleneck property is propagated and competition for consumers increases resulting in a potential prisoner's dilemma when deciding whether to offer prioritization. We show that peering for prioritized traffic emerges as a collusive outcome and present off-net prices as a further collusive instrument.
L96|Spiteful bidding and gaming in combinatorial clock auctions|Combinatorial Clock Auctions (CCAs) have recently been used around the world to allocate mobile telecom spectrum. CCAs are claimed to significantly reduce the scope for strategic bidding. This paper shows, however, that bidding truthfully does not constitute an equilibrium if bidders also have an incentive to engage in spiteful bidding to raise rivals' cost. The restrictions on further bids imposed by the clock phase of a CCA give certainty to bidders that certain bids above value cannot be winning bids, assisting bidders to engage in spiteful bidding.
L96|The need for more efficient public funding of new communications infrastructure in EU member states|Ubiquitous coverage of new high-speed broadband networks, as foreseen by the European Commission, still appears to be a rather unrealistic objective in most European Union member states without government intervention in terms of funding network deployment in unprofitable areas. We contend, however, that the current contract practice of fixing ex ante targets for network expansion is inefficient given the uncertainty about future returns on high-speed broadband services and the public authorities’ incomplete information about the costs of the network provider. This paper suggests delegating the choice of the network expansion to the typically much better informed network operator. Furthermore, we show that such contracts can be implemented based on existing accounting data and that it is not necessary to undertake any additional ex post verification of cost or demand data as is currently the case under claw-back rules.
L96|Access regulation and the entrant's mode of entry under multi-product competition in telecoms|We study the optimal access regulation during the transition from copper to fiber access networks in telecoms when each competitor provides broadband services that are both horizontally and vertically differentiated. We consider a setting in which there is a vertically integrated incumbent that controls a network required for the supply of the final services and an entrant that undertakes a “build-or-buy” decision. In this multi-product framework, where the quality of the services is endogenously determined, we show that the entrant always prefers service-based to facilities-based entry, provided that this option is available. Hence, the regulator sets the welfare-maximizing access charges whenever this socially optimal access pricing policy leads to higher welfare than facilities-based entry. Otherwise, a sufficient access policy that ensures facilities-based competition is to ban access to the incumbent's upstream facilities. We present the conditions under which each of these instruments should be implemented and conclude that the optimal access rules depend on the characterization of consumers according to their tendency to be “firm-oriented” or “technology-oriented” since this discrimination determines whether intra-firm or, respectively, inter-firm competition prevails in the market.
L96|Spectrum policy and competition in mobile data|This paper studies the effects of radio spectrum sharing between two mobile operators within a Hotelling model of duopoly. We apply the M/M/1 queuing model to analyze the effect of mandated sharing of radio spectrum on the equilibrium connection quality, data volumes and prices. Our analysis shows that spectrum sharing can have adverse effects. First, it creates an incentive for the mobile operators to increase the load in their network in order to weaken the competitor. A higher network load leads to more network congestion and suboptimal equilibrium connection quality. Second, consumer surplus decreases and industry profit increases for a wide range of parameter values in the model. In other words, spectrum sharing could lead to a transfer from consumers to producers.
L96|International network competition under national regulation|We extend the workhorse model of network competition to international calls. This model enables us to show that national regulatory authorities (NRAs) maximizing domestic welfare have incentives to increase termination rates above the social optimum to extract rent from international call termination. Excessive termination rates distort prices but transfer surplus from foreign to domestic consumers via intensified network competition. The model can explain the regulation of termination rates through rate floors. International network ownership and deregulation are alternatives to combat the incentives of NRAs to distort termination rates. We identify conditions under which each of these policies increases aggregate welfare.
L96|Insurance penetration and economic growth nexus: Cross-country evidence from ASEAN|This paper investigates whether there are Granger causal relationships between insurance market penetration, broad money, stock-market capitalization, and economic growth, using panel data for the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum (ARF) countries for the 1988–2012 period. Using a multivariate framework, we show that all the variables are cointegrated and reveal a network of causal connections, including short-run bidirectional causality between insurance market penetration and economic growth. Recommendations based on this study include establishing a sound regulatory framework for a country's insurance industry, and introducing professional education and certification of insurance personnel to ensure adherence to global best practices and standards. Moreover, opening up a country's domestic insurance market to larger foreign players can ensure a wider choice of cost-effective, quality insurance.

L96|Medieval market making brokerage regulations in Central Western Europe, ca. 1250-1700|This paper examines brokerage regulations in Central and Western Europe from approximately 1250 to 1700. Based on a sample of 70 cities with more than 1609 sets of regulations, we find that brokerage was a multifunctional institution, which served matchmaking, quality certification, and tax collection functions, mainly in product wholesale markets but also in finance and real estate markets. We argue that the implementation of regulations for matchmaking and certification solved incentive problems related to asymmetric information between buyers and sellers, consequently improving the allocation process and fostering trade. In line with these results, we find that most brokerage regulations occur along trade routes and in merchant towns.
L96|State-invested enterprises in the European telecommunications industry: Are they competitive players?|The present paper provides an overview of the main companies operating in European telecommunication industry over the decade 2006-2015, with a specific focus on their ownership structure. Following Christiansen and Kim (2014), State-invested telecom companies are classified into State-owned (SOEs) and partially State-owned (PSOEs) enterprises. The aim of the analysis is to investigate the current involvement of European Governments in the telecommunications sector after the deep process of privatisation started in the ‘80s and to understand whether the type of ownership is connected with companies’ economic performance. It turns out that European States still have an important role in the telecommunications industry, mainly through minority but significant participations into previously publicly held incumbents. Moreover, from the analysis of balance sheet data it turns out that State-Invested companies have achieved an economic performance which is comparable, if not superior, to that of private enterprises in terms of profitability. However, some gaps seem to persist as far as labour productivity and investment levels are concerned.
L96|Media and Political Participation in North Africa|We examine the role of new decentralized media (the internet) vs old media (television) on individuals' political engagement in North Africa. Drawing our data from the Afrobarometer round 5 survey, we tackle issues of endogeneity by resorting first to a propensity score matching method to identify the effect of media on political participation. We then address endogeneity by relying to a bivariate probit model while using lightening activity as an instrument for media. The analysis evidences the political power of the internet and TV. Getting news from internet reduces voting but increases protests, while TV watching induces more vote and less protest. This effect is channeled through the impact of media on the perception about political institutions, which differs across the different media.
L96|Price discrimination of ott providers under duopolistic competition and multi-dimmesional product differentiation in retail broadband access|Network neutrality regulation prevents price discrimination from Access Providers to Content Providers and product differentiation in terms of connection quality in the retail broadband access market. This paper analyzes the economic implications of price discrimination under duopolistic competition and multi-dimensional product differentiation in retail internet access using a sequential-moves game theoretic model. Under this framework, we discuss the impact of product differentiation and price discrimination on social welfare, and offer systematic simulations using feasible ranges for parameters value to help discern the impact of departing from network neutrality regulation on social welfare.

L96|Market Power and Collusion on Interconnection Phone Market in Tunisia : What Lessons from International Experiences|"We try in this paper to characterize the state of mobile phone market in Tunisia. Our study is based on a survey of foreign experience (Europe) in detecting collusive behavior and a comparison of the critical threshold of collusion between operators in developing countries like Tunisia. The market power is estimated based on the work of Parker Roller (1997) and the assumption of ""Balanced Calling Pattern"". We use then the model of Friedman (1971) to compare the critical threshold of collusion. We show that the “conduct parameter” measuring the intensity of competition is not null during the period 1993-2011. Results show also that collusion is easier on the Tunisian market that on the Algerian, Jordanian, or Moroccan one."
L96|Liberation technology: mobile phones and politicalmobilization in Africa|Can digital information and communication technology (ICT) foster mass political mobilization? We use a novel geo-referenced dataset for the entire African continent between 1998 and 2012 on the coverage of mobile phone signal together with geo-referenced data from multiple sources on the occurrence of protests and on individual participation in protests to bring this argument to empirical scrutiny. We find that mobile phones are instrumental to mass mobilization during economic downturns, when reasons for grievance emerge and the cost of participation falls. Estimated effects are if anything larger once we use an instrumental variable approach that relies on differential trends in coverage across areas with different incidence of lightning strikes. The results are in line with insights from a network model with imperfect information and strategic complementarities in protest provision. Mobile phones make individuals more responsive to both changes in economic conditions - a mechanism that we ascribe to enhanced information - and to their neighbors’ articipation - a mechanism that we ascribe to enhanced coordination. Empirically both effects are at play, highlighting the channels through which digital ICT can alleviate the collective action problem.
L96|The Information Industry: Measuring Russia By International Standards|Structural changes influenced by ICT are having an impact on production processes and the release of products in the information and communication technology (ICT) sphere and content (on the level of individual enterprises) and are resulting in the pursuit of new approaches to socio-economic development, to increase the competitiveness of the country and to participate in the international division of labour. In order to identify development priorities and prospects in the information industry we therefore need a clear understanding of what the information industry is, what its boundaries are, what forms of economic activity make up this economic segment, and which products form the corresponding market. This working paper summarizes the results of a study to ‘measure’ the information industry as a segment of the economy producing goods and services linked to ICT and content. Methodological approaches are proposed to establish the ‘Information industry’ definitions based on the Russian Classification of Economic Activities (OKVED) and the Russian Classification of Products by Economic Activities (OKPD) in line with international standards and recommendations by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Key indicators of the development of the information industry are also tentatively calculated for Russia and compared with countries abroad. The content of this paper is based on research results commissioned by the Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation and the outcome of evaluations and testing at a round table on the subject ‘IT industry: problems of classification and application’ round table (2014) and a session of the statistics section of the Central House of Scientists at the Russian Academy of Sciences on the subject of ‘Developing the “Information industry” and “IT industry” definitions based on the OKVED2 and OKPD2’ (http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/rosstat/sec/tez-abdr.doc). The paper was also supported by the Basic Research Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) and the subsidy granted to the HSE by the Government of the Russian Federation for the implementation of the Global Competitiveness Program.
L96|Foreign Reactions to U.S. Auctions: Implications for U.S. Bidders in Foreign Countries|In this study, we examine the implications of FCC Auctions for U.S. companies in foreign countries. We show that U.S. auctions will have the most detrimental effect on U.S. companies planning to serve the most attractive foreign markets. For moderately attractive markets, establishing a joint venture with a firm in the target country is crucial. The least attractive markets can become more attractive when their neighboring countries are served by U.S. companies. We discuss the foreign retaliation upon U.S. telecom auctions, U.S. companies' responses, the pressure from the U.S. Congress on the FCC, and FCC's strategies. We conclude by analyzing the foreign reactions to U.S. auctions, these reactions’ implications on the FCC, and the offsetting trends. Finally, we recommend some strategies to FCC.
L96|On the private and social desirability of mixed bundling in complementary markets with cost savings|We study the private and the social desirability of mixed bundling that generates cost savings in markets for complementary products. Firms always want to adopt such a strategy, and we find that the prices of stand-alone products may decrease when cost savings are important. We also identify an intriguing case where mixed bundling is beneficial for firms, as it depends on the interplay between product substitutability and cost savings in a non-monotonic way. Finally, we highlight situations where private and social interests coincide, and those where they collide.
L96|Price Differentiation between On-Net and Off-Net Calls: An Application to the Chilean Telephony Market|This paper characterizes discriminatory plans offered by Movistar in Chile in May 2010, before the Competition Court of Chile banned the offer of plans based on different prices for on-net and off-net calls. Using a model of strategic interaction among firms that set discriminatory and nonlinear prices, this paper assess the extent to which on-net and offnet price differentials in this plans represent predatory practices in the mobile telephony market in Chile. The main result is that for high levels of call externality, most Movistarâ€™s offered plans should be explained by efficiency and strategic reasons. However, for low levels of call externality at least half plans for individual customers could present evidence of anticompetitive practices. Therefore, whether our result justifies or contradicts the Competition Courtâ€™s decision is a matter of future empiric work, since information regarding the call externality parameter is not fully reliable.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L96|Predation and network based price discrimination in Chile|This paper uses a model of strategic interaction among firms –that set discriminatory and nonlinear prices– in addition to public information on prices of the plans marketed by the three major mobile phone companies, to assess the extent to which on-net/off-net price differentials in the plans they offered could represent predatory practices in the mobile telephony market in Chile. The results show that the largest companies offered a few plans with an off-net/on-net price differential larger than what a competitive theoretical model predicts. This larger differential is consistent with the notion of predation defined by Hoernig (2007) as reducing a competitor's profits. Despite the fact that these plans were a small fraction of all the plans mobile phone firms offered, they were recently banned by the antitrust authority because of their potential anticompetitive effects.
