E27|Inequality, mobility and the financial accumulation process: a computational economic analysis|Abstract Our computational economic analysis investigates the relationship between inequality, mobility and the financial accumulation process. Extending the baseline model by Levy et al., we characterise the economic process through stylised return structures generating alternative evolutions of income and wealth through time. First, we explore the limited heuristic contribution of one and two-factors models comprising one single stock (capital wealth) and one single flow factor (labour) as pure drivers of income and wealth generation and allocation over time. Second, we introduce heuristic modes of taxation in line with the baseline approach. Our computational economic analysis corroborates that the financial accumulation process featuring compound returns plays a significant role as source of inequality, while institutional arrangements including taxation play a significant role in framing and shaping the aggregate economic process that evolves over socioeconomic space and time.
E27|The Trend Unemployment Rate in Canada: Searching for the Unobservable|In this paper, we assess several methods that have been used to measure the Canadian trend unemployment rate (TUR). We also considerimprovements and extensions to some existing methods. The assessment is based on four criteria: (i) the extent to which methods provide explanations for changes in trend unemployment; (ii) whether revisions to unemployment gap (UGAP, the difference between the actual unemployment rate and TUR) estimates are well behaved; (iii) if UGAPs provide information about future inflation; and (iv) if UGAPs help explain historical data about wages and consumer price inflation. In our assessment of conformity to the second and third criteria, we use real-time data, i.e., the data available to policymakers at the time of making decisions. We find that while all methods we consider have both strengths and weaknesses, those based on variables thought to determine TUR provide better interpretation and tend to do at least as well as others against the other criteria. These are most promising for future work. Nevertheless, there is considerable uncertainty about the value of TUR, which suggests it would be prudent to use a range of models in research or policy work. While estimates of TUR have declined since the mid-1990s, it is assessed to range between 5.6 and 6.7 per cent in 2018Q4.
E27|Assessing the Resilience of the Canadian Banking System|The stability of the Canadian financial system, as well as its ability to support the Canadian economy, depends on the ability of financial institutions to absorb and manage major shocks. This is especially true for large banks, which perform services essential to the Canadian economy.
E27|Évaluer la résilience du système bancaire canadien|La stabilité du système financier canadien et son rôle de pilier de l’économie du pays tiennent à la capacité des institutions financières à absorber et à gérer les chocs majeurs. Cela est particulièrement vrai pour les grandes banques, dont les services sont essentiels à l’économie canadienne.
E27|A new approach to dating the reference cycle|This paper proposes a new approach to the analysis of the reference cycle turning points, defined on the basis of the specific turning points of a broad set of coincident economic indicators. Each individual pair of specific peaks and troughs from these indicators is viewed as a realization of a mixture of an unspecified number of separate bivariate Gaussian distributions whose different means are the reference turning points. These dates break the sample into separate reference cycle phases, whose shifts are modeled by a hidden Markov chain. The transition probability matrix is constrained so that the specification is equivalent to a multiple changepoint model. Bayesian estimation of finite Markov mixture modeling techniques is suggested to estimate the model. Several Monte Carlo experiments are used to show the accuracy of the model to date reference cycles that suffer from short phases, uncertain turning points, small samples and asymmetric cycles. In the empirical section, we show the high performance of our approach to identifying the US reference cycle, with little difference from the timing of the turning point dates established by the NBER. In a pseudo real-time analysis, we also show the good performance of this methodology in terms of accuracy and speed of detection of turning point dates.
E27|Forecasting the Colombian Unemployment Rate Using Labour Force Flows|Accurate predictions of future magnitudes of the unemployment rate are crucial for monetary policy. This paper investigates whether the use of disaggregated household survey data improves the forecasts of the Colombian 13 cities unemployment rate. We conduct an outof-sample forecast exercise to compare the performance of a model that incorporates flows of workers across different states of the labour market to that of various macroeconomic non-structural models. The paper follows the approach proposed by Barnichon & Nekarda (2013). Our results indicate that the two-state-flow model provides substantially better forecasts of the unemployment rate over longer horizons (more than five months ahead). Additionally, when forecasts are combined, significant gains in every forecasting horizon occurs. This combined forecast shows a 23% reduction in overall RMSE. **** ABSTRACT: En este documento se evalúan los pronósticos de la tasa de desempleo urbana en Colombia utilizando varias metodologías. La primera se basa en las propiedades estadísticas de la serie de tiempo de la tasa de desempleo. La segunda considera la relación entre el crecimiento del producto y los cambios en el desempleo, conocida como la Ley de Okun. Finalmente, con base en los microdatos de las encuestas de hogares se calculan los flujos de trabajadores del mercado laboral para pronosticar la tasa de desempleo de acuerdo con Barnichon y Nekarda (2013). La evaluación de los pronósticos fuera de muestra indica que el modelo de dos estados (ocupado-desocupado) es el mejor en horizontes superiores a cinco meses. Por su parte, los modelos ARIMA y la Ley de Okun compiten en precisión en horizontes de corto plazo. Cabe destacar que la combinación de los modelos de pronóstico genera ganancias significativas en todos los horizontes, alcanzando una reducción global de 23% en la raíz del error cuadrático medio.

E27|Límite de la Deuda Pública y Espacio Fiscal: Análisis para Colombia y Otros Mercados Emergentes|En este documento se analiza el límite de la deuda pública y el espacio fiscal para Colombia y otras economías emergentes, bajo el enfoque de la fatiga fiscal (Ghosh et. al., 2013). El estado de fatiga se presenta en situaciones de incrementos continuos de la deuda y del pago de los intereses, que llevan a que los esfuerzos del gobierno para generar superávits primarios se deterioren. El trabajo utiliza la técnica de los splines para estimar la reacción del gobierno a la dinámica de deuda y plantea una prima de riesgo endógena a su evolución. Las estimaciones se realizan con un panel desbalanceado de trece economías, seis de la región, para el periodo 1985–2016. Los resultados sugieren que el límite de la deuda pública de país se situaría en 56% del PIB y el espacio fiscal ascendería a 7 p.p. del producto, el cual luce estrecho especialmente por la sensibilidad de la deuda a los choques externos. Frente a otros países de la región, Chile cuenta con el mayor espacio fiscal, al tiempo que México y Ecuador, con endeudamientos cercanos al colombiano, disponen de menor espacio. **** ABSTRACT: This paper assess the public debt limit and fiscal space for Colombia and some emerging economies, under the fiscal fatigue approach (Ghosh et. al., 2013). The fatigue phenomenon occurs under situations of continuous increases of both debt and interest payments, which lead to government´s efforts to obtain primary surpluses to deteriorate. The paper uses the spline technique to estimate the government's reaction function to debt dynamics and proposes a sovereign risk premium endogenous to the level of indebtedness. Estimates carry out with an unbalanced panel of thirteen economies, six of them from Latin America, for the period 1985-2016. Results suggest that the limit of Colombian public debt would be 56% of GDP and that fiscal space would amount to 7 points of GDP, which looks so narrow due to the debt sensitivity to external shocks. In front to other countries, Chile has the largest fiscal space, while Mexico and Ecuador, with comparable indebtedness to the Colombian, have lower spaces.
E27|The Effect of the Employer Match and Defaults on Federal Workersâ€™ Savings Behavior in the Thrift Savings Plan: Working Paper 2019-06|Policymakers are weighing options that would change the retirement system for federal workers by shifting more of their deferred compensation from the defined benefit plan toward the defined contribution plan, called the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). We use administrative longitudinal data on federal workersâ€™ demographics, compensation, and TSP behavior to estimate the effects of an employer match and plan default options on workersâ€™ TSP savings behavior and the cost of employer contributions. We rely primarily on two sources of exogenous variation stemming from policy changes
E27|Forecasting GDP all over the World: Evidence from Comprehensive Survey Data|Comprehensive and international comparable leading indicators across countries and continents are rare. In this paper, we use a free and fast available source of leading indicators, the World Economic Survey (WES) conducted by the ifo Institute, to forecast growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 44 countries and three country aggregates separately. We come up with three major results. First, for 35 countries as well as the three aggregates a model containing one of the major WES indicators produces on average lower forecast errors compared to an autoregressive benchmark model. Second, the most important WES indicators are either the economic climate or the expectations on future economic development for the next six months. And last, 70% of all country-specific models contain WES information from at least one of the main trading partners. Thus, by allowing WES indicators from economic important partners to forecast GDP of the country under consideration, increases forecast accuracy.
E27|Changing Business Cycles: The Role of Women's Employment|This paper studies the impact of changing trends in female labor supply on productivity, TFP growth and aggregate business cycles. We find that the growth in women’s labor supply and relative productivity added substantially to TFP growth from the early 1980s, even if it depressed average labor productivity growth, contributing to the 1970s productivity slowdown. We also show that the lower cyclicality of female hours and their growing share can account for a large fraction of the reduced cyclicality of aggregate hours during the great moderation, as well as the decline in the correlation between average labor productivity and hours. Finally, we show that the discontinued growth in female labor supply starting in the 1990s played a substantial role in the jobless recoveries following the 1990-1991, 2001 and 2007-2009 recessions. Moreover, it depressed aggregate hours, output growth and male wages during the late 1990s and mid 2000s expansions. These results suggest that continued growth in female employment since the early 1990s would have significantly improved economic performance in the United States.
E27|Incentive-driven Inattention|This paper establishes a link between incentives and limited attention in economic decision-making. We explore how agents' attention reacts to incentives versus the arrival of information and how each factor affects the quality of decisions. We analyze a unique survey dataset where professional forecasters decide when to update a forecast and there is a formal incentive in the form of a contest rewarding forecast accuracy. There is also a major piece of information arriving right after the contest. We empirically establish that the contest is the primary driver of updating decisions and accuracy improvements. Then, we develop and structurally estimate a rational inattention model where agents choose how much attention to allocate to updating. The estimated model fits the data and allows us to perform counterfactuals to quantify the value of the contest and how it affects updates and accuracy, as well as to establish the optimal timing of the contest.
E27|Predicting Consumer Default: A Deep Learning Approach|We develop a model to predict consumer default based on deep learning. We show that the model consistently outperforms standard credit scoring models, even though it uses the same data. Our model is interpretable and is able to provide a score to a larger class of borrowers relative to standard credit scoring models while accurately tracking variations in systemic risk. We argue that these properties can provide valuable insights for the design of policies targeted at reducing consumer default and alleviating its burden on borrowers and lenders, as well as macroprudential regulation.
E27|Mind the gap! Stylized dynamic facts and structural models|We study what happens to identified shocks and to dynamic responses when the data generating process features q disturbances but less than q variables are used in the empirical model. Identified shocks are mongrels: they are linear combinations of current and past values of all structural disturbances and do not necessarily combine disturbances of the same type. Sound restrictions may be insufficient to obtain structural dynamics. The theory used to interpret the data and the disturbances it features determine whether an empirical model is too small. An example shows the magnitude of the distortions and the steps needed to reduce them. We revisit the evidence regarding the transmission of house price and of uncertainty shocks.
E27|Australian macro-econometric models and their construction - A short history|The paper provides a short account of the major complete macroeconometric models that have been constructed in Australia. Initially these were by academics but later both the Treasury and Reserve Bank of Australia developed these for policy analysis and forecasting, so that the history focusses a good deal on what was developed in those institutions. The basic strategy of the paper is to set out the modelling themes that were occurring overseas and then to discuss the same variants in Australia. In a number of instances Australian research might be considered to have been well ahead of overseas developments.
E27|Professional Forecasters and January|Each month various professional forecasters give forecasts for next year's real GDP growth and many other variables. In terms of forecast updates, January is a special month, as then the forecast horizon moves to the following calendar year, and as such the observation is not a revision. Instead of deleting the January data when analyzing forecast updates, this paper proposes a periodic version of an often considered test regression, to explicitly include and model the January data. An application of this periodic model for many forecasts across a range of countries learns that apparently there is a January optimism effect. In fact, in January, GDP forecast updates are suddenly positive, and at the same time the forecast updates for unemployment are likewise negative. This optimism about the new year of the professional forecasters is however found to be detrimental to forecast accuracy. The main conclusion is that forecasts created in January for the next year need to be treated with care.
E27|A Theory of Housing Demand Shocks|Aggregate housing demand shocks are an important source of house price fluctuations in the standard macroeconomic models, and through the collateral channel, they drive macroeconomic fluctuations. These reduced-form shocks, however, fail to generate a highly volatile price-to-rent ratio that comoves with the house price observed in the data (the “price-rent puzzle”). We build a tractable heterogeneous-agent model that provides a microeconomic foundation for housing demand shocks. The model predicts that a credit supply shock can generate large comovements between the house price and the price-to-rent ratio. We provide empirical evidence from cross-country and cross-MSA data to support this theoretical prediction.
E27|Biased Forecasts to Affect Voting Decisions? The Brexit Case|This paper introduces macroeconomic forecasters as political agents and suggests that they use their forecasts to infuence voting outcomes. We develop a probabilistic voting model in which voters do not have complete information about the future states of the economy and have to rely on macroeconomic forecasters. The model predicts that it is optimal for forecasters with economic interest (stakes) and influence to publish biased forecasts prior to a referendum. We test our theory using high-frequency data at the forecaster level surrounding the Brexit referendum. The results show that forecasters with stakes and influence released much more pessimistic estimates for GDP growth in the following year than other forecasters. Actual GDP growth rate in 2017 shows that forecasters with stakes and influence were also more incorrect than other institutions and the propaganda bias explains up to 50 percent of their forecast error.

E27|Sectoral Production and Diffusion Index Forecasts for Output in Lithuania|In this paper, we develop and describe quarterly data on disaggregated sectors in Lithuania which covers the period 1998-2018. The data is useful for empirical studies requiring panels with a large number of time observations and a large number of cross-sectional units. We follow the NACE2 level of disaggregation in developing our data, thus allowing us to combine the data with world input-output tables which we in turn use to identify the hubs and the main importing and exporting sectors within the economy. The data is then used for forecasting the growth rate of GDP. There is a substantial increase in the degree of covariation among sectoral production growth rates, which is observed using a split sample around 2008. When we apply factor methods, we find that this strong covariation can be explained by a few factors which are closely correlated to the growth of the retail and wholesale sectors. For GDP growth, the forecasts we consider are the diffusion index forecasts produced using a few indexes that summarize sectoral data, and the forecasts produced using the production growth of selected hubs and importing and exporting sectors. We find that the diffusion indexes and the production growth of sectors that make heavy use of imported inputs in their production have interesting forecasting power for the growth rate of GDP in the 2006-2011 and 2012-2018 periods.
E27|Changing Business Cycles: The Role of Women's Employment|This paper builds a real DSGE model with gender differences in labor supply and productivity. The model is used to assess the impact of changing trends in female labor supply on productivity and TFP growth and aggregate business cycles. We find that the growth in women's labor supply and relative productivity contributed substantially to TFP growth starting from the early 1980s, even if it depressed average labor productivity growth, contributing to the 1970s productivity slowdown. We also show that the lower cyclicality of female hours and their growing share in aggregate hours is able to account for a large fraction of the decline in the cyclicality of aggregate hours during the great moderation, as well as the decline in the correlation between average labor productivity and hours. Finally, we show that the discontinued growth in female labor supply after the 1990s played a substantial role in the jobless recoveries following the 2001 and 2007-2009 recession. Moreover, it also depressed aggregate hours and output growth during the late 1990s and mid 2000s expansions and it reduced male wages. These results suggest that continued growth in female hours since the early 1990s would have significantly improved economic performance in the United States.
E27|Long-term macroeconomic effects of climate change: A cross-country analysis|We study the long-term impact of climate change on economic activity across countries, using a stochastic growth model where labour productivity is affected by country-specific climate variables - defined as deviations of temperature and precipitation from their historical norms. Using a panel data set of 174 countries over the years 1960 to 2014, we find that per-capita real output growth is adversely affected by persistent changes in the temperature above or below its historical norm, but we do not obtain any statistically significant effects for changes in precipitation. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that a persistent increase in average global temperature by 0.04oC per year, in the absence of mitigation policies, reduces world real GDP per capita by 7.22 percent by 2100. On the other hand, abiding by the Paris Agreement, thereby limiting the temperature increase to 0.01oC per annum, reduces the loss substantially to 1.07 percent. These effects vary significantly across countries. We also provide supplementary evidence using data on a sample of 48 U.S. states between 1963 and 2016, and show that climate change has a long-lasting adverse impact on real output in various states and economic sectors, and on labour productivity and employment.
E27|From Transactions Data to Economic Statistics: Constructing Real-Time, High-Frequency, Geographic Measures of Consumer Spending|Access to timely information on consumer spending is important to economic policymakers. The Census Bureau’s monthly retail trade survey is a primary source for monitoring consumer spending nationally, but it is not well suited to study localized or short-lived economic shocks. Moreover, lags in the publication of the Census estimates and subsequent, sometimes large, revisions diminish its usefulness for real-time analysis. Expanding the Census survey to include higher frequencies and subnational detail would be costly and would add substantially to respondent burden. We take an alternative approach to fill these information gaps. Using anonymized transactions data from a large electronic payments technology company, we create daily estimates of retail spending at detailed geographies. Our daily estimates are available only a few days after the transactions occur, and the historical time series are available from 2010 to the present. When aggregated to the national level, the pattern of monthly growth rates is similar to the official Census statistics. We discuss two applications of these new data for economic analysis: First, we describe how our monthly spending estimates are useful for real-time monitoring of aggregate spending, especially during the government shutdown in 2019, when Census data were delayed and concerns about the economy spiked. Second, we show how the geographic detail allowed us quantify in real time the spending effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in 2017.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
E27|An attitude of complexity: thirteen essays on the nature and construction of reality under the challenge of Zeno's Paradox|This book is about the construction of reality. The central aim of this study is to understand how gravity works and how it may be focused and manipulated. While I do not have an answer to this question, the discoveries along the way have been worth collecting into a single volume for future reference.
E27|Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) dynamics in India: what do ARIMA models tell us?|Using annual time series data on net FDI inflows in India from 1960 to 2017, the study examines net FDI inflows using the Box – Jenkins ARIMA methodology. The ADF tests reflect that India FDI net FDI inflows data is I (1). Based on the AIC, the study presents the ARIMA (1, 1, 0) model. The diagnostic tests further show that the presented parsimonious model is not only stable but also suitable for explaining net FDI dynamics in India. The results of the study indicate that, net FDI inflows in India are likely to weaken over the next 10 years. The study identifies two (2) significant policy recommendations in an effort to aid policy makers on how to promote and stimulate the much expected net FDI inflows in India.
E27|Working Time, Employment and Competitiveness|Abstract This report studies working time and competitiveness. The first part of the report compares working time in Finland to other European countries using working time data from Eurostat and provides a review of the economics literature on working time and employment. The second part of the report studies the impact of the Competitiveness Pact on employment and Finnish competitiveness using Etla’s macro model. This analysis separates the impact of working time extension and social security contributions and taxation on employment. The results of the working time comparison show that the average hours worked are little less than an hour shorter in Finland compared to the EU average. The low incidence of part-time work increases the average hours worked in Finland, while the working hours of both full-time and part-time employees are among the shortest in Europe. Annual holidays, public holidays and absences decrease working time in Finland more than in most other European countries. The literature review shows that the impact of working time changes on employment depend crucially on how they affect labor costs. The Competitiveness Pact increased employment and improved Finnish competitiveness. Working time extensions account for about 40% of the employment impact, while the rest is accounted for by the reductions in social security contributions and taxation.
E27|Commodity Price Uncertainty as a Leading Indicator of Economic Activity|In this paper we examine the impact of commodity price uncertainty on US economic activity. Our empirical analysis indicates that uncertainty in agricultural, metals and energy markets depresses US economic activity and acts as an early warning signal for US recessions with a forecasting horizon ranging from one to twelve months. The results reveal that uncertainty shocks in agricultural and metals markets are more significant for the US macroeconomy when compared to oil price uncertainty shocks. Finally, we show that when accounting for the effects of macroeconomic and monetary factors, the negative dynamic response of economic activity to agricultural and metals price uncertainty shocks remains unaltered, while the response to energy uncertainty shocks is significantly reduced due to either systematic policy reactions or random shocks in monetary policy.
E27|Money Neutrality, Monetary Aggregates and Machine Learning|The issue of whether or not money affects real economic activity (money neutrality) has attracted significant empirical attention over the last five decades. If money is neutral even in the short-run, then monetary policy is ineffective and its role limited. If money matters, it will be able to forecast real economic activity. In this study, we test the traditional simple sum monetary aggregates that are commonly used by central banks all over the world and also the theoretically correct Divisia monetary aggregates proposed by the Barnett Critique (Chrystal and MacDonald, 1994; Belongia and Ireland, 2014), both in three levels of aggregation: M1, M2, and M3. We use them to directionally forecast the Eurocoin index: A monthly index that measures the growth rate of the euro area GDP. The data span from January 2001 to June 2018. The forecasting methodology we employ is support vector machines (SVM) from the area of machine learning. The empirical results show that: (a) The Divisia monetary aggregates outperform the simple sum ones and (b) both monetary aggregates can directionally forecast the Eurocoin index reaching the highest accuracy of 82.05% providing evidence against money neutrality even in the short term.
E27|Macroeconomic Impacts of Trade Credit: An Agent-Based Modeling Exploration|This paper explores the effects of trade credit by assessing its macroeconomic impacts on several dimensions. To that end, we develop an agent-based model (ABM) with two types of firms: downstream firms, which produce a final good for consumption purposes using intermediate goods, and upstream firms, which produce and supply those intermediate goods to the downstream firms. Upstream firms can act as trade credit suppliers, by allowing delayed payment of a share of their sales to downstream firms. Our results suggest a potential trade-off between financial robustness as measured by the proportion of non-performing loans and the average output level. The intuitive reason is that greater availability of trade credit, which however does not necessarily imply proportionately greater actual use of it by downstream firms, allows more financial resources to remain in the real sector, favoring the latterâ€™s financial robustness. Yet, given that trade credit is proportionally more beneficial to smaller downstream firms, it enhances market competition. This results in a decrease in markups and thereby in profits and dividends, which contributes negatively to aggregate demand formation
E27|Asset Dynamics, Liquidity, And Inequality In Decentralized Markets|The Kiyotaki and Wright model has exerted a considerable influence on the monetary search literature. We argue that the model also delivers important insights into a broader range of macroeconomic and development issues. The analysis studies how market frictions and the liquidity of assets affect the distribution of income. Experiments illustrate how the economy adjusts to shocks to asset returns and to the matching technology. They also deal with long‐run transition. An experiment interprets the reversal of fortune hypothesis as a situation in which an economy with a low‐return asset takes over a similar economy with a high‐return asset.

E27|The Shape of Eurozone’s Uncertainty: Its Impact and Predictive Value on GDP|This paper examines the role of uncertainty in the context of the business cycle in the Eurozone. To gain a more granular perspective on uncertainty, the paper decomposes uncertainty along two dimensions: First, we construct the four different moments of uncertainty, including the point estimate, the standard deviation, the skewness and the kurtosis. The second dimension of uncertainty spans along three distinct groups of economic agents, including consumers, corporates and financial markets. Based on this taxonomy, we construct uncertainty indices and assess the impact on real GDP via impulse response functions and further investigate their informational value in rolling out-of-sample GDP forecasts. The analysis lends evidence to the hypothesis that higher uncertainty expressed through the point estimate, a larger standard deviation among confidence estimates, positive skewness and a higher kurtosis are all negatively correlated with the business cycle. The impulse response functions reveal that in particular the first and the second moment of uncertainty cause a permanent effect on GDP with an initial decline and a subsequent overshoot. We find uncertainty in the corporate sector to be the main driver behind this observation, followed by financial markets’ uncertainty whose initial effect on GDP is comparable but receding much faster. While the first two moments of uncertainty improve GDP forecasts significantly, both the skewness and the kurtosis do not augment the forecast quality any further.
E27|Nowcasting the Unemployment Rate in the EU with Seasonal BVAR and Google Search Data|Abstract In this paper a Bayesian vector autoregressive model for nowcasting the seasonally non-adjusted unemployment rate in EU-countries is developed. On top of the official statistical releases, the model utilizes Google search data and the effect of Google data on the forecasting performance of the model is assessed. The Google data is found to yield modest improvements in forecasting accuracy of the model. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first time the forecasting performance of the Google search data has been studied in the context of Bayesian vector autoregressive model. This paper also adds to the empirical literature on the hyperparameter choice with Bayesian vector autoregressive models. The hyperparameters are set according to the mode of the posterior distribution of the hyperparameters, and this is found to improve the out-of-sample forecasting accuracy of the model significantly, compared to the rule-of-thumb values often used in the literature.
E27|Convergenta macroeconomica si regionala|The study is mainly focussed on the analysis of real convergence process in EU and inside of each of three conventional groups of countries (western, southern, and eastern). Moreover, the structural convergence (evaluated by the shares of main sectors of economy in total employment) and regional convergence (inside of each country) are analysed. Generally, dynamics of the estimated specific indicators of convergence after 2000 shows a strong real and structural convergence, both at the level of EU and inside of each groups of countries. However, the study demonstrated a more complex process in case of the regional convergence.
E27|The Economic Consequences of Migration: An Input-Output Approach|The main purpose of this paper is to contribute for a better understanding of the economic consequences of migration. In a first step, the different consumption patterns of nationals and foreigners are measured, using data from a Family Income and Expenditure Survey in Portugal (Inquérito às Despesas das Famílias, 2010/2011). Households are grouped according to the proportion of foreigners and the consumption structures of these groups are determined and compared. This information is useful in assessing the differences in living conditions across national and migrant families. In a second step, the sectoral and macroeconomic impacts (in Gross Output, Value Added, GDP and Imports) of these different consumption structures are simulated, using an Input-Output approach. These results allow us to project the demand led effects of a growing in-migration flow to Portugal, (both of workers and retirees) expected for the coming years. In a third (future) step of this research project, other consequences of migration will also be studied, namely, supply side effects (labor force, wages and profits, productivity), government budget and social security income and expenditure effects, demographic trend effects, etc.
E27|The North-South Divide, the Euro and the World|The European north-south divide has been an issue of a long-standing debate. We employ a Global VAR model for 28 developed and developing countries to examine the interaction between the global trade imbalances and their impact within the euro-area framework. The aim is to assess the propagation mechanisms of real shocks, focusing on the interconnections among the north euro area and the south euro area. We incorporate theory-based long-run restrictions and examine the effects of (i) non-export real output shocks, (ii) expansionary shocks and (iii) real exchange rate shocks. The results provide support for symmetric adjustment in the euro area; an expansionary policy of the north euro area and increased competitiveness in the south euro area can alleviate trade imbalances of the debtor euro area economies. From the south euro area perspective, internal devaluation is the most beneficial policy. North euro area and U.S. origin shocks to domestic output exert a dominant influence in the rest of the Europe and Asia while the strong linkage between trade flows within the euro area is confirmed.
E27|Job creation and economic impact of renewable energy in Netherlands|This study evaluates the economic impact of a shift towards renewable electricity mix in the Netherlands using the neo-Keynesian CGEM ThreeME (Multi-sector Macroeconomic Model for the Evaluation of Environmental and Energy policy). This scenario has been inspired by the Urgenda's report ‘Energy 100% Sustainable in the Netherlands by 2030’, which have been quantified using the Energy Transition Model (ETM) developed by Quintel. Using the output of the ETM regarding the change in the electricity generation shares as input in ThreeME, we derive the impact in terms of key economic variables (GDP, employment, investment, value-added, prices, trade, tax revenue, etc.). We find that transition to renewable energy may have a positive impact on the Dutch economy, creating almost 50 000 new jobs by 2030 and adding almost 1% of gross domestic product
E27|Une comparaison des prévisions macroéconomiques 2018-2020 sur la France|Nous comparons les prévisions de croissance de l'économie française à l'horizon 2020 réalisées entre septembre et début novembre 2018 par 18 organismes (publics et privés, dont l'OFCE). Après avoir augmenté de 2,3 % en 2017, l'activité ralentirait pour l'ensemble des prévisionnistes interrogés à 1,6 % en moyenne en 2018. Il n'y a pas d'accélération prévue à l'horizon de l'exercice de prévision : l'activité progresserait en moyenne de 1,6 % en 2019 et de 1,5 % 2020 (avec 8 instituts sur 12 qui prévoient un ralentissement). Mais les moteurs de la croissance changeraient. En 2017, la croissance avait été tirée par une forte contribution de la demande intérieure hors stocks tandis que le commerce extérieur jouait négativement. L'histoire est toute autre en 2018, le commerce extérieur, par sa contribution positive, contribuerait à compenser partiellement une demande intérieure moins dynamique. En 2019 et 2020, c'est l'inverse. L'accélération de la consommation des ménages permise par l'amélioration des revenus soutiendrait la croissance, tandis que l'investissement resterait solide. L'environnement international serait moindre favorable et les risques sur la croissance, plutôt orientés à la baisse. Si un consensus existe autour de ce scénario central, il masque malgré tout des divergences entre instituts liées notamment aux hypothèses relatives au positionnement de l'économie française dans son cycle, et donc au degré de tensions dans l'économie. Pour tous, l'inflation reste globalement modérée en prévision (entre 1,4 % et 1,9 % en 2020 selon les instituts) mais l'inflation sous-jacente s'accélère, tout en restant inférieure à 2 %, et certains instituts considèrent que des contraintes d'offre existent, notamment sur le marché du travail. Le taux de chômage baisserait de 9,4 % en 2017 à entre 8,1 % pour les plus optimistes à 9,1 % les plus pessimistes en fin de période. La progression des salaires resterait malgré tout contenue sur la période (avec un maximum à 2,6 % en 2020). L'impact positif des réformes passées et en cours sur la croissance du PIB et la compétitivité des entreprises ne ressort pas véritablement des scénarios. La France est sortie de la Procédure de déficit excessif en 2018 et tous les instituts prévoient le respect des règles budgétaires concernant le déficit public, qui resterait en-deçà du seuil des 3 % à l'horizon 2020. Néanmoins, le déficit se dégraderait 2019, du fait de mesures exceptionnelles (remboursement aux entreprises de la taxe sur les dividendes et transformation du CICE en baisses de charges sociales employeurs) et d'une amélioration de la composante conjoncturelle plus limitée qu'en 2017. En 2020, il serait compris entre 2,7 % et 1,6 % du PIB.
E27|Une comparaison des prévisions macroéconomiques sur la France|Alors que l'INSEE vient de publier une première estimation de la croissance française de 2017 (1,9 %), nous comparons les prévisions pour 2018 et 2019 réalisées par 18 organismes (publics et privés, dont l'OFCE) entre septembre et décembre 2017. Pour tous la reprise semble solidement enclenchée et durable, avec une croissance moyenne prévue de 1,8 % en 2018 puis de 1,7 % en 2019 : les prévisions sont assez proches pour 2018 (1,7 % à 2 %) mais s'étalent de 1,4 % à 2,2 % en 2019 (avec 8 instituts sur 15 qui prévoient un ralentissement). La consommation privée accélérerait un peu (1,6 % en 2018 et 1,7 % en 2019), avec des écarts nets entre instituts. En effet, l'emploi progresserait entre 0,6 et 1,9 % en 2019 et les salaires entre 1,3 % et 2,6 %. Le diagnostic sur les salaires dépend du degré de tensions sur le marché du travail, de l'impact de l'inflation et des gains de productivité et de l'effet de la réforme du marché du travail de 2017 (décentralisation des négociations collectives). L'inflation resterait modérée (1,4 % en 2019). Le taux de chômage baisserait à 8,8 % en moyenne en 2019 mais les prévisions varient entre 8,1 % et 9,2 %.

E27|Une comparaison des prévisions macroéconomiques 2018-2020 sur la France|Nous comparons les prévisions de croissance de l'économie française à l'horizon 2020 réalisées entre septembre et début novembre 2018 par 18 organismes (publics et privés, dont l'OFCE). Après avoir augmenté de 2,3 % en 2017, l'activité ralentirait pour l'ensemble des prévision- nistes interrogés à 1,6 % en moyenne en 2018. Il n'y a pas d'accélération prévue à l'horizon de l'exercice de prévision : l'activité progresserait en moyenne de 1,6 % en 2019 et de 1,5 % 2020 (avec 8 instituts sur 12 qui prévoient un ralentissement). Mais les moteurs de la croissance changeraient. En 2017, la croissance avait été tirée par une forte contribution de la demande intérieure hors stocks tandis que le commerce extérieur jouait négativement. L'histoire est toute autre en 2018, le commerce extérieur, par sa contribution positive, contribuerait à compenser partiellement une demande intérieure moins dynamique. En 2019 et 2020, c'est l'inverse. L'accélération de la consommation des ménages permise par l'amélioration des revenus soutiendrait la croissance, tandis que l'investissement resterait solide. L'environnement international serait moindre favorable et les risques sur la croissance, plutôt orientés à la baisse.

E27|Diffusion of Shared Goods in Consumer Coalitions. An Agent-Based Model|This paper focuses on the process of coalition formation conditioning the common decision to adopt a shared good, which cannot be afforded by an average single consumer and whose use cannot be exhausted by any single consumer. An agent based model is developed to study the interplay between these two processes: coalition formation and diffusion of shared goods. Coalition formation is modelled in an evolutionary game theoretic setting, while adoption uses elements from both the Bass and the threshold models. Coalitions formation sets the conditions for adoption, while diffusion influences the consequent formation of coalitions. Results show that both coalitions and diffusion are subject to network effects and have an impact on the information flow though the population of consumers. Large coalitions are preferred over small ones since individual cost is lower, although it increases if higher quantities are purchased collectively. The paper concludes by connecting the model conceptualisation to the on-going discussion of diffusion of sustainable goods, discussing related policy implications.
E27|The Use of Business Expectations in the Short-Term Forecasting of Economic Activity in Ukrainian|This paper focuses on the predictive capability of business outlook survey findings in forecasting changes in Ukraine’s real GDP, and in its consumption and investment components. Survey findings have been generalized through the use of principal component analysis. The business outlook index compiled by the National Bank of Ukraine is used as an alternative measure. To forecast GDP and its components, we employ ARDL and VAR models, which factor in the estimated principal components, the business outlook index, and the business outlook survey findings for construction investment over the next 12 months. In estimating the predictive capability of the models, we use pseudo-out-of-sample forecasting. A comparison with actual data shows that annual GDP and consumption growth are best forecast in the current period by applying business outlook survey findings that have been generalized using a principal component analysis, and the first difference of the business outlook index.
E27|Money circulation and debt circulation: A restatement of quantity theory of money|Both money and debt are products of credit creation of banks. Money is always circulating among traders by facilitating commodity transactions. In contrast, debt is created by borrowing and annihilated by repayment as it is matured. However, when this creation- annihilation process is mediated by banks which are constrained by a credit capacity, there exists continuous transfer of debt among debtors, which can be defined as debt circulation. This paper presents a multi-agent model in which income determination, credit creation, and credit transaction are integrated. A hypothetical economy composed of a banking system and multiple traders is proposed, in which the traders are allowed to borrow money from the bank once their expenditure cannot be financed by their own funds. In order to demonstrate the circulations of money and debt from the micro view, the authors track the transfer processes of them and collect their holding times respectively. When the traders could afford their expenditures, only money circulation can be observed. However, as they are forced to borrow, the money circulation is accelerated and debt circulation emerges. Both distributions of holding times of money and debt are found to take exponential form due to the random nature of exchanges. The velocity of money circulation is determined by the expending behavior of traders, while the velocity of debt circulation is associated with the repayment behavior of debtors. Consequently, the aggregate income can be decomposed into two parts: one comes from money circulation and the other from debt circulation.
E27|Weather-induced Short-term Fluctuations of Economic Output|We contribute to the recent literature on the economic effects of those weather conditions that deviate from their regular seasonal pattern. To this end we use local temperature and snow measurements across Germany to analyze their impact on German monthly total industrial and construction-sector production. We find noticeable effects of the various (linear and nonlinear, contemporaneous and dynamic) weather regressors, which in the –seasonally adjusted– construction sector growth data imply an extra explanatory power of more than 50% of the variation, compared to benchmark predictive regressions. As expected, the impact is quite a bit less in total industrial production. From our estimates we obtain (seasonally as well as) weather adjusted production series, and our regression-based approach also yields confidence intervals for these adjustments. The estimated adjustments are quantitatively relevant also for broad output (quarterly GDP). In a mixed-frequency framework we find some value of the estimated monthly weather impact for quarterly GDP nowcasts in (quasi) real time.
E27|Idiosyncratic Risk, Aggregate Risk, And The Welfare Effects Of Social Security|We ask whether a pay‐as‐you‐go financed social security system is welfare improving in an economy with idiosyncratic and aggregate risk. We show that the whole welfare benefit from insurance against both risks is greater than the sum of benefits from insurance against the isolated risks. One reason is the convexity of the welfare gain. The other reason is a direct risk interaction amplifying the utility losses from risk. Our quantitative evaluation shows that introducing a minimum pension leads to sizeable welfare gains, despite substantial crowding out. About 60% of these gains would be missing from summing up the isolated benefits.
E27|“A regional perspective on the accuracy of machine learning forecasts of tourism demand based on data characteristics”|In this work we assess the role of data characteristics in the accuracy of machine learning (ML) tourism forecasts from a spatial perspective. First, we apply a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on non-parametric regression to isolate the different components of the time series of international tourism demand to all Spanish regions. This approach allows us to compute a set of measures to describe the features of the data. Second, we analyse the performance of several ML models in a recursive multiple-step-ahead forecasting experiment. In a third step, we rank all seventeen regions according to their characteristics and the obtained forecasting performance, and use the rankings as the input for a multivariate analysis to evaluate the interactions between time series features and the accuracy of the predictions. By means of dimensionality reduction techniques we summarise all the information into two components and project all Spanish regions into perceptual maps. We find that entropy and dispersion show a negative relation with accuracy, while the effect of other data characteristics on forecast accuracy is heavily dependent on the forecast horizon.
E27|Consumer confidenceâ€™s boom and bust in Latin America|We characterize consumer confidence cycle across LatAm using Markov-switching models. Our findings show that a core group of countries shares a statistical common ground for both confidenceâ€™s boom and bust cycle synchronisation. Notably, Argentina and Chile tend to lead consumer mood shifts, playing a leading role in propagating consumer confidence shocks throughout LatAm.
E27|Fundamental Drivers of Existing Home Sales in Canada|Existing home sales’ share of Canada’s economic pie has been rising in recent years, and variation around this trend has resulted in outsized contributions to changes in real gross domestic product (GDP). In this context, we use a cointegration framework to estimate the level of resale activity across the Canadian provinces that is supported by fundamentals—namely, full-time employment, housing affordability and migration flows—to help look through the volatility. The results suggest that, over longer horizons, resales activity and these fundamentals share a stable relationship, although deviations are sometimes persistent. We also find a robust and positive relationship between house price growth and deviations of existing home sales from fundamentals. While predicting quarterly changes in resales remains very difficult, provincial models improve upon national and naïve benchmarks and provide a useful framework for identifying risks to GDP growth that stem directly from the resale market.
E27|The Framework for Risk Identification and Assessment|Risk assessment models are an important component of the Bank’s analytical tool kit for assessing the resilience of the financial system. We describe the Framework for Risk Identification and Assessment (FRIDA), a suite of models developed at the Bank of Canada to quantify the impact of financial stability risks to the broader economy and a range of financial system participants (households, businesses and banks). These risks are tail-risk events that are rare and severe but plausible. FRIDA combines models that quantify the impact of risks on both aggregate macrofinancial variables and different types of financial system participants, thus allowing us to understand the channels through which severe shocks could be transmitted and amplified within the financial system. By including sectoral models, FRIDA can consider the rich institutional features and heterogeneity that characterize different parts of the financial system and capture the various channels through which they can be affected by shocks. Like any model, FRIDA faces model uncertainty. Consequently, results from FRIDA are used in combination with expert judgment to form an overall assessment of financial stability risks.
E27|Can media and text analytics provide insights into labour market conditions in China?|The official Chinese labour market indicators have been seen as problematic, given their small cyclical movement and their only-partial capture of the labour force. In our paper, we build a monthly Chinese labour market conditions index (LMCI) using text analytics applied to mainland Chinese-language newspapers over the period from 2003 to 2017. We use a supervised machine learning approach by training a support vector machine classification model. The information content and the forecast ability of our LMCI are tested against official labour market activity measures in wage and credit growth estimations. Surprisingly, one of our findings is that the much-maligned official labour market indicators do contain information. However, their information content is not robust and, in many cases, our LMCI can provide forecasts that are significantly superior. Moreover, regional disaggregation of the LMCI illustrates that labour conditions in the export-oriented coastal region are sensitive to export growth, while those in inland regions are not. This suggests that text analytics can, indeed, be used to extract useful labour market information from Chinese newspaper articles.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

E27|Modelling the Macrofinancial Effects of a House Price Correction in Canada|We use a suite of risk-assessment models to examine the possible impact of a hypothetical house price correction, centred in the Toronto and Vancouver areas. We also assume financial stress significantly amplifies the macroeconomic impact of the house price decline. The rates of arrears rise for households and businesses, which puts some pressure on banks. But the large banks remain resilient through the risk scenario, supported by their international diversification and their ability to replenish capital with retained earnings. As with any simulation exercise, the results are subject to significant uncertainty and depend on the specifics of the scenario being considered.
E27|A short-term forecasting model for the Spanish economy: GDP and its demand components|This document describes the key aspects of the extended and revised version of Spain-STING (Spain, Short-Term Indicator of Growth), which is a tool used by the Banco de España for the short-term forecasting of the Spanish economy’s GDP and its demand components. Drawing on a broad set of indicators, several dynamic factor models are estimated. These models allow the forecasting of GDP, private consumption, public expenditure, investment in capital goods, construction investment, exports and imports in a consistent way. We assess the predictive power of the GDP and its demand components for the period 2005- 2017. With regard to the GDP forecast, we find a slight improvement on the previous version of Spain-STING. As for the demand components, we show that our proposal is better than other possible time series models.
E27|Nowcasting private consumption: traditional indicators, uncertainty measures, credit cards and some internet data|The focus of this paper is on nowcasting and forecasting quarterly private consumption. The selection of real-time, monthly indicators focuses on standard (“hard” / “soft” indicators) and less-standard variables. Among the latter group we analyze: i) proxy indicators of economic and policy uncertainty; ii) payment cards’ transactions, as measured at “Point-of-sale” (POS) and ATM withdrawals; iii) indicators based on consumption-related search queries retrieved by means of the Google Trends application. We estimate a suite of mixed-frequency, time series models at the monthly frequency, on a real-time database with Spanish data, and conduct out-of-sample forecasting exercises to assess the relevant merits of the different groups of indicators. Some results stand out: i) “hard” and payments cards indicators are the best performers when taken individually, and more so when combined; ii) nonetheless, “soft” indicators are helpful to detect qualitative signals in the nowcasting horizon; iii) Google-based and uncertainty indicators add value when combined with traditional indicators, most notably at estimation horizons beyond the nowcasting one, what would be consistent with capturing information about future consumption decisions; iv) the combinations of models that include the best performing indicators tend to beat broader-based combinations.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
E27|New Keynesian NAIRU and the Okun Law: An application for Colombia|This paper proposes new monthly estimates for the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) and the output gap for Colombia. These rely on a New Keynesian small open economy model following González et al (2013), augmented by an Okun’s Law equation. The resulting output gap closely follows the business cycle, as identified by other estimates currently employed by the central bank. The unemployment gap is negatively correlated to the output gap, in a magnitude consistent with simple Okun Law’s estimations. Unlike previous works, this paper presents shocks decompositions, which allow for some economic interpretation of the unemployment dynamics in terms of macroeconomic shocks. This framework might be well suited to evaluate the effects of monetary policy on the labor market, as suggested by an evaluation of forecasting accuracy.
E27|Nowcasting economic activity with electronic payments data: A predictive modeling approach|Economic activity nowcasting (i.e. making current-period estimates) is convenient because most traditional measures of economic activity come with substantial lags. We aim at nowcasting ISE, a short-term economic activity indicator in Colombia. Inputs are ISE’s lags and a dataset of payments made with electronic transfers and cheques among individuals, firms, and the central government. Under a predictive modeling approach, we employ a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous neural network model. Results suggest that our choice of inputs and predictive method enable us to nowcast economic activity with fair accuracy. Also, we validate that electronic payments data significantly reduces the nowcast error of a benchmark non-linear autoregressive neural network model. Nowcasting economic activity from electronic payment instruments data not only contributes to agents’ decision making and economic modeling, but also supports new research paths on how to use retail payments data for appending current models.

E27|Asymmetric In?ation Expectations, Downward Rigidity of Wages,and Asymmetric Business Cycles|This paper shows that household expectations of the inflation rate are more responsive to inflationary news than to disinflationary news. This asymmetry in inflation expectations can be a source of downward nominal wage rigidity, since workers expectations adjust more quickly to inflationary shocks than disinflationary shocks. I embed asymmetric beliefs into a general equilibrium model and show that, in such a model, monetary policy has asymmetric effects on employment, output, and wage inflation consistent with the data. I microfound asymmetric household expectations using ambiguity-aversion: households, who do not know the quality of their information, overweight inflationary news since it reduces their purchasing power, and underweight deflationary news since it increases their purchasing power. Although wages are downwardly rigid in this environment, monetary policy need not have a bias towards using inflation to grease the wheels of the labor market.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
E27|The Forecasting Performance of Dynamic Factor Models with Vintage Data|We present a comparative analysis of the forecasting performance of two dynamic factor models, the Stock and Watson (2002a, b) model and the Forni, Hallin, Lippi and Reichlin (2005) model, based on vintage data. Our dataset that contains 107 monthly US “first release” macroeconomic and financial vintage time series, spanning the 1996:12 to 2017:6 period with monthly periodicity, extracted from the Bloomberg database†. We compute real-time one-month-ahead forecasts with both models for four key macroeconomic variables: the month-on-month change in industrial production, the unemployment rate, the core consumer price index and the ISM Purchasing Managers’ Index. First, we find that both the Stock and Watson and the Forni, Hallin, Lippi and Reichlin models outperform simple autoregressions for industrial production, unemployment rate and consumer prices, but that only the first model does so for the PMI. Second, we find that neither models always outperform the other. While Forni, Hallin, Lippi and Reichlin’s beats Stock and Watson’s in forecasting industrial production and consumer prices, the opposite happens for the unemployment rate and the PMI.
E27|A composite likelihood approach for dynamic structural models|We describe how to use the composite likelihood to ameliorate estimation, computational, and inferential problems in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models. We present a number of situations where the methodology has the potential to resolve well-known problems and formally justifies existing practices. In each case we consider, we provide an example to illustrate how the approach works and its properties in practice.
E27|The transition of China to sustainable growth – implications for the global economy and the euro area|China’s rise has been the economic success story of the past four decades but economic growth has been slowing and domestic imbalances have widened. This paper analyses the recent evolution of China’s imbalances, the risks they pose to the economic outlook and the potential impact of a transition to sustainable growth in China on the global and euro area economies. The paper documents China’s heavy reliance on investment and credit as drivers of growth, which has created vulnerabilities in a number of sectors and has been accompanied by increased complexity and leverage in the financial system. China retains some buffers, including policy space, to cushion against adverse shocks for the time being, but additional structural reforms would facilitate a shift of China’s economy onto a sustainable and strong growth trajectory in the medium term. China’s size, trade openness, dominant position as consumer of commodities and growing financial integration mean that its transition to sustainable growth is crucial for the global economic outlook. Simulation analysis using global macro models suggests that the spillovers to the euro area would be limited in the case of a modest slowdown in China’s GDP growth, but significant in the case of a sharp downturn. Sensitivity analysis underscores that the spillovers are dependent on the strengths of the various transmission channels, as well as the policy reaction by central banks and governments.

E27|Forecasting Inflation Expectations from the CESifo World Economic Survey: An Empirical Application in Inflation Targeting|The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we evaluate the responses to the questions on inflation expectations in the World Economic Survey for sixteen inflation targeting countries. Second, we compare inflation expectation forecasts across countries by using a two-step approach that selects the most accurate linear or non-linear forecasting method for each country. Then, using Self Organizing Maps, we cluster the inflation expectations, setting June 2014 as a benchmark. At this time there was a sharp decline in oil prices and by analyzing inflation expectations in the context of this price change, we can discriminate between countries that anticipated the oil shock smoothly and those that had to significantly adjust their expectations. Our main findings from the in-sample comparison of the WES surveys suggest that expert forecasts of inflation expectations are systematically distorted in 83 percent of the countries in the sample. On the other hand, our out of sample forecast analysis indicates that Non-linear Artificial Neural Networks combined with Bayesian regularization outperform ARIMA linear models for longer forecasting horizons. This holds true for countries with both soft and brisk changes of expectations. However, when forecasting one step ahead, the performance between the two methods is similar.
E27|Models, Inattention and Bayesian Updates|We formulate a theory of expectations updating that fits the dynamics of accuracy and disagreement in a new survey dataset where agents can update at any time while observing each other’s expectations. Agents use heterogeneous models and can be inattentive but, when updating, they follow Bayes’ rule and assign homogeneous weights to public information. Our empirical findings suggest that agents do not herd and, despite disagreement, they place high faith in their models, whereas during a crisis they lose this faith and undergo a paradigm shift. Bayesian updating fits the data well, but only in non-crisis years. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate this theory’s relative strengths and weaknesses in both crisis- and non-crisis years vis-a-vis several leading alternatives and find that it fits better on average and in non-crisis years.

E27|A stochastic estimated version of the Italian dynamic General Equilibrium Model (IGEM)|We estimate with Bayesian techniques the Italian dynamic General Equilibrium Model (IGEM), which has been developed at the Italian Treasury Department, Ministry of Economy and Finance, to assess the effects of alter-native policy interventions. We analyze and discuss the estimated effects of various shocks on the Italian economy. Compared to the calibrated version used for policy analysis, we find a lower wage rigidity and higher adjustment costs. The degree of prices and wages indexation to past inflation is much smaller than the indexation level assumed in the calibrated model. No substantial difference is found in the estimated monetary parameters. Estimated fiscal multipliers are slightly smaller than those obtained from the calibrated version of the model.

Numerous useful indicators are identified and forecast pooling of three model classes (bridge models, MIDAS models and unrestricted mixed-frequency models) are shown to outperform simple benchmark models. We further separately examine forecast accuracy of each of the three model classes. Our results show that differences in performance of model classes are generally small, but for the period covering the Great Recession unrestricted mixed-frequency models and MIDAS models clearly outperform bridge models. Notably, the sets of top-performing indicators differ for our two subsample observation periods (2008Q1â€“2011Q4 and 2012Q1â€“2016Q4). The best indicators in the first period are traditional real-sector variables, while those in the second period consist largely of monetary, banking sector and financial market variables. This finding supports the notion that highly volatile periods of recession and subsequent recovery are driven by forces other than those that prevail in more normal times. The results further suggest that the driving forces of the Russian economy have changed since the global financial crisis.
E27|Forecasting unemployment rates in Malta: A labour market flows approach|This study extends the flow approach to forecasting unemployment, as carried out by Barnichon and Nekarda (2013) and Barnichon and Garda (2016), to the Maltese labour market using a wider number of estimating techniques. The flow approach results in significant improvements in forecast accuracy over an autoregressive (AR) process. Particular improvements to forecasting accuracy are returned over shorter time horizons. When including flows, forecast improvements over both an AR process and non-flow forecasts are found when applying VECM methods. Bayesian and OLS VARs also show strong improvements over an AR, with or without the inclusion of flows. For Maltese data, the use of flows computed using aggregate data in these two latter methodologies does not bring about a significant improvement over the forecasts which exclude them.
E27|The impact of Taxation on Economic Growth in South Africa|This paper investigates the impact of taxation on economic growth in South Africa. Yearly data for South Africa for the period 1981 – 2016 was used to develop the Auto-Regressive Distribution Lag (ARDL) approach. The empirical results confirm that there is a negative relationship between taxes and economic growth in South Africa. The findings of the study include that economic growth, trade and openness, capital and taxes are co-integrated. This paper suggests that fiscal policy is very important to force sustainable economic growth in South Africa
E27|The Forcasting Performance of Dynamic Factor Models with Vintage Data|"We present a comparative analysis of the forecasting performance of two dynamic factor models, the Stock and Watson (2002a, b) model and the Forni, Hallin, Lippi and Reichlin (2005) model, based on vintage data. Our dataset contains 107 monthly US ""first release"" macroeconomic and financial vintage time series, spanning the 1996:12 to 2017:6 period with monthly periodicity, extracted from the Bloomberg database. We compute real-time one-month-ahead forecasts with both models for four key macroeconomic variables: the month-on-month change in industrial production, the unemployment rate, the core consumer price index and the ISM Purchasing Managers' Index. First, we find that both the Stock and Watson and the Forni, Hallin, Lippi and Reichlin models outperform simple autoregressions for industrial production, unemployment rate and consumer prices, but that only the first model does so for the PMI. Second, we find that neither models always outperform the other. While Forni, Hallin, Lippi and Reichlin's beats Stock and Watson's in forecasting industrial production and consumer prices, the opposite happens for the unemployment rate and the PMI."
E27|Expectations with Endogenous Information Acquisition: An Experimental Investigation|We use a survey experiment to generate direct evidence on how people acquire and process information. Participants can buy different information signals that could help them forecast the future median national home price. Participants put substantial value on their preferred signal and, when acquired, use the signal in the formation of their expectations. However, they disagree on which signal to buy. As a result, making information cheaper does not decrease the cross-sectional dispersion of expectations. We provide a model with costly acquisition and processing of information, and show that it can match almost all of our empirical results.
E27|Saving, investment, capital stock and current account projections in long-term scenarios|The paper describes the framework used in long-term economic scenarios for the projection of the saving rate, investment, capital stock and current account. The saving rate is determined according to an estimated equation which suggests that demographics, captured by the old-age dependency rate and life expectancy, is a major driver, with additional effects from the fiscal balance, labour productivity growth, the net oil trade balance, the availability of credit and the level of social protection. The evolution of the business sector capital stock depends on the economy’s cyclical position, product market regulation, employment protection legislation and the user cost of capital, and may be constrained by current account deficits depending on the degree of capital account openness. Business sector investment is derived from the capital stock projection via the usual stock-flow identity. The public sector capital stock-to-output ratio is assumed to be constant in the baseline scenario, but a public investment shock can be simulated in alternative scenarios. The current account balance is obtained as the difference between national investment and saving, and in turn determines the evolution of the net international investment position. A global interest rate premium helps to bring global saving and investment into balance.
E27|Investment as a transmission mechanism from weak demand to weak supply and the post-crisis productivity slowdown|Current weak labour productivity growth in many OECD countries reflects historically weak contributions from both total factor productivity (TFP) growth and capital deepening. The slowdown in trend productivity growth in the pre-crisis period is mostly explained by a long-established slowdown in TFP growth, but since the crisis the further deceleration is mainly due to weak capital deepening, a development apparent in practically every OECD country. Much of the weakness in the growth of the capital stock since the financial crisis can be explained by an accelerator response of investment to continued demand weakness, leading in turn to a deterioration of potential output via a hysteresis-like effect. For the most severely affected economies, the financial crisis is estimated to have reduced potential output by more than 2% via this transmission mechanism. In many OECD countries, declining government investment as a share of GDP has further exacerbated post-crisis weakness in capital stock growth, both directly and probably indirectly via adverse spillover effects on business investment. Finally, over a period when the use of conventional macro policy instruments was constrained, the slower pace of structural reform represents a missed opportunity, not least because more competition-friendly product market regulation could have boosted both investment and potential growth.
E27|Keeping track of global trade in real time|This paper builds an innovative composite world trade cycle index (WTI) by means of a dynamic factor model to monitor and perform short-term forecasts in real time of world trade growth of both goods and (usually neglected) services. The selection of trade indicator series is made using a multidimensional approach, including Bayesian model averaging techniques, dynamic correlations and Granger non-causality tests in a linear VAR framework. To overcome real-time forecasting challenges, the dynamic factor model is extended to account for mixed frequencies, to deal with asynchronous data publication and to include hard and survey data along with leading indicators. Nonlinearities are addressed with a Markov switching model. Simulations analysis in pseudo real-time suggests that: i) the global trade index is a useful tool to track and forecast world trade in real time; ii) the model is able to infer global trade cycles precisely and better than the few competing alternatives; and iii) global trade finance conditions seem to lead the trade cycle, in line with the theoretical literature.
E27|The North-South Divide, the Euro and the World|The European north-south divide has been an issue of a long-standing debate. We employ a Global VAR model for 28 developed and developing countries to examine the interaction between the global trade imbalances and their impact within the euro-area framework. The aim is to assess the propagation mechanisms of real shocks, focusing on the interconnections among the north euro area and the south euro area. We incorporate theory-based long-run restrictions and examine the effects of (i) non-export real output shocks, (ii) expansionary shocks and (iii) real exchange rate shocks. The results provide support for symmetric adjustment in the euro area; an expansionary policy of the north euro area and increased competitiveness in the south euro area can alleviate trade imbalances of the debtor euro area economies. From the south euro area perspective, internal devaluation is the most beneficial policy. North euro area and U.S. origin shocks to domestic output exert a dominant influence in the rest of the Europe and Asia while the strong linkage between trade flows within the euro area is confirmed.
E27|Forecasting tax revenues in an emerging economy: The case of Albania|Fiscal balance is one of the main concerns of fiscal policy. Although academic and political choices on budget deficit vary due to perspective differences, improving the quality of revenue and expenditure forecasting has become prominent. The seminal researches on this topic present that tax revenue forecasts suffer from high positive biases. As tax forecasts have chain implications on the expenditures side as well, this might lead to high unexpected deficits. According to the IMF 2016 country report on Albania, emerging market economies are suffering higher than advanced ones in tax revenue forecasting. The aim of this paper is to implement new forecasting models and to apply forecast combinations for Albania, where forecast errors are higher than average. The estimation results show that influence of internal and external factors on tax revenue forecasting create a significant improvement on tax revenue accuracy. The estimations and forecast combinations of this paper perform lower errors than official forecasts, which indicate that revision of tax forecasting methodology can increase the accuracy of predictions for emerging market economies.

E27|Exploring Brexit with dynamic spatial panel models : some possible outcomes for employment across the EU regions|Starting with a reduced form derived from standard urban economics theory, this paper estimates the possible job-shortfall across UK and EU regions using a time-space dynamic panel data model with a Spatial Moving Average Random Effects (SMA-RE) structure of the disturbances. The paper provides a logical rational for the presence of spatial and temporal dependencies involving the endogenous variable, leading to estimates based on a dynamic spatial Generalized Moments (GM) estimator proposed by Baltagi, Fingleton and Pirotte (2018). Given state-of-the art interregional trade estimates, the simulations are based on a linear predictor which utilizes different regional interdependency matrices according to assumptions about interregional trade post-Brexit.
E27|Improving Underlying Scenarios for Aggregate Forecasts: A Multi-level Combination Approach|Abstract In some situations forecasts for a number of sub-aggregations are required for analysis in addition to the aggregate itself. In this context, practitioners typically rely on bottom-up methods to produce a set of consistent forecasts in order to avoid conflicting messages. However, using this approach exclusively can mean that forecasting accuracy is negatively affected when compared to using other methods. This paper presents a method for increasing overall accuracy by jointly combining the forecasts for an aggregate, any sub-aggregations, and the components from any number of models and measurement approaches. The framework seeks to benefit from the strengths of each of the forecasting approaches by accounting for their reliability in the combination process and exploiting the constraints that the aggregation structure imposes on the set of forecasts as a whole. The results from the empirical application suggest that the method is successful in allowing the strengths of the better-performing approaches to contribute to increasing the performance of the rest.
E27|Probability Forecast Using Fan Chart Analysis: A case of the Sierra Leone Economy|This article made use of ARIMAX methodology in producing probability forecast from Fan Chart analysis for the Sierra Leone economy. In view of the estimation technique used to determine best model choice for outputting the Fan Chart, the outcomes have shown the importance of Exchange Rate variable as an exogenous component in influencing Inflation dynamics in Sierra Leone. The use of Brier Score probability was also used to ascertain the accuracy of the forecast methodology. Despite inflation outcome is showing an upward trend for the forecasted periods, the probability bands (upper and lower) have also revealed the peculiarity of the Sierra Leone economy when it comes to addressing policy measures for controlling spiralling inflation dynamics.
E27|Income inequality, consumption, credit and credit risk in a data-driven agent-based model|The issue of income inequality occupies a prominent position in the research agenda of academic and policy circles alike, especially after the crisis of 2008, due to its potential causal link with the development of credit bubbles and therefore the emergence of financial crises. This paper examines the long-run effect of income inequality on consumption, consumer credit and non-performing loans through the means of a data-driven agent-based model. The data-driven nature of the model enhances its ability to match historical series and thus makes it suitable for policy simulations tailored for specific economies. The analysis indicates that higher income inequality has a detrimental impact on consumption and is associated with lower volumes of consumer credit. However, the ratio of non-performing loans as a share of total loans seems to be independent of income inequality.
E27|On Identification Issues in Business Cycle Accounting Models|Since its introduction by Chari et al. (2018), Business Cycle Accounting (BCA) exercises have become widespread. Much attention has been devoted to the results of such exercises and to methodological departures from the baseline methodology. Little attention has been paid to identification issues within these classes of models, despite the methodology typically involving estimating relatively large scale dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models. In this paper we investigate whether such issues are of concern in the original methodology and in an extension proposed by Sustek (2011) called Monetary BCA. We resort to two types of identification tests in population. One concerns strict identification as theorized by Komuner and Ng (2011), while the other deals both with strict and weak identification as in Iskrev (2015). As to the former, when restricting the estimation to the parameters governing the latent variable's laws of motion, we find that both in the BCA and MBCA framework, all parameters fulfill the requirements for strict identification. If instead we estimate all structural parameters of the model jointly, both frameworks show strict identification failures in several parameters. These results hold for both tests. We show that restricting estimation of some deep parameters can obviate such failures. When we explore weak identification issues, we find that they affect both models. They arise from the fact that many of the estimated parameters do not have a distinct effect on the likelihood. Most importantly, we explore the extent to which these weak identification problems affect the main economic takeaways and find that the identification deficiencies are not relevant for the standard BCA model. Finally, we compute some statistics of interest to practitioners of the BCA methodology.
E27|Bank Lending Constraints in the Euro Area|This paper constructs stylized scenarios to assess the lending constraints faced by the banking sectors of euro area Member States arising from a combination of low profitability, adverse bank equity markets and the phase in of new capital requirements. In this connection, it also presents a comprehensive review of the potential sources of increases in minimum bank capital requirements, providing projections for their evolution at Member State level. The combination of the aforementioned factors is seen to carry the potential to significantly constrain bank lending over the period of transition to higher capital ratios which, according to DSGE model simulations, can noticeably impair growth and investment levels in the short run.
E27|Credit card utilization and consumption over the life cycle and business cycle|The revolving credit available to consumers changes substantially over the business cycle, life cycle, and for individuals. We show that debt changes at the same time as credit, so credit utilization is remarkably stable. From ages 20–40, for example, credit card limits grow by more than 700 percent, and yet utilization holds steadily at around 50 percent. We estimate a structural model of life-cycle consumption and credit use in which credit cards can be used for payments, precautionary smoothing, and life-cycle smoothing, uniting their monetary and revolving credit functions. Our estimates predict stable utilization closely matching the individual, life-cycle, and business-cycle relationships between credit and debt. The preference heterogeneity implied by the different uses of credit cards drives our results. The revealed preference that some people with credit cards borrow at high interest, while others do not, suggests that around half the population is living nearly hand to mouth.
E27|What's the Story? A New Perspective on the Value of Economic Forecasts|We apply textual analysis tools to measure the degree of optimism versus pessimism of the text that describes Federal Reserve Board forecasts published in the Greenbook. The resulting measure of Greenbook text sentiment, “Tonality,” is found to be strongly correlated, in the intuitive direction, with the Greenbook point forecast for key economic variables such as unemployment and inflation. We then examine whether Tonality has incremental power for predicting unemployment, GDP growth, and inflation up to four quarters ahead. We find it to have significant and substantive predictive power for both GDP growth and unemployment, particularly since 1991: higher (more optimistic) Tonality presages higher GDP growth and lower unemployment, relative to the Greenbook point forecasts. We then test whether Tonality helps predict monetary policy and stock returns. Higher Tonality has some power to predict tighter than forecasted monetary policy, while it has substantial power fo r predicting higher 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month stock market returns.
E27|Selecting Primal Innovations in DSGE models|"DSGE models are typically estimated assuming the existence of certain primal shocks that drive macroeconomic fluctuations. We analyze the consequences of estimating shocks that are ""non-existent"" and propose a method to select the primal shocks driving macroeconomic uncertainty. Forcing these non-existing shocks in estimation produces a downward bias in the estimated internal persistence of the model. We show how these distortions can be reduced by using priors for standard deviations whose support includes zero. The method allows us to accurately select primal shocks and estimate model parameters with high precision. We revisit the empirical evidence on an industry standard medium-scale DSGE model and find that government and price markup shocks are innovations that do not generate statistically significant dynamics."
E27|Political (In)Stability of Social Security Reform|In this paper we consider an economy populated by overlapping generations, who vote on abolishing the funded system and replacing it with the pay-as-you-go scheme (i.e. unprivatizing the pension system). We compare politically stable and politically unstable reforms and show that even if the funded system is overall welfare enhancing, the cohort distribution of benefits along the transition path turns unprivatizing social security politically favorable.
E27|Working Paper 01-17 - Public Investment in Belgium - Current State and Economic Impact|Belgian government investment, and specifically the part spent on infrastructure, is relatively low both in historical terms and compared to neighbouring countries. A simulation with the European Commission's Quest III model suggests that increasing government investment permanently by 0.5% of GDP leads to a growth in GDP, private consumption and private investment. The impact of alternative financing mechanisms is compared. Finally, a budget neutral shift of investment in favour of infrastructure is found to yield significant benefits in terms of GDP and its main components already in the medium run.
E27|Factor Models for Non-Stationary Series: Estimates of Monthly U.S. GDP|This paper presents a novel dynamic factor model for non-stationary data. We begin by constructing a simple dynamic stochastic general equilibrium growth model and show that we can represent and estimate the model using a simple linear-Gaussian (Kalman) filter. Crucially, consistent estimation does not require differencing the data despite it being cointegrated of order 1. We then apply our approach to a mixed frequency model which we use to estimate monthly U.S. GDP from May 1969 to January 2017 using 171 series with an emphasis on housing related data. We suggest our estimates may, at a quarterly rate, in fact be more accurate than measurement error prone observations. Finally, we use our model to construct pseudo real-time GDP nowcasts over the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis. This last exercise shows that a GDP index, as opposed to real time estimates of GDP itself, may be more helpful in highlighting changes in the state of the macroeconomy.
E27|Unternehmensdemografien in Deutschland – Aktualisierung 2017 mit Sonderauswertung ausgewählter Branchen und Projektionen bis 2020|Die Veränderung der Gesamtzahl an Unternehmen zwischen den vorliegenden Berichtsjahren (2006–2014, nach Wirtschaftsabschnitten) zeigt, dass die Rückgänge im Hinblick auf die Unternehmensanzahl im Handel am höchsten ausfielen, gefolgt vom Verarbeitenden Gewerbe sowie dem Gastgewerbe. Bei der Abweichung nach oben stellt die Energiebranche einen Sonderfall dar: Durch das Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz der Bundesregierung werden Stromeinspeisungen, die aus erneuerbaren Energiequellen stammen, stark gefördert. Die Zahl der Unternehmen hat sich damit in der Branche von 2006 bis 2014 mehr als verdreifacht, wobei überwiegend Ein-Personen-Unternehmen ohne Angestellte gegründet wurden. Daneben steigt die Zahl der Unternehmen vor allem in wirtschaftlichen Dienstleistungssektoren sowie in der Immobilienbranche. Seit 2015 wird die Entwicklung von Unternehmensgründungen und -schließungen sowie die Entwicklung der Gesamtzahl von Unternehmen nach Wirtschaftszweigen von der GWS auf Basis der Daten zur Unternehmensdemografie vom Statistischen Bundesamt analysiert und projiziert. Mit dem Update 2017 wird der historisch verfügbare Zeitraum um ein weiteres Jahr ergänzt und somit auch die Projektion von unternehmensdemografischen Veränderungen bis zum Jahr 2020 erweitert. Zudem erfolgt eine detailliertere Analyse samt eines Erklärungsansatzes für die Entwicklungen in den acht Wirtschaftsabschnitten mit den höchsten unternehmensseitigen Veränderungen – vier Sektoren mit den höchsten Zuwächsen als auch vier Sektoren, in denen sich die Unternehmenszahl am stärksten rückläufig entwickelte.
E27|Fiscal Devaluation and Structural Gaps|The paper characterizes the optimal tax scheme in an open economy with structural inefficiencies on the labor market and on government size. On analytical grounds first, we show that the economy can use fiscal revaluation to exploit the terms of trade externality and to dampen the impact of an excessive public spending. However, if real labor market rigidities are large enough, fiscal devaluation may be desirable. Second, we provide a quantitative assessment of the optimal tax reform using France as the benchmark economy. Our results show that France would benefit more from fiscal devaluation than a economy where the labor market is more flexible, as the US. We also show that the welfare gains from the optimal tax reform crucially depend on the ability of the government to target its optimal size.
E27|Financial Conditions and Monetary Policy in Uruguay: An MS-VAR Approach|"This study analyzes the effects of ""financial stress"" on the Uruguayan macroeconomy in the 1998Q3-2016Q2 period with the underlying idea that financial shocks propagate differently during ""normal times"" than during times of ""stress."" This behavior is captured in a multivariate framework through a Markovswitching vector auto regressive (MS-VAR) model. The evidence found so far supports the idea that financial conditions affect the macroeconomy, as they not only change the private investment long-run average growth rate but also directly modify the behavior of monetary policy."
E27|A daily indicator of economic growth for the euro area| In this paper, we study alternative methods to construct a daily indicator of growth for the euro area. We aim for an indicator that (i) provides reliable predictions, (ii) can be easily updated at the daily frequency, (iii) gives interpretable signals, and (iv) it is linear. Using a large panel of daily and monthly data for the euro area we explore the performance of two classes of models: bridge and U-MIDAS models, and different forecast combination strategies. Forecasts obtained from U-MIDAS models, combined with the inverse MSE weights, best satisfy the required criteria.
E27|Opportunities and limits of rebalancing the Eurozone via wage policies|In this paper we discuss the relationship between the current account rebalancing in the Eu-rozone, income distribution and wage policies with a focus on the main surplus economy, Germany. We will illustrate how and to which extent German wage policies could be able to contribute to a more balanced development of the Eurozone and to overcome the export-led mercantilist German model. Our analysis and our scenarios will be based on stylized econo-metric results for Germany, as they have recently been obtained in the empirical literature estimating the German demand and growth regime based on post-Kaleckian models. We will focus in particular on the relationship between nominal wages and functional income distribu-tion, on the one hand, and between functional income distribution and domestic demand, on the other hand. We show that more expansionary wage policy can contribute to reducing the excessive German current account surplus, mainly through the domestic income-imports channel. However, wage policy alone will be overburdened with the task of rebalancing. For this, in particular more expansionary fiscal policies are required.
E27|IGEM-PA: a Variant of the Italian General Equilibrium Model for Policy Analysis|This paper extends IGEM, the dynamic general equilibrium model for the Italian economy currently in use at the Italian Department of the Treasury for economic policy analysis. In this new variant of the model the public sector is explicitly modelled as suppliers of goods and services. With this tool in hand we are able to present an in-depth analysis of expenditure-based fiscal multipliers and ameliorate our understanding of the potential macroeconomic effects of several policy interventions,such as those aimed at the rationalization of public spending, at the improvement of the business environment and at fostering productivity of the public administration (PA).
E27|The impact of the functional distribution of income on gross domestic product: Colombia, 1970-2011|The aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of the functional distribution of income (wages and profits) on Colombia’s gross domestic product (GDP) for the period between 1970 and 2011. For this purpose, the postkeynesian model of Bhaduri and Marglin (1990) provides the backbone of our theoretical approach, as this model allows analyzing the conditions under which the growth of an economy is guided by workers’ wages or capitalists’ profits. To determine Colombia’s growth regime a vector auto-regression (VAR) model is estimated, as well as simulations of how the GDP reacts to changes in the wage share. The results show that Colombia’s growth regime is led by wages.
E27|Scenarios for potential macroeconomic impact of Brexit on Hungary|The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the economic impact mechanism of the secession of Great Britain from the European Union (Brexit) on the Hungarian economy, and to quantify the domestic growth risks. Several international studies have dealt with this topic using partial analysis and model based simulations, but only partial analyses are available regarding the Hungarian economy. Our analysis provides a broader picture by using the new macroeconomic forecast model of the MNB. Upon determining the exogenous assumptions in our simulations we relied on the central bank experts’ broad knowledge. The applied model handles the wealth heterogeneity in the decision making processes of the households and the corporate sector. This feature makes the model suitable for explaining prolonged after-crisis recovery and the role of the financial accelerator feedback mechanism. In the course of illustrating the economic impact mechanism we show the main channels through which Brexit can spread over to Hungarian economic growth. Besides the primary channels, our analysis includes the secondary channel effects increasingly in the spotlight: we investigate the shock resilience ability of the financial system, and analyze the potential room for manoeuvre for fiscal policy.
E27|A revised approach to trend employment projections in long-term scenarios|The paper describes revisions to the trend employment component of the production function underpinning long-term economic scenarios. Starting with historical age and sex-specific employment rates, a novel approach is developed to correct for cyclical effects using the country-level employment gap while allowing the different sex and age groups to exhibit different sensitivities to the economic cycle. From the resulting cyclically adjusted age/sex-specific employment rates, trend entry and exit rates into/out of employment are computed using the traditional cohort approach. The different employment propensities of existing cohorts are then used to project future employment rates, with entry and exit rates of new cohorts assumed to mimic the most recent ones. To construct scenarios, the model allows a number of policy settings to influence employment rate projections, notably the legal retirement age, tax wedges, family benefits, etc. The sizes of these effects are sourced from recent OECD work on the quantification of structural reforms, and are also specific to sex and age groups. The trend total employment projection is obtained by aggregating age/sex-specific employment rate projections using external demographic projections.
E27|The German Precariat and the Role of Fundamental Security - Is the Unconditional Basic Income a Possible Solution for the Growing Precarity in Germany?|The international business competition fostered new forms of flexible working and atypical employment. The flexibilization process started during the 1970s and continues to change the labor market and the perception of labor to the present day. As a result, a new class, called the precariat, is establishing which can be characterized by insecure employment and living. Precarity resulting from fixed-term, short-term, part-time or temporary employment can concern everyone and has negative consequences on society, economy and health. In parallel to the development of precarity, a possibility of basic security in the form of the Unconditional Basic Income (UBI) is discussed globally. However, the particular situation in Germany, regarding the precariat and the UBI as a possible solution has not been outlined yet. Although, UBI implementation models have been proposed for Germany, there is no analysis in the current literature that would show the effect of the UBI on the German precariat. Applying a modern macroeconomic analysis within the scope of the jobless growth argument, the paper investigates the effect of an UBI on goods demand, economic growth, employment level and consequently, the precariat. The paper shows that an implemented UBI as well as labor-related security increase economic growth and can reduce the German precariat. Politicians and employers should be aware of this positive aspect of the UBI and implement policies to reduce labor-related insecurities in order to decrease the growing precarity.
E27|Joint Forecast Combination of Macroeconomic Aggregates and Their Components|This paper presents a framework that extends forecast combination to include an aggregate and its components in the same process. This is done with the objective of increasing aggregate forecasting accuracy by using relevant disaggregate information and increasing disaggregate forecasting accuracy by providing a binding context for the component’s forecasts. The method relies on acknowledging that underlying a composite index is a well defined structure and its outcome is a fully consistent forecasting scenario. This is particularly relevant for people that are interested in certain components or that have to provide support for a particular aggregate assessment. In an empirical application with GDP data from France, Germany and the United Kingdom we find that the outcome of the combination method shows equal aggregate accuracy to that of equivalent traditional combination methods and a disaggregate accuracy similar or better to that of the best single models.
E27|A Power Booster Factor for Out-of-Sample Tests of Predictability|In this paper we introduce a “power booster factor” for out-of-sample tests of predictability. The relevant econometric environment is one in which the econometrician wants to compare the population Mean Squared Prediction Errors (MSPE) of two models: one big nesting model, and another smaller nested model. Although our factor can be used to improve the power of many out-of-sample tests of predictability, in this paper we focus on boosting the power of the widely used test developed by Clark and West (2006, 2007). Our new test multiplies the Clark and West t-statistic by a factor that should be close to one under the null hypothesis that the short nested model is the true model, but that should be greater than one under the alternative hypothesis that the big nesting model is more adequate. We use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the size and power of our approach. Our simulations reveal that the new test is well sized and powerful. In particular, it tends to be less undersized and more powerful than the test by Clark and West (2006, 2007). Although most of the gains in power are associated to size improvements, we also obtain gains in size-adjusted power. Finally we present an empirical application in which more rejections of the null hypothesis are obtained with our new test.
E27|Malý dynamický faktorový model na krátkodobé prognózovanie slovenského HDP<BR>[A Small Dynamic Factor Model for the Short-Term Forecasting of Slovak GDP]|In this article we estimate a small dynamic factor model (DFM) for the short-term forecasting of Slovak GDP. The model predicts the developments of real activity in the next two quarters on the basis of monthly data, which are published earlier than GDP. The regular release of various monthly indicators allows about a weekly update of the short-term outlook. Our DFM contains six monthly indicators, which are retail sales, sales in industry and construction, employment in selected industries, health care contributions of employers, export and the PMI for the eurozone. These approximate the production, expenditure and income side of GDP. The forecast accuracy of the factor model prevails over simple approaches not relying on monthly data, such as the random walk and the autoregressive models of the GDP series.
E27|Инвестирование Денежных Средств В Условиях Экономического Кризиса В 2017 Году|In the conditions of the economic crisis, one of the most urgent aspects is the investment of funds. The choice of the most optimal directions for investing is rather complicated, since there are many alternative options. The purpose of this study is to determine the most profitable directions for investing money in 2017.
E27|К Вопросу О Долгосрочной Взаимосвязи Реального Потребления Домохозяйств С Реальным Доходом В Рф<BR>[A note on cointegration relationship between real consumption and real income in Russia]|The paper is devoted to testing for existence of a long run relationship between consumption and income in Russia. We couldn’t find cointegration between consumption of households and GDP in constant prices. But statistical tests are in favor of cointegration between consumption in constant prices and real income which we define as a ratio of nominal GDP to implicit deflator for consumption. We also estimated a VECM model for real consumption and real income. Our results show high predictability of consumption growth by the error correction mechanism.
E27|The Programmable Economy: Envisaging an Entire Planned Economic System as a Single Computer through Blockchain Networks|Since the dawn of the concept of nation-states, many nations have been planning their economies to increase people’s prosperity and standard of living. All economies have a centralized feature where decisions are taken. But data collection and plan implementation has been cumbersome because of the manual nature of economic planning. Centralized systems, even when digitized, are prone to single point failures. Controlled Blockchains allow for an economic system to be decentralized, yet having central supervision i.e. quasi-decentralization. This paper deals with shifting a national economy to a network of Blockchains and creating a Programmable Economy (P.E) where the whole economic system behaves like a single computer, taking in certain inputs and providing the desired outputs. We discuss the various factors that are needed to bring about such a transformation. We also analyse the impact this will have on various aspects of the economy and people’s lives. Finally the paper concludes by summarizing the purpose, methodology and impact of a Programmable Economy (P.E).
E27|Evaluación de la capacidad predictiva del índice de percepción del consumidor<BR>[Assessing the predictive power of the consumer perception index]|In this paper the ability of the Economic Perception Index, IPECO, to predict aggregate consumption and other macroeconomic variables is studied. The accuracy of the predictions is improved when IPECO is used as predictor of consumption, in comparison with the predictions of an autoregressive model. The predictive ability of IPECO is higher than the one of its components and, among the components, the most informative are the expectations indexes
E27|Education and labour market: estimating future skill gap in India|Demographic transition creates a small window for countries when the population pyramid shows signs of maturity and bulges in the middle, indicating a relatively larger share of working age population. Key to reaping this demographic dividend lies in using the working age population to fullest potential and enhance production to the maximum possible. However, this can become a nightmare if skill demand and supply in the labour market do not match, keeping large portion of the working age population out of productive engagement while at the same time some productive sectors suffer from labour shortage in key areas. In this paper we look at the issue of estimating skill gap in the Indian labour market starting with the methods currently available globally. It then attempts to project both future labour demand and labour supply by sector and skill group and study the expected surplus/shortages in labour market. Results indicate that methodologies are still in the nascent stage and surplus and shortages are likely to coexist in the labour market. While some specific skills are scarce, others are in surplus, indicating the importance of taking a hard look at the manpower policy, including the education policy. It is crucial to bridge the gap between education, training and employment so that promised demographic dividend can actually materialise.
E27|Macroeconomic uncertainty, growth and inflation in the Eurozone: a causal approach| In this article, we evaluate the causal relationship between macroeconomic uncertainty indices, inflation and growth rate for 17 Eurozone countries on a county-level examination. In performing a series of linear and nonlinear causality tests, we find little evidence of a causal relationship between uncertainty and macroeconomic variables. Thus, macroeconomic analysis based on uncertainty indices should be treated with caution.
E27|Využití metody vícestavové demografie při analýze trhu práce<BR>[Utilization of Multistate Demography Method at the Labour Market Analysis]|This article deals with multistate demography approach applied on the labour market. The multistate demography - methodology and history - are briefly described. The application of this method is presented using transitions between economically active and inactive states on the labour market and among economically inactive, employed and unemployed states. Estimation based on the Labour Force Sample Survey (LFSS) for the Czech Republic shows that during the life course (15-64 years of age) the expected length of stay for each state changes depending on the original state and age. Main differences were found for younger (25-40 years) and older (55+ years) persons.
E27|Impact of uncertainty measures on the Portuguese economy|The purpose of this paper is to review developments in a number of uncertainty measures for Portugal and gauge their impact on macroeconomic developments in recent years, particularly on GDP, private consumption and GFCF. Our analysis shows that elevated uncertainty had a significant negative impact on economic activity during the financial and sovereign debt crises, while the unwindinding of uncertainty associated with the conclusion of the economic and financial assistance programme in 2014 boosted the subsequent recovery.
E27|No such thing as a perfect hammer: comparing different objective function specifications for optimal control|Abstract Linear-quadratic (LQ) optimization is a fairly standard technique in the optimal control framework. LQ is very well researched, and there are many extensions for more sophisticated scenarios like nonlinear models. Conventionally, the quadratic objective function is taken as a prerequisite for calculating derivative-based solutions of optimal control problems. However, it is not clear whether this framework is as universal as it is considered to be. In particular, we address the question whether the objective function specification and the corresponding penalties applied are well suited in case of a large exogenous shock an economy can experience because of, e.g., the European debt crisis. While one can still efficiently minimize quadratic deviations around policy targets, the economy itself has to go through a period of turbulence with economic indicators, such as unemployment, inflation or public debt, changing considerably over time. We test four alternative designs of the objective function: a least median of squares based approach, absolute deviations, cubic and quartic objective functions. The analysis is performed based on a small-scale model of the Austrian economy and illustrates a certain trade-off between quickly finding an optimal solution using the LQ technique (reaching defined policy targets) and accounting for alternative objectives, such as limiting volatility in economic performance. As an implication, we argue in favor of the considerably more flexible optimization technique based on heuristic methods (such as Differential Evolution), which allows one to minimize various loss function specifications, but also takes additional constraints into account.
E27|Real-time forecast evaluation of DSGE models with stochastic volatility|Recent work has analyzed the forecasting performance of standard dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, but little attention has been given to DSGE models that incorporate nonlinearities in exogenous driving processes. Against that background,we explore whether incorporating stochastic volatility improves DSGE forecasts (point, interval, and density). We examine real-time forecast accuracy for key macroeconomic variables including output growth, inflation, and the policy rate. We find that incorporating stochastic volatility in DSGE models of macroeconomic fundamentals markedly improves their density forecasts, just as incorporating stochastic volatility in models of financial asset returns improves their density forecasts.
E27|Weather adjustment of economic output|While recurring and regular variations of weather conditions are implicitly addressed by standard seasonal adjustment procedures of economic time series, extraordinary weather outcomes are not. We propose a way of measuring aggregate abnormal weather conditions based on available local measurements and a straightforward regression-based framework to analyze their impact on German monthly total industrial and construction-sector production data, and find noticeable effects. In the historical - and seasonally adjusted - construction sector growth data the extra explanatory power of the weather regressors over a benchmark univariate autoregressive model even exceeds 50% of the variation. The estimated effects of weather deviations can be subtracted from the already seasonally adjusted data to obtain (seasonally as well as) weather adjusted series, which might capture economic developments better. The estimated adjustments are quantitatively relevant also for aggregate output (GDP).
E27|The impact of the Basel III liquidity coverage ratio on macroeconomic stability: An agent-based approach|Commercial banks across the world have been implementing the Basel III accord, which is the most important international response to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Particularly, the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) introduced by the Basel III accord is the first global standard for banking liquidity management. Does this requirement work? And what macroeconomic effects does it produce? In order to address such crucial issues, the author develops a stock-flow consistent (SFC)/agent-based computational economic (ACE) model. As he knows, there is a real danger that the requirement restricts the availability of bank credit and hence reducing economic activity. However, in comparison to the prior works, the author finds that the externality is presented as a positive self-reinforcing feedback process, which causes the macroeconomic conditions to spiral downwards. This dynamic feedback process that hardly can be revealed by the current macroeconomic models based on equilibrium analyses. The results also shed some light on the fact that credit creation substantially affects economic activity and macroeconomic stability, as the fundamental reason leading to the results. Therefore, the bank as the driver of credit creation is crucial in an economy, and meanwhile bank regulations have great potential impacts on entire economy rather than only in the bank sector itself.
E27|Financial Constraints, Wage Rigidity, and the Labor Market|This paper studies the effects of combining financial frictions with wage rigidity in a search and matching framework. The model is able to match three empirical observations that existing search and matching models struggle to explain jointly: the cyclical component of the unemployment rate is positively skewed, the number of hires tends to increase in recessions, and the correlation between vacancies and unemployment is highly negative.
E27|Evaluating forecasting models for unemployment rates by gender in selected european countries|The unemployment can be considered as one of the main economic problems. The aim of this article is to examine the differences in male and female unemployment rates in selected European countries and to predict their future trends by using different statistical forecasting models. Furthermore, the impact of adding a new data point on the selection of the most appropriate statistical forecasting model and on the overall forecasting errors values is also evaluated. Male and female unemployment rates are observed for twelve European countries in the period from 1991 to 2014. Four statistical forecasting models have been selected and applied and the most appropriate model is considered to be the one with the lowest overall forecasting errors values. The analysis has shown that in the period from 1991 to 2014 the decreasing trend of unemployment rates in the short-run is forecasted for more Eastern Balkan than the EU-28 countries. An additional data point for male and female unemployment rates in 2014 led to somewhat smaller forecasting errors in more than half of the observed countries. However, the additional data point does not necessarily improve forecasting performances of the used statistical forecasting models.
E27|Business cycle phases in Spain|We characterize regional business cycles for Spain using monthly Social Security affiliations. Based on a set of Markov-switching models, we find substantial synchronization of regional business cycles, which has increased since the Great Recession. We do however evidence a regional leading and lagging performance that repeats itself across the different recessions.
E27|Alternative Scenario to the October 2017 MPR Base-Case Projection: Higher Potential Growth|We construct an alternative scenario in which trend labour input and business investment are stronger than that expected in the Bank of Canada’s base-case projection in the October 2017 Monetary Policy Report. We find that while the size and timing of these effects are highly uncertain, the level of potential and real output could be almost 1 per cent higher than expected by the end of 2020. The resulting effect on the output gap and inflation is small and therefore does not affect the stance of monetary policy.
E27|Indicators to monitor and follow construction investment|This paper presents the indicators available to monitor construction investment and forecast its short-term evolution, in the case of the Spanish economy. In addition, it is described a procedure followed to estimate medium-term forecasts for housing investment, mainly based on demographic fundamentals that determine the demand for primary dwellings. The analysis takes into consideration a number of features of the construction sector: long maturity period supply, heterogeneous products, and regional disparity.
E27|Monitoring the Spanish Economy through the Lenses of Structural Bayesian VARs|This paper proposes a suite of Structural Bayesian Vector Autoregression (SBVAR) models used (i) to disentangle the main shocks driving the Spanish economy over time and (ii) to provide short and medium term forecasts of output and infl ation. The suite consists of a benchmark model, that includes output, prices and interest rate, along with four extensions that gather information from the labor, financial, and international markets, and from the fiscal sector. The identification of the structural shocks is achieved by relying on sign and exclusion restrictions. The models provide a narrative of the contribution of fundamental economic shocks that agrees with main historic events of the Spanish economy. Moreover, the proposed SBVAR models are used to provide forecasts of output and inflation conditional on different scenarios about the development of key macroeconomic variables. Therefore, the suite could be incorporated to the toolkit of quantitative models that the Banco de España uses to perform forecasts.
E27|The Propagation Of Industrial Business Cycles|This paper examines the business cycle linkages that propagate industry-specific business cycle shocks throughout the economy in a way that (sometimes) generates aggregated cycles. The transmission of sectoral business cycles is modelled through a multivariate Markov-switching model, which is estimated by Gibbs sampling. Using nonparametric density estimation approaches, we find that the number and location of modes in the distribution of industrial dissimilarities change over the business cycle. There is a relatively stable trimodal pattern during expansionary and recessionary phases characterized by highly, moderately and lowly synchronized industries. However, during phase changes, the density mass spreads from moderately synchronized industries to lowly synchronized industries. This agrees with a sequential transmission of the industrial business cycle dynamics.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
E27|Using the payment system data to forecast the Italian GDP|Payment systems track economic transactions and therefore could be considered important indicators of economic activity. This paper describes the available monthly data on the retail settlement system for Italy and selects some of them for short-term forecasting. Using a mixed frequency factor model to predict Italian GDP, we find that payment system flows stand out when compared to other standard business cycle indicators.
E27|Clustering and forecasting inflation expectations using the World Economic Survey: the case of the 2014 oil price shock on inflation targeting countries|This paper examines inflation expectations of the World Economic Survey for ten inflation targeting countries. First, by a Self Organizing Maps methodology, we cluster the trajectory of agents inflation expectations using the beginning of the oil price shock occurred in June of 2014 as a benchmark in order to discriminate between those countries that anticipated the shock smoothly and those with brisk changes in expectations. Then, the expectations are modeled by artificial neural networks forecasting models. Second, for each country we investigate the information content of the quantitative survey forecast by comparing it to the average annual inflation based on national consumer price indices. The results indicate the presence of heterogeneity among countries to anticipate inflation under the oil shock and, also different patterns of accuracy to predict average annual inflation were found depending on the observed inflation trend.

E27|The economic cost of capital: a VECM approach for estimating and testing the banking sector's response to changes in capital ratios|The Basel III/CRD IV reforms to the banking system following the financial crisis of 2008–09 required banks to raise significantly both the quality and quantity of capital on their balance sheets. This econometric study provides evidence of both the long and short-term implications for ongoing activity in the UK economy of a change in the aggregate proportion of bank capital funding. We find that, in response to changes in their capital funding, banks change credit spreads applied to private non-financial corporate borrowers to a greater extent than for household borrowers in the short term, but equalise these changes in the longer term. The short-term impact reflects banks’ desire to adjust their capital ratios through changes to the value of their risk-weighted assets by restricting the flow of lending to higher-risk sectors to a greater extent than to lower-risk sectors. We also find that after recent regulatory reforms banks may have modified their price-setting behaviour somewhat. We develop a vector error correction model of these effects with an innovative non-standard estimation of the short-term coefficients. Using this approach, we are able to: (i) test hypotheses about the short-term and long-term responses to changes in the aggregate mix of bank capital funding; (ii) test hypotheses about the responses of the non-financial corporate and household sectors; and (iii) enhance the accuracy of the short-term dynamics and the accuracy of the macroeconomic simulations of the effect of increasing bank capital.
E27|A time varying parameter structural model of the UK economy|e estimate a time varying parameter structural macroeconomic model of the UK economy, using a Bayesian local likelihood methodology. This enables us to estimate a large open-economy DSGE model over a sample that comprises several different regimes and an incomplete set of data. Our estimation identifies a gradual shift to a monetary policy regime characterised by a marked increase in the responsiveness of monetary policy to inflation alongside a decrease in the level of trend inflation down to the 2% target level. The time varying model also performs remarkably well in forecasting and delivers statistically significant accuracy improvements for most variables and horizons in both point and density forecast performance compared to the standard fixed parameter version.
E27|Should one follow movements in the oil price or in money supply? Forecasting quarterly GDP growth in Russia with higher-frequency indicators|GDP forecasters face tough choices over which leading indicators to follow and which forecasting models to use. To help resolve these issues, we examine a range of monthly indicators to forecast quarterly GDP growth in a major emerging economy, Russia. Numerous useful indicators are identified and forecast pooling of three model classes (bridge models, MIDAS models and unrestricted mixed-frequency models) are shown to outperform simple benchmark models. We further separately examine forecast accuracy of each of the three model classes. Our results show that differences in performance of model classes are generally small, but for the period covering the Great Recession unrestricted mixed-frequency models and MIDAS models clearly outperform bridge models. Notably, the sets of top-performing indicators differ for our two subsample observation periods (2008Q1–2011Q4 and 2012Q1–2016Q4). The best indicators in the first period are traditional real-sector variables, while those in the second period consist largely of monetary, banking sector and financial market variables. This finding supports the notion that highly volatile periods of recession and subsequent recovery are driven by forces other than those that prevail in more normal times. The results further suggest that the driving forces of the Russian economy have changed since the global financial crisis.
E27|Consumo de los hogares en Colombia: ¿teoría del ingreso disponible o ingreso permanente? Análisis para el periodo 2000-2016|Este documento realiza un análisis descriptivo de los principales determinantes del consumo en Colombia. Asimismo, establece cuál de las dos teorías del consumo: ingreso disponible o ingreso permanente, se ajusta mejor a los datos durante el periodo 2000Q1-2016Q2. Para tal fin, primero se presenta una revisión de literatura sobre los principales determinantes del consumo en Colombia. Luego, partiendo de dos modelos teóricos bien definidos, se realiza el análisis y las pruebas econométricas para el caso colombiano. Por último, se encuentra que los principales determinantes del consumo de los hogares son: la riqueza, las restricciones de liquidez, tasa de desempleo y los términos de intercambio; igualmente, se obtiene que la teoría de ingreso permanente se ajusta mejor a los datos.
E27|Value Added in Motion: Modelling World Trade Patterns at the 2035 Horizon|We address in this paper the future geography of production, migration and energy at the world level, and the consequences for the largest European countries. We take scant account of the wide range of possible evolutions of the world economy in terms of technological progress and diffusion, education, demography including migrations and finally energy price and efficiency. Taking a 2035 horizon, we examine how world trade patterns will be shaped by the changing comparative advantages, demand, and capabilities of different regions, and what will be the implications in terms of location of value added at the sector and country level. We combine a convergence model fitting three production factors (capital, labour and energy) and two factor-specific productivities, alongside a dynamic CGE model of the world economy calibrated to reproduce observed elasticity of trade to income. Each scenario involves three steps. First, we project growth at country level based on factor accumulation, demography and migration, educational attainment and efficiency gains, and discuss uncertainties related to our main drivers. Second, we impose this framework on the CGE baseline. Third, we implement trade policy scenarios (tariffs as well as non-tariff measures in goods and services), in order to get factor allocation across sectors from the model as well as demand and trade patterns.
E27|Value Added in Motion: Macroeconomic Implications of Energy Price Trajectories|Taking a 2035 horizon, we examine how world energy consumption and emission patterns will be shaped by the changing demand and technological capabilities of different regions. We combine a convergence model fitting three production factors (capital, labour and energy) and two factor-specific productivities, along with a dynamic CGE model of the world economy. We consider three possible â€œworldsâ€ with very different energy scarcity, and how Copenhagen pledges change economic agentsâ€™ calculus in each of these three situations. We find that the most dramatic changes in terms of location of value added are to be expected from the intrinsic differences among the three considered â€œworldsâ€ , not so much in terms of economic impact of environmental pledges.
E27|Revision of the small macro-econometric model of the Nigerian economy|The first operational small-scale macro-econometric model of the Nigerian Economy was developed in 2013. Ever since, the country had witnessed significant changes owing to oil price shock which culminated into internal and external imbalances. To address these challenges among others, informed the revision of the model. Thus, in the revised model, provisions are made for unemployment and the role of expectations and uncertainty surrounding the oil and foreign exchange markets. By simulating three alternative policy scenarios using oil price, monetary policy rate and cash reserve ratio, some striking results are obtained with implications for monetary policy in Nigeria.
E27|How Rising Income Inequality Influenced Economic Growth in Germany|The cumulative growth rate of the German economy since reunification would have been around two percentage points higher if income inequality had remained constant. This is whatsimulations using the DIW Macroeconomic Model have shown. They were made under the assumption that the income distribution dynamics would not be influenced by any feedback effects of economic growth. In 2015, Germany’s real GDP should have been 40 billion euros higher than it actually was. Private consumer demand, investment, and exports would all have risen faster if inequality - here measured by the Gini index of net household income - had remained at its 1991 level. At the same time, the trade surplus would not have grown asquickly. In fact, it curbed the effect of income inequality on GDP. The finding is not only relevant given the debate over imbalances in the euro area. It also clearly indicates that the discussion about the macroeconomic consequences of rising income inequality has excessively focused on its negative effects on GDP. Private consumption, infinitely more important to the German population’s quality of life, will decline more sharply in the long run.
E27|Wie steigende Einkommensungleichheit das Wirtschaftswachstum in Deutschland beeinflusst|Das Wachstum der deutschen Wirtschaft wäre seit der Wiedervereinigung kumuliert um rund zwei Prozentpunkte höher gewesen, wenn die Einkommensungleichheit konstant geblieben wäre. Darauf weisen Simulationsrechnungen mit dem DIW Makromodell hin, die unter der Annahme durchgeführt wurden, dass die Entwicklung der Einkommensverteilung nicht umgekehrt von der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung beeinflusst wurde. Das reale Bruttoinlandsprodukt hätte im Jahr 2015 gut 40 Milliarden Euro über seinem tatsächlichen Wert gelegen. Vor allem die private Konsumnachfrage, aber auch Investitionen und Exporte, wären stärker gestiegen, wenn die Ungleichheit – hier gemessen am Gini-Koeffizienten der Nettohaushaltseinkommen – auf ihrem Stand des Jahres 1991 geblieben wäre. Gleichzeitig hätte der Außenhandelssaldo nicht so stark zugenommen; er hat den Effekt der Ungleichheit auf das Bruttoinlandsprodukt abgemildert. Dieser Befund ist nicht nur vor dem Hintergrund der Debatte um Ungleichgewichte in der Europäischen Währungsunion relevant. Er macht auch deutlich, dass der Fokus der Diskussion über die makroökonomischen Folgen zunehmender Einkommensungleichheit zu Unrecht auf den negativen Auswirkungen auf das Bruttoinlandsprodukt liegt, denn der für die Lebensqualität der Menschen ungleich wichtigere private Konsum wird noch stärker und dauerhafter gemindert.
E27|Using debit card payments data for nowcasting Dutch household consumption|In this paper we analyse whether the use of debit card payments data improves the accuracy of one-quarter ahead forecasts and nowcasts (current-quarter forecasts) of Dutch private household consumption. Since debit card payments data are timely available, they may be a valuable indicator of economic activity. We study a variety of models with payments data and find that a combination of models provides the most accurate nowcast. The best combined model reduces the root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE) by 18% relative to the macroeconomic policy model (DELFI) that is used by the Dutch central bank (DNB). Based on these results for the Netherlands, we conclude that debit card payments data are useful in modelling household consumption.
E27|GHG mitigation schemes and energy policies: A model-based assessment for the Italian economy|We build up a large scale dynamic general equilibrium model embodying a cap on pollutant emissions, an electricity sector and fuel consumption to analyse climate-energy policies for the Italian economy. Our results show how the trade-off between environmental quality and economic activity can be effectively overcome by recycling the revenues from the sales of emission permits in labour tax reductions. A tax combination aimed at reducing the consumption of fossil fuel, while simultaneously decreasing taxes on labour, is expansionary, but the final outcome is influenced by the underlying GHG emission policy. Tax incentives encouraging the use of clean energy sources, by discouraging the use of fossil fuel, produce a sizeable reallocation of emissions across sectors and are found to be expansionary. Overall the paper highlights the non-trivial interactions between the different fiscal tools in hand to meet the legally binding commitment on emission reduction, while limiting the potential negative fallout on the economy.
E27|Rationality and seasonality: Evidence from inflation forecasts|We examine the seasonal pattern in expectations, using a unique Israeli survey of quarterly inflation forecasts. Rationality is rejected with respect to (trivial) information about calendar quarter. Seasonal bias is strongest at shorter horizons and in a low inflation environment.
E27|On the rationality and efficiency of inflation forecasts: Evidence from advanced and emerging market economies|This paper provides a full characterization of inflation rate forecasts using the mean values from Consensus Economics for a sample of 78 advanced and emerging economies between 1989 and 2014. It also assesses the performance of inflation rate forecasts around business cycles’ turning points. As expected, that inflation forecasts start to mirror the actual data as the forecast horizon draws to a close, particularly in advanced economies. The mean forecast error is positive and larger than one point when we pool all countries, but this masks inter-group differences. Moreover, we find evidence for biasedness, inefficiency or information rigidities, with a clear tendency for “forecast smoothing”. Accounting for cross-country informational linkages is important: forecasters fail to adjust their inflation forecasts quick enough in response to domestic news and news from abroad. Finally, during recession episodes forecasts generally appear to be inefficient. The same holds true for recoveries.
E27|Testing The Predictability Of Consumption Growth: Evidence From China|Using time series macroeconomic data, Chow (1985, 2010, 2011) reported indirect empirical evidence that implies the validity of the permanent income hypothesis in China. We revisit this issue by evaluating direct measures of the predictability of consumption growth in China during the post-economic reform regime (1978-2009). We also implement and report similar analysis for the postwar U.S. data for comparison. Our in-sample analysis provides strong evidence against the PIH for both countries. Out-of-sample forecast exercises show that consumption changes are highly predictable, which sharply contrasts the implications of empirical findings by Chow (1985, 2010, 2011).
E27|Demographic Transition and the Unobservable Scale Effects of Economic Growth|Idea-based growth models usually predict that economic growth rates are increasing with the level or growth rate of the population. This scale effect prediction is intuitive and derived directly from the nonrivalry of ideas. However, time-series data over the last century generally did not support this scale effect prediction. This article illustrates why scale effects were unobservable. A modified idea-based model shows that economic growth rates increase with investments in human capital accumulation and population growth rates. The offsetting movements of these two factors during the demographic transition of the last century obscured the scale effects.
E27|Population Growth, Human Capital Accumulation, and the Long-Run Dynamics of Economic Growth|This article adopts a modified idea-based growth model with endogenous human capital and population to explain why the theoretically relevant growth effect of population growth on economic growth is empirically unobservable. The model predicts that the economic growth rate is proportional to the growth rates of both population and human capital. The offsetting movement of the growth rates of population and human capital after the demographic transition obscures observation of the growth effect. The model also generates an evolution of the growth rates of population, human capital, and per capita income that is consistent with historical and postwar data.
E27|Forecasting travelers in Spain with Google queries|We examine whether web search queries help economic agents with predictions about the checking in and overnight stays of travelers in Spain in real time. We show that the models including queries outperform models that exclude these leading indicators. In this way, we aim to contribute to the literature on the link between the Internet and the tourism market.
E27|Blockchain in financial services: Regulatory landscape and future challenges|Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), including blockchains, are increasingly getting a massive interest from established industries. The interest is especially strong among financial services firms, which are starting to see DLTs as a potential driver of huge savings in infrastructure and back-office processes.
E27|Implementing Cross-Border Interbank Lending in BoC-GEM-FIN|BIS interbank lending data show that the Great Recession generated large and persistent changes in the international interbank lending positions of various countries. The main objective of this study is to understand the role of changes in international interbank credit flows in transmitting shocks across borders. To accomplish this, we needed a global structural model with an international interbank market. Our search for a suitable structural model revealed that the Bank of Canadas version of the Global Economy Model (BoC-GEM-FIN) comes closest to our needs. BoC-GEM-FIN includes region-specific interbank markets, as well as some international borrowing and lending, but abstracts from international interbank lending. This paper describes the modifications we made in order to introduce the international interbank market into BoC-GEM-FIN. The modified model is calibrated to match the changes in international interbank lending positions and the decline in the US banksbusiness lending that took place after the fourth quarter of 2008. Our simulations show that the international interbank market amplifies the spillover effects of demand shocks but does not systematically alter the effects of supply shocks, including those for commodities.
E27|Extending the Labour Market Indicator to the Canadian Provinces|Calculating the labour market indicator (LMI) at the provincial level provides useful insights into Canada’s regional economies and reveals differing trends in the state of underlying labour market conditions across provinces. Conclusions based on the Canadian LMI do not necessarily translate to the provinces. In most cases, the correlations between the provincial LMIs and the underlying labour market variables have the expected sign. Differences among provinces reflect idiosyncratic differences among provincial labour markets. The values of the provincial LMIs are not invariant to the sample period used when constructing them. We find that using a longer sample estimation period improves the properties of some of the provincial LMIs. Recent values for the LMI show that labour markets have deteriorated notably in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador. At the same time, the LMIs for British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick have improved over the course of the past year and the gap between the unemployment rate and the LMI has tended to narrow.
E27|The Complex Adjustment of the Canadian Economy to Lower Commodity Prices|In this analytical note, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the complex structural adjustment facing the Canadian economy following the commodity price decline since mid-2014. We quantify separately the impacts coming from the commodity sector restructuring and the broader effect of significantly lower terms of trade. Based on our analysis, the impact on the Canadian economy will occur in three phases. By the end of phase 3, in 2020, the level of Canadian GDP will be 2 per cent lower due to the commodity price decline than it otherwise would have been had commodity prices stayed at the mid-2014 level. At this point, the commodity sector is expected to play a smaller role in the Canadian economy.
E27|The Case of Serial Disappointment|Similar to those of other forecasters, the Bank of Canada’s forecasts of global GDP growth have shown persistent negative errors over the past five years. This is in contrast to the pre-crisis period, when errors were consistently positive as global GDP surprised to the upside. All major regions have contributed to the forecast errors observed since 2011, although the United States has been the most persistent source of notable errors. In turn, the Bank of Canada’s gauge of foreign demand for Canadian exports—the foreign activity measure—has been continuously revised down. Average forecast errors for Canadian GDP growth are also negative over this period, particularly at the one-year-ahead horizon. The most important contributors to this unexpected weakness are exports and business fixed investment, the effects of which were only partly offset by positive surprises on housing. We find that the one-year-ahead export errors can be linked in part to the unanticipated weakness in US growth. Canadian competitiveness may also have been weaker than assumed. The errors on business investment correlate with measures of firm sentiment and uncertainty, as well as with deviations in oil prices from the view in the Bank’s baseline forecast. The possibility that a period of negative surprises in foreign and domestic output growth could continue over the coming years raises important questions for future study by central banks and policy-makers.
E27|Crude Oil Prices and Fixed-Asset Cash Spending in the Oil and Gas Industry: Findings from VAR Models|This note investigates the relationship between crude oil prices and investment in the energy sector. We employ a set of vector autoregression (VAR) models (unconstrained VAR, vector error-correction and Bayesian VAR) to formalize the relationship between the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) benchmark and fixed-asset cash spending in the oil and gas extraction and support activities sector of the Canadian economy. Using data from Statistics Canada’s Quarterly Financial Statistics for the period 1999Q2–2015Q4, we report that, for example, an average WTI of $50 in 2016 would yield a 27.1 to 31.4 per cent (year over year) decline in fixed-asset cash spending in the sector relative to 2015.
E27|The evolution of bad debts in Italy during the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis: a counterfactual analysis|This paper presents the results of a counterfactual exercise that aims at quantifying the contribution to the evolution of bad debts made by the two recessions that have hit the Italian economy since 2008. The counterfactual simulations are performed using the Bank of Italy’s Quarterly Model (BIQM). A ‘no-crises scenario’ is built for the period 2008-2015. The counterfactual dynamics of the main macroeconomic and financial variables are used to feed a simple model, in which the new bad debt rate depends on macroeconomic conditions and borrowing costs. The analysis suggests that, in the absence of the two recessions – and of the economic policy decisions that were taken to combat their effects – non-financial corporations’ bad debts at the end of 2015 would have reached €52 billion, instead of €143 billion. The ratio of bad debts to the total amount of loans to non-financial corporations would have reached 5%, a value in line with the pre-crisis period.
E27|Global value chains: new evidence and implications|The workshop entitled 'Global Value Chains: new evidence and implications' was held in Rome on the 22nd of June 2015. The workshop presented the results of a research project carried out by a group of economists from the Bank's Directorate General for Economics, Statistics and Research. The first session focuses on the structure of global value chains and how they function in the euro area economies. The second and third sessions examine the implications of global value chains on competitiveness and economic performance, respectively. The last session concentrates on specific countries, regions and firms.
E27|Nowcasting of the Russian GDP Using the Current Statistics: Approach Modification|This work presents a modification of the model of GDP short-term estimation based on current macroeconomic statistics initially offered in the paper titled 'Nowcasting and Short-Term Forecasting of Russian GDP with a Dynamic Factor Model' by Alexey Porshakov and co-authors [8]. The model modification presented in this work considers factors separately for each of the three groups of indicators - agents' expectations and their estimate of the current economic situation; financial variables, world market and foreign economic activity indicators; real sector indicators. This model can be used to get GDP estimates for the previous and current quarters, which allows researchers to obtain information on output dynamics in the economy in addition to estimates under other models and expert judgments. Also, the model helps decompose GDP quarterly growth rates into various factors.
E27|Approximating time varying structural models with time invariant structures|The paper studies how parameter variation affects the decision rules of a DSGE model and structural inference. We provide diagnostics to detect parameter variations and to ascertain whether they are exogenous or endogenous. Identification and inferential distortions when a constant parameter model is incorrectly assumed are examined. Likelihood and VAR-based estimates of the structural dynamics when parameter variations are neglected are compared. Time variations in the financial frictions of Gertler and Karadi's (2010) model are studied.
E27|A New Index of Uncertainty Based on Internet Searches: A Friend or Foe of Other Indicators?|"The preliminary evidence in the literature suggests that changes in uncertainty have a role in shaping the U.S. economic cycle. But what is effectively measured by the different available indicators of uncertainty still remains an ""uncertain"" issue. This paper has two aims: (i) to introduce a new uncertainty indicator (GT) based on Internet searches; and (ii) to compare the main features and the macroeconomic effects of alternative measures of uncertainty, including our own. Results suggest that GT shocks embody timely information about people's perception of uncertainty and, in some cases, earlier than other indexes. Furthermore, the effect of uncertainty shocks on output is more influenced by parameter breaks due to insample events than by model specification. The consequence is that an all-comprehensive indicator able to weight different sources of uncertainty is preferable."

E27|CICE et Pacte de responsabilité : une évaluation selon la position dans le cycle. Simulations ex ante a partir d’un modele macroeconomique|To deal with mass unemployment the French government has chosen to favour a supply-side policy. Using the OFCE?s macroeconomic model for the French economy e-mod.fr , we evaluate the effects of the ?CICE? and the ?Pacte de responsabilit? on economic activity and employment, taking into account the business cycle, and we study the sensitivity of results to the value of the elasticity of substitution between capital and labour. Excluding the impact of financing, these policies would create or save 530,000 jobs by 2018 and would have a positive effect on economic activity (+ 1.2 point of GDP). Including the effects of financing, there would be no gain on GDP and jobs created or saved would amount to about 290 000, ranging from 190 000 to 420 000 according to the business cycle and the capital / labour elasticity of substitution.

E27|The Macro-Economic Impact of Brexit: Using the CBR Macro-Economic Model of the UK Economy (UKMOD)|This working paper uses the new CBR macro-economic model of the UK economy to investigate possible futures following the referendum decision to leave the EU. The paper briefly explains why we felt the necessity to build a new model and describes some of its key features. Since Brexit is a unique event with no precedent it is not possible to do a normal forecast in which a few assumptions are made about a limited range of exogenous variables. The best that can be done is to construct scenarios and two are presented here. The difficult part is to decide what scale of adjustment is needed to reflect the likely realities of Brexit. Analysis by HM Treasury of the potential impact of various outcomes for trade outside the EU is examined and found wanting. Instead the actual experience of UK export performance is examined for a long period including both pre- and post- accession years. This suggests a more limited impact of EU membership. While we include a scenario based on Treasury assumptions, a more realistic, although in our view still pessimistic, scenario assumes half of the trade loss of the Treasury. The results are presented through comparing these scenarios with a pre-referendum forecast. In the milder Brexit scenario there is a two per cent loss of GDP by 2025 but little loss of per capita GDP, less unemployment but more inflation. In the more severe, Treasury-based scenario the loss of GDP is nearer five per cent (two per cent for per capita GDP), inflation is higher and the advantage in unemployment less.
E27|One Pillar Crumbling, the Others Too Short: Old-Age Provision in Germany|Responding to the challenges of demographic ageing, the German system of old-age provision has undergone substantial changes during the past two decades and is in fact still under reconstruction. Benefit levels deriving from the public pay-as-you-go scheme will decline until 2060, while contribution rates may still go up substantially. Additional cover from private or occupational pension schemes is urgently needed. Thus far, steps in this direction have been half-hearted. The continuing crisis in financial markets and a more profound distrust in financial institutions and market-based instruments of old-age provision currently create obstacles to progress with this overhaul. Nevertheless, despite the differing traditions, Germany could learn important lessons now from other developed countries that have longer experience of funded pensions.
E27|Forecastability and statistical characteristics of aggregate oil and gas investments on the Norwegian Continental Shelf b|We investigate the potential for statistical forecasting of aggregate oil and gas investment on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). A unique and detailed dataset containing data from 109 different fields on the NCS between 1970 and 2015 was employed. A set of 1080 autoregressive distributed lag models are evaluated pseudo out-of-sample and tested for data mining by utilizing a Diebold-Mariano hypothesis test and the model confidence set procedure by Hansen and Lunde (2011). The main results are as follows. First, we find that it is indeed possible but challenging to outperform the parsimonious random walk benchmark in an out-of-sample environment. Second, lags of investment growth, crude oil price growth and realized volatility is found to be adequate predictors for the investment growth. Finally, there is a clear benefit from re-estimating the models coefficient at every step.
E27|A self-organizing map analysis of survey-based agents? expectations before impending shocks for model selection: The case of the 2008 financial crisis|This paper examines the role of clustering techniques to assist in the selection of the most indicated method to model survey-based expectations. First, relying on a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) analysis and using the financial crisis of 2008 as a benchmark, we distinguish between countries that show a progressive anticipation of the crisis, and countries where sudden changes in expectations occur. We then generate predictions of survey indicators, which are usually used as explanatory variables in econometric models. We compare the forecasting performance of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to that of three different time series models. By combining both types of analysis, we find that ANN models outperform time series models in countries in which the evolution of expectations shows brisk changes before impending shocks. Conversely, in countries where expectations follow a smooth transition towards recession, autoregressive integrated moving-average (ARIMA) models outperform neural networks.
E27|Forecasting U.S. Recessions and Economic Activity|This paper proposes a framework to produce real time multi-horizon forecasts of business cycle turning points, average forecasts of economic activity as well as conditional forecasts that depend on whether the horizon of interest belongs to a recession episode or not. Our forecasting models take the form of an autoregression of order one that is augmented with either a probability of recession or an inverse Mills ratio. Our empirical results suggest that a static Probit model that uses only the Term Spread as regressor provides comparable fit to the data as more sophisticated non-static Probit models. We also find that the dynamic patterns of the Term Structure of recession probabilities are quite informative about business cycle turning points. Our most parsimonious augmented autoregressive model delivers better out-of-sample forecasts of GDP growth than the benchmark models considered. We construct several Term Structures of recession probabilities since the last official NBER turning point. The results suggest that there has been no harbinger of a recession for the US economy since 2010Q4 and that there is none to fear at least until 2018Q1. GDP growth is expected to rise steadily between 2016Q3 and 2018Q1 in the range [2.5%,3.5%].
E27|Impacto de la distribución funcional del ingreso sobre el producto interno bruto de Colombia, 1970-2011|Resumen: El objetivo de este artículo es analizar el impacto de la distribución funcional del ingreso (salarios y beneficios) sobre el producto interno bruto (PIB) de Colombia durante el período comprendido entre 1970 y 2011. Para tal fin, se adopta como marco teórico de referencia el modelo poskeynesiano de Bhaduri y Marglin (1990), el cual permite determinar si el crecimiento de una economía es guiado por los salarios de los trabajadores o por los beneficios de los capitalistas. Para establecer el régimen de crecimiento de la economía colombiana se elaboran dos análisis: la estimación de un modelo de vectores auto-regresivos (VAR) y un estudio de pronósticos de cambios en la participación de salarial sobre el PIB. Los resultados muestran que los salarios orientan el crecimiento económico de Colombia durante el período de estudio
E27|Respuesta del producto a perturbaciones de oferta y demanda en Colombia: 1981-2015|Este documento tiene como objetivo estimar la respuesta del producto real en Colombia a perturbaciones de oferta y demanda durante el periodo 1981Q1-2015Q3. Para tal fin, a partir de un modelo SVAR con restricciones de largo plazo, se realizan pruebas de causalidad de Granger, análisis de impulso respuesta, descomposición de varianza y descomposición histórica. Por último, se realizan estimaciones del producto potencial, brecha del producto y se prueba la hipótesis del cumplimiento de la ley de Okun para Colombia en el periodo considerado.
E27|Hipótesis de ingreso permanente y consumo en Colombia 1952-2014|El presente trabajo pone a prueba la Hipótesis de Ingreso Permanente (HIP) y examina los principales determinantes del Consumo Privado Real para Colombia en el Periodo 1952-2014. Para esto, se utiliza una metodología de series de tiempo y, se estima la relación entre el Consumo Privado Real como proporción del Ingreso Nacional Disponible con un conjunto de variables que recogen los efectos permanentes y transitorios del ingreso. De manera complementaria, se estima un modelo en el que el logaritmo del Consumo Privado Real está en función de los componentes permanente (tendencial) y transitorio (cíclico) del ingreso, obtenidos por medio del filtro Hodrick y Prescott al Ingreso Nacional Disponible. Los resultados de las estimaciones sugieren que en Colombia: i) el Consumo Privado Real es una función de sus valores inmediatamente anteriores, lo cual valida la Hipótesis de Expectativas Adaptativas de Hall en la que el consumo se comporta como un paseo aleatorio y, ii) se cumple la HIP, no obstante, los ingresos transitorios también ejercen influencia sobre el consumo.
E27|Nowcasting Mexico’s Short-Term GDP Growth in Real-Time: A Factor Model versus Professional Forecasters|We introduce a novel real-time database for the Mexican economy and propose a small-scale mixed-frequency dynamic factor model for nowcasting Mexico’s short-term GDP growth in real-time. We compare our factor-based backcasts, nowcasts, and forecasts with those of the consensus of the survey of professional forecasters during the period from the second quarter of 2008 through the second quarter of 2014. Our results suggest that our factor-based backcasts, nowcasts, and forecasts outperform those of the consensus of professional forecast- ers in real-time comparisons despite some structural instability during the 2008–09 crisis and its aftermath in 2010.
E27|Modelling the Impacts of a Cut to Company Tax in Australia|We investigate the impact of a cut to the company tax rate using a miniature version of the Vic-Uni computable general equilibrium model of the Australian economy with additional detail on ownership of physical capital. Because of Australia's system of dividend imputation, a change to the company tax rate only affects the final post-tax rate of return for foreign investors. Therefore a cut to the company tax rate would transfer government revenue to foreigners, and add to pressure on government to reduce spending or to raise personal taxes. We concur with the Treasury's finding that a cut to the company tax rate would attract more foreign investment to Australia, making workers more productive and increasing wages and output. However, there is a lag between new investment activity and capital growth, and a large share of future company profits will accrue to foreign investors. We also find that increased wages will reduce returns to domestically owned capital. While the impact on national production, as measured by GDP, will be positive, this is not a suitable measure of national benefit. The right indicator of national benefit is the impact of a company tax rate cut on national income and we find that this will fall.
E27|Internet searches and transactions on the housing market|We use Google searches of the word â€œmortgageâ€ to explain housing transactions in the Netherlands in the period from 2004 until 2015. Our estimates indicate that Google searches of the previous months are significantly positively associated with housing transactions in the current month. This provides evidence that internet search data can provide information about real market behaviour.
E27|“Modelling and forecasting mortgage delinquency and foreclosure in the UK.”|In the absence of micro-data in the public domain, new aggregate models for the UK's mortgage repossessions and arrears are estimated using quarterly data over 1983–2014, motivated by a conceptual double trigger frame framework for foreclosures and payment delinquencies. An innovation to improve on the flawed but widespread use of loan-to-value measures, is to estimate difficult-to-observe variations in loan quality and access to refinancing, and shifts in lenders’ forbearance policy, by common latent variables in a system of equations for arrears and repossessions. We introduce, for the first time in the literature, a theory-justified estimate of the proportion of mortgages in negative equity as a key driver of aggregate repossessions and arrears. This is based on an average debt–equity ratio, corrected for regional deviations, and uses a functional form for the distribution of the debt–equity ratio checked on Irish micro-data from the Bank of Ireland, and Bank of England snapshots of negative equity. We systematically address serious measurement bias in the ‘months-in-arrears’ measures, neglected in previous UK studies. Highly significant effects on aggregate rates of repossessions and arrears are found for the aggregate debt–service ratio, the proportion of mortgages in negative equity and the unemployment rate. Economic forecast scenarios to 2020 highlight risks faced by the UK and its mortgage lenders, illustrating the usefulness of the approach for bank stress-testing. For macroeconomics, our model traces an important part of the financial accelerator: the feedback from the housing market to bad loans and hence banks’ ability to extend credit.
E27|Forecasting U.S. Recessions and Economic Activity|This paper proposes a framework to produce multi-horizon forecasts of business cycle turning points, average forecasts of economic activity as well as conditional forecasts that depend on whether the horizon of interest belongs to a recession episode or not. Our forecasting models take the form of an autoregression (AR) of order one that is augmented with either a probability of recession or an inverse Mills ratio. Our empirical results suggest that a static Probit model that uses only the TS as regressor provides comparable fit to the data as more sophisticated non-static Probit models. We also find that the dynamic patterns of the term structure of recession probabilities are quite informative about business cycle turning points. Our most parsimonious AAR model delivers better out-of-sample forecasts of GDP growth than the benchmark models considered. We construct term structures of recession probabilities since the last oficial NBER turning point. The results suggest that there has been no harbinger of a recession for the US economy since 2010Q4 and that there is none to fear at least until 2018Q1. GDP growth is expected to rise steadily between 2016Q3 and 2018Q1 in the range [2.5%,3.5%].
E27|Is the Intrinsic Value of Macroeconomic News Announcements Related to their Asset Price Impact?|The literature documents a heterogeneous asset price response to macroeconomic news announcements. We explain this variation with a novel measure of the intrinsic value of an announcement - the announcement's ability to nowcast GDP growth, inflation, and the Federal Funds Target Rate-and decompose it into the announcement's relation to fundamentals, a timeliness premium, and a revision premium. We find that differences in intrinsic value can explain a significant fraction of the variation in the announcements' price impact on Treasury bond yields. The announcements' timeliness and relation to fundamentals are the most important characteristics in explaining this variation.
E27|The housing market, household portfolios and the German consumer|House price booms in Anglo-Saxon economies and their collapse were an important part of the financial accelerator via consumption, construction and the banking system. This paper examines links for Germany between household portfolios, income and consumption in a six-equation system, for 1980-2012 data, for consumption, house prices, consumer credit, housing loans, liquid assets and permanent income with latent variables representing the shifts in the availability of the two types of credit. We find evidence of well specified consumption and house price functions and that Germany differs greatly from the Anglo-Saxon economies: rising house prices do not translate into higher consumer spending. This suggests that the transmission of monetary policy via asset prices, in particular house prices, on consumption is likely to be less effective, and any financial accelerator weaker, in Germany than in the US or the UK. There is little evidence of overvaluation of German house prices by 2012. JEL Classification: E21, E27, E44, E51, E58
E27|Ciclo económico y minería del cobre en Chile|En el presente artículo se “endogeniza” la oferta de cobre, incorporando la demanda de insumos del sector minero correspondiente a otros bienes de la economía —específicamente, bienes intermedios— y también energía, en un modelo de equilibrio general dinámico estocástico (dsge) para una muestra del período 2003-2013. La estimación del modelo revela que un aumento de un 1% del precio del cobre causa un incremento de un 0,16% en el producto interno bruto (pib) en cinco años. La principal contribución del estudio es mostrar que, si se considera al sector minero integrado al resto de la economía, en lugar de suponer —como es usual— que constituye un enclave, los efectos del precio del cobre en la economía chilena por lo menos se duplican.
E27|The business cycle and copper mining in Chile|This article “endogenizes” the copper supply, incorporating demand for mining-sector inputs represented by other goods in the economy (specifically, intermediate goods) and also energy into a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model for a sample of the 2003-2013 period. The model estimation reveals that a rise of 1% in the copper price leads to a 0.16% increase in gross domestic product (GDP) over five years. The main contribution of the study is to show that, if the mining sector is treated as integrated into the rest of the economy rather than being assumed to be an enclave, as it usually is, the effects of the copper price on the Chilean economy at least double.
E27|From pro-natalist rhetoric to population policies in Turkey? An OLG general equilibrium analysis|We build an overlapping generation (OLG) general equilibrium model of Turkey with survival rates and endogenous labour supply to simulate the economic, fiscal, welfare, and intergenerational redistribution impacts of the medium and high fertility demographic scenarios projected by the United Nations. We assume that the high fertility variant is a realistic demographic proxy for pro-natalist policies in Turkey. Our results show that on a purely economic basis, a higher fertility scenario in Turkey appears open to criticisms as it cannot offset the social security pressures of ageing, and it also involves intergenerational welfare redistributions so that current young adults are unlikely to endorse natalist rhetoric and policies.
E27|Modelling events: The short-term economic impact of leaving the EU|This paper presents a framework for modelling important socio-economic events in order to provide an informative counterfactual. This involves mapping the deep underlying shock associated with the event itself into a series of more tractable shocks consistent with the model being applied and calibrated from data, existing literature or ancillary analysis. The results should then be subject to testing of their sensitivity to the assumptions made. As a practical example, the paper uses the National Institute's Global Econometric Model (NiGEM) to consider the short-term economic impact to the UK of leaving the European Union. We find that the UK economy would be around 2 1/2% smaller 2years after a decision to leave the EU when compared to the counterfactual of deciding to remain a member.
E27|Modeling the short-run effect of fiscal stimuli on GDP: A new semi-closed input–output model|In this study, we propose a new semi-closed input–output model, which reconciles input–output analysis with modern consumption theories. It can simulate changes in household consumption behavior when exogenous stimulus policies lead to higher disposable income levels. It is useful for quantifying the short-run effects of fiscal stimuli on GDP and its industry-level value added components. We illustrate the use of the model by estimating the short-run effect of the 4trillion yuan stimulus package on China's GDP. Our results show that this stimulus package might have led to an increase in GDP of more than 3trillion yuan, which is 9.5% of China's GDP in 2008. This result compares well to actual changes in GDP as observed in the years immediately after the introduction of the package.
E27|On interactions between remittance outflows and Saudi Arabian macroeconomy: New evidence from wavelets|The effect of workers' remittance outflows on macroeconomic variables of host countries is a controversial issue. The purpose of this paper is to study lead/lag interactions between workers' remittance outflows and macroeconomic leading variables in Saudi Arabia for 1980–2013 within a time–frequency framework. To this end, we perform three wavelet variants, namely, the wavelet power spectrum, the cross-spectrum wavelet, and the coherence wavelet. We show that remittance outflows are strongly associated with the main Saudi aggregates and that their relationships change across time scale and frequency bands. In the short- and mid-term, real output growth and government expenditures guide remittance outflows. More specifically, government expenditures positively affect remittance shares to real outputs. In addition, the wavelet analysis reveals a positive causality link from the active population to remittances over low-frequency bands. These outcomes have several prominent implications and point to practical recommendations in terms of monetary policy coordination and financial stability.
E27|Real-time nowcasting of nominal GDP with structural breaks|This paper provides early assessments of current U.S. Nominal GDP growth, which has been considered as a potential new monetary policy target. The nowcasts are computed using the exact amount of information that policy makers have available at the time predictions are made. However, real time information arrives at different frequencies and asynchronously, which poses the challenge of mixed frequencies, missing data, and ragged edges. This paper proposes a multivariate state space model that not only takes into account asynchronous information inflow it also allows for potential parameter instability (DYMIBREAK). We use small scale confirmatory factor analysis in which the candidate variables are selected based on their ability to forecast nominal GDP. The model is fully estimated in one step using a nonlinear Kalman filter, which is applied to obtain simultaneously both optimal inferences on the dynamic factor and parameters. Differently from principal component analysis, the proposed factor model captures the comovement rather than the variance underlying the variables. We compare the predictive ability of the model with other univariate and multivariate specifications. The results indicate that the proposed model containing information on real economic activity, inflation, interest rates, and Divisia monetary aggregates produces the most accurate real time nowcasts of nominal GDP growth.
E27|Forecasting unemployment across countries: The ins and outs|This paper evaluates the flow approach to unemployment forecasting proposed by Barnichon and Nekarda (2012) for a set of OECD countries characterized by very different labor markets. We find that the flow approach yields substantial improvements in forecast accuracy over professional forecasts for all countries, with especially large improvements at longer horizons (one-year ahead forecasts) for European countries. Moreover, the flow approach has the highest predictive ability during recessions and turning points, when unemployment forecasts are most valuable.
E27|A time varying DSGE model with financial frictions|We build a time varying DSGE model with financial frictions in order to evaluate changes in the responses of the macroeconomy to financial friction shocks. Using U.S. data, we find that the transmission of the financial friction shock to economic variables, such as output growth, has not changed in the last 30years. The volatility of the financial friction shock, however, has changed, so that output responses to a one-standard deviation of the shock increase twofold in the 2007–2011 period in comparison with the 1985–2006 period. The time varying DSGE model with financial frictions improves the accuracy of forecasts of output growth and inflation during the tranquil period of 2000–2006, while delivering similar performance to the fixed coefficient DSGE model for the 2007–2012 period.
E27|Long term oil prices|In this paper we propose a model to estimate and simulate long term oil prices. Our model is based on properties of demand and supply for oil and it is able to reproduce historical real oil prices well. We use the model to estimate and simulate future real oil price scenarios. The results show that if we are not able to significantly increase demand elasticity, the yearly real oil price change can reach 12% in the years following the peak production level without taking a scarcity rent into account. Until peak production level is reached, the long term real oil price changes stemming from fundamental supply and demand changes are expected to be negative. Our simulation results based on an expected peak production year of 2020 and a scarcity rent of 3% suggest an expected real crude oil price of $169/bbl in 2040. For comparison the EIA outlook predicts a real oil price of $141/bbl for the same year. We also provide an on-line Appendix that allows the readers to change the assumptions underlying our analysis and see the results immediately.
E27|Forecasting electricity consumption in Pakistan: the way forward|Growing shortfall of electricity in Pakistan affects almost all sectors of its economy. For proper policy formulation, it is imperative to have reliable forecasts of electricity consumption. This paper applies Holt-Winter and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models on time series secondary data from 1980 to 2011 to forecast total and component wise electricity consumption in Pakistan. Results reveal that Holt-Winter is the appropriate model for forecasting electricity consumption in Pakistan. It also suggests that electricity consumption would continue to increase throughout the projected period and widen the consumption-production gap in case of failure to respond the issue appropriately. It further reveals that demand would be highest in the household sector as compared to all other sectors and the increase in the energy generation would be less than the increase in total electricity consumption throughout the projected period. The study discuss various options to reduce the demand-supply gap and provide reliable electricity to different sectors of the economy.
E27|Asset price bubbles and economic welfare|In this paper, we provide the first empirical evidence on whether or not asset price bubbles predict economic welfare. Using a time-series model, we show that asset price bubbles both positively and negatively predict economic welfare, although the evidence that asset price bubbles are welfare-enhancing is much stronger. These results are also robust to out-of-sample forecasting as well as to a predictive regression model augmented by structural break dates.
E27|A self-organizing map analysis of survey-based agents׳ expectations before impending shocks for model selection: The case of the 2008 financial crisis|This paper examines the role of clustering techniques to assist in the selection of the most indicated method to model survey-based expectations. First, relying on a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) analysis and using the financial crisis of 2008 as a benchmark, we distinguish between countries that show a progressive anticipation of the crisis, and countries where sudden changes in expectations occur. We then generate predictions of survey indicators, which are usually used as explanatory variables in econometric models. We compare the forecasting performance of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to that of three different time series models. By combining both types of analysis, we find that ANN models outperform time series models in countries in which the evolution of expectations shows brisk changes before impending shocks. Conversely, in countries where expectations follow a smooth transition towards recession, autoregressive integrated moving-average (ARIMA) models outperform neural networks.
E27|Nonlinear forecasting with many predictors using kernel ridge regression|This paper puts forward kernel ridge regression as an approach for forecasting with many predictors that are related to the target variable nonlinearly. In kernel ridge regression, the observed predictor variables are mapped nonlinearly into a high-dimensional space, where estimation of the predictive regression model is based on a shrinkage estimator in order to avoid overfitting. We extend the kernel ridge regression methodology to enable its use for economic time series forecasting, by including lags of the dependent variable or other individual variables as predictors, as is typically desired in macroeconomic and financial applications. Both Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application to various key measures of real economic activity confirm that kernel ridge regression can produce more accurate forecasts than traditional linear and nonlinear methods for dealing with many predictors based on principal components.
E27|The accuracy of forecasts prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee|We analyze forecasts of consumption, nonresidential investment, residential investment, government spending, exports, imports, inventories, gross domestic product, inflation, and unemployment prepared by the staff of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee from 1997 to 2008, called the Greenbooks. We compare the root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and the proportion of directional errors of Greenbook forecasts of these macroeconomic indicators with the errors from three forecasting benchmarks: a random walk, a first-order autoregressive model, and a Bayesian model averaged forecast from a suite of univariate time-series models commonly taught to first-year economics graduate students. We estimate our forecasting benchmarks both on end-of-sample vintage and real-time vintage data. We find that Greenbook forecasts significantly outperform our benchmark forecasts for horizons less than one quarter ahead. However, by the one-year forecast horizon, typically at least one of our forecasting benchmarks performs as well as Greenbook forecasts. Greenbook forecasts of personal consumption expenditures and unemployment tend to do relatively well, while Greenbook forecasts of inventory investment, government expenditures, and inflation tend to do poorly.
E27|Land prices and unemployment|We integrate the housing market and the labor market in a dynamic general equilibrium model with credit and search frictions. We argue that the labor channel, combined with the standard credit channel, provides a strong transmission mechanism that can deliver a potential solution to the Shimer (2005) puzzle. The model is confronted with U.S. macroeconomic time series. The estimation results account for two prominent facts observed in the data. First, land prices and unemployment move in opposite directions over the business cycle. Second, a shock that moves land prices also generates the observed large volatility of unemployment.
E27|Models, Inattention and Expectation Updates|"We formulate a theory of expectation updating that fits the dynamics of accuracy and disagreement in a new survey dataset where agents can update at any time while observing each other's expectations. Agents use heterogeneous models and can be inattentive but, when updating, they follow Bayes' rule and assign homogeneous weights to public information. Our empirical findings suggest that agents do not herd and, despite disagreement, they place high faith in their models, whereas during a crisis they lose this faith and undergo a paradigm shift. This simple, ""micro-founded"" theory could enhance the explanatory power of macroeconomic and finance models."
E27|Impact of Mergers and Acquisitions on European Insurers: Evidence from Equity Markets|The current macro-economic and financial conditions remain extremely challenging for the European insurance sector. Under the ongoing low yield environment insurers are changing their business models and looking for new investment and business opportunities to improve their profitability and the overall solvency positions. This is also reflected in an increasing interest in mergers and acquisitions to achieve sufficient returns. However, there is no clear answer in the literature whether this strategy brings the expected positive results. This study empirically tests the effects of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) on share prices of European insurers via an event study. Our results do not confirm the positive impact of such strategies on acquirers’ share prices delivering abnormal returns for shareholders.
E27|The Impact of the Monetary Policy Interventions on the Insurance Industry|This paper investigates the effect of the conventional and unconventional (e.g. Quantitative Easing) monetary policy intervention on the insurance industry. We first analyse the impact on the stock performances of 166 (re)insurers of the last Quantitative Easing programme launched by the ECB by constructing an event study around the announcement date. Then we enlarge the scope by looking at the monetary policy surprise effects on the same sample of (re)insurers over a timeframe of 8 years. Our evidences suggest that a single intervention extrapolated from the comprehensive strategy cannot be utilized to estimate the effect of the monetary policy intervention on the market. On the impact of monetary policies we show how the effect of interventions changes over time. The expansionary monetary policy interventions, when generating an instantaneous reduction of interest rates, had an immediate positive effect on the stock market and on the insurance industry from 2008 till 2013. However, the effect fades away in 2014-2015. This period includes the last ECB QE intervention and it is characterized by already extreme low interest rates shows statistically non-significant effects on the (re)insurers stock returns.
E27|Updating the Long Term Rate in Time: A Possible Approach|This study proposes the potential methodological approach to be utilized by regulators when setting up a Long-Term Rate (LTR) for the evaluation of insurers’ liabilities beyond the last liquid point observable in the market. Our approach is based on the optimization of two contradictory aspects – stability and accuracy implied by economic fundamentals. We use U.S. Treasury term structure data over the period 1985-2015 to calibrate an algorithm that dynamically revises LTR based on the distance between the value implied by long-term growth of economic fundamentals in a given year and the regulatory value of LTR valid in a year prior. We employ both Nelson-Siegel and Svensson models to extrapolate yields over maturities of 21-30 years employing the selected value of the LTR and compare them to the observed yields using mean square error statistic. Furthermore, we optimise the parameter of the proposed LTR formula by minimising the defined loss function capturing both mentioned factors.

E27|Cuantificación de los efectos de la disminución de remesas internacionales dirigidas a las regiones urbanas y rurales de México en 2002 mediante el uso de una matriz de contabilidad social|En este artículo, se estiman los efectos multisectoriales de una reducción de las remesas internacionales que recibieron los hogares mexicanos en 2002. Para ello, se usa una matriz de contabilidad social correspondiente a 1996 en la que se desglosan las regiones rurales de México, actualizada a 2002 y balanceada con el método de entropía. Los resultados muestran que los efectos fueron mayores en la producción sectorial de agriculturaganadería, manufactura alimentaria, comercio, servicios y transporte. Además, el factor productivo más afectado globalmente es el trabajo urbano ligado a los sectores comercio y transporte, otros servicios y servicios profesionales. Con una baja de 10% en las remesas, el PIB se reduce 1%. La mayor parte de la afectación total corresponde a la región urbana (0.27%) y marginalmente a las rurales (0.01%).
E27|Impact of Mergers and Acquisitions on European Insurers: Evidence from Equity Markets|Under the current low yield environment insurers are changing their business models and looking for new investment and business opportunities. This is also reflected in an increasing interest in mergers and acquisitions to achieve sufficient returns. However, there is no clear answer in the literature whether this strategy brings the expected positive results. This study empirically tests the effects of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) on share prices of European insurers via an event study. Our results do not confirm the positive impact of such strategies on acquirers’ share prices delivering abnormal returns for shareholders.
E27|China's Macroeconomic Outlook and Risk Assessment: Counterfactual Analysis, Policy Simulation, and Long-Term Governance¡ªA Summary of Annual Report (2015¨C2016)|This summary report highlights the confluence of continued downward pressures and deflation scares in the face of looming uncertainty in China¡¯s key macroeconomic landscapes. Counterfactual analyses and policy simulations are conducted, in addition to benchmark forecasts, based on IAR-CMM model and taking into account both cyclical and secular factors. Economic deceleration is projected to continue in the short to medium term, with real GDP growth declining to 6.3% (5.5% using more reliable instead of official data) in 2016 and facing a significant risk of sliding further down in 2017. Five key factors contributing to the weak outlook, additional to frictions and impediments associated with economic transition/restructuring and lackluster domestic/external demands, are identified, including: lack of new growth/ development engine, exhaustion of government-led driving force, the crowding-out of private sectors by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) with excess capacity\capital overhang, nonperforming government sectors and officials, and twist or misinterpretation of the ¡°New Normal.¡± A root cause of these problems, lying with sluggishness in China¡¯s transformation into a market based economy, has to do with overpowered government but underpowered market in resource allocation and government underperformance in enforcing integrity and transparency in the marketplace and in providing public goods and services. At the nexus between inclusive growth and institutional transformation are market oriented and rule of law governed structural reforms and harmonious development. As such, fundamental institutional reforms that dialectically balance demand and supply side factors and properly weigh short run stabilization against long run development should be elevated to the top of the agenda.
E27|Heterogeneity and Unemployment Dynamics|This paper develops new estimates of flows into and out of unemployment that allow for unobserved heterogeneity across workers as well as direct effects of unemployment duration on unemployment-exit probabilities. Unlike any previous paper in this literature, it develops a complete dynamic statistical model that allows us to measure the contribution of different shocks to the short-run, medium-run, and long run variance of unemployment as well as to specific historical episodes. This paper finds that changes in the inflows of newly unemployed are the key driver of economic recessions and identify an increase in permanent job loss as the most important factor.
