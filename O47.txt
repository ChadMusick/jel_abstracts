O47|Intermediate Goods-Skill Complementarity|With the growing importance of intermediate goods, recent studies begin to suggest intermediate goods-skill complementarity and its potential effect on inequality. However, this possible complementarity has not yet been formally tested. This paper conducts a formal test on whether intermediate goods are complements for skilled labor. Using the panel data of 40 countries over the period 1995-2009, we estimate a two-level CES production function. Our results indicate that, at the aggregated one-sector level, the elasticity of substitution between intermediate goods and unskilled labor is significantly greater than that between intermediate goods and skilled labor. This confirms intermediate goods-skill complementarity. At the more disaggregated level, such complementarity is observed mainly in the heavy manufacturing industries and the service sector, whereas substitutability is confirmed in the primary sector and in light manufacturing industries. Moreover, intermediate goods-skill complementarity tends to be higher for industries whose shares of imported intermediate goods are higher.
O47|Labour and capital remuneration in the OECD countries|Functional distribution is an important driver of inequality. When market remuneration of labour and capital are very uneven, as they have been in recent decades, personal distribution tends to polarise, jeopardising social cohesion. This fact explains a renewed interest in functional distribution. Nevertheless, in the estimates on functional distribution the role of self-employed income has been undervalued. National accounts provide estimates of the compensation of employees and the operating surplus, but do not refer to self-employed workers as a specific productive factor and implicitly include their income in the ‘mixed income’ and in some minor items. Most analysts estimate self-employed income by attributing the same average unit compensation of the corresponding employees to each worker, that in fact is not necessarily consistent with the GDP estimates.Other estimates take a fixed share of the ‘mixed income’, usually the same for every country. When national accounts are very detailed, as in the case of Italy, it is possible to estimate self-employment income from non-financial accounts by sectors with some accuracy, under some weak assumptions. In this paper we analyse four workable estimates, since only the total amount of ‘mixed income’ received by households is available for most countries. We analyse the data of the OECD countries focusing mainly on eight large countries: the US, Japan, the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy. The results are somehow unexpected. First of all, evaluating the income of the self employed properly, the overall labour share is declining much faster than reported by the official data in some countries, and more countries showed a decrease in the 2000s. Indeed, the real unit compensation of the self employed reduced significantly in most of the eight countries (and in some of the others) after the mid or the end of the nineties, since self-employment has been used extensively to reduce the overall labour cost. Unit labour cost (ULC) also increased much slower (or even declined more) after 2000 in most countries, shedding new light on the pattern of international competitiveness and the drivers of inflation. The share of operative surplus of non-financial and financial corporations, properly recalculated, has had different dynamics, whereas the component related to imputed rentals of owner occupied houses played an unexpectedly important role. Finally, the mark-up on variable production costs has been higher than expected and its dynamic has been faster in most countries, showing a minor sensitivity to the business cycle. Indeed, statistical data on self-employment income is not fully satisfactory in many countries, thus our estimation of self-employment income represents only a first step towards a deeper comprehension of the dynamic of primary distribution. Indirect evidence of the reliability of our estimates is in their capacity to explain some key variables more accurately, strictly related to labour share, mark-up and ULC, which are income inequality, inflation and export performance.
O47|The Impact of Intellectual Property Rights on Labor Productivity: Do Constitutions Matter?|Focusing on 22 OECD countries we estimate the impact of constitutional provisions and of lower-rank norms aimed at protecting intellectual property rights (IPR) on labor productivity at industry level. Our analysis allows us to answer the following questions: Are IPR more likely to be enforced if they are envisaged in the constitution rather than provided for in ordinary legislation? And if constitutional protection implies an accrued defense or enforcement of those principles, is this difference relevant enough to translate into a higher impact on firms’ outcome? By using IV techniques and controlling for a full set of year-, industry- and country fixed effects (and their interactions), we show that constitutional provisions protecting IPR positively affect the differential in labor productivity between high and low R&D intensive sectors. This effect is driven by the impact of IPR protection on R&D investment of the highly innovative sectors. Our results hold after controlling for lower-rank norms. Furthermore, the interaction between constitutional norms and lower legislation is negative, suggesting that the two are substitutes: the impact of constitutions is stronger in those countries where IPR protection by lower norms is weaker. On turn, in those countries where IPR are protected by constitutional norms, lower norms do not have a significant effect on the productivity of high R&D intensive sectors.
O47|An Integrated Panel Data Approach to Modelling Economic Growth|"Empirical growth analysis has three major problems -- variable selection, parameter heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence -- which are addressed independently from each other in most studies. The purpose of this study is to propose an integrated framework that extends the conventional linear growth regression model to allow for parameter heterogeneity and cross-sectional error dependence, while simultaneously performing variable selection. We also derive the asymptotic properties of the estimator under both low and high dimensions, and furtherinvestigate the finite sample performance of the estimator through Monte Carlo simulations. We apply the framework to a dataset of 89 countries over the period from 1960 to 2014. Our results reveal some cross-country patterns not found in previous studies (e.g., ""middle income trap hypothesis"", ""natural resources curse hypothesis"", ""religion works via belief, not practice"", etc.)."
O47|"Job creation in Colombia vs the U.S.: ""up or out dynamics"" meets ""the life cycle of plants"""|"Following the seminal work of Hsieh and Klenow (2014), there is growing consensus that a key difference between the U.S. and developing economies is that the latter exhibit slower employment growth over the life cycle of the average productive establishment. At the same time, the distribution of startup employment growth in the U.S. is highly skewed, with extraordinary growth establishments driving average employment growth, giving rise to the ""up or out dynamics"" label (Haltiwanger, Jarmin and Miranda, 2013). We look at the entire population of non-micro manufacturing establishments in Colombia vs. the US and find that slower average life cycle growth in Colombia is driven by a less enthusiastic contribution of extraordinary growth plants and less dynamic selection of young underperforming plants. As a consequence, the size distribution of non-micro plants exhibits more concentration in small-old plants in Colombia, both in unweighted and employment-weighted bases. These findings point to a shortage of high-growth entrepreneurship and a relatively high likelihood of long-run survival for small, likely unproductive plants, as two key elements at the heart of the development problem. An extreme concentration of resources in micro plants is the other distinguishing feature of the Colombian manufacturing sector vis a vis the US'."
O47|Assessing the Gains from E-Commerce|E-Commerce represents a rapidly growing share of consumer spending in the U.S. We use transactions-level data on credit and debit cards from Visa, Inc. between 2007 and 2017 to quantify the resulting consumer surplus. We estimate that E-Commerce spending reached 8% of consumption by 2017, yielding consumers the equivalent of a 1% permanent boost to their consumption, or over $1,000 per household. While some of the gains arose from saving travel costs of buying from local merchants, most of the gains stemmed from substituting to online merchants. Higher income cardholders gained more, as did consumers in more densely populated counties.
O47|GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy|The welfare contributions of the digital economy, characterized by the proliferation of new and free goods, are not well-measured in our current national accounts. We derive explicit terms for the welfare contributions of these goods and introduce a new metric, GDP-B which quantifies their benefits, rather than costs. We apply this framework to several empirical examples including Facebook and smartphone cameras and estimate their valuations through incentive-compatible choice experiments. For example, including the welfare gains from Facebook would have added between 0.05 and 0.11 percentage points to GDP-B growth per year in the US.
O47|The Industry Anatomy of the Transatlantic Productivity Growth Slowdown|By merging KLEMS data sets and aggregating over the ten largest Western European nations (EU-10), we are able to compare and contrast productivity growth up through 2015 starting from 1950 in the U.S. and from 1972 in the EU-10. Data are provided at the aggregate level, as well as for 16 industry groups within the total economy and 11 manufacturing sub-industries. The analysis focuses on outcomes over four time intervals: 1950-72, 1972-95, 1995-2005, and 2005-15. We interpret the EU-10 performance as catching up to the U.S. in stages, with its rapid growth of 1950-72 representing a delayed adoption of the inventions that propelled U.S. productivity growth in the first half of the 20th century, and the next EU-10 stage for 1972-95 as imitating the U.S. outcome for 1950-72. We show that both the pace of aggregate productivity growth during 1972-95 for the EU-10 as well as its industrial composition matched very closely the growth record of the U.S. in the previous 1950-72 time interval. A striking finding is that for the total economy the “early-to-late” productivity growth slowdown from 1972-95 to 2005-15 in the EU-10 (-1.68 percentage points) was almost identical to the U.S. slowdown from 1950-72 to 2005-15 (-1.67 percentage points). There is a very high EU-U.S. correlation in the magnitude of the early-to-late slowdown across industries. This supports our overall theme that the productivity growth slowdown from the early postwar years to the most recent decade was due to a retardation in technical change that affected the same industries by roughly the same magnitudes on both sides of the Atlantic.
O47|Accumulation of Human and Market Capital in the United States, 1975-2012: An Analysis by Gender|This paper covers a continuous and longer time period than previously possible to examine human and market capital because of research by Christian (2017). This paper focuses on the presentation and analysis of trends in human capital by gender. During 1975-2012 there were significant changes in participation by women, the wage gender gap, and educational attainment and time in household production by both women and men. Both the market and nonmarket sectors will be covered as well as multifactor productivity with and without human capital. (A previous paper (Fraumeni, et al. 2017) described the national income accounting system which underlies both this paper and the much earlier paper by Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989).) New insights will be gained by looking in detail at the 1975-2012 time period.
O47|Misallocation Under Trade Liberalization|This paper incorporates firm-level distortions into a Melitz model and characterizes welfare under misallocation. We derive an analogue to the well-known ACR result in an economy with distortions. We highlight a channel through which trade can reduce welfare by exacerbating misallocation. A key statistic to infer welfare is the gap between input and output shares. Using Chinese manufacturing data for quantitative analysis, we show that trade integration can lead to a 18% welfare loss coming from a reduction in allocative efficiency. The overall gains to trade is substantially smaller than implied by standard calculations.
O47|Mandated Financial Reporting and Corporate Innovation|We investigate the impact of reporting regulation on corporate innovation activity. Exploiting thresholds in Europe’s regulation and a major enforcement reform in Germany, we find that forcing a greater share of firms to publicly disclose their financial statements reduces firms’ innovative activities at the industry level. At the same time, it increases firms’ reliance on patenting to protect their innovations, to the extent they continue innovating. Our evidence is consistent with reporting mandates having significant real effects by imposing proprietary costs on innovative firms, which diminishes their incentives to engage in innovative activities. Importantly, we examine and find that this decline in innovative activity is not fully compensated by positive information spillovers (e.g., to competitors, suppliers, and customers) within industries. Thus, our evidence implies that proprietary costs induced by reporting mandates are important consideration for regulators and policy makers.
O47|In Search of Reforms for Growth: New Stylized Facts on Policy and Growth Outcomes|The lack of growth response to “Washington Consensus” policy reforms in the 1980s and 1990s led to widespread doubts about the value of such reforms. This paper updates these stylized facts by analyzing moderate to extreme levels of inflation, black market premiums, currency overvaluation, negative real interest rates and abnormally low trade shares to GDP. It finds three new stylized facts: (1) policy outcomes worldwide have improved a lot since the 1990s, (2) improvements in policy outcomes and improvements in growth across countries are correlated with each other (3) growth has been good after reform in Africa and Latin America, in contrast to the “lost decades” of the 80s and 90s. This paper makes no claims about causality. However, if the old stylized facts on disappointing growth accompanying reforms led to doubts about economic reforms, new stylized facts should lead to some positive updating of such beliefs.
O47|Do Unit Labor Costs Matter? A Decomposition Exercise on European Data|From the introduction of the Euro up to the 2008 global financial crisis, macroeconomic imbalances widened among Member States. This divergence took the form of strong differences in the dynamics of unit labour costs. This paper asks why this happened. Is it the result of distortionary public spending, or the consequence of economic integration? To answer this question, this paper builds a theoretical framework that is able to provide a decomposition of unit labour costs growth into various effects of economic integration and policy intervention. Using a novel dataset, it then measures the contribution of each effect to the dynamics of unit labour costs in 12 countries of the Euro area from 1995 to 2014. Results show that trade and financial integration are significant drivers of unit labour costs divergence. Before the global financial crisis, in Greece and Portugal for example, trade and financial integration explain up to 30% of the increase in unit labour costs relative to core countries. On the contrary, distortionary public spending plays a minor role. These results suggest that, in peripheral economies, increasing unit labour costs reflect more the process of real convergence than fiscal profligacy.
O47|Understanding the relationship between poverty, inequality and growth: a review of existing evidence|This paper reviews the theoretical literature and empirical evidence on the relationship between poverty, inequality and economic growth. It finds evidence that economic inequality is good for growth as well as new convincing evidence that inequality is bad for growth. Variation in data quality, methodologies, the range of countries included in different studies makes it difficult to compare the evidence. A recent hypothesis that the relationship between inequality and growth might be non-linear, with very low and very high levels of inequality being harmful to growth but a range in between where the relationship is not clearly defined might provide a means to unify some of the conflicting findings.
O47|Pandemics, Places, and Populations: Evidence from the Black Death|The Black Death killed 40% of Europe's population between 1347-1352, making it one of the largest shocks in history. Despite its importance, little is known about its spatial effects and the effects of pandemics more generally. Using a novel dataset that provides information on spatial variation in Plague mortality at the city level, as well as various identification strategies, we explore the short-run and long-run impacts of the Black Death on city growth. On average, cities recovered their pre-Plague populations within two centuries. In addition, aggregate convergence masked heterogeneity in urban recovery. We show that both of these facts are consistent with a Malthusian model in which population returns to high-mortality locations endowed with more rural and urban fixed factors of production. Land suitability and natural and historical trade networks played a vital role in urban recovery. Our study highlights the role played by pandemics in determining both the sizes and placements of populations.
O47|Is favoritism a threat to Chinese aid effectiveness? A subnational analysis of Chinese development projects|Chinese aid comes with few strings attached, allowing recipient country leaders to use it for domestic political purposes. The vulnerability of Chinese aid to political capture has prompted speculation that it may be economically ineffective, or even harmful. We test these claims by estimating the effect of Chinese aid on subnational economic development - as measured by per-capita nighttime light emissions - and whether this effect is different in politically favored jurisdictions than in other parts of the country. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, we do not nd that the local receipt of Chinese aid undermines economic development outcomes at either the district level or provincial level. Nor does political favoritism in the allocation of Chinese aid towards the home regions of recipient country leaders reduce its effectiveness. Our results - from 709 provinces and 5,835 districts within 47 African countries from 2001-2012 - demonstrate that Chinese aid improves local development outcomes, regardless of whether such aid is allocated to politically consequential jurisdictions.
O47|The Fall in UK Potential Output due to the Financial Crisis: a Much Bigger Estimate|Conventional estimates suggest that the 2007-9 financial crisis reduced UK potential output by 3.8 to 7.5 per cent of GDP. This implied a need for fiscal tightening as the structural budget deficit had increased considerably. The austerity that followed led to the rise of UKIP, the EU referendum and the vote for Brexit. Brexit will reduce potential output by somewhere between 3.9 and 8.7 per cent of GDP. Thus, it can be argued that the total fall in UK potential output due to the banking crisis is approximately double the conventional estimate.
O47|Economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa, 1885-2008|Estimates of GDP per capita are provided on an annual basis for eight SubSaharan African economies for the period since 1885. Although the growth experienced in most of SSA since the mid-1990s has had historical precedents, there have also been episodes of negative growth or “shrinking”, so that long run progress has been limited. Despite some heterogeneity across countries, this must be seen as a disappointing performance for the region as a whole, given the possibilities of catch-up growth. Avoiding episodes of shrinking needs to be given a higher priority in understanding the transition to sustained economic growth.
O47|Is the UK Productivity Slowdown Unprecedented?|We estimate trend UK labour productivity grow thusing a Hodrick-Prescott filter method. We use the results to compare downturns where the economy fell below its pre-existing trend. We find that the current productivity slowdown has resulted in productivity being 19.7% below the pre-2008 trend path in 2018. This is nearly double the previous worst productivity short fall ten years after the start of a downturn. On this criterion the slow down is unprecedented in the last 250 years. We conjecture that this reflects a combination of adverse circumstances, namely, a financial crisis, a weakening impact of ICT and impending Brexit.
O47|The Sources of British Economic Growth since the Industrial Revolution : Not the Same Old Story|This paper updates the classic growth accounting research of the early 1980s taking account of improved data that has subsequently become available. The picture of long-run growth which results from incorporating many revisions is considerably different. The long-run path of productivity growth is now that of a roller-coaster with twin peaks in the third quarters of the 19th and 20th centuries rather than a U-shape. Productivity growth appears to have been very slow to accelerate in the Industrial Revolution, the notion of an Edwardian climacteric is not persuasive and the current productivity slowdown stands out as unprecedented.
O47|The Pre-1914 UK Productivity Slowdown: A Reappraisal|This paper re-examines UK productivity growth in the decades before World War I using a new dataset compiled by Thomas and Dimsdale (2017). We find that the productivity slowdown of the early 20th century was quite modest and does not deserve to be called a climacteric. A more serious slowdown in labour productivity growth occurred in the 1870s. Neither of these episodes should be regarded as a precedent for the current severe deterioration in UK productivity performance. Nor should a late-Victorian productivity slowdown be attributed to the end of the steam age despite the popularity of this belief.
O47|Job creation in Colombia vs the U.S.: “up or out dynamics” meets “the life cycle of plants”|There is growing consensus that a key difference between the U.S. and developing economies is that the latter exhibit slower employment growth over the life cycle of the average business. At the same time, the rapid post entry growth in the U.S. is driven by an “up or out dynamic”. We track manufacturing establishments in Colombia vs. the US and find that slower average life cycle growth in Colombia is driven by a less enthusiastic contribution of extraordinary growth plants and less dynamic selection of young underperforming plants. As a consequence, the size distribution of non-micro plants exhibits more concentration in small-old plants in Colombia, both in unweighted and employment-weighted bases. These findings point to a shortage of high-growth entrepreneurship and a relatively high likelihood of long-run survival for small, likely unproductive plants, as two key elements at the heart of the development problem. An extreme concentration of resources in micro plants is the other distinguishing feature of the Colombian manufacturing sector vis a vis the US.
O47|Determinantes de la productividad agrícola|Uno de los grandes desafíos que enfrenta el país es disminuir la desproporción en el desarrollo social y económico de las zonas urbanas y rurales. Para entender los retos detrás de este desafío es necesario tener una mirada comprensiva de las diferencias en las condiciones urbanas y rurales, tanto en términos de inclusión social, como productiva. En términos sociales los datos parecen mostrar la existencia de un círculo perverso que limita la acumulación de educación en las zonas rurales que, junto con unas bajas opciones de inserción productiva, conduce a un mercado de trabajo con unas condiciones precarias de empleabilidad, que se ve reflejado en bajos ingresos y pobreza. En cuanto al sector productivo, se observa que el acervo de condiciones naturales del país se encuentra en un nivel bajo de utilización, al mismo tiempo aquellos recursos que se utilizan no responden a su verdadera vocación productiva. En esa vía, se indago por los niveles de productividad agrícola y sus determinantes para varios cultivos (agroindustriales, frutales y cereales), teniendo en cuenta los diferentes niveles de la actividad agrícola: las características propias de los productores y de sus unidades productivas; de los aspectos institucionales con los que se cuenta (acceso a crédito, instrumentos de fomento, etc.), así como los aspectos las características geográficas (distancia a los centros principales de acopio, facilidad de acceso a los mercado, etc.).
O47|Saving Rates in Latin America: A Neoclassical Perspective|Latin American countries have long exhibited low levels of saving rates when compared to other countries in relatively similar stages of economic development (e.g., Asian economies). Motivated by this fact, this paper examines the time path of the saving rates between 1970 and 2010 in three Latin American countries— Chile, Colombia, and Mexico—through the lens of the neoclassical growth model. The findings indicate that two factors, the TFP growth rate and fiscal policy (via tax rates and government expenditure), are capable of accounting for some of the major fluctuations in saving rates observed in these years. For instance, the impressive increase in Chile’s saving rate following the early 1980s debt crisis is likely to have resulted from a combination of high TFP growth and a tax reform that substantially reduced capital taxation. Counterfactual experiments also reveal that average saving rates in Latin America could have been some three percentage points higher, had the region experienced TFP growth similar to that of the Asian countries. This increase, however, is insufficient to bridge the observed gap between saving rates in the two regions.
O47|La Guajira: caracterización departamental y municipal|En este documento se describen los activos con que cuenta el departamento de La Guajira en cuanto a sus recursos naturales y talento humano, así como su infraestructura y sus instituciones. De igual forma, se analizan sus indicadores económicos y sociales y se identifican sus brechas internas y con respecto del resto del país. Esta región estratégica para el país, que es parte del Gran Caribe y que tiene frontera con Venezuela, tiene un gran potencial de desarrollo, pero también grandes desafíos en cuanto a ofrecer a su población condiciones dignas de vida y oportunidades para la reducción de la desigualdad, el reconocimiento de su diversidad cultural, el fortalecimiento de sus instituciones y la diversificación de su economía. A las acciones ya emprendidas por el Gobierno Nacional, en el marco de las órdenes dadas por la Corte Constitucional para asegurar la protección de la infancia y la adolescencia wayuu, hay que sumar un plan de inversiones que garantice el desarrollo productivo del departamento, concertado en un contrato plan o en un nuevo Pacto territorial.
O47|Análisis de experiencias de modelos asociativos como mecanismo para el desarrollo empresarial en la ruralidad|En este trabajo estudiamos algunos de estos modelos, con un enfoque diferente. A saber, analizamos modelos asociativos de características diferentes, identificamos buenas y malas prácticas y hacemos recomendaciones de política. Para ello, recolectamos información cuantitativa y cualitativa –entrevistas, registros e información secundaria– de empresas y productores de nueve modelos asociativos en cuatro sectores: palma, cacao, leche y panela. El trabajo está organizado de la siguiente manera. Después de esta introducción, en el segundo capítulo presentamos el marco conceptual para caracterizar los diferentes modelos asociativos de agricultura por contrato y hacemos explícitos sus principales riesgos. En el tercer capítulo se explica la metodología para la selección de casos, se presentan los modelos a estudiar y se describen los aspectos más importantes de cada uno. En el cuarto capítulo elaboramos un resumen comparativo de los estudios de caso y en el quinto presentamos las conclusiones y recomendaciones en diversos frentes, entre otros respecto a precios remunerativos, productividad y calidad, acceso al crédito y formalización laboral.

O47|The Armistice of the Sexes: Gender Complementarities in the Production Function|Macroeconomic models have largely ignored the importance of gender diversity by assuming that male and female workers are perfectly substitutable in the aggregate production function. Whether this assumption is valid is an empirical question that this paper aims to answer by estimating the elasticity of substitution (ES) between the two types of labor. We apply linear and non-linear techniques to cross-country data at the aggregate level, to cross-country data at the sectoral level, and to firm-level data for the manufacturing sector in China. We find that women and men are far from being perfect substitutes: the ES is below 1 for the aggregate sample, between 1-2 for the sectoral sample, and between 2-3 at firm-level. We discuss why the ES may vary at different levels of aggregation and conclude on the implications of these results for growth accounting and for the gains from gender equality.
O47|Productivity Growth, Capital Reallocation and the Financial Crisis: Evidence from Europe and the US|How has capital reallocation affected productivity growth since the financial cri- sis? For example, have low interest rates disrupted the reallocation process? This paper calculates the effect on productivity growth of capital reallocation between industries. It uses an accounting framework, due to Jorgenson and his co-authors, that computes the contribution of capital services to productivity growth relative to one where rates of return are equalised between sectors: if capital persists in the low return sectors, the reallocation measure falls. Using data from 11 countries (the major EU economies plus the US), in 1997-2013, we nd: (a) the contribution of capital reallocation to productivity growth is lower in most economies after than before the financial crisis, notably in Mediterranean countries; (b) more capital real- location is correlated with lower real interest rates, contrary to the hypothesis that low real interest rates have hurt capital reallocation; (c) controlling for shocks, lower capital reallocation is associated with lower optimism, and weaker financial systems.
O47|Misallocation Under Trade Liberalization|This paper incorporates firm-level distortions into a Melitz model and characterizes welfare under misallocation. We derive an analogue to the well-known ACR result in an economy with distortions. We highlight a channel through which trade can reduce welfare by exacerbating misallocation. A key statistic to infer welfare is the gap between input and output shares. Using Chinese manufacturing data for quantitative analysis, we show that trade integration can lead to a 18% welfare loss coming from a reduction in allocative efficiency. The overall gains to trade is substantially smaller than implied by standard calculations.
O47|The gains from catch-up for China and the US: An empirical framework|As China becomes more closely entwined with the US, positive shocks in the US translate into positive outcomes for China, but the extent of gain for the US during the convergence process is less clear. We develop an empirical framework of two interacting open economies in which Chinese GDP per capita moves towards convergence and cointegration with the US, resulting in a time-varying structural VAR model. As a result, the impulse responses of the two countries to shocks are sensitive to the timing of the shock. The changing effects of US shocks are evident in the analysis, which shows that over the convergence process both the US and China unambiguously benefit from the catch-up process.
O47|Demographic change, human capital, and economic growth in Korea|In this study, we construct a measure of human capital using micro datasets on labor composition of age, gender, education, and wage rate and analyze its role in economic growth for the Korean economy. Over the past three decades, human capital has grown steadily at about 1% per year, contrasting to a continuously declining trend of total work-hours. This growth has been driven by the rise of better-educated baby boom cohorts. A growth accounting exercise shows that human capital contributes significantly to economic growth; it accounted for 0.5% points of annual GDP growth over the period. Human capital is projected to remain a major growth factor over the next two decades as the increase in educational attainment continues. Increased employment rate of elderly or female workers reduces the aggregate human capital growth while increasing the available labor. Polices to improve human capital of less-productivity workers will help to support aggregate human capital and economic growth.

O47|Energy Consumption and Economic Growth: Evidence from Vietnam|The importance of non-renewable, renewable and sustainable energy sources and energy consumption in the economic development strategy of a country is undeniable. The purpose of the paper is to investigate the impacts of energy consumption on the economic growth of Vietnam during the 1980-2014 period. By applying the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model of Pesaran et al. (2001), and the Granger causality test of Toda and Yamamoto (1995), the empirical results provide evidence that electricity consumption has positive impacts on Vietnam’s economic growth in both the short run and long run. For public policy prescriptions, the empirical evidence suggests that an exploration of new sources of renewable and sustainable energy is essential for long run economic development.
O47|Malthus in the Light of Climate Change|To reconsider the Malthusian predictions of natural limits to economic development, the paper develops a multi-sector growth model with exhaustible resource extraction, investments in physical and knowledge capital, climate change, and endogenous fertility. Economic growth is driven by endogenous innovations which increase in the availability and productivity of research labour. Poor substitution of natural resources triggers sectoral change. Climate change is the result of polluting resource use which is, like consumption and investments, based on the intertemporal optimization of the households. Highlighting the importance of bounded resource supply and of rational extraction decisions I show that climate change is independent of population growth in steady state and there is no causal relationship between climate and population during transition to steady state. The consumption per capita growth rate rises in the innovation rate and the output elasticities of labour and capital in the different sectors. Unlike climate policy, population policy is not warranted; it may be counterproductive because labour is crucial for the research sector.
O47|Firm Entry and Exit and Aggregate Growth|Using plant-level data from Chile and Korea, we find that, during episodes of rapid growth, most of the aggregate productivity growth is due to the entry and exit of firms while, during episodes of slower growth, it is mostly due to growth within and across existing firms. Studies for other countries suggest that this is an empirical regularity. We develop a dynamic general equilibrium model based on Hopenhayn (1992) which incorporates the theory of economic growth proposed by Parente and Prescott (1994) and Kehoe and Prescott (2002). In this model, new firms enter every period with productivities drawn from a distribution whose mean grows over time. After entering, a firmâ€™s productivity grows, but not as rapidly as new firmsâ€™ productivity distribution. In a version of the model calibrated to U.S. plant-level data, we simulate two sets of reforms: a decrease in new firmsâ€™ costs of entry and a reduction in the barriers to technology adoption for new firms. The model reproduces the regularity that we observe in the data, and confirm that entry and exit of firms is crucial for reforms to generate rapid growth.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O47|Accounting for Innovations in Consumer Digital Services: IT Still Matters|"This paper develops a framework for measuring digital services in the face of ongoing innovations in the delivery of content to consumers. We capture what Brynjolfsson and Saunders (2009) call ""free goods"" as the capital services generated by connected consumers' stocks of IT digital goods, a service flow that augments the existing measure of personal consumption in GDP. Its value is determined by the intensity with which households use their IT capital to consume content delivered over networks, and its volume depends on the quality of the IT capital. Consumers pay for delivery services, however, and the complementarity between device use and network use enables us to develop a quality-adjusted price measure for the access services already included in GDP. Our new estimates imply that accounting for innovations in consumer content delivery matters: The innovations boost consumer surplus by nearly $1,800 (2017 dollars) per connected user per year for the full period of this study (1987 to 2017) and contribute more than 1/2 percentage point to US real GDP growth during the last ten. All told, our more complete accounting of innovations is (conservatively) estimated to have moderated the post-2007 GDP growth slowdown by nearly .3 percentage points per year.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"

O47|Misallocation and Credit Market Constraints: the Role of Long-Term Financing|We measure aggregate productivity loss due to credit market constraints in a model with endogenous borrowing constraints, long-duration bonds, and costly equity payouts. Due to long-duration bonds, the model generates a realistic distribution of credit spreads. We structurally estimate our model using firm-level data on credit spreads from Thomson Reuters Bond Security Data and balance sheet data from Compustat. Credit market constraints increase aggregate productivity by 0.4% through their effect on the credit spread distribution. However, credit market constraints also interact with costly equity payouts, resulting in an overall productivity loss equal to 1.6%.
O47|Industry Competitiveness Indicators|It can be argued that the competitiveness of an industry consists of two main parts: The production conditions and the utilization of these. The production conditions are largely determined by factors exogenous to the firms comprising the industry, including the economic environment, regulatory framework, etc. The utilization of the production conditions corresponds to the classic economic notion of structural efficiency. We here argue that it is crucial for policy analysis to be able to quantify each of these two aspects separately, since the production conditions are partly in the hands of the policy makers, whereas the utilization is mainly the responsibility of firm management. In this paper we define two new bilateral indicators; the Bilateral Industry Utilization (BIU) indicator, and the Bilateral Production Conditions (BPC) indicator. These are applied to a large data set of dairy farms across 19 European countries provided by the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). With focus on the competitiveness of Danish dairy farms we show that dairy farms in most other countries have significantly better production conditions than those in Denmark while Sweden is the only country with significantly better utilization. Finally, we asses potential causes behind the differences and discuss possible remedies.
O47|Is the United States of America (USA) really being made great again? witty insights from the Box-Jenkins ARIMA approach|Using annual time series data on GDP per capita in the United States of America (USA) from 1960 to 2017, I model and forecast GDP per capita using the Box – Jenkins ARIMA technique. My diagnostic tests such as the ADF tests show that US GDP per capita data is I (2). Based on the AIC, the study presents the ARIMA (0, 2, 2) model. The diagnostic tests further indicate that the presented model is stable and hence reliable. The results of the study reveal that living standards in the US are likely to sky-rocket over the next decade, especially if the current economic policy stance is to be at least maintained. Indeed, America is being made great again!!!
O47|Where is Kenya being headed to? Empirical evidence from the Box-Jenkins ARIMA approach|Using annual time series data on GDP per capita in Kenya from 1960 to 2017, the study analyzes GDP per capita using the Box – Jenkins ARIMA technique. The diagnostic tests such as the ADF tests show that Kenyan GDP per capita data is I (2). Based on the AIC, the study presents the ARIMA (3, 2, 1) model. The diagnostic tests further show that the presented parsimonious model is stable and reliable. The results of the study indicate that living standards in Kenya will improve over the next decade, as long as the prudent macroeconomic management continues in Kenya. Indeed, Kenya’s economy is growing. The study offers 3 policy prescriptions in an effort to help policy makers in Kenya on how to promote and maintain the much needed growth.
O47|Is Nigeria's economy progressing or backsliding? Implications from ARIMA models|Using annual time series data on GDP per capita in Nigeria from 1960 to 2017, I model and forecast GDP per capita using the Box – Jenkins ARIMA technique. My diagnostic tests such as the ADF tests show that Nigerian GDP per capita data is I (1). Based on the AIC, the study presents the ARIMA (2, 1, 0) model. The diagnostic tests further reveal that the presented optimal model is stable and hence reliable. The results of the study indicate that living standards in Nigeria will tumble over the next decade, as long as the current economic policy stance is not reviewed. Indeed, Nigeria’s economy is backsliding again!!! In order to improve the living standards of an ordinary Nigerian, this study has put forward four-fold policy prescriptions.
O47|Terms of Trade Effects of Productivity Shocks and Economic Development|This paper studies the terms of trade effects from unexpected economy-specific productivity increases in both developing and advanced economies using a panel vector autoregression model with interactive fixed effects and the “max-share” approach developed by Francis et al. (2014). First, we find that the terms of trade of developing economies do not deteriorate after unexpected productivity increases and display similar dynamics to those of advanced economies. Second, studying these shocks in a more detailed classification of developing economies shows that the terms of trade worsen following an unexpected productivity increase in the least developed economies, implying that economic underdevelopment can result in unexpected productivity increases causing a deterioration in the terms of trade. However, this adverse effect of productivity increases disappears in the developing economies with some success in moving up the ladder of economic development, as implied by our finding that the terms of trade of these economies improve after an unexpected productivity increase.
O47|The Influence of Zakat on Economic Growth and Welfare Society in Indonesia|Indonesia as a one of the most significant Muslim population in the world has developed zakat rapidly; it is shown by the development of the zakat regulation and establishes of Badan Amil Zakat Nasional (BAZNAS). Zakat has many benefit for economic both of macro and micro aspect, such as foster inclusive economic growth. The objective of this study are 1) to examine the influence of zakat on economic growth and welfare society which uses 3 (three) indicators i.e.HDI, Percentage of Poor People, and GINI Index and 2) to investigate whether items of Theory Planned Behavior influence of zakat payment. The researcher used Structural Equation Model (SEM) with PLS software. The result showed that zakat in Indonesia does not influence economic growth and welfare society. Besides that, welfare society Indonesia as a developing country has a negative value to HDI and GINI index but has a positive value to Percentage of Poor People.
O47|Investment Constraints And Productivity Cycles In Bolivia|Bolivia has suffered from a series of investment constraints and negative productivity cycles in the last half-century. In this context, this article first presents suggestive empirical evidence that physical capital accumulation has been constrained by high volatility in investment per worker, low marginal product of capital, and high adjustment costs. Next, the article presents evidence about the cyclical behavior of Bolivia’s total factor productivity (TFP) during the 1980-2008 period. As expected, the cyclical dynamics of TFP are shaped by cyclical variables such as terms of trade and fluctuations in the real exchange. However, economic policy variables (such as macroeconomic stabilization and external debt management), institutional variables (such as democracy and civil rights) and initial conditions also appear to be significant when explaining the behavior of Bolivia’s TFP.
O47|Economic effects of inward foreign direct investment in Vietnamese provinces|This article examines the effect of FDI on economic growth and domestic investment with a focus on Vietnamese provinces by conducting the Granger causality and impulse response tests under a vector auto-regression (VAR) estimation using panel data. The major research questions in this study are twofold: whether the inward FDI causes economic growth or economic growth induces the FDI, and whether the inward FDI crowds in or crowds out domestic investment. Since this study targets Vietnamese provinces, it explores reginal differences in the FDI effect by dividing Vietnamese provinces according to FDI-value intensity. The VAR estimation results showed two clear contrasts on FDI effects between the FDI-intensive region and the FDI-less-intensive one. One contrast was that FDI causes economic growth in the FDI-intensive region, whereas economic growth induces FDI in the FDI-less-intensive region. Another contrast was that FDI crowds in domestic investment in the FDI-intensive region, whereas FDI crowds out domestic investment in the FDI-less-intensive region. These contrasts suggest the existence of FDI’s agglomeration effects.
O47|Innovation and Income Inequality: World Evidence|In this paper we explore the effect of innovation on income inequality using annual country panel data for 29 countries. We demonstrate that innovation activities reduce personal income inequality by matching patents from the European Patent Office with their inventors. Our findings are supported by instrumental variable estimations to tackle endogeneity. The results are also robust with respect to various inequality measures, alternative quality indexes of innovation, truncation bias, the use of patent applications together with granted patents and different ways to split or allocate patents.
O47|The Pollution Release and Transfer Register System in the U.S. and Japan: An Analysis of Productivity|This study analyzes productivity in the context of environmental regulations on the provision and dissemination of environmental information. Our study measures total factor productivity (TFP) by considering the emission of toxic chemical substances in the U.S. and Japan and the two countries’ corresponding policies. We apply the directional distance function to measure the Luenberger productivity indicator to estimate TFP. The data for U.S. and Japanese manufacturing firms include 386 firms over 1999 and 2007 and 466 firms over 2001 to 2008, respectively. This paper focuses on nine industries with highest pollution intensity: rubber and plastic, chemicals and allied products, paper and pulp, steel and non-ferrous metal, fabricated metal, industrial machinery, electric products, transportation equipment, and precision instruments. These nine sectors are categorized into two industry groups: the basic materials group and the processing and assembly group. The results show that productivity improved in all industrial sectors in the U.S. and Japan from 2001 to 2007. In particular, the electric product industry improved rapidly after 2002 for both countries. The enforcement of RoHS and the REACH directive in Europe might be one of the reasons for these increases. These stringent restrictions on toxic chemical substances give U.S. companies that export to the European market a strong incentive to treat their toxic chemical substances.
O47|Environmental Efficiency and Regional Convergence Clusters in Japan: A Nonparametric Density Approach|This paper studies environmental efficiency convergence across the prefectures of Japan over the 1992-2008 period. Using a novel nonparametric density estimation clustering framework, two alternative indicators of environmental efficiency are contrasted: a conventional indicator, based on the ratio of gross regional product to CO2 emissions, and a more comprehensive indicator, based on the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model. Results show, on the one hand, a lack of intra-distributional mobility and potentially a unique convergence cluster when using the more conventional indicator. On the other hand, large backward mobility and at least two convergence clusters are identified when using the DEA-based indicator of environmental efficiency. The paper concludes arguing the importance of accounting for production inputs, as they appear to be driving the formation of regional convergence clusters in Japan.
O47|Economic Growth and Poverty in Cameroon: the role of Employment|This study investigates empirically the effect of employment in the transmission of economic growth to poverty change in Cameroon. Using data covering the period 1991 to 2017. We estimate two models: the employment intensity of growth model of Kapsos; and the Loayza and Raddatz model, which assesses the impact of sectoral employment intensity of economic growth to the change in poverty. Analyses highlight two main results. First, economic growth positively affects employment and negatively affects poverty rates. Second, the transmission of economic growth through employment is not effective in reducing poverty in Cameroon. These results show that in recent decades, economic growth has propelled the creation of employment in Cameroon. However, these employments, which are mostly precarious, generated by the informal sector, have not significantly reduced poverty.
O47|Is South Africa the South Africa we all desire? Insights from the Box-Jenkins ARIMA approach|Using annual time series data on GDP per capita in South Africa from 1960 to 2017, the study investigates GDP per capita using the Box – Jenkins ARIMA technique. The diagnostic tests such as the ADF tests show that South African GDP per capita data is I (1). Based on the AIC, the study presents the ARIMA (0, 1, 1) model. The diagnostic tests further show that the presented parsimonious model is indeed stable and quite reliable. The results of the study indicate that living standards in South Africa may improve but very slowly over the next decade, unless prudent macroeconomic management practices are exercised. The paper offers 5 main policy prescriptions in an effort to help policy makers in South Africa on how to promote and maintain the much awaited growth and development.
O47|Institutional quality and economic development: Focus on the moroccan case|Over the last decades, the world economy has undergone profound changes, producing a heterogeneous trajectory in terms of growth rate and development dynamics. Economic studies that have looked into this issue have revealed that institutional quality has an undeniable role in economic development, to the extent that a country's explicit and implicit standards of behavior condition its economic performance. Thus, the initiation of a rapid process of economic catch-up requires the establishment of an institutional framework that takes into account the specificities of a society and explicit and implicit norms of behavior that condition economic behavior. This study is part of the same analysis and attempts to highlight institutional quality’s important role in explaining economic performance. The analysis was based on the exploitation of a set of databases, in order to determine the institutional variables that explain the level of development.
O47|Sectoral productivity Growth and Innovation Policies|This papers studies the sectoral differences in the impacts of various innovation policies, human capital and R&D intensity on the productivity growth using econometric panel data techniques. We analyze the development of the sectoral productivity as depending on both knowledge creation and knowledge adoption, where both channels of productivity growth can be influenced by various types of R&D related public policy. We use the combination of the most recent EU-KLEMS database and OECD data for econometric analysis on six aggregated sectors of the economy. In contrast with other existing studies our econometric analysis covers the whole of the economy and includes various traditional, industrial and services sectors. The main contribution of the paper is in highlighting the differences between economic sectors and identifying potential for sector-specific innovation policies.
O47|Modeling and forecasting Botswana's Growth Domestic Product (GDP) per capita|Using annual time series data on GDP per capita in Botswana from 1960 to 2017, the study analyzes GDP per capita using the Box – Jenkins ARIMA methodology. The diagnostic tests such as the ADF tests show that Botswana GDP per capita data is I (1). Based on the AIC, the study presents the ARIMA (3, 2, 3) model. The diagnostic tests further show that the presented model is not only stable but also suitable. The results of the study indicate that living standards in Botswana will definitely continue to improve over the next decade. Indeed, Botswana’s success story is a reality. The study offers 4 policy recommendations in an effort to help policy makers in Botswana on how to promote and maintain the much needed better living standards for all Batswana.
O47|On Trust Dynamics of Economic Growth|Trust among individuals in society may have various economic and social implications. Though, worldwide data on economic growth rarely consider trust as an ingredient in manipulating economic outcomes. Thus, we include trust instigating from individual, affecting community and state thus, forming trust-based economy. In order to explore the relationship of trust with growth and its benefits implications, this study suggests a model which is validated by Markov process. Consequently, results indicate significant impact of trust on economic growth by achieving convergence in very few iterations in the case of trust-based economy. On the other hand, economy with lowest trust level shows delayed convergence and takes around 4 times more iterations to attain equilibrium. Additionally, socio-economic benefits are more visible in a trust-based economy.
O47|Potential output, capital input and U.S. economic growth|The objective in this paper is to highlight the complex linkages of capital input to potential output in the U.S. nonfarm private business sector. For this purpose the analytical framework used by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is adapted and re-estimated using data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) over the period 1949-2016. By focusing on the changes in the composition of the capital stock in terms of structures, equipment and intangibles, average service lives, and the relative prices of producer’s to consumer’s goods, the paper allows for their influence on the capital input and traces the latter’s effects on the potential output. It is found that: (a) when the capital input is adjusted to reflect all aforementioned changes, the potential output decelerated in recent decades even faster than suggested by CBO’s estimates; (b) in the post-2007 period the shortfall in the estimated potential output widened relative to that computed by CBO, and (c) the faster deceleration of the potential output emanated from the declining share of structures in the capital stock and the spectacular decline in the prices of equipment relative to structures. Drawing on these findings it is concluded that, although the real economy may have overshoot its potential in the last few years, the forces that slow down potential output through changes in the capital input remain intact and, unless some remedial policies are instituted, they will continue to function as significant headwinds to U.S. economic growth, along with all others that are well known.
O47|Demand adjusted capital input and potential output in the context of U.S. economic growth|Two alternative measures of demand adjusted capital input for the U.S. non-farm private business sector are derived and their differential impacts on the potential supply of output are compared to those obtained using the unadjusted index of capital input published by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The results show that, allowing for the demand pressure on the fixed assets of firms, leads to three effects. It raises the level of estimated potential output well above CBO’s estimates; with the exception of the 1990s, the estimated growth rates turn out to be higher than those computed by CBO; and, lastly, the long term trend of the growth rates with and without the demand adjustment to the capital input is sloping downwards. The latter finding was not unexpected since aggregate demand, as reflected in the utilization rate of fixed assets by firms, has been trending downwards throughout the postwar period. Drawing on these findings it is concluded that the path to secular stagnation that the U.S. economy is following in the postwar period is not due solely to headwinds on the supply side. To some degree, perhaps significant, the deceleration in the expansion of productive capacity as well as in the intensity of its utilization is due to the declining long term aggregate demand.
O47|"Parameter variation in the ""log t"" convergence test"|"This paper estimates a local linear version of the model used in Phillips and Sul's (2007, 2009) ""log t"" convergence test. It documents the economically and statistically significant within-sample variation in the estimated value of the key parameter of that test when applied to data for 18 OECD countries during the 20th century. This variation suggests the substantial waxing and waning of the forces driving convergence, possibly due to low-frequency shocks and changes in the level economic integration."
O47|Entrepreneurship, Institutions, and Economic Growth: Does the Level of Development Matter?|This study questions the assumption that entrepreneurship unequivocally leads to economic growth. Using insights from institutional theory and development economics, we reevaluate entrepreneurship’s contribution towards economic growth. Our study uses Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) data for a panel of 83 countries from 2002 to 2014 and highlights several important findings. First, our evidence suggests that entrepreneurship encourages economic growth but not in developing countries. Second, we find that a country’s institutional environment—measured by GEM’s Entrepreneurial Framework Conditions (EFCs)—contributes to economic growth in more developed countries but not in developing countries. Lastly, we find that opportunity-motivated entrepreneurship encourages economic growth in developed countries, while necessity-motivated entrepreneurship discourages economic growth in developing countries. These findings have important policy implications. Namely, our evidence contradicts policy proposals that suggest entrepreneurship and the adoption of pro-market institutions that support it will encourage economic growth in developing countries. Our evidence suggests these policy proposals are unlikely to generate the desired economic growth.
O47|The Impact of Trade Openness, Foreign Direct Investment and Domestic Investment on Economic Growth: New Evidence from Asian Developing Countries|The objective of this paper is to examine the impact of openness, foreign investment inflows, and domestic investment on economic growth for the case of 24 Asian economies over the time span 2002-2017 through the use of the fixed and random effect models. Our empirical results pointed out that domestic investment positively influences economic growth. However, we found that foreign direct investment and exports are negatively affecting the growth path. Also, the population, imports, and final consumption expenditure have no real impact on economic growth. Due to the importance of the positive externalities linked to the trade openness and foreign direct investments inflow, in terms of technology transfer bias, financial capacities, human expertise, large markets size, and spillover effect added to the domestic capacities and the national investment, the pace of the phenomenal economic performance of the Asian economies is very well justified.
O47|The Relationship between Economic Growth, Exports and Imports in Morocco: An Empirical Validation Based on VAR Modeling Techniques and Causality in the Meaning of Granger|This paper analyzes the relationship between economic growth, export and import in Morocco. VAR modeling techniques and Granger causality are used in empirical work. The study showed a causal effect ranging from economic growth in exports. Evidence shows that economic growth favors exports. However, there is no effect that goes for export to growth. In addition, there is no relationship between imports and economic growth.
O47|Does Agricultural investment still promote economic growth in China? Empirical evidence from ARDL bounds testing model|One of the major unresolved research issues in agriculture is the question as to whether agricultural investments still a promoter of economic growth at the regional and local levels. The concern is not with the agricultural benefits, principally measured as food security, but whether there are additional development benefits from these investments. In this paper, we have developed a new approach to study the impact of agricultural investment on economic growth. By taking the case of China, this study is based on the Auto-Regressive Distributive Lags (ARDL) approach that is proposed by Pesaran et al (2002). The empirical estimate yields interesting results. In the short and long terms, agricultural investment has a positive effect on economic growth. The findings of this research have important implications for further policy designs that seek to maintain the agricultural sector in China in the future.
O47|Does Agricultural Trade promote Chinese economic growth? ARDL Approach|Since the beginning of the third millennium, the Chinese agricultural exports increase at a strong pace. In this context, this paper aims to answer the question if the agriculture trade promotes Chinese economic growth by employing the ARDL bounds testing for the study period from 1984 to 2017. In the long-run, our highlights reported that domestic investment and agricultural exports have a positive effect on economic growth. However, agricultural imports have a significant negative impact on growth. In the short-run, our insights reported a positive and significant effect of domestic investment, agricultural imports and agricultural exports on economic growth. The positive impact of agriculture exports on growth is due to the importance of agriculture in terms of creating jobs and opportunities for the economy as a whole. Also, sufficient national investment in the agriculture sector leads to enlarging these opportunities and then improves the Chinese economic growth.
O47|The Impact of Domestic and Foreign Direct Investment on Economic Growth: Fresh Evidence from Tunisia|This paper aims to analyze the impact of domestic investment and Foreign Direct Investment on economic growth in Tunisia during the period 1976–2017. This study is based on the Auto-Regressive Distributive Lags (ARDL) approach that is proposed by Pesaran et al (2001). Bound testing approaches to the analysis of level relationships. According to the results of the analysis, domestic investment and foreign direct investment have a negative effect on economic growth in the long run. However, in the short run, only domestic investment causes economic growth. The findings are important for Tunisian economic policy makers to undertake the effective policies that can promote and lead domestic and foreign investments to boost economic growth.

O47|Innovation and Economic Growth: Does Internet Matter?|We analyze the relationship between economic growth and innovation taking into consideration the importance of the internet. To do so, we use a panel ARDL model, with data on a sample of 76 developed and developing countries in different geographic regions for the 1995–2016 period. Our findings provide empirical evidence of the positive role of innovation and internet in economic growth and the positive role of economic growth and internet in innovation. From these results, we derive several basic policy conclusions.
O47|The human capital-economic growth nexus in SSA countries: What can strengthen the relationship?|The World Bank has recently placed increasing emphasis on the role of human capital development in facilitating economic development in the Sub-Saharan African (SSA) region. Our study examines the impact of human capital on economic growth for a selected sample of 9 SSA countries between 1980 and 2016 using a panel econometric approach. Interestingly enough, our empirical analysis shows an insignificant effect of human capital on economic growth for our selected sample. These findings remain unchanged even after adding interactive terms to human capital which are representative of government spending as well as foreign direct investment. Nevertheless, we establish a positive and significant effect of the interactive term between urbanization and human capital on economic growth, a result which emphasizes the importance of developing urbanized, ‘smart’, technologically-driven cities within the SSA region as a platform towards strengthening the impact of human capital- economic growth relationship.
O47|Domestic Investment, Export, Import and Economic Growth in Brazil: An Application of Vector Error Correction Model|This paper aims to investigate the nexus between domestic investment, exports, imports, and economic growth for the Brazilian economy during the period 1970-2017, using the VECM methodology. In the short-run, our empirical results pointed out that import, exports, and domestic investment cause economic growth. Also, economic growth causes exports. Exports, imports, and economic growth cause domestic investment. However, in the long-run, our results revealed that domestic investment and exports have a positive effect on economic growth. Also, imports have a negative effect on economic growth. The results recorded a positive impact of economic growth and imports on domestic investment. Exports have a negative effect on domestic investment. Finally, we record the absence of significant impact of economic growth, exports and domestic investment on imports, and economic growth, domestic investment, and imports on exports. Due to the importance of these aspects to the economic performance of Brazil, the policymakers are invited to orient these issues towards the sustainability facets to guarantee a sustained growth path.
O47|Sustainability of the transport sector during the last 20 years: evidences from a panel of 35 countries|Between 1990 and 2015, the annual global amount of CO 2 emission generated by transport has increased by 68%, from around 4.6 GtCO 2 to around 7.7 GtCO2. Technological advances towards eco friendly vehicles and policy incentives promoting environmental friendly modes of transport have thus been offset by economic growth and increasing mobility. This study questions the relationship between economic growth and sustainability performance of transport sector. It adds to the literature new insights concerning recent trends in the relationship between gross domestic product and various aspects of transport sustainability such as carbon footprint, carbon intensity and transport safety. A particular attention is given to discussing the emerging issues of “carbon inequality” and the role of political entities that contribute most to global CO2 emissions, such China, USA and the EU. Finally, this study adds to the literature a composite index of transport sustainability performance and explores between country inequalities in terms of sustainability performance.
O47|Does Domestic Investment Contribute to Economic Growth in Uruguay? What did the Empirical Facts Say?|The fundamental role of domestic investment to provide economic prosperity is very well recognized by the economic theory since the Mercantilist theory. Hence, we investigate the impact of domestic investment on economic growth for the case of the Uruguayan economy over the period 1960-2017. For this aim, we employ the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). Our highlights reveal the absence of a significant impact of domestic investment on growth in the short- and long-run. Due to the marginal role of domestic investment played in the Uruguayan economy, the weak saving rate couldn’t significantly help the economy and creating wealth. Therefore, a strong saving policy is required to encourage domestic investors and reevaluate their crucial role in the economic process of Uruguay.
O47|Domestic Investment, Export, Import and Economic Growth in Brazil: An Application of Vector Error Correction Model|This paper aims to investigate the nexus between domestic investment, exports, imports, and economic growth for the Brazilian economy during the period 1970-2017, using the VECM methodology. In the short-run, our empirical results pointed out that import, exports, and domestic investment cause economic growth. Also, economic growth causes exports. Exports, imports, and economic growth cause domestic investment. However, in the long-run, our results revealed that domestic investment and exports have a positive effect on economic growth. Also, imports have a negative effect on economic growth. The results recorded a positive impact of economic growth and imports on domestic investment. Exports have a negative effect on domestic investment. Finally, we record the absence of significant impact of economic growth, exports and domestic investment on imports, and economic growth, domestic investment, and imports on exports. Due to the importance of these aspects to the economic performance of Brazil, the policymakers are invited to orient these issues towards the sustainability facets to guarantee a sustained growth path.
O47|Natural disasters and economic growth in Africa|The continent of Africa has experienced its fair share of natural disasters historically and in contemporary times. The effect of natural disasters on economic growth has generated useful but inconclusive debates in the literature. Different studies have found positive, negative or no significant effects at all in some cases of disasters on growth. This makes the question of what impacts natural disasters have on an economy’s growth a purely empirical one and more meaningful to be examined on a case by case basis. Using panel data solely for the continent of Africa from 1980-2015, our regression results show a significant negative effect of natural disasters on economic growth, growth in agricultural value-added and growth in industrial value-added. Additionally, our results also show that disaster effect appears and persists in the post-year periods. The negative relationship between economic growth and disasters is also robust to different disaster measures. We recommend the need to invest in the modernization of the agricultural sector in Africa with the goal of withstanding the negative effects of natural disasters.
O47|Does Domestic Investment Contribute to Economic Growth in Uruguay?

Hence, we investigate the impact of domestic investment on economic growth for the case of the Uruguayan economy over the period 1960-2017. For this aim, we employ the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). Our highlights reveal the absence of a significant impact of domestic investment on growth in the short- and long-run. Due to the marginal role of domestic investment played in the Uruguayan economy, the weak saving rate couldn’t significantly help the economy and creating wealth. Therefore, a strong saving policy is required to encourage domestic investors and reevaluate their crucial role in the economic process of Uruguay.
O47|Are Uncertainties across the World Convergent?|We analyse the convergence of a news-based measure of uncertainty across 143 countries (spanning 99 percent of world GDP) over the quarterly period of 1996:01 to 2018:03. We apply a panel data-based unit root test, which controls for both nonlinearity and cross-sectional dependence, to the ratio of the uncertainty of individual countries relative to that of global uncertainty. We find overwhelming evidence of stationarity in 141 of the cross-sectional units, leading to a rejection of the null of a unit root for the entire panel. Our results provide strong evidence of convergence and hence, the spillover of uncertainty spillover across the economies of the world. Given this, policymakers need to be alert all the time to counteract the negative impact on the domestic economy in the wake of uncertainty increases around the world.
O47|A Reconsideration of Kuznets Curve across Countries: Evidence from the Co-summability Approach|This study re-examines the existence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between economic growth and income inequality using advanced time series techniques, which enable analyzing nonlinear long-run relationships among stochastic processes. Applying the concept of summability, balancedness, and co-summability on a sample of 55 countries from 1980 to 2010, we find no evidence in support of the nonlinear long-run relationship economic growth and income inequality.
O47|Regional fiscal equalization. A simultaneous equation approach to assess the economic effects of fiscal policy|Regional fiscal equalization in Germany aims to reduce fiscal disparities by allocating financial resources to less promising regions in order to support the supply of public goods. This paper aims to analyse secondary economic effects of regional fiscal equalization on several economic in- and output variables. Additionally, the paper examines the potential regional characteristics to influence the transformation of fiscal inputs into economic outcomes. Lastly, I compare the effects of fiscal equalization to these of the major German structural funding program GRW. My findings reveal a significant positive effect of fiscal equalization on the regional employment rate. Moreover, the findings suggest different transmission channels of fiscal equalization in East and West Germany. Particularly, I find higher effects in right-wing CDU/CSU preferring regions on the employment, human capital and private-sector investment rate. Finally, while structural funding affects more economic variables significantly, the magnitude of the estimated economic responses of fiscal equalization compared to these of German structural funding are not statistically different.
O47|Effects of R&D subsidies on regional economic dynamics: Evidence from Chinese provinces|We investigate the impact of research and development (R&D) subsidies on R&D inputs of large- and medium-sized firms and on additional innovation and economic activities in Chinese provinces. A panel vector autoregressive (VAR) model and corresponding impulse response function (IRF) analysis allow us to differentiate between direct and indirect effects, which add up to total effects. We find that an increase of R&D subsidies significantly decreases private R&D investments, although there is a significant positive effect on the R&D personnel employed in firms. We interpret these findings as a partial crowding-out effect because public funds substitute some private funds while total R&D inputs still increase. Complementarily, we find a positive secondary effect on the provincial patent activity, our measure of technological progress. Interestingly, we also find potentially unintended effects of R&D subsidies on increases in the investment rate in physical capital and residential buildings. Although R&D subsidies fail to incentivize private R&D expenditures, firms increase total R&D inputs, and provincial economies benefit from secondary effects on technological progress and capital deepening.
O47|Aggregate productivity and the allocation of resources over the business cycle|This paper proposes a novel decomposition of aggregate productivity to evaluate the role of allocative efficiency for the cyclical dynamics of aggregate productivity. The decomposition, which is derived from the aggregation of heterogeneous firm-level production functions, accounts for changes in allocative efficiency, as well as for changes in entry and exit. This approach thereby extends Solow's (1957) growth accounting exercise to a framework with firm heterogeneity and frictions in the allocation of resources across firms. I apply the decomposition to a comprehensive dataset of French manufacturing and service firms, and I find that entry and exit contribute little to the year-on-year variability of sectoral productivity, between-sector allocative efficiency plays a limited role for the volatility of aggregate productivity, whereas within-sector allocative efficiency is countercyclical and tends to reduce the volatility of sectoral productivity.

O47|Protección y productividad en la industria colombiana, 1993-2011|Este documento analiza la evolución de la productividad total factorial en la industria colombiana entre 1993 y 2011 haciendo uso de datos a nivel de firma. La determinación de la productividad total factorial es bastante importante debido a sus implicaciones en el crecimiento económico, la innovación y el nivel de ingresos del país. Una vez definida la evolución de la productividad to tal factorial se estudian sus determinantes. Fundamentalmente se consideran especificaciones que evalúan la importancia de la apertura económica y el nivel de concentración de la producción sobre los niveles de productividad. Los resultados muestran un estancamiento en la productividad factorial en la industria manufacturera del país y, además, se identifica una relación directa entre los niveles de incorporación de las firmas a los mercados internacionales y su nivel de productividad. **** ABSTRACT: This document analyzes the evolution of total factor productivity in Colombian industry between 1993 and 2011 using data at the firm level. The determination of total factor productivity is quite important because of its implications for economic growth, innovation and the income levels in the country. Once the evolution of total factor productivity is defined, its determinants are studied. Fundamentally, we considered specifications that evaluate the importance of the economic opening and the level of production concentration on productivity levels. The results show a stagnation in the productivity levels in the manufacturing industry of the country and, in addition, a direct relationship is identified between the firm’s integration levels to international markets and their productivity.
O47|Skill Biased Technical Change and Misallocation. A Unified Framework and a country-sector exercize|Due to strict reliance on perfectly competitive labor markets, standard approaches estimating skill biased technical change (SBTC) conflate ‘true’ SBTC and labor market distortions preventing firms from choosing the efficient skilled to unskilled labor ratio. To overcome this limit, we present a unified framework to estimate SBTC, net of factor accumulation (FA) effects, and quantify the discrepancy between skilled to unskilled marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS) and wage ratio (i.e., relative misallocation). The methodology takes advantage of recent developments in nonparametric estimation methods (i.e., generalized kernel regression) that allow us to estimate the marginal productivity of inputs at the country-sector level directly from country-sector data. Using 1995-2005 data, we find a 3% yearly growth rate for the MRTS between skilled and unskilled labor and show such change to be mostly driven by SBTC, rather than FA. We then show that MRTS changes does not match the evolution of the wage ratios (quite stable over time), thus yielding substantial heterogeneity in terms of relative misallocation patterns, for which we report a 6% increase, overall (1.5% in manufacturing, against a rough 12% in Non-Manufacturing sectors). Finally, we show evidence that relative misallocation increased less in country-sectors in which it was larger at the beginning of the period and grew more in country-sectors characterized by: higher skill-intensity; lower bargaining power of skilled over unskilled workers; lower FA effects.
O47|Productivity Panics – Polemics and Realities|Widespread uneasiness has emerged concerning a perceived slowdown in productivity growth. The question posed here is whether our destiny is indeed tied to inexorable movements in productivity and innovation, whatever these things may be, or can we build a future contingent upon collective choices and guided by human needs and desires?
O47|Econometric Analysis Of Competitiveness, Innovation And Trade Openness Of Western Balkan Countries|The level of trade openness plays a crucial role on boosting countries? competitiveness, innovation and productivity. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to empirically analyze the linkage of trade openness and competitiveness for Western Balkan countries covering the time period 2005-2017. The research method consists of a panel regression analysis by examining the static models for both fixed and random effects and using the Hausman test for deciding for the most appropriate model for the proposed sample countries. First, the gross competitiveness index is modelled as dependent variable on trade openness and a set of control variables such as: GDP per capita, gross fix capital formation, FDI, inflation and several interaction variables with trade openness. Second, innovation is taken as dependent variable whereas trade openness and the aforementioned indicators as independent variables. The empirical results of the fixed effects model suggest that trade openness positively affect competitiveness, as well as trade openness enhance innovation as in both models the coefficients of trade openness seem to be statistically significant and with positive signs. Regarding interaction variables between trade and FDI as well as trade and gross capital formation, it is confirmed that countries with higher level of FDI and higher physical capital benefit more from international trade, and in turn increase competitiveness. The findings of this research reveal important policy implications for Western Balkan countries, in terms of strengthening the mutual trade cooperation and joining the efforts for increasing even more their participation into the global market. It will imply extension of competitiveness and a range of paybacks, such that job creation, poverty alleviation and better standards of living of their citizens.
O47|Crime and Economic Growth: A Case Study of Manaus, Brazil|Due to economic and social advances since the 1990s, Brazil became the 7th largest economy in the world in 2012. However, crime rates have not stopped rising since the beginning of the last decade, with Brazil having the 11th largest homicide rate on the planet in that year (UN). In this paper we estimate how much crime harms economic activity from a case study of the city of Manaus, where in 2007 the organized crime group known as â€œFamÃ­lia do Norteâ€ was created. We analyzed the effects on Manausâ€™ GDP per capita using the synthetic control method. The comparison between Manaus and its synthetic control in the period after the creation of the criminal group showed that the presence of the criminal faction diminished the cityâ€™s GDP by 3% per year. Robustness checks confirmed this result, showing how organized crime can disrupt the countryâ€™s economic advances.
O47|Characterizing growth instability: new evidence on unit roots and structural breaks in long run time series|In this paper we investigate whether long run time series of income per capita are better described by a trend-stationary model with few structural changes or by unit root processes in which permanent stochastic shocks are responsible for the observed growth discontinuities. To this purpose, we develop a methodology to test the null of a generic I(1) process versus a set of stationary alternatives with structural breaks. Differently from other tests in the literature, the number of structural breaks under the alternative hypothesis is treated as an unknown (up to some ex ante determined maximum). Critical values are obtained via Monte Carlo simulations and finite sample size and power properties of the test are reported. An application is provided for a group of advanced and developing countries in the Maddison dataset, also using bootstrapped critical values. As compared to previous findings in the literature, less evidence is found against the unit root hypothesis. Failures to reject the I(1) null are particularly strong for a set of developing countries considered. Finally, even less rejections are found when relaxing the assumption of Gaussian shocks.
O47|Potential Effects of Scaling-up Infrastructure in Peru: a General Equilibrium Model-based Analysis|This study assesses the potential economic impacts of investments dedicated to filling infrastructure gaps in Peru. By using a national database at the firm level, we start by empirically estimating the positive externalities of Peruvian infrastructure on private activities’ output. In the second step, these estimates are introduced in a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium model used to conduct counterfactual simulations of various investment plans in infrastructure over a 15-year period. These simulations show to what extent scaling-up infrastructure could be a worthwhile strategy to achieve economic growth in Peru; however, they also show that these benefits depend on the choice of funding schemes related to such public spending.
O47|Agglomeration economies and firm-level labor misallocation|A large portion of the productivity differentials among locations is related to density. Firms located in denser areas are more productive (Combes et al., 2012a, Econometrica, 80: 2543–2594). We show in this article that resource misallocation is lower in denser areas and argue that misallocation plays an important role in explaining the observed productivity premium of large cities. Using a methodology proposed by Petrin and Sivadasan (2013, Review of Economics and Statistics, 95: 286–301), we firstly assess the degree of resource misallocation among firms within sectors for each of the 348 French Employment Areas (commuting zones). Based on firm-level productivity estimates, we identify in the gap between the values of the marginal product and marginal input price the degree of input allocation at the firm level. Over the whole period 1994–2007, the average gap at firm level is 9.5 thousand euros. Secondly, we show that firm misallocation is lower in denser employment zones, suggesting that matching mechanisms on the labor market contribute to the productivity premium of agglomerated locations.
O47|Employment Protection Legislation Impacts on Capital and Skills Composition|[eng] The article investigates the effects of Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) on capital and skills according to the intensity of international competition. Grounded on a panel data sample for 14 OECD countries and 18 industries from 1988 to 2007, and a difference-in-difference approach, we find that strengthening EPL: (i) leads to a capital-labour substitution in favour of non ICT non R&D capital to the detriment of employment, this effect being mitigated in industries highly exposed to international competition; (ii) lowers ICT capital and, even more severely, R&D capital relatively to other capital components; and (iii) works at the relative disadvantage of low-skilled workers. Strengthening EPL can therefore be an impediment to organizational and so technological change and risk taking on globalized markets. An illustrative simulation suggests that structural reforms weakening EPL could have a significant favorable impact on firms’ ICT and R&D investment and on hiring low-skilled workers.
O47|The volatility effect of diaspora's location|Remittances can transmit volatility from host to home countries for some common patterns of diaspora's geographical distribution. In a migration portfolio model, the overall risk of volatility of any set of diaspora location is decomposed into a contagion and a concentration risks: a diaspora located in more volatile destinations induces a higher contagion risk, while a diaspora located in few destination countries increases the concentration risk. A series of estimations on a large panel of developing countries over 1995–2015 provide evidence for these two risks. Estimation of a structural model confirms that the geography of diaspora has an indirect impact on the origin country's aggregate instability through remittances.
O47|Rent Creation And Rent Sharing: New Measures And Impacts On Total Factor Productivity|This analysis proposes new measures of rent creation and rent sharing and assesses their impact on productivity on cross‐country‐industry panel data. We find first that: (1) anticompetitive product market regulations positively affect rent creation and (2) employment protection legislation boosts hourly wages, particularly for low‐skill workers. However, we find no significant impact of this employment legislation on rent sharing, as the hourly wage increases are offset by a negative impact on hours worked. Second, using regulation indicators as instruments, we find that rent creation and rent sharing both have a substantial negative impact on total factor productivity.

O47|Beyond Miracle and Malaise: Social Capability in Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal during the Development Era 1930-1980|This paper investigates the outcome of the efforts to economically catch up during the so-called development era in French speaking West Africa. An attempt is made to measure and discuss key elements of social capability over the period 1930-1980 in Côte d'Ivoire and Senegal following Moses Abramovitz' interpretation of social capability. The paper distinguishes between four elements of social capability: degree of structural transformation, social and economic inclusion, the state's autonomy and its accountability. We find that there was significant but uneven progress in social capability in both countries during the development era. Despite their differences in economic performance both countries confronted fundamental shared challenges. Most notably, our analysis highlights how persistent lack of broad-based access to economic opportunities played a significant role in disrupting sustained economic and social progress in the two countries. This gives an opportunity to reflect on similarities and differences between the development era and the recent African growth phase.
O47|Income, Education and Democracy|This paper puts forth a unified theory of growth and polity in which economic development affects a country's polity and polity affects its development. Education crucially impacts both trajectories, first by moving resources out of the traditional sector and decreasing incomes of the landed class and second, by increasing the de facto power of the masses. An autocrat aligned with the landed class will try to retard education of its citizens but eventually will relinquish power when the transfers needed to prevent the masses from revolting become too large. At this point society democratizes and the economy's growth path is determined by the median voter. The model is calibrated to the economic and political histories of Britain from 1200-2000 and used to quantify the role of education, land inequality, constraints on the executive, and school curricula for the timing of modernization and democratization. The effects of these factors are found to be large, on the order of centuries. The paper also contributes to the empirical literature by showing that support for the modernization hypothesis based on System General Method of Moments estimation is more robust than previous research suggests and by showing that only primary education predicts democracy in this estimation method.
O47|Nonlinear Effects of Population Aging on Economic Growth?|Using panel data for 142 countries for the period from 1960 to 2014, we assess the effects of population aging on economic growth. We find that population aging proxied by old-age population share (or old-age dependency ratio) negatively affects economic growth only when it reaches a certain high level and its negative effects grow stronger as population aging deepens. We also find that population aging has hampered economic growth during more recent years, especially in more aged countries which are mostly developed countries. This nonlinear effect of aging is mainly driven by the fact that we use old-age population share as a proxy for aging. If we use lower working-age population share as a proxy for aging, the nonlinear relationship disappears: working-age population share is positively related to economic growth in a linear way.
O47|Long-term Trends in Gross Domestic Expenditure in Indonesia: Provisional Estimates|This paper seeks to overcome the fact that historical estimates of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Indonesia are currently only available in constant prices. Using the expenditure approach it offers new estimates of Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE), the equivalent of GDP, in current prices. The paper anchors the estimates on Indonesia’s Input-Output (I-O) Tables available for benchmark years between 1969 and 2010, which reveal that until 1995 Indonesia’s official national accounts underestimated GDP and GDE. The paper combines corrections based on the I-O Tables with additional sources to present provisional new estimates of GDE in current prices for 1870-1941 and 1948-1995. It then analyses the composition of GDE, noting the generally modest proportions of discretionary public expenditure and capital formation, particularly during 1870-1913 and 1948-1966.
O47|Bright Investments: Measuring the Impact of Transport Infrastructure Using Luminosity Data in Haiti|This paper quantifies the impacts of transport infrastructure investments on economic activity in Haiti, using satellite night-light luminosity as a proxy measure. Our identification strategy exploits the differential timing of rehabilitation projects across various road segments of the primary road network. We combine multiple sources of non-traditional data and carefully address concerns related to unobserved heterogeneity. The results obtained across multiple specifications consistently indicate that receiving a road rehabilitation project leads to an increase in luminosity values of between 6% and 26% at the communal section level. Taking into account the national level elasticity between luminosity values and GDP, we approximate that these interventions translate into communal section-GDP increases of between 0.5% and 2.1%, for communal sections benefited by a transport infrastructure project. We observe temporal and spatial variation in results, and crucially that the larger impacts appear once projects are completed and are concentrated within 2 km buffers around the intervened roads. Neither the richest or the poorest communities reap the benefits from road improvements, with gains accruing to those in the middle of the ranking of communal sections, based on unsatisfied basic needs. Our findings provide novel evidence on the role of transport investments in promoting economic activity in developing countries.
O47|Indian growth is not overestimated: Mr. Subramanian you got it wrong|Subramanian (2019) argues that indicators like growth in export, import and private credit can be used to predict economic growth across countries. He finds these indicators were able to predict Indian growth before 2011 but fail to do so after the GDP estimation methodology was changed in 2011. This implies Indian growth was overestimated by 2.5 per annum post 2011. But on removing various flaws in his data and procedures used, we find these indicators underestimate growth before 2011 too. The most reasonable specification suggests that the underestimation before 2011 was higher than underestimation post 2011. Moreover, growth in a large number of countries is found to be either overestimated or underestimated, based on these indicators. His empirical design is therefore flawed. These regressions cannot be used for predicting growth or for concluding Indian growth is overestimated or for pointing to problems in the estimation methodology.
O47|Re-examining the debt-growth nexus: A grouped fixed-effect approach|This paper uses panel data for 116 countries over the period 1995-2016 to investigate the heterogeneity of the debt-growth nexus across countries and the factors underlying it. In the first step, the grouped fixed effects (GFE) estimator proposed by Bonhomme and Manresa (2015) is used to classify countries into groups, with group membership being endogenously determined. In the second step, a multinomial logit model is used to explore the drivers of the heterogeneity detected, among them the quality of institutions, the composition of debt-funded public expenditure, the relative public and private indebtedness, and the maturity of debt. Finally, the underlying factors explaining the time-varying impact of public debt on growth in the country groups identified is also investigated.
O47|Cross-country Evidence on the Determinants of Inclusive Growth Episodes|Widening income disparities and slow productivity growth in most advanced, and several emerging-market, economies have rekindled interest in the empirical analysis of the determinants of inclusive growth, defined in this paper as episodes of increases in GDP per capita without a concomitant deterioration in the distribution of household disposable income.The empirical analysis is based on a chronology of inclusive growth episodes between 1980 and 2013 for a sample of 78 countries.Logit and multinomial probit estimations show that human capital accumulation, the redistributive potential of tax-benefit systems, increases in multifactor productivity and labor force participation, as well as trade openness and a range of institutional factors, including political system durability and electoral regimes, are important determinants of the probability of occurrence of inclusive growth. This empirical evidence contributes to the policy debate about how countries can deal with efficiency-equity trade-offs.
O47|Monetary Policy, Growth and Employment in Developing Areas: A Review of the Literature|"In this paper we review the literature on the impact that monetary policy has on growth and employment in developing countries. Much of the literature focusses on the impact of monetary policy on inflation levels and inflation volatility, and sometimes on output (GDP) levels and volatility of output. This survey of the literature on Monetary policy and growth shows that money plays a small role in developing countries and that monetary policy is not a very important influence on growth but may have some impact on inflation. Although there is much discussion about the merits of keeping inflation levels and volatility low, there is very little literature on studying the impact of low rates of steady inflation on the levels of private investment and technological change and hence on economic growth and on employment. There is very little research about the direct links between monetary policy and employment. The impact of growth on employment depends on what are the main drivers of economic growth and the initial state of the economy. Although growth may lead to increasing employment (formal and informal) there is little evidence showing that growth leads to an increase in ""decent employment""."
O47|The race against the robots and the fallacy of the giant cheesecake: Immediate and imagined impacts of artificial intelligence|After a number of AI-winters, AI is back with a boom. There are concerns that it will disrupt society. The immediate concern is whether labor can win a `race against the robots' and the longer-term concern is whether an artificial general intelligence (super-intelligence) can be controlled. This paper describes the nature and context of these concerns, reviews the current state of the empirical and theoretical literature in economics on the impact of AI on jobs and inequality, and discusses the challenge of AI arms races. It is concluded that despite the media hype neither massive jobs losses nor a `Singularity' are imminent. In part, this is because current AI, based on deep learning, is expensive and dificult for (especially small) businesses to adopt, can create new jobs, and is an unlikely route to the invention of a super-intelligence. Even though AI is unlikely to have either utopian or apocalyptic impacts, it will challenge economists in coming years. The challenges include regulation of data and algorithms; the (mis-) measurement of value added; market failures, anti-competitive behaviour and abuse of market power; surveillance, censorship, cybercrime; labor market discrimination, declining job quality; and AI in emerging economies.
O47|Human Capital and the Economic Convergence Mechanism: Evidence from China|"We examine the mechanism by which human capital affects economic growth and convergence, using provincial level panel data from China. We specify alternative measures of human capital and apply them to an enhanced growth model which we estimate parametrically, nonparametrically, and with a threshold model. Our results show that economic convergence is pronouncedly conditional on human capital across all our measures of human capital. The positive ""benefit of being backward"" due to lower initial income is almost trumped by the negative impact of low levels of human capital among the poorest areas."
O47|Accumulation of Human and Market Capital in the United States, 1975-2012: An Analysis by Gender|This paper covers a continuous and longer time period than previously possible to examine human and market capital because of research by Christian (2017). This paper focuses on the presentation and analysis of trends in human capital by gender. During 1975-2012 there were significant changes in participation by women, the wage gender gap, and educational attainment and time in household production by both women and men. Both the market and nonmarket sectors will be covered as well as multifactor productivity with and without human capital. (A previous paper (Fraumeni, et al. 2017) described the national income accounting system which underlies both this paper and the much earlier paper by Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989).) New insights will be gained by looking in detail at the 1975-2012 time period.
O47|Labor Productivity during the Great Depression in UK Manufacturing|This paper provides estimates of labor productivity for one-third of UK manufacturing during the Great Depression. It covers engineering and allied industries, and metal working industries. A unique data set of actual hours of work is combined with comparable real output and employment statistics. It establishes that output per worker-hour was countercyclical in the 1929-1932 peak-to-trough years of the Depression. This result has also been found for US manufacturing over the same period. Working time is found to play a crucial role the UK productivity response. Countercyclical productivity is discussed in terms of (i) the strong final output and consumer price deflations of 1929 to 1934, (ii) an absence of significant labor hoarding, and (c) diminishing returns to long weekly hours of work.
O47|The Decline in Entrepreneurship in the West: Is Complexity Ossifying the Economy?|Entrepreneurship in most advanced economies is in decline. This comes as a surprise: many scholars have expected an upsurge in entrepreneurship. What are the reasons for the decline? In this paper I first document the extent of the decline in terms of entrepreneurial entry rates; the share of young and small firms; and in terms of labor market mobility and in innovativeness. I then critically discuss the explanations that have been offered in the literature, which variously ascribes the decline to either the slowing of population growth, and/or growing market concentration, zombie-firm congestion, slower diffusion of knowledge, and burdensome business regulations. While having merit, these explanations tend to take a supply-side view and moreover fail to explain why the decline in entrepreneurship is largely confined to economies with high levels of economic complexity. I argue that we need to consider the potential of negative scale effects and evolutionary pressures from rising complexity, as well as long-run changes in aggregate demand and energy costs. Whether the decline in entrepreneurship and the ossification of the economy is undesirable, is a point for debate, calling for more research and more attention to entrepreneurship in growth theories.
O47|Experimental Economics and the New Commodities Problem|Brynjolfsson, Collis, Diewert, Eggers and Fox (2018) have used experimental economics to measure the welfare benefits of free commodities. In this paper, their methodological approach is adapted to measuring the benefits of new commodities which may or may not be free. Their approach leads to a new method for estimating Hicksian reservation prices. The new methodology in the present paper requires experimental estimates for household willingness to pay for new commodities or estimates for the compensation required for households to give up their use of a new commodity.

O47|R&D, innovation and productivity|This paper reviews various technological indicators from innovation inputs to innovation outputs, pointing out their strengths and weaknesses and the consequent caution that is in order when using these data for economic analysis. It briefly explains the theoretical link between innovation and productivity growth and then compares the estimated magnitudes of that relationship using the different innovation indicators.
O47|Can we have growth when population is stagnant? Testing linear growth rate formulas and their cross-unit cointegration of non-scale endogenous growth models|We sub-divide scale-invariant fully or semi-endogenous growth models into six sub-categories for formulas relating steady-state growth rates of income per capita and the growth rate of the population depending on the properties of slopes and intercepts. We capture their steady-state relation by a long-term relation in panel vector-error-correction models for 16 countries, and estimate the 16 models simultaneously allowing successively for more heterogeneity. The slope and intercepts of the growth equations are positive in this setting under slope homogeneity but less significant or even negative when allowing for heterogeneity. Slopes are mostly non-positive. Intercepts are positive for a large majority of countries. Results therefore favour fully over semi-endogenous growth with and without slope homogeneity and allow for growth rate policies. The more frequent case is that long-run growth can remain positive if population stops growing. Analysis of cross-unit cointegration suggests that long-run results are internationally connected.
O47|No evidence of an oil curse: Natural resource abundance, capital formation and productivity|This chapter examines the relationship between labour productivity, capital formation, and natural resource extraction in countries with natural resource reserves. We develop a theoretical two-sector model for a closed economy that maximises consumption over time, and examine how the control variables - natural resource extraction and the savings rate - determine fixed capital investment. We find that in a closed economy, the overall labour productivity is a positive function of capital investment per labour. That is in turn related to the externally given natural resource price, natural resource reserves and the resource extraction ratio. High natural resource prices and extraction rates provide opportunities to increase the overall investment in fixed capital and thus boost the labour productivity. We empirically test this model for oil as a natural resource. The data covers 36 years from 1980 to 2015 and includes 149 countries. 85 of these countries possessed commercially recoverable oil reserves in at least a part of the time period covered. We are able to exploit the panel and carry out the estimation using two-way fixed effects. We observe that oil price has an overall positive impact on labour productivity growth in the modern sector. The savings rate and schooling are positively correlated to labour productivity growth as well as fixed capital formation per capita. We find that the oil sector variables - oil reserves and oil extraction ratio - do not contribute to labour productivity growth directly, rather through increased capital formation per capita.
O47|Characterizing growth instability: new evidence on unit roots and structural breaks in long run time series|In this paper we investigate whether long run time series of income per capita are better described by a trend-stationary model with few structural changes or by unit root processes in which permanent stochastic shocks are responsible for the observed growth discontinuities. To this purpose, we develop a methodology to test the null of a generic I(1) process versus a set of stationary alternatives with structural breaks. Differently from other tests in the literature, the number of structural breaks under the alternative hypothesis is treated as an unknown (up to some ex ante determined maximum). Critical values are obtained via Monte Carlo simulations and finite sample size and power properties of the test are reported. An application is provided for a group of advanced and developing countries in the Maddison dataset, also using bootstrapped critical values. As compared to previous findings in the literature, less evidence is found against the unit root hypothesis. Failures to reject the I(1) null are particularly strong for a set of developing countries considered. Finally, even less rejections are found when relaxing the assumption of Gaussian shocks.
O47|Imported intermediates, technological capabilities and exports: Evidence from Brazilian firm-level data|This paper explores how technological capabilities influence the relationship between imported inputs and the export performance of firms. We apply threshold regression techniques to a representative dataset of Brazilian firms and find a strong positive influence of innovation skills on the relationship between imported intermediates and export revenues. We further find that the complementarities between importing and exporting are stronger for firms that export products with a higher scope for quality differentiation. We also observe that technological capabilities are directly correlated with export performance, confirming the view that innovation positively influences firms' international competitiveness. This relationship is not found to be significant for firms that export products with a low scope for quality differentiation and that export to lower income non-OECD markets. Overall, our results suggest that technological capabilities and the quality of imported inputs not only benefit firms directly but also complement each other in enhancing export competitiveness.
O47|Japan's productivity and GDP growth: The role of GBAORD, public and foreign R&D|We analyse the dynamic interaction of Japan's total factor productivity (TFP), GDP, domestic and foreign private and public R&D as well as mission-oriented R&D, GBAORD, in a cointegrated VAR for Japan with data from 1988-2014. Analysis of effects of permanent shocks shows that (i) public R&D, unlike GBAORD, encourages private R&D and TFP, and has high internal rates of return. (ii) Japan's public and private R&D have a statistically significant positive effect on foreign private and public R&D stocks and vice versa. (iii) After transitory GDP shocks, public and private R&D are counter-cyclical and GBAORD is pro-cyclical in Japan.
O47|The decline in entrepreneurship in the West: Is complexity ossifying the economy?|Entrepreneurship in most advanced economies is in decline. This comes as a surprise: many scholars have expected an upsurge in entrepreneurship. What are the reasons for the decline? In this paper I first document the extent of the decline in terms of entrepreneurial entry rates; the share of young and small firms; and in terms of labor market mobility and in innovativeness. I then critically discuss the explanations that have been offered in the literature: slow population growth, market concentration, zombie-firm congestion, slower diffusion of knowledge, and burdensome business regulations. While having merit, these explanations are largely supply-side oriented and moreover fail to explain why the decline in entrepreneurship is associated with high levels of economic complexity. I argue that we need to consider the potential of negative scale effects and evolutionary pressures from rising complexity, as well as long-run changes in aggregate demand and energy costs. Whether the decline in entrepreneurship and the ossification of the economy is undesirable, is a point for debate, calling for more research and more attention to entrepreneurship in growth theories.
O47|Dynamic Productivity Decomposition with Allocative Efficiency|We propose a novel approach to decomposing aggregate productivity growth into changes in technical efficiency, allocative efficiency, and variety of goods as well as relative efficiency of entrants and exiters. We measure technical efficiency by the aggregate production possibility frontier and allocative efficiency by the distance from the frontier. Applying our approach to establishment- and firm-level datasets from Japan, we find that the allocative efficiency among survivors declined during the banking crisis period, while the technical efficiency declined during the Global Financial Crisis period. Furthermore, we find that both entrants and exiters were likely to be more efficient than survivors.
O47|Identifying Sri Lanka’s Sources of Growth: The Application of Primal and Dual Total Factor Productivity Growth Accounting Approaches|This study aims to identify how much of economic growth is driven by improvement in Total Factor Productivity (TFP) in Sri Lanka, a small open economy, in comparison to other Asian economies. To examine this, aggregate TFP growth was calculated for Sri Lanka by using both primal and dual growth accounting frameworks. The study covers the period 1980-2016 and eight sub-periods, classified according to distinctive socio-economic-politico changes. For the whole period, TFP growth accounts for 45 percent of the total output growth. The annual average TFP growth rates under the primal and dual approaches are 2.3 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively. Though the growth accounting framework has limitations, the results were robust enough to draw comparative conclusions with those of other Asian countries. Sri Lanka’s TFP growth under both methods has been positive and higher than some Asian countries, except for China. Further, though Indonesia and Sri Lanka have similar per capita GDP levels, Sri Lanka’s TFP growth has been higher than that of Indonesia. Additionally, we show that the two growth drivers in Sri Lanka have been capital accumulation and productivity growth.
O47|Regional resilience in China: The response of the provinces to the growth slowdown|Since 2007 China’s real GDP growth rate has slowed from a level of over 10% per annum to below 7%. Given China’s regional diversity, an important aspect of the slowdown is the possible spatial variation in its experience. This is the issue we consider in this paper and we analyse this question in the context of the regional economic resilience framework. We proceed in two stages. In the first we analyse a measure of provincial slowdown (a sensitivity index) based just on growth rates and use cross-section regressions to investigate the determinants of this index, using a range of provincial characteristics common in the resilience literature. We find that economic structure, demographic factors and education all play a role, although with signs that are often at odds with the existing literature. In the second stage we decompose regional growth rates into national and province-specific components using a VAR model and argue that since resilience concerns the response of provinces to a national shock, it is properly analysed using just the national component of the growth rate rather than the growth rate as such. We therefore analyse a sensitivity index based just on the national component of growth and find many differences between the two sets of results. Using the second index matters for the determinants which are significant as well as for the magnitude of their coefficients. It appears that some of the influences found to be significant in the first stage are there only because of their influence on growth via the province-specific component of the growth rate and in this sense are spurious.
O47|Moving Into the Slow Lane|Growth in much of CESEE will remain healthy by post-crisis standards, but has passed its peak. We expect most economies to slow from here, reflecting weaker external demand and domestic capacity constraints. Global trade tensions, structural weakness in the eurozone and Brexit all pose downside risks to our forecasts.
O47|Is the UK Productivity Slowdown Unprecedented?|We estimate trend UK labour productivity growth using a Hodrick-Prescott filter method. We use the results to compare downturns where the economy fell below its pre-existing trend. We find that the current productivity slowdown has resulted in productivity being 19.7% below the pre-2008 trend path in 2018. This is nearly double the previous worst productivity shortfall ten years after the start of a downturn. On this criterion the slowdown is unprecedented in the last 250 years. We conjecture that this reflects a combination of adverse circumstances, namely, a financial crisis, a weakening impact of ICT and impending Brexit.
O47|The Sources of British Economic Growth since the Industrial Revolution: Not the Same Old Story|This paper updates the classic growth accounting research of the early 1980s taking account of improved data that has subsequently become available. The picture of long-run growth which results from incorporating many revisions is considerably different. The long-run path of productivity growth is now that of a roller-coaster with twin peaks in the third quarters of the 19th and 20th centuries rather than a U-shape. Productivity growth appears to have been very slow to accelerate in the Industrial Revolution, the notion of an Edwardian climacteric is not persuasive and the current productivity slowdown stands out as unprecedented.
O47|The Pre-1914 UK Productivity Slowdown: A Reappraisal|This paper re-examines UK productivity growth in the decades before World War I using a new dataset compiled by Thomas and Dimsdale (2017). We find that the productivity slowdown of the early 20th century was quite modest and does not deserve to be called a climacteric. A more serious slowdown in labour productivity growth occurred in the 1870s. Neither of these episodes should be regarded as a precedent for the current severe deterioration in UK productivity performance. Nor should a late-Victorian productivity slowdown be attributed to the end of the steam age despite the popularity of this belief
O47|Inflation Anchoring, Real Borrowing Costs, and Growth: Evidence from Sectoral Data|Central bankers often assert that anchoring of inflation expectations and reducing inflation uncertainty are good for economic outcomes. We test this claim and search for a relevant channel using panel data on sectoral growth for 22 manufacturing industries from 36 advanced and emerging market economies over the period 1990-2014. Our difference-in-difference strategy is based on the theoretical prediction that inflation uncertainty has larger effects in industries that are more credit constrained by increasing effective real borrowing costs. The results show that industries characterized by high external financial dependence, low asset tangibility, and high R&D intensity tend to grow faster in countries with well-anchored inflation expectations. The results are robust to controlling for the interaction between these characteristics and a broad set of macroeconomic variables over the sample period, including the level of inflation and output volatility. The results are also robust to IV techniques, using indicators of monetary policy transparency and independence as instruments.
O47|“Re-examining the debt-growth nexus: A grouped fixed-effect approach”|This paper uses panel data for 116 countries over the period 1995-2016 to investigate the heterogeneity of the debt-growth nexus across countries and the factors underlying it. In the first step, the grouped fixed effects (GFE) estimator proposed by Bonhomme and Manresa (2015) is used to classify countries into groups, with group membership being endogenously determined. In the second step, a multinomial logit model is used to explore the drivers of the heterogeneity detected, among them the quality of institutions, the composition of debt-funded public expenditure, the relative public and private indebtedness, and the maturity of debt. Finally, the underlying factors explaining the time-varying impact of public debt on growth in the country groups identified is also investigated.
O47|The population question in a neoclassical growth model: A brief theory of production per capita|"This work seeks to answer the ""population question,"" i.e. the effect of population growth on production per capita. This question has lingered in economic thought for centuries and to this day two general lines of thought can be identified, which might be marked as the ""optimist"" and the ""pessimist"" view. While the optimists claim that an increase in population will - chiefly owed to concomitant specialization and technological progress - raise average production per capita, the pessimists maintain that the latter would decline as a result of resources becoming relatively more scarce. Integrating both approaches and using a neoclassical framework, this work intends to show that sustainably increasing productivity is predominantly the result of reducing too high fertility toward a lower level such that diminishing returns are outweighed by the benefits from labor division. The paper argues that the historical reduction of fertility can almost completely explain long-run development."
O47|The long-term effect of migration on economic inequality between EU Member States|This paper explores the long-term effect of migration on economic inequality between the 28 EU member states, covering the period 1995-2017. The cross-national, longitudinal analysis demonstrates that migration has had a positive and significant effect on development and economic growth in 28 member states. However, the findings also indicate that some countries have benefitted from migration more than others. Specifically, for countries experiencing positive net migration the effect is disproportionately larger than for countries experiencing negative net migration. This seems to indicate that, while migration has indeed contributed to economic development in all member states over the period analysed, it has not necessarily contributed to decreasing economic inequalities between them.
O47|Is Favoritism a Threat to Chinese Aid Effectiveness? A Subnational Analysis of Chinese Development Projects|Chinese aid comes with few strings attached, allowing recipient country leaders to use it for domestic political purposes. The vulnerability of Chinese aid to political capture has prompted speculation that it may be economically ineffective, or even harmful. We test these claims by estimating the effect of Chinese aid on subnational economic development - as measured by per-capita nighttime light emissions - and whether this effect is different in politically favored jurisdictions than in other parts of the country. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, we do not find that the local receipt of Chinese aid undermines economic development outcomes at either the district level or provincial level. Nor does political favoritism in the allocation of Chinese aid towards the home regions of recipient country leaders reduce its effectiveness. Our results -from 709 provinces and 5,835 districts within 47 African countries from 2001-2012 - demonstrate that Chinese aid improves local development outcomes, regardless of whether such aid is allocated to politically consequential jurisdictions.
O47|Investment, Autonomous Demand and Long Run Capacity Utilization: An Empirical Test for the Euro Area|This paper reviews and empirically tests the validity and policy conclusions of the Sraffian Supermultiplier model (SSM) and the modified Neo-Kaleckian model after the inclusion of autonomous components of aggregate demand. First, we theoretically assess whether the SSM may constitute a complex variant of the Neo-Kaleckian model. In this sense, it is shown that results compatible with the SSM can be obtained by implementing a set of mechanisms in a modified Neo-Kaleckian model. Second, the paper empirically tests the main implications of the models in the Euro Area, based on Eurostat data. In particular, the discussion outlines the short and long-run relation between autonomous demand and output, by testing cointegration and causality with a VECM model. Moreover, the role accounted by both theories to the rate of capacity utilization is empirically assessed, through a time-series estimation of the Sraffian and Neo-Kaleckian investment functions. While confirming the theoretical relation between autonomous demand and output in the long run, the results show that capacity utilization still plays a key role in the short-run adjustment mechanism. Therefore, admitting that Keynesian results may hold even after the traverse, our work suggests to be Kaleckian in the short run and Sraffian in the long run.
O47|Technological change, energy, environment and economic growth in Japan|A considerable amount of research has shown that that carbon tax combined with research subsidy may be regarded as an optimal policy in view of diffusing low carbon technologies for the benefit of the society. The paper exploits the macro economic approach of the endogenous growth models with technological change for a comparative assessment of these policy measures on the economic growth in the US and Japan in the medium and the long run. The results of our micro estimates reveal several important differences across the Japanese and US energy firms: lower elasticity of innovation production function in R&D expenditure, lower probability of a radical innovation, and larger advances of dirty technologies in Japan. This may explain our quantitative findings of stronger reliance on carbon tax than on research subsidies in Japan relative to the US.

O47|Revisiting Intangible Capital and Labour Productivity Growth, 2000-2015: Accounting for the Crisis and Economic Recovery in the EU|This paper aims to revisit the relationship between intangible capital and labour productivity growth using the largest, up-to-date macro database (2000-2015) available to corroborate the econometric findings of earlier work and to generate novel econometric evidence by accounting for times of crisis (2008-2013) and economic recovery (2014-2015). To achieve these aims, this paper employs a cross-country growth accounting econometric estimation approach using the largest, up-to-date database available encompassing 16 EU countries over the time-period 2000- 2015. The paper accounts for times of crisis (2008-2013) and of economic recovery (2014-2015). It separately estimates the contribution of three distinct dimensions of intangible capital: i) computerized information, ii) innovative property and iii) economic competencies. First, when accounting for intangibles, the paper finds that these have become the dominant source of labour productivity growth in the EU, explaining 56 percent of growth. Second, when accounting for times of crisis (2008-2013), in contrast to tangible capital, the paper detects a solid positive relationship between intangibles and labour productivity growth. Third, when accounting for the economic recovery (2014-2015), the paper finds a highly significant and remarkably strong relationship between intangible capital and labour productivity growth. This paper corroborates the importance of intangibles for labour productivity growth and thereby underlines the necessity to incorporate intangibles into today's national accounting frameworks in order to correctly depict the levels of capital investment being made in European economies. These levels are significantly higher than is currently reflected in official statistics.
O47|The fundamental causes of economic growth: a comparative analysis of the total factor productivity growth of European agriculture, 1950-2005|In recent decades, the debate on economic growth has largely focused the role-played by institutions, geography, trade, and culture. In line with this concern, this study analyses the underlying causes of agricultural productivity growth in Europe in the second half of the twentieth century. To achieve this objective, a calculation of the Total Factor Productivity growth in European agriculture is made and an econometric model is proposed to determine the importance of these fundamental causes. Our study highlights that inclusive institutions, policies to support agriculture that do not discourage innovation, qualified human capital and a full openness to international trade are key factors for favouring growth of productivity in agriculture.
O47|Publish and Perish: Creative Destruction and Macroeconomic Theory|A number of macroeconomic theories, very popular in the 1980s, seem to have completely disappeared and been replaced by the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) approach. We will argue that this replacement is due to a tacit agreement on a number of assumptions, previously seen as mutually exclusive, and not due to a settlement by ‘nature’. As opposed to econometrics and microeconomics and despite massive progress in the access to data and the use of statistical software, macroeconomic theory appears not to be a cumulative science so far. Observational equivalence of different models and the problem of identification of parameters of the models persist as will be highlighted by examining two examples: one in growth theory and a second in testing inflation persistence.
O47|Demand and Supply-side Drivers of Labour Productivity Growth: an empirical assessment for G7 countries|The recent slowdown in labour productivity growth experienced in advanced economies is generally considered one of the main causes of the current phase of economic stagnation. This has led scholars to carry out a number of theoretical and empirical studies to identify the long-run determinants of productivity growth. The present work aims to fall within this debate, with a peculiar focus on the relevance of the Kaldor-Verdoorn law. To this purpose, we empirically investigate on the determinants of labour productivity growth both for the total economy and for the manufacturing sector, comparing the role played by demand- and supply-side factors. A Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) model is estimated for G7 countries from 1970 to 2017. Although the analyses confirm the positive role of supply-side factors in fostering productivity growth, our findings generally validate also the relevance of demand-side factors. Additionally, the positive effect generated by demand factors on labour productivity growth suggests that supply-side measures would be not sufficient to enhance productivity. Our findings suggest that demand-side policies are likely to foster productivity by also stimulating supply-side factors, particularly in the manufacturing sector of the economy.
O47|The Productivity Slowdown in Canada: an ICT Phenomenon?|We ask whether a weaker contribution of information and communication technologies (ICT) to productivity growth could account for the productivity slowdown observed in Canada since the early 2000s. To answer this question, we consider several models which capture channels by which ICT could affect productivity growth. Our results indicate that ICT continues to contribute to productivity growth, but that this contribution has declined and consequently accounts for part of the productivity growth slowdown. However, the productivity slowdown and the change in the contribution of ICT do not seem to have the same timing. While productivity growth slowed in the early 2000s, the ICT contribution does not appear to have fallen until around the Great Recession. This prompts the conclusion that while ICT had little to no role in the initial productivity slowdown, it has been a major determinant of the subdued productivity growth since 2007-2009.
O47|Zombie firms in Italy: a critical assessment|This note shows the consequences of different methodological choices for the estimates of the incidence of zombie firms in Italy. We use as a benchmark the influential measure proposed by the OECD (Adalet McGowan et al. 2017a and 2017b) which identifies zombie firms based on a combination of firm age and values of the interest coverage ratio (operating profits to interest expenses). We show that a key decision is whether operating profits are taken before or after amortization and depreciation and we argue that using profits after amortization and depreciation has several undesirable characteristics: i) it overestimates the share of capital “trapped” into zombie firms, and, to a smaller extent, the share of zombie firms; ii) it is worse in predicting the future performance of firms; iii) it is more likely to classify as zombies in a given year firms which invested heavily in previous years and amortized that investment quickly (for example to enjoy tax breaks); iv) it is especially inappropriate for cross-country comparisons.
O47|Allocative Efficiency and Finance|This paper studies the effect of bank lending shocks on aggregate labor productivity. Exploiting a unique administrative dataset covering the universe of Italian manufacturing firms between 2000 and 2015, we apply the Melitz and Polanec (2015) decomposition at the 4-digit industry level to distinguish the contribution to aggregate productivity growth of: changes in surviving firms’ average productivity, market share reallocation among surviving firms, and firm entry and exit. We estimate the impact of credit shocks on each of these components, using data from the Italian Credit Register to construct industry-specific exogenous credit supply shocks. Only for the 2008-2015 period, we find that a tightening in the supply of credit lowers average productivity but increases the covariance between market share and productivity among incumbents, thus boosting the reallocation of labor. We find no significant effects of credit supply shocks on the contribution made by firm entry and exit. We find that the effects of negative credit shocks on average productivity and reallocation are concentrated in industries with a lower share of tangible capital and collateralized debt.
O47|Protección y productividad en la industria colombiana, 1993-2011|Este documento analiza la evolución de la productividad total factorial en la industria colombiana entre 1993 y 2011 haciendo uso de datos a nivel de firma. La determinación de la productividad total factorial es bastante importante debido a sus implicaciones en el crecimiento económico, la innovación y el nivel de ingresos del país. Una vez definida la evolución de la productividad total factorial se estudian sus determinantes. Fundamentalmente se consideran especificaciones que evalúan la importancia de la apertura económica y el nivel de concentración de la producción sobre los niveles de productividad. Los resultados muestran un estancamiento en la productividad factorial en la industria manufacturera del país y, además, se identifica una relación directa entre los niveles de incorporación de las firmas a los mercados internacionales y su nivel de productividad.
O47|Efectos de la digitalización y la productividad en la economía española : una comparación internacional|Los efectos de la digitalización en términos de contribución al crecimiento muestran que mientras la contribución de todos los inputs relacionados con la digitalización se sitúa entre 0,5 y 1,5 p.p. del crecimiento del valor añadido entre 1996 y 2014, la contribución de la productividad total de los factores (PTF) pesa negativamente reduciendo significativamente e incluso anulando el efecto positivo de la inversión en digitalización. Sin embargo y tal y como sucede a partir de 2015, cuando la contribución de la PTF es positiva, la digitalización, tal y como se ha medio en el estudio, es responsable de hasta un 30% del crecimiento del valor añadido. El valor acumulado entre 1996 y 2017 de los efectos agregados de la digitalización supone un 5,7% del PIB de 2016 pero, cuando se omite el valor del progreso tecnológico, se dispara hasta un 18% del PIB. El análisis del nivel de la productividad pone de manifiesto que el deterioro de la productividad del factor trabajo junto con un declive de la del capital entre 1996 y 2009, explican el bajo nivel de la PTF española. Sin duda y a pesar de la mejora del capital humano y de la inversión TIC durante el periodo observado, los niveles alcanzados no son suficientes para invertir la tendencia decreciente de la productividad de trabajo y mejorar significativamente la del capital. Sin embargo, cuando se amplía la lente del observado y se realiza el análisis desagregando por ramas de actividad, los resultados ponen de manifiesto que junto a ramas con deterioros profundos de productividad conviven ramas con tasas de crecimiento de la PTF de dos dígitos, entre las que sobresale la rama de la información y comunicación. A la luz de estos resultados, se impone un análisis en profundidad de la ineficiencia en la asignación de los recursos productivos de la economía española...
O47|Access to Justice and Economic Development: Evidence from an International Panel Dataset|We empirically investigate the impact of access to justice (ATJ) on GDP per capita growth in a panel of 83 countries from 1970 to 2014. Our analysis relies on a new database documenting the number of judges per capita as a proxy for capturing the cross-country evolution of ATJ. The proxy measures the extent to which disputes between economic actors can be resolved at a relatively low cost, without dysfunctional delay and discrimination. In a dynamic panel setting using internal instruments, we find that increasing ATJ by 1% increases the five-year growth rate of GDP per capita by 0.86 p.p. (0.17 p.p. annually) with diminishing marginal returns. In line with the diminishing marginal returns argument, we find that the effect of ATJ is two times smaller in Europe compared to other regions due to higher levels of ATJ. We find no evidence of a differential effect of ATJ across other regions, income levels, legal origins, democracy, corruption of the judicial system or human capital levels.
O47|Business Cycle during Structural Change: Arthur Lewis' Theory from a Neoclassical Perspective|We document that the nature of business cycles evolves over the process of development and structural change. In countries with large declining agricultural sectors, aggregate employment is uncorrelated with GDP. During booms, employment in agriculture declines while labor productivity increases in agriculture more than in other sectors. We construct a unified theory of business cycles and structural change consistent with the stylized facts. The focal point of the theory is the simultaneous decline and modernization of agriculture. As capital accumulates, agriculture becomes increasingly capital intensive as modern agriculture crowds out traditional agriculture. Structural change accelerates in booms and slows down in recessions. We estimate the model and show that it accounts well for both the structural transformation and the business cycle fluctuations of China.
O47|Measuring trends and persistence in capital and labor misallocation|We analyze trends and persistence in the misallocation of labor and capital using firm-level panel data for the Netherlands in the period 2001-2017. We use the dispersion in marginal revenue products of labor and capital to measure the extent of misallocation. Compared to a counterfactual efficient allocation we find that misallocation has had a sizable negative impact on aggregate productivity. Especially capital misallocation has increased over time. The relatively high and rising capital misallocation is caused by a combination of small, highly productive firms facing relatively high capital wedges and large and unproductive firms facing relatively low capital wedges. Exploiting a panel data error components model we find that capital misallocation has a much more permanent character than labor misallocation. Moreover, it is the permanent component of capital misallocation that has increased over time. Finally, we show that in our sample the measurement of misallocation is largely insensitive to capital adjustment costs and alternative specifications of the production function. The contribution of heterogeneous markups to observed misallocation, however, is non-negligible.
O47|When losses turn into loans: the cost of undercapitalized banks|We provide evidence that a weak banking sector has contributed to low productivity growth following the European sovereign debt crisis. An unexpected increase in capital requirements for a subset of Portuguese banks in 2011 provides a natural experiment to study the effects of reduced bank capital adequacy on productivity. Affected banks respond not only by cutting back on lending but also by reallocating credit to firms in financial distress with prior underreported loan loss provisioning. We develop a method to detect when banks delay loss reporting using detailed loan-level data. We then show that the credit reallocation leads to a reallocation of production factors across rms. A partial equilibrium exercise suggests that the resulting increase in factor misallocation accounts for 20% of the decline in productivity in Portugal in 2012.

O47|Breaking the Shackles: Zombie Firms, Weak Banks and Depressed Restructuring in Europe|This paper explores the connection between “zombie” firms (firms that would typically exit in a competitive market) and bank health and the consequences for aggregate productivity in 11 European countries. Controlling for cyclical effects, the results show that zombie firms are more likely to be connected to weak banks, suggesting that the zombie firm problem in Europe may at least partly stem from bank forbearance. The increasing survival of zombie firms congests markets and constrains the growth of more productive firms, to the detriment of aggregate productivity growth. Our results suggest that around one-third of the impact of zombie congestion on capital misallocation could be directly attributed to bank health and additional analysis suggests that this may partly be due to reduced availability of credit to healthy firms. Finally, improvements in bank health are more likely to be associated with a reduction in the prevalence of zombie firms in countries where insolvency regimes do not unduly inhibit corporate restructuring. Thus, leveraging the important complementarities between bank strengthening efforts and insolvency regime reform would contribute to breaking the shackles on potential growth in Europe.
O47|Estimation of Industry-level Productivity with Cross-sectional Dependence by Using Spatial Analysis|We examine aggregate productivity in the presence of inter-sectoral linkages. Cross-sectional dependence is inevitable among industries, in which each sector serves as a supplier to the other sectors. However, the chains of such interconnections cause indirect relationship among industries. Spatial analysis is one of the approaches to address cross-sectional dependence by using a priori a specified spatial weights matrix. We exploit the linkage patterns from the input-output tables and use them to assign spatial weights to describe the economic interdependencies. By using the spatial weights matrix, we can estimate the industry-level production functions and productivity of the U.S. from 1947 to 2010. Cross-sectional dependencies are the consequences of indirect effects, and they reflect the interactions among industries linked via their supply chain networks result in larger output elasticities as well as scale effects for the networked production processes. However, productivity growth estimates are reportedly comparable across various spatial and non-spatial model specications.
O47|Investment, autonomous demand and long run capacity utilization: An empirical test for the Euro Area|In recent years, the role attached to the autonomous components of aggregate demand has attracted rising attention, as testified by the development of the Sraffian Supermulti plier model (SSM) and the attempts to include autonomous demand in the Neo-Kaleckian model. This paper reviews and empirically tests the validity and the policy conclusions of the two models in the Euro Area. First, we theoretically assess whether the SSM may con stitute a complex variant of the Neo-Kaleckian model. In this sense, it is shown that results compatible with the SSM can be obtained by implementing a set of mechanisms in a modified Neo-Kaleckian model, leading to the convergence towards a desired rate of utilization. Furthermore, the chief diffierence between the models is recognized to be the role attached to the rate of capacity utilization in the long run. Second, the paper empirically tests the main implications of the models in the Euro Area, based on Eurostat data. In particular, the discussion outlines the short and long-run relation between autonomous demand and output, by testing both the cointegration and the direction of causality between the two with a VECM model. Moreover, the role accounted by both theories to the actual rate of capacity utilization and its discrepancies from the normal rate is empirically assessed, through a time-series estimation of the Sraffian and Neo-Kaleckian investment functions. While confirming the theoretical relation between autonomous demand and output in the long run, the results show that the dynamics of the rate of capacity utilization still plays a key role in the short-run adjustment mechanism - despite its stationary behaviour in the long term. Therefore, admitting that Keynesian results may hold even after the traverse, our work suggests to be Kaleckian in the short run and Sraffian in the long run.
O47|Unconventional monetary policy and productivity: Evidence on the risk-seeking channel from US corporate bond markets|We examine the relationship between lax monetary policy, access to high-yield bond markets and productivity in the US between 2008 and 2016. Using monetary policy surprises, obtained from changes in interest rates futures in narrow windows around FOMC announcements, we isolate the increased access to high-yield bond markets relative to investment-grade bond markets that is due to unconventional monetary policy (UMP). We find that through the risk-taking channel, UMP has increased investors’ appetite for high-yield US corporate bonds, thereby increasing access to high-yield bond markets for firms with a higher risk profile. Since the relationship between credit ratings and firm-level productivity is U-shaped, the aggregate effect on productivity is a priori unclear. Turning to the real economy, we thus analyse whether this additional access to finance had an effect on aggregate productivity by altering the reallocation of resources across firms. Our results show that unconventional monetary policy induced less investment in tangible capital by high-productive firms. However, before drawing conclusions on the net effects of UMP on aggregate productivity, we discuss a number of issues that this paper could not deal with due to data limitations, including prominently whether this apparent misallocation may have been offset by a shift in the composition of investments towards more intangible investment.
O47|Measuring consumer inflation in a digital economy|The effect on the household consumption price index from possible sources of error in capturing digital products depends on the weight of the affected products. To calculate upper bounds for this effect, we apply weights based on the average structure of household consumption in OECD countries to a maximum plausible overstatement of price change for each affected or potentially affected product. The products account for about 35% of household expenditure in 2005, declining to 32% in 2015. The upper bound simulation effect on the growth rate of the consumption deflator is somewhat less than –0.6 percentage points in 2015 – large enough to improve the picture of GDP and productivity growth in advanced economies. However, this would not overturn the conclusion that productivity growth has slowed substantially compared over the past decades.
O47|Future-Proofing the WA Economy: A roadmap to industrial diversification and regional growth|Future-Proofing the WA Economy is the fourth report in the Bankwest Curtin Economics Centre’s Focus on Industry report series. The report recommends the implementation of a ‘smart specialisation’ approach to regional diversification, to ensure that new development opportunities build on existing regional capabilities and capitalise on local conditions and networks. Of course, this doesn’t mean taking our ‘foot off the gas’ in the parts of the economy that are going well. A fundamental element of smart specialisation is to support those industries that the regions are leading in. But the smart specialisation policy is useful to encourage diversification into new industries that build on WA’s existing advantages. This report contributes an important new evidence base to inform the State’s diversification strategy, based on a data-driven approach to identify current industry strengths and emerging opportunities in each of WA’s ten regions. The report puts forward a series of recommendations to support the State’s diversification strategies. In doing so, our hope is that more economic development opportunities in Western Australia will be seized rather than lost.
O47|Imputing Away the Ladder: Implications of Changes in National Accounting Standards for Assessing Inter-country Inequalities|Over the last half century, a large literature has developed on both the nature and the drivers of uneven development. While different methodologies and theoretical approaches to the issue of convergence abound, the use of GDP growth as a measure of economic growth has, remarkably, gone unquestioned. This paper reviews the convergence debates to date, and examines what the changes to the System of National Accounts (SNA) - the international standard for constructing macroeconomic indicators such as GDP - imply for assessing economic convergence. The 1993 and 2008 revisions to the SNA include several major changes to how production is measured - including the reclassification of financial intermediation services, R&D, weapons systems and owner-occupied dwellings as productive activities - all areas in which developed countries have had an advantage in recent decades. We argue that these changes to the production boundary constitute a form of ‘kicking away the ladder,’ i.e. redefining the yardstick of development to fit the new strengths of developed economies. We analyze data series for a range of countries concurrently available under the 1968 SNA, 1993 SNA and 2008 SNA standards. The earlier measure shows a larger and faster convergence of most countries in ‘the Rest’ with those of ‘the West’. Going a step further, we build on Basu and Foley’s (2013) Measured Value-Added concept as a proxy of ‘Core GDP’. This indicator omits any sector for which value-added is imputed based on net incomes, in the absence of an independent measure of output. This allows us to examine more countries and a longer, more consistent time series than concurrent SNA data, but the conclusions are the same - developing countries have caught up more in Core-GDP terms than the contemporary imputation-heavy measure of GDP would suggest. These findings suggest that the current measure of GDP has become decoupled from core employment-generating activities, and is therefore a misleading measure of growth in an economy. Furthermore, it is inconsistent with the understanding the Sustainable Development Goals of inclusive and sustainable growth. Finally, the paper considers the political economy implications of the changes in GDP methodology, such as the justification of voting shares in international financial institutions, epistemological consequences, and domestic political economy considerations.
O47|Below the Aggregate: A Sectoral Account of the UK Productivity Puzzle|We analyse new industry-level data to re-examine the UK productivity puzzle. We carry out an accounting exercise that allows us to distinguish general macroeconomic patterns from sector trends and idiosyncrasies, providing a roadmap for anyone interested in explaining the puzzle. We focus on the UK market sector. Average annual labour productivity growth was 2.5 percentage points lower during the period 2011-2015 than in the decade before the financial crisis that began in 2007. We find that several years on from the financial crisis stagnation remains widespread across detailed industry divisions, pointing to economy-wide explanations for the puzzle. With some exceptions, labour productivity growth lost most momentum in those industries that experienced strong growth before the crisis. Three fifths of the gap is accounted for by a few industries that together account for less than one fifth of market sector value added. In terms of why we observe continued stagnation, we find that capital shallowing has become increasingly important in explaining the labour productivity growth gap in service sectors, as the buoyancy of the UK labour market has not been sufficiently matched by investment, although our figures suggest that the majority of the productivity gap is accounted for by a TFP gap. The collapse in labour productivity growth has been more pronounced in the UK than elsewhere, but the broad sector patterns of productivity stagnation are in many respects similar across other advanced economies, emphasising the importance of global explanations for the puzzle. UK industries that saw the biggest reductions in productivity growth tended to be internationally competitive and more dependent on global demand than other industries. They were also industries where productivity is difficult to measure.
O47|Productivity growth, firm turnover and new varieties|In this paper, we reconcile two different strands of the literature: the literature on how new goods impact prices and the literature on productivity growth and firm turnover. The decomposition we propose generalises the framework currently used in the literature. Moreover, we extend the estimator for the demand elasticity, proposed by Feenstra (1994) and supplemented by Soderbery (2015). To illustrate the decomposition and estimator, we analyse the case of firm turnover in Norway. Our results indicate that net creation of new varieties from firm turnover contributes by about one half percentage point to annual aggregate productivity growth.
O47|The Digital Economy, New Products and Consumer Welfare|Benefits of the Digital Economy are evident in everyday life, but there are significant concerns that these benefits may not be appropriately reflected in official statistics. The measurement of the net benefits of new and disappearing products depends on what type of price index the statistical agency is using to deflate final demand aggregates. We examine this measurement problem when the agency uses any standard price index formula for its deflation of a value aggregate, such as GDP. We also apply the methodology to the problem of measuring the effects of product substitutions for disappearing items. Our exact expressions for biases inherent in different approaches provide a theoretical basis and framework for the emerging empirical literature on new goods and services, and for assessing the quality adjustment methodologies used in practice.
O47|Double Deflation: theory and practice|Real GDP measured from the output side, GDP(O), should equal real GDP measured from the expenditure side, GDP(E), just as corresponding two approaches to measuring GDP in current prices are necessarily equal. But this is only the case even in theory if real value added in each industry is measured by double deflation. We set out the theory of double deflation using a matrix algebra treatment based on the framework of the Supply and Use Tables. The context is the UK’s national accounts which measures volume growth by chained Laspeyres indices and which currently use single not double deflation. Initially we use simplified assumptions about prices. Later we introduce more realistic assumptions. We analyse the conditions on prices under which real GDP(O) equals real GDP(E). We consider three alternative methods of implementing double deflation. The preferred method makes use of all the price indices which the Office for National Statistics currently collects: Producer Price Indices, Services Producer Price Indices, Consumer Price Indices, Export Price Indices and Import Price Indices. We implement a simplified version of double deflation, using the same data as in the latest vintage of the national accounts, and compare our estimates with the official ones. In this version the same price index is used for each product regardless of whether the product is an output or an input. We find that double-deflated industry growth rates are consistently lower than the official single-deflated ones and also considerably more variable year-to-year. We interpret this finding as reinforcing the case for careful selection of the set of deflators to use for double deflation.
O47|Vietnam: The next asian Tiger?|We investigate the growth experience of Vietnam, the country which has been getting recent attention as being the next emerging giant. First, we present an aggregate level investigation of Vietnam’s economic growth experience, since the inauguration of reform in 1986 known as Doi Moi. We focus on a top-down approach that performs growth and level accounting exercises. These decompositions offer the possibility to track the economic progress of Vietnam and to formulate policy accordingly depending on where the gaps originate from. Second, we build a two-sector general equilibrium model, investigating the secular decline in agricultural employment. Despite the notable structural changes over the past thirty years, agriculture still has a substantial weight in the Vietnamese economy. We conduct a quantitative analysis using a theoretical framework, with an emphasis on the counterfactual outcomes of inheriting Chinese sectoral productivity growth rates, where China is recognized as the paragon emerging economy. The main findings are: (i) Vietnam has grown impressively since 1986, but is still a relatively poor country in absolute terms; (ii) Vietnam must decrease its reliance on factor accumulation as its source of growth and increase its technological capabilities; (iii) economic policies should equally target both agricultural and nonagricultural sectors to increase sectoral productivity growth rates in Vietnam.
O47|Boosting productivity and living standards in Thailand|The Prosperity pillar of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development calls for an integrated approach based on boosting productivity through diversification, upgrading technology and innovation, and increasing employment and entrepreneurship. Thailand needs to address all these challenges to achieve high-income country status by 2036. Over the past decade, limited structural reform and capital investment have held back productivity growth and improvements in well-being, and Thailand has lost ground vis-à-vis regional comparators. More recently, however, economic growth has started to regain momentum helped by a pick-up in global trade, which has supported exports, and by a substantial public infrastructure investment programme. Moving forward, Thailand will need to boost productive capacity in the face of intensified competition with regional peers and rapid demographic ageing. In addition, productivity gains will be increasingly necessary to drive growth. Key areas of focus include improving human resource development, encouraging technology diffusion via cluster development, promoting innovation and digitalisation, improving the SME policy framework and expanding regional integration, as emphasised in the government’s 12th Plan and Thailand 4.0. This Working Paper relates to the Initial Assessment report of the Multi-dimensional Country Review of Thailand (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/multi-dimensional-review-thailand.htm)
O47|Financing innovative business investment in Poland|Poland’s productivity has grown strongly over the past two decades. However, the public and private capital stock is weak, and investment remains focused on the adoption of existing technologies, which weighs on future productivity gains and innovation. Many micro enterprises have low productivity, and structural bottlenecks reduce start-ups' growth and their chances of survival. The EU and the government are stepping up funding for business research and development, collaboration with the public sector, entrepreneurship and innovation. This is an opportunity to improve the management of public business support, and the large new programmes should be carefully discussed with stakeholders and regularly evaluated to avoid the risks of subsidising low-productivity firms and to strengthen the take up from the most productive small and medium-sized enterprises. The sustainability of this ambitious package of measures will also require significant public revenues and promoting alternative market-based financing instruments will be critical over the medium term. Ongoing improvements in insolvency procedures and efforts to reduce the regulatory burden are set to ease reallocation of resources through the economy. However, the level of state involvement would remain important, and ensuring the independence of the network industry regulators and the Competition Authority and a level playing field between alternative technologies, as well as easing labour mobility would be good moves.
O47|Design of insolvency regimes across countries|This paper explores cross-country differences in the design of insolvency regimes, based on quantitative indicators constructed from countries’ responses to a recent OECD policy questionnaire. The indicators – which are available for 36 countries for 2010 and 2016 – aim to better capture the key design features of insolvency which impact the timely initiation and resolution of personal and corporate insolvency proceedings. According to these metrics, the design of insolvency regimes varies significantly across countries, with important differences emerging with respect to the treatment of failed entrepreneurs, the availability of preventative and streamlining tools and ease of corporate restructuring. While a comparison of indicator values for 2010 and 2016 imply that recent reform efforts have improved policy design, there remains much scope to reform insolvency regimes in many OECD countries. This is particularly significant in light of complementary analysis which shows that the design of insolvency regimes is relevant for understanding three inter-related sources of contemporary labour productivity weakness: the survival of “zombie” firms, capital misallocation and stalling technological diffusion.
O47|The drivers of regional growth in Russia: A baseline model with applications|Russia is a federation of more than 80 regions spanning across a huge territory. Natural resource endowment, inherited industrial specialization, remoteness and climate conditions contribute to large regional disparities. This paper presents an empirical framework model for assessing determinants of regional growth in Russia between 2004 and 2015 with an extension to include sub-national fiscal policies. Baseline results show convergence rates of regional GDP per capita in line with the 2% “iron law of convergence” between countries. Capital investment, and public investment in particular, is a stronger driver of regional growth than in most OECD countries. Natural-resource rich regions are growing faster, and oil price shocks have little economic impact in these regions, pointing at Russia’s centralized tax and transfer system. Subnational current government expenditure is associated with lower growth and slower regional convergence, suggesting low sub-national spending efficiency. There is also weak evidence that sub-national investment yields higher returns than federal government investment. Transfers have mixed effects depending on their nature. Budget equalization grants tend to slow regional growth as they reduce incentives to improve spending efficiency. On the other hand earmarked matching grants tend to spur growth and convergence as they direct resources towards more productive spending.
O47|Environmentally Adjusted Multifactor Productivity: Methodology and Empirical Results for OECD and G20 Countries|This paper extends the analytical framework for measuring multifactor productivity in order to account for environmental services. A growth accounting approach is used to decompose a pollution-adjusted measure of output growth into the contributions of labour, produced capital and natural capital. These indicators allow the sources of economic growth, and its long run sustainability, to be better assessed. Results presented here cover OECD and G20 countries for the 1990–2013 period, and account for the extraction of subsoil natural assets and emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases. The main findings suggest that growth in OECD countries has been generated almost exclusively through productivity gains, while BRIICS countries have drawn largely on increased utilisation of factor inputs to generate additional growth. Regarding natural capital, in countries such as Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Chile, reliance on subsoil assets extraction has contributed to a significant share of income growth. Results also point to a shift towards more environmentally friendly production processes in many countries. In fact, most OECD countries have decreased their emissions over the last two decades, and these pollution abatement efforts result in an upward adjustment of their GDP growth rates, allowing for a more accurate assessment of their economic performance.
O47|Of mice and merchants: trade and growth in the Iron Age|We study the causal connection between trade and development using one of the earliest massive trade expansions: the first systematic crossing of open seas in the Mediterranean during the time of the Phoenicians. We construct a measure of connectedness along the shores of the sea. This connectivity varies with the shape of the coast, the location of islands, and the distance to the opposing shore. We relate connectedness to local growth, which we measure using the presence of archaeological sites in an area. We find an association between better connected locations and archaeological sites during the Iron Age, at a time when sailors began to cross open water very routinely and on a big scale. We corroborate these findings at the level of the world.
O47|Economic development in post-war Thailand|This paper discusses five aspects of Thailand’s economic performance since World War II: the changing rate of growth and its composition; the sources of that growth; the causes and consequences of the Asian Financial Crisis (AFC) of 1997-99, including the reason it originated in Thailand; the distribution among the Thai population of the fruits of long-term growth; and whether Thailand is caught in a middle-income trap. The evidence from Thailand demolishes the notion that economic growth fails to benefit the poor – provided ‘benefit’ is understood in absolute and not relative terms. It is argued that Thailand is now caught in a ‘middle-income trap’ caused by a backward and under-resourced educational system. Exit is possible, but requires a public commitment to overcoming the under-supply of human capital that a market-based economic system inherently produces and to raising the public revenue needed to finance higher levels of educational investment.
O47| Capacidad productiva, cambio técnico y productividad: Estimaciones alternativas del producto de largo plazo| Esta investigación presenta las estimaciones del producto de largo plazo y de la brecha del producto, correspondientes a dos enfoques teóricos. El primero es el enfoque del crecimiento dirigido por la demanda. Se estiman dos modelos de producción de largo plazo. El modelo de Shaikh y Moudud (2004) con una ligera modificación para captar el cambio técnico determinado por la demanda en el sentido Kaldoriano (Kaldor, 1957); y, el modelo de Thirlwall (1979) según el cual las tasas teóricas de crecimiento de largo plazo de la economía están determinadas, en el largo plazo, por las tasas de crecimiento de las exportaciones. El segundo enfoque es el neoclásico de Solow-Swan (1956). Este enfoque sostiene que el crecimiento de largo plazo está limitado por factores de oferta y, entre estos se encuentran ciertamente los factores de producción capital y trabajo. Se utiliza la misma técnica de cointegración para estimar los modelos de ambos enfoques para de este modo facilitar su comparación. JEL Classification-JEL: E12 , E13 , E23 , O11 , O40 , O47 , O49
O47|Conditional Divergence in the Post-1989 Globalisation Period|This paper shows that conditional convergence in per capita income, as a robust empirical regularity across countries, may have dissipated in the post-1989 globalisation era. There is evidence of conditional divergence over the period 1990-2016, with growth-reducing structural change emanating from greater trade openness and a slower rate of technology catch-up in developing countries identified as potential explanations. The results further show that conditional divergence can only be ceased subject to some initial, efficiency-adjusted level of educational attainment. One implication of conditional divergence is that the growth accelerations observed in many developing economies since the late-1990s may not be sustainable.
O47|The impact of corruption on economic growth, a bootstrapping analysis|"In this paper we evaluate the impact of corruption in economic growth and if in less developed countries the hypothesis ""greasing the wheels” is valid. Using an unbalanced panel data with 2907 observations from 174 countries and 23 years between 1995 and 2017 (data from Transparency International and World Bank), we estimate using bootstrapping that the impact of corruption on growth is negative (an estimate of 0.025pp per CPI point) and that the hypothesis ""greasing the wheels” is not supported in the data. Our results are in accordance with the literature but are more robust because our database has much more observations."
O47|Barriers to Reallocation and Economic Growth: the Effects of Firing Costs|We study how factors that hinder the reallocation of inputs across firms influence aggregate productivity growth. We extend Hopenhayn and Rogerson's (1993) general equilibrium firm dynamics model to allow for endogenous innovation. We calibrate the model using US data, and then evaluate the effects of firing taxes on reallocation, innovation, and aggregate productivity growth. In our baseline specification, we find that firing taxes reduce overall innovation and productivity growth. We also show that firing taxes can have opposite effects on the entrants' innovation and the incumbents' innovation, and thus the overall outcome depends on the relative strengths of these forces.
O47|Educational Gender Gaps and Economic Growth: A Systematic Review and Meta-Regression Analysis|We conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the empirical literature on the impact of gender inequality in education on per capita economic growth, including cross-country, time series, and sub-national growth regressions. Studies using male and female education as separate covariates show a larger effect of female than male education on growth, except when an arguably problematic regression specification popularized by Barro and co-authors is used. We conduct a meta-regression analysis for studies that use the female-male ratio of education as explanatory variable. There we find evidence for a positive and statistically significant relationship between gender equality in education and growth based on 216 estimates from 17 such studies. We find that the average partial correlation coefficient between economic growth and the ratio of female over male education is 0.25, which is a moderate effect. The effect does not appear to be influenced by publication bias, it increases when one controls for initial education levels and social/institutional controls, while it falls with the use of fixed effects, the inclusion of economic controls, and the share of female authors.
O47|Wage-led vs. profit-led growth: a comprehensive empirical analysis|This study investigates the impact of various economic factors in determining the relationship between functional income distribution and economic growth. Inspired by the seminal paper of Bhaduri and Marglin (1990), we base our analysis on a demand-driven distribution and growth model for an open economy that allows for either profit-led or wage-led growth. To this end, we use a cross-country panel dataset consisting of 41 countries from 1961 to 2011. In the first step of the empirical analysis, we first estimate whether growth regime is wage-led or profit-led in each country. Next, in the second step, using probit and meta-regression approaches with cross-country data, we analyse the effects of various macroeconomic variables on the nature of economic growth. Our results strongly reflect that a higher level of trade openness is associated with a lower probability of being wage-led. Moreover, we find evidence that lower wage inequality would make an economy more wage-led and that countries with a greater private credit-to-GDP ratio are more likely to be profit-led.
O47|Spatial Chaining in International Comparisons of Prices and Real Incomes| Multilateral international comparisons of the purchasing power of currencies and real income often use as building blocks bilateral comparisons between all possible pairs of countries. The standard approach in the literature weights all these bilaterals equally. One problem with this approach is that some bilaterals are typically of lower quality, and their inclusion therefore can undermine the integrity of the multilateral comparison. Formulating multilateral comparisons as a graph theory problem, we show how quality can be improved by replacing bilateral comparisons with their shortest path spatially chained equivalents. We consider a few variants on this approach, and illustrate these multilateral methods using data from the 2011 round of the International Comparisons Program (ICP). Using some novel bounds criteria, we demonstrate how spatial chaining improves the quality of the overall multilateral comparison.
O47|Identification of common factors in panel data growth model|Cross sectional dependence may lead to inconsistent and inefficient estimators and as such misleading inferences when standard panel data techniques such as fixed/random effects are employed. Pesaran (2006) suggests incorporating cross sectional averages in panel data models as approximates of unobserved common factor(s) to deal with cross sectional dependence. In the context of a standard panel growth model we investigate whether these unobserved common factors can be identified and we find that institutional variables and life expectancy are able to adequately identify them.
O47|The role of production factor quality and technology diffusion in twentieth-century productivity growth|Abstract The twentieth century was a period of exceptional growth, driven mainly by the increase in total factor productivity (TFP). Using a database of 17 OECD countries over the 1890–2013 period, this paper integrates production factor quality into the measure of TFP, namely by factoring the level of education of the working-age population into the measure of labor and the age of equipment in the measure of capital stock. We then estimate how the diffusion of technology impacts the growth of this newly measured TFP through two emblematic general purpose technologies, electricity and information and communication technologies (ICT). Using growth decomposition methodology from instrumental variable estimates, this paper finds that education levels contribute most significantly to growth, while the age of capital makes a limited, although significant, contribution. Quality-adjusted production factors explain less than half of labor productivity growth in the largest countries except for Japan, where capital deepening posted a very large contribution. As a consequence, the “one big wave” of productivity growth (Gordon in Am Econ Rev 89(2):123–128, 1999), as well as the ICT productivity wave for the countries which experienced it, remains only partially explained by quality-adjusted factors, although education and technology diffusion contribute to explain the earlier wave in the USA in the 1930s–1940s. Finally, technology diffusion, as captured through our two general purpose technologies, leaves unexplained between 0.6 and 1 percentage point of yearly growth, as well as a large proportion of the two twentieth-century technology waves. These results both support a significant lag in the diffusion of general purpose technologies and raise further questions on a wider view on growth factors, including changes in the production process, management techniques and financing practices. Measurement problems may also contribute to the unexplained share of growth.

O47|Firm-level productivity dispersion and convergence|On a French firm dataset, productivity at the technological frontier has not decelerated and convergence of firms’ productivity has not slowed down. Yet, the dispersion of productivity has increased, which suggests growing difficulties in reallocating production factors between firms.
O47|Constitutional rules as determinants of social infrastructure|A sizable literature has established the positive impact of social infrastructure on economic development, but the determinants of social infrastructure itself have yet to be fully explored. Competing theories suggest a variety of political institutions as driving forces of social infrastructure, but the empirical literature has been hampered by the small set of available proxies, many of which are broadly defined. We leverage a new, comprehensive dataset that codes political institutions directly from countries’ constitutions. By employing a statistical methodology that is designed to juxtapose candidate regressors associated with many competing theories, we test each individual political institution's effect on social infrastructure. Our results show that constitutional rules pertaining to executive constraints as well as to the structure of electoral systems are crucial for the development of high-quality social infrastructure. We also find that the determinants of social infrastructure are much more fundamental than previously thought: not only the general structure of electoral systems matter, but also highly detailed aspects such as limits on campaign contributions and the freedom to form parties. Moreover, the granularity of our data allows us to highlight the profound effect of basic human rights on social infrastructure, a dimension which has not been explored in the literature to date.
O47|Labour Market Regulations and Capital Intensity|On the basis of a country*industry unbalanced panel data sample for 14 OECD countries and 18 industries covering the years 1988 to 2007, this study proposes an econometric investigation of the effects of the OECD Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) indicator on capital intensity for four capital components, and on the share of employment for two skill components. Our results relying on a difference-in-difference approach are the following: i) positive and significant effects for non-ICT physical capital intensity and the share of high-skilled employment; ii) non-significant effects for ICT capital intensity; and (iii) negative and significant effects for R&D capital intensity and the share of low-skilled employment. These results suggest that firms consider that the strengthening of Employment Protection Legislation is equivalent to a rise in the cost of labor, resulting in capital-to-labor substitution in favor of non-ICT capital and working at the disadvantage of low-skill relatively to high-skill workers. They indicate to the contrary that structural reforms for more labor flexibility weakening this legislation could have a favorable impact on firms’ R&D investment and their hiring of low-skill workers.
O47|Innovation and Top Income Inequality|In this article, we use cross-state panel and cross-U.S. commuting-zone data to look at the relationship between innovation, top income inequality and social mobility. We find positive correlations between measures of innovation and top income inequality. We also show that the correlations between innovation and broad measures of inequality are not significant. Next, using instrumental variable analysis, we argue that these correlations at least partly reflect a causality from innovation to top income shares. Finally, we show that innovation, particularly by new entrants, is positively associated with social mobility, but less so in local areas with more intense lobbying activities.
O47|The Elephant Curve of Global Inequality and Growth|We present new evidence on global inequality and growth since 1980 using the World and Wealth Income Database. We plot the curve of cumulated growth from 1980 to 2016 by percentile of the global distribution of income per adult. This curve has an elephant shape due to high growth rates at the median (fast growth in China and India), modest growth rates above the median, and explosive growth rates at the top. We project the evolution of global inequality between now and 2050 combining projected macro growth rates and within country inequality evolution based on past trends.
O47|External debt and real exchange rates’ adjustment in the euro area: new evidence from a nonlinear NATREX model| In this article, we revisit medium- to long-run real exchange rate determination within the euro area, focusing on the role of external debt. Accordingly, we rely on the NATural Real EXchange rate (NATREX) approach which provides an explicit framework of the external debt--real exchange rates nexus. In particular, given the indebtedness levels reached by the euro area economies, we investigate potential nonlinearity in real exchange rates dynamics, according to the level of the external debt. Our results evidence that during the monetary union, gross and net external debt positions of the euro area countries have exerted pressures on real exchange rate dynamics within the area. Moreover, we find that, beyond a threshold reached by the external debt, euro area countries are found to be in a vulnerable position, leading to an unavoidable adjustment process. Nevertheless, the adjustment process, while effective, is found to be low and occurs slowly.
O47|Is the output growth rate in NIPA a welfare measure?|National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) measure real output growth by means of a Fisher ideal chain index. Bridging modern macroeconomics and the economic theory of index numbers, this paper shows that output growth as measured by NIPA is welfare based. In a dynamic general equilibrium model with genreral recursive preferences and technology, welfare depends on present and future consumption. Indeed, the associated Bellman equation provides a representation of preferences in the domain of current consumption and current investment. Applying standard index number theory to this representation of preferences shows that the Fisher-Shell true quantity index is equal to the Divisia index, in turn well approximated by the Fisher ideal index used in NIPA.
O47|Economic convergence and exchange rate misalignments in the European Union|We investigate (i) the characteristics of real economic and price convergence, (ii) the relationship between economic growth (convergence) and real exchange rate (RER) misalignments within the European Union (EU) during the period 1995–2016. In addition to the relative external price level of GDP, we quantified an alternative indicator for the RER: the internal relative price of services to goods, as measured from the expenditure side of GDP. We interpreted RER-misalignments as deviations from levels consistent with levels of economic development among EU countries. Regarding real convergence, the “catching up” of the less developed member states to the more affluent ones within the EU was expressly rapid in terms of relative per capita growth measured at current PPPs; it was less impressive if measured at constant PPPs, and rather modest in terms of relative real GDP-growth. As for price levels and the relative price of services to goods, a rapid convergence could be observed until the international financial crisis, but this process halted in 2008. Using pooled OLS and dynamic panel techniques, we found that within the EU there is a negative relationship between the contemporaneous sign of RER-misalignment (based on both the external price level and internal relative prices) and economic growth: over- (under-) valuations are associated with lower (higher) growth. This is mainly due to developments in countries operating under fixed exchange rate regimes. Our results indicate that the level of development does not influence the strength of the growth-misalignment relationship within the EU. These results are robust to the applied panel estimation method. Regarding the external price level, we find that the positive relationship between undervaluation and growth diminishes with increasing size of undervaluation. The aggregate effect of misalignments is significantly negative on both export market shares and the ratio of gross fixed capital formation to GDP: both the competitiveness and the investment channel play an important role in the relationship between growth and RER misalignments. As an extension, we analyse the relationship between growth and the misalignment of wages from productivity levels; “wage-misalignments” are also negatively associated with economic growth. Although our study carries policy messages – in particular, mild real exchange rate undervaluations are positively, while overvaluations are negatively associated with growth and real economic convergence – the RER is an endogenous variable, which is not under direct policy control. Our results point to the importance of a growth strategy avoiding overvaluation on the one hand, and to the futility of aiming at excessive undervaluation, on the other.
O47|Resilience to Economic Shrinking: A Social Capability Approach to Processes of Catching up in the Developing World 1951-2016|This paper highlights and assesses the importance of the role of economic shrinking for the long-term growth process in the developing world over the period 1951-2016. On the basis of descriptive analysis it shows that resilience to shrinking, even among the miracle economies in Pacific Asia, plays a more important role for successful catching up than economic growth per se. The paper then proposes and elaborates on a novel way of how to understand resilience to shrinking and argues that five interrelated social capabilities are of special significance: inclusive and broad based economic growth; engagement in more complex and transformative economic activities; generation of social arrangements for conflict resolution; the state’s autonomy against vested interests; and the state’s accountability in delivering public goods. The implication of the paper is that economic development would be better encouraged by strengthening these social capabilities rather than focusing on the short-term growth rate.
O47|The Social Capability Index and Income Convergence|Domestic social capabilities are a set of national characteristics for understanding why some countries grow faster than others. Yet there is no clear agreement on the main characteristics of these capabilities and therefore they have been neglected in the income convergence debate. The paper presents an index for revisiting the role of social capabilities in this debate. A relatively socially advanced society is more likely to improve the prospects of income convergence. The index is restricted to 4 capabilities: diversify the economy (transformation), distribute the benefits of growth (inclusion), control price inflation (autonomy) and provide public goods (accountability). Using a sample of 27 countries from Africa, Asia and Latin America over the period 1990-2010, we show that this set of capabilities is related to income growth and to long run performance in manufacturing. The index confirms the consolidation of the East Asian tigers and the rise of China, but the laggard performance on India. Indonesia represents the median in the index, surrounded by Latin American countries like Venezuela and Brazil. In the African context, we see Mauritius standing further away from Ethiopia, South Africa and Nigeria.
O47|Feeding the people: grain yields and agricultural expansion in Qing China|We use modern econometric methods to analyze a recently-released sample of 3 000 Chinese grain yields. We find significant variation across provinces and persistent increases in yields over time – albeit slow compared to Europe and the New World. Growth rates for rice (the primary southern crop) and dry land crops (the primary northern crops) were similar. We show that provinces were more extensively farmed when yields and population pressure were high, and that extending production put downward pressure on yields. Overall, Chinese farmers avoided the problem of agricultural involution by efficiently boosting output at the extensive margin, not the intensive margin.
O47|Macro-economic Measures for a Globalised World: Global Growth and Inflation|In this paper we offer a framework for measuring global growth and inflation built on an index number theory and practice; standard national accounts principles; and the concepts and methods for international macroeconomic comparisons. Our approach provides a sound basis for the estimates of purchasing power parity and exchange-rate based global growth regularly published by IMF, the World Bank and the United Nations. It also rectifies deficiencies in the current procedures used in measuring global inflation. For illustrative purposes, we present our estimates of global growth and inflation using data for 141 countries for the years 2005 and 2011. Contribution of movements in exchange rates and purchasing power parities to global inflation are presented.
O47|Quantifying and Accounting for Quality Differences in Services in International Price Comparisons: A Bilateral Price Comparison between United States and Japan|Purchasing power parities (PPPs) from the International Comparison Program (ICP) are used for cross-country comparisons of price levels and real gross domestic product (GDP), household consumption and investment. PPPs from the ICP are also used in compiling internationally comparable output aggregates and making productivity comparisons in the KLEMS initiative. PPP compilation is anchored on the principle of comparing the like with like and price data are collected for goods and services with detailed specifications in the form of structural product descriptions. While this approach works well for goods, it is not effective in the case of services. If differences in service quality exist, these get reflected in the PPPs from the ICP. In this paper, we focus on the USA-Japan bilateral price comparison in the 2014 ICP in the OECD region and estimate bias induced by differences in quality of services in. Service quality is driven by various unobservable factors. In this paper we make use of data on quality differences and consumers’ willingness to pay collected through a specialised survey conducted by the Japan Productivity Center early in 2017. Data are collected from a large sample of 517 respondents from USA and 519 respondents from Japan, covering 28 service items including transport, restaurants, retail services, health and education. Estimates of consumers’ willingness to pay for quality differences in services by the US and Japanese consumers are obtained using standard econometric methodology, these are in turn used in estimating quality adjustment factors that can be applied to price data used in PPP computation. Using the Sato-Vartia index, which has useful analytical and decomposition properties, we find PPP for household consumption (including real estate services) of 113 JPY per US dollar reduces to 104 JPY per dollar after adjusting for quality differences. When real estate services are not included, PPP reduces from 95 JPY to 87 JPY after quality adjustment. The paper also presents labour productivity estimates before and after quality adjustment for a number of service sectors including transport and storage; retail trade; hotels and restaurants; and other subsectors. Our exploratory study demonstrates that adjustment for quality differences in services is feasible and such adjustments are important for making meaningful international price comparisons.

O47|産業別労働生産性の国際比較 : 水準とダイナミクス|供給サイドの制約（例：労働力人口の減少）に直面する日本において、生産性向上が実務・政策面における最重要課題の一つとなっている。生産性向上に向けた効果的な方策を検討するためには、生産性を巡る現状を正確に理解する必要があるだろう。こうした問題意識を踏まえて、本稿では、まず、分析用のデータセットが入手可能な最新年次である2015年の産業レベルデータを用いることで、近年の日本における産業別労働生産性が他の先進諸国（米、独、英、仏）に比してどの程度の「水準」にあるのかを確認する。その上で、2015年までの約20年間に亘る産業別労働生産性に関する成長パターン（ダイナミクス）を、その構成要素である「付加価値」（アウトプット）と「労働投入」（インプット）の変動に分解して描写する。本稿での主たる発見は以下の通りである。第一に、日本の非製造業における近年の低労働生産性水準は、労働投入の減少ではカバー出来ない付加価値の低下を主因として生じている。第二に、製造業の幾つかの業種では、これらの両要素に関する多様な変動を通じて労働生産性の成長を実現している。第三に、これらの結果を他国の産業別労働生産性水準でベンチマークした場合、ごく一部の業種（例：対事業所サービス）を除いて、ほぼ全ての日本の産業において米国に比して労働生産性水準が低下している。第四に、こうした過去20年に亘る産業別労働生産性のダイナミクスを各年毎に対前年比で記述したところ、長期のダイナミクスの背後に、短期における多様なダイナミクスが存在していることが確認された。

O47|Productivity in Emerging Market Economies: Slowdown or Stagnation?|This paper analyzes productivity growth trends in emerging-market economies vis-à-vis advanced economies, both in the recent global productivity slowdown and from a long-term perspective. While income has converged in most countries in the last three decades, total factor productivity has diverged. Periods of high productivity growth coincide with episodes of output accelerations, while during normal times productivity growth is modest. Most recently, the correlation between productivity growth in emerging markets and advanced economies has increased. This paper analyzes potential factors explaining this increase, which presumably is due to the slowdown in trade and microeconomic factors that underlie technology diffusion. It concludes with a discussion of long-term challenges and opportunities facing emerging-market economies in a low productivity environment.
O47|R&D offshoring and home industry productivity|Offshoring R&D commonly invokes concerns regarding the loss of high value jobs and a hollowing out of technological capabilities, but it can also benefit domestic firms by enabling them to tap into the global technological frontier. We study the effect of R&D offshoring on industrial productivity in the home country using industry-level data for 18 OECD countries over a 26-year period. Simultaneity between productivity and R&D offshoring is addressed by using foreign tax policy as an instrument for offshored R&D. We show that R&D offshoring contributes positively to productivity in the home country, irrespective of the host country destination.
O47|The role of openness in economic growth of regions. The perspectives of economic growth and new economic geography theory and empirics|The bond between economic growth and openness of regions is a complex and to some extent ambiguous both from theoretical and empirical perspectives. The relationship becomes even more blurred if we take into account spatial nonlinearity into account. In the present paper we critically review the theoretical and empirical literature in the two strands – economic growth and new economic geography. It seems that thee analysis of the impact of openness on economic growth of regions should take into account the various potential channels, try to prove the direction of causality and acknowledge the presence of spatial interlinkages between regions. This is in particular important for mid-size and large-size economies with a significant number of regions and large regional heterogeneity frequently due to more deep-rooted factors. It implies the use of spatial econometric techniques.
O47|The role of infrastructure efficiency in economic development – the case of underused highways in Europe|In this paper, we establish a two way causality between the phenomenon of the infrastructure which is underused (the so called “white elephant case”) and the aggregate productivity level (TFP) of the economy. On the one hand, the fact that a transport infrastructure is not used so much as it could be is itself a cause of low TFP, because it represents a low productivity for an important item of social capital. On the other hand, low aggregate productivity makes firms strategies founded on large scale of production and exports more risky, given the possibility that the political decision to build the required transport infrastructure may never be taken.
O47|Financial Development and Economic Growth: A Study for OECD Countries in the Context of Crisis|We revisit the relationship between economic growth and financial development in OECD countries during the period 1990-2016, paying special attention to the recent economic crisis. Using a random effects model, we find that an increase in domestic credit provided by the financial-sector, in market capitalization and in the turnover ratio of domestic shares entails a significant positive effect on per capita GDP. We also find different effects during the period of the crisis on domestic credit provided by the financial-sector and on market capitalization. Among other socioeconomic determinants related to economic growth, expenditure in education, inflation and unemployment rates appear highly significant for economic growth of the analysed countries.
O47|Optimal Tax Structure for Consumption and Income Inequality:an Empirical Assessment|In the present empirical analysis, we try to assess the impact of taxation on investment, growth. In particular, and by using gross fixed capital formation as a proxy for investment, we intend to evaluate the impact of the taxation structure in investment dynamics, in a short and a long-run perspectives. This empirical exercise was conducted for all OECD countries, during the 1980-2015 period. Through panel data econometric techniques, we find optimal tax-investment threshold values, especially higher for short-term than for long-term horizon. In addition, we find optimal income taxation around 9%, in percentage of GDP, an average optimal value of 12.7% for consumption taxes to promote annual investment growth.
O47|The sinful side of taxation: is it possible to satisfy the government hunger for revenues while promoting economic growth?|In this study we try to evaluate both linear and non-linear relationships between each tax item and real per capita growth. Our analysis, conducted for all the OECD countries between 1980 and 2015 and by resorting to panel data techniques in a short and long-term basis, evidences tax items threshold values for all tax components (except for taxes on individual income). In particular, for long-run economic performance, we obtain optimal threshold values for social security contributions between 7.0% and 12.43%. Lastly, our results provide some conclusions, highlighting the raise of some taxes, in GDP terms, without harming economic growth evolution.

O47|Resource Misallocation in European Firms: The Role of Constraints, Firm Characteristics and Managerial Decisions|Using a new survey, we document high dispersion of marginal revenue products across firms in the European Union (EU). To interpret this dispersion, we develop a portable framework to quantify gains from better allocation of resources. We demonstrate that apart from direct measures of distortions, firm characteristics, such as demographics, quality of inputs, utilization of resources, and dynamic adjustment of inputs, are predictors of the marginal revenue products of capital and labor. We emphasize that some firm characteristics may reflect compensating differentials rather than constraints and the effect of constraints on the dispersion of marginal products may hence be smaller than has been assumed in the literature. We show that cross-country differences in the dispersion of marginal products in the EU are largely due to differences in how the business, institutional and policy environment translates firm characteristics into outcomes rather than to the differences in firm characteristics per se. Removing distortions could raise EU aggregate productivity by 40 percent or more.
