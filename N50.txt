N50|Is irrigation driven by the economic value of internationally traded agricultural products?|A recent trend of literature investigates how international trade compensates or accentuates the differences in countries' endowments in water resources and whether trade regulation should be used to improve the use of water resources at the global level. In this paper, we develop a simple model establishing a positive link between the demand for irrigation water of agricultural producers and the international price of irrigated goods. Unlike previous works, that focus on the cost of water resources, we emphasize the price of traded goods as a key element of the shadow value of water used in agriculture. We test our model empirically using data on 159 irrigated crops exported by 183 countries, and find that countries' irrigation behavior is strongly linked to the global price of crops. This indicates that agricultural producers internalize the price of irrigation water. The export price effect is stronger when countries are net exporters of irrigated crops and weaker for internationally traded crops that constitute a pillar of most countries' domestic food security, such as cereals. Our results provide elements for the broader issue of the economically efficient use of water resources in agriculture.
N50|Míster Ford en el Océano|Este trabajo busca aproximarse al desarrollo del sistema fordista en la pesca. Dicho sistema, difundido en la industria agroalimentaria en Estados Unidos en los años treinta, por asimilación de los cambios operados en la industria de bienes de consumo duradero, fue replicado por el conjunto de sectores agrícolas occidentales tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Los cambios en el modelo industrial permitieron incrementar sustancialmente la productividad, asentando un sistema de acumulación basado en la producción y el consumo masivo. La nueva naturaleza industrial también afectó a la pesca. La exigencia de recursos abundantes y homogéneos impuesta por la tecnología pesquera de tipo fordista, impulsó la intensificación y la mundialización de la actividad, generando nuevas dinámicas económicas y ecológicas. En las siguientes páginas abordaremos, primero, la difusión del fordismo en la industria agroalimentaria y la incorporación del pescado a las nuevas formas de consumo; a continuación, analizaremos su plasmación en la actividad pesquera, las nuevas formas de aprovechamiento y conservación del pescado; después, estudiaremos los factores que proporcionaron consistencia al sistema en los años sesenta y setenta; sus bases tecnológicas y su excepcional marco institucional y económico.
N50|The Development of Modern Agricultural History within Economic History in Spain|This paper analyses the evolution of modern agricultural history in Spain within the framework of the development of the discipline of economic history. This analysis is divided into five thematic parts: production, productivity and technical change; the international insertion of Spanish agriculture; the institutional framework; long-term visions; and finally, recent developments and some deficits. It is interesting to emphasize that research on agricultural economic history in Spain has been carried out adopting methodologies, questions and developments similar to those of researchers from other advanced countries. Spanish agricultural economic history is one of the most powerful in the international context.
N50|Is irrigation driven by the economic value of internationally traded agricultural products?|A recent trend of literature investigates how international trade compensates or accentuates the differences in countries' endowments in water resources and whether trade regulation should be used to improve the use of water resources at the global level. Unlike previous works that focus on the cost of water resources, this paper emphasizes the price of traded goods as a key element of the shadow value of water used in agriculture. We use a simple production model to establish a positive link between the demand for irrigation water and the international price of irrigated crops. We test our model empirically using data on 243 irrigated crops exported by 185 countries, and find that higher-priced products are irrigated more intensively. This indicates that agricultural producers internalize the price of irrigation water. The effect is stronger when countries are net exporters of irrigated crops and weaker for crops essential for reaching food security, such as cereals. Our results imply that trade policy is a pertinent instrument to incite or deter the use of irrigation water across products, easier to implement than a differentiated water pricing policy, especially in water-scarce developing countries.
N50|Revisiting water and economic growth from a long-term perspective|Water use has increased notably throughout the world over the last 250 years. The industrial revolution and the long-term economic growth processes, first experienced by Western countries, and then by many other regions, put growing pressure on water resources. If we focus on economic growth, structural change and the rise in per capita income have been key factors in explaining water use trajectories. In addition, population growth has also boosted water needs worldwide. On the contrary, the increase in water use efficiency, mostly driven by technological developments, but also by improved institutions and environmental awareness, has slowed down water requirements. In this general context, our study aims to analyse the drivers of water use from a long-term perspective. More specifically, we analyse world and regional trends in water use over the last century and their relationships with population, economic growth and technological change. We pay particular attention to the second half of the last century and the twenty-first century, given the rising demands linked to trade, the emergence of new economies with increasing per capita income and demands and the smooth technological change observed in developed countries.
N50|Revisiting the Natural Resource ‘Curse’ in the Context of Trade in Value Added: Enclave or High-development Backward Linkages?|This paper puts forward and empirically tests the conjecture that specialisation in Natural Resource Industries (NRI) might not necessarily be a ‘curse’ for (developing) countries, if it provides opportunities for export diversification in backward linked sectors à la Hirschman. We first revisit the evolution of the debate around the NRI ‘curse’, including those from scholars sceptical of diversification based on beneficiation from NRI. We then empirically test whether NRI might represent a sufficient “domestic representative demand” à la Linder for backward linked sectors such as Knowledge Intensive Business Services (KIBS) or high tech manufacturing that might provide new opportunities for export diversification led by virtuous pathways of domestic structural change. We find empirical support for this conjecture and discuss some implications that revisit the NRI curse debate.
N50|Electricity and the role of the state: New Zealand and Uruguay before state-led development (1870-1930)|The configuration of a “modern” production structure requires there to be sufficient energy supply at competitive costs to justify exploiting the corresponding natural resources. New Zealand’s better economic performance, since the last third of the 19th century in coal production and better natural conditions to generate electric energy at low cost –thus offering energy at low prices– explain, at least partially, the differences with respect to Uruguay. New Zealand's advantage in energy endowments facilitated the development of a dairy sector, certain energy-intensive manufactures and a more efficient use of railways that reinforced the differences between the two economies. However, endowments are not the complete story and the institutional arrangements are another relevant factor of differentiation. Our argument is based on the concept of endogeneity of natural resources and we use it to prove the hugely different roles of states in the creation and management of the electricity systems. These differences were not related to the extent of state intervention but to the achievements of such action. This action aimed at improving the welfare conditions in the case of Uruguay without paying enough attention to those aspects related to the production conditions; instead, in New Zealand, the productive development was the focus of the public intervention. The result was the creation of differential production conditions that explain the long-run divergent economic performance in terms of sector diversification and international competitiveness in favour of New Zealand.
N50|Agriocliometrics and Agricultural Change in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries|Before the industrial revolution, agriculture was the most important economic activity of traditional societies. The spread of industrialisation processes, first throughout a large part of the western world and later across many more countries, gave rise to an abundance of literature on the role of agriculture in these processes. The initial perspectives offered by economic history, particularly for the British case, and the approaches of development economics specialists, largely based on previous studies by economic historians, became subject to reconsideration when numerous studies emerged that, from a cliometric point of view, sought to evaluate the changes experienced by agriculture and their contribution to economic growth. In this context, the objective of this study is to use these contributions to analyse the profound transformations that have occurred in agriculture around the world over the last two centuries.
N50|Structural transformation to manufacturing and services: what role for trade?|Understanding how and why economies structurally transform as they grow is crucial for sound national policy making. Typically analysts of this issue focus on sectoral shares of GDP and employment. This paper extends that to include exports, including of services. It also considers mining in addition to agriculture and manufacturing, and recognizes some of the products of those four sectors are nontradable. The theory section’s general equilibrium model provides hypotheses about structural change in different types of economies as they grow, and tests them econometrically with annual data for a sample of 117 countries for the period 1991-2014. The results point to the futility of adopting protective policies aimed at slowing de-agriculturalization and subsequent de-industrialization in terms of sectoral shares, since those trends inevitably will accompany economic growth. Fortuitously governments now have far more efficient and equitable ways of supporting the adjustments needed by people choosing or being pushed to leave declining industries.
N50|Exporting Pollution|Despite awareness of the detrimental impact of CO2 pollution on the world climate, countries vary widely in how they design and enforce environmental laws. Using novel micro data about firms’ CO2 emissions levels in their home and foreign countries, we document that firms headquartered in countries with strict environmental policies perform their polluting activities abroad in countries with relatively weaker policies. These effects are stronger for firms in high-polluting industries and with poor corporate governance characteristics. Although firms export pollution, they nevertheless emit less overall CO2 globally in response to strict environmental policies at home.
N50|Transition to Agriculture and First State Presence: A Global Analysis|It has often been observed that the emergence of states in a region is typically preceded by an earlier transition to agricultural production. Using new data on the date of first state emergence within contemporary countries, we present a global scale analysis of the chronological relationship between the transition to agriculture and the subsequent emergence of states. We find statistically significant relationships between early reliance on agriculture and state age in all sub-samples. Our findings show that this relationship is not markedly different in cases where states were imposed from outside or when they emerged through internal origination.
N50|Why 1990 international Geary-Khamis dollars cannot be a foundation for reliable long run comparisons of GDP|Using a large, new dataset of agricultural prices and quantities for many countries and regions, we create five new international Geary-Khamis pounds – for 1870, 1845, 1775, 1705, and a superior chained series. We show that estimated levels and changes in output per worker look very different – more extreme – using 1705 international pounds and 1990 international dollars, compared to all other series; growth rates appear substantially higher using 1990 international dollars. In short, out-of-sample baskets and/or prices create extremely unreliable output estimates. We also show that individual country price indices (rather than international indices) can generate substantially different estimated growth rates.
N50|Two Blades of Grass: The Impact of the Green Revolution|We examine the impact of the Green Revolution, defined as the discusion of high-yielding crop varieties (HYVs), on aggregate economic outcomes in developing countries during the second half of the 20th century. We use time variation in the development and discusion of HYVs of 10 major crops, and the spatial variation in agro-climatically suitability for growing them, to identify the causal effects of adoption. In a sample of 84 counties, we estimate that a 10 percentage points increase in HYV adoption increases GDP per capita by about 15 percent. This effect is fully accounted for by a combination of the direct effect on crop yields, factor adjustment in agriculture, and structural transformation. Our analysis also reveals that the Green Revolution reduced fertility and that the reduction was only partly ofset by decreasing mortality rates. The net effect on population growth was therefore negative.

N50|Assessing Implementation of Environmental Provisions in Regional Trade Agreements|This report assesses the progress of the implementation of environmental provisions in RTAs. It focuses on the extent to which governments have complied with the environmental commitments made in the trade agreements to which they are a Party. The report takes a two track approach. First, a review of implementation and evaluation reports associated with environmental provisions in such agreements is performed. Second, a survey of government officials, trade negotiators and other experts is carried out.

N50|Long Run Trends and Fluctuations In Cotton Prices|One revelation from the 2008 Global Financial Crisis was the fragility of models and assumptions based on samples too short to include periods of high volatility, and this study attempts to remedy that short-coming for USDA’s development of long run cotton price projections. Real cotton prices have fallen significantly since 1900, but statistical verification of the presence of a long-run downward trend has proven elusive. Cotton price volatility has varied widely over the last 226 years, largely correlated with macroeconomic instability. Cotton’s period of greatest instability—during the U.S. Civil War—was primarily driven by cotton-specific trade and production disruptions, but since the Civil War, cotton volatility has largely coincided with broader commodity price volatility. One of cotton’s most volatility\e episodes since 18th century occurred over 2009-12, and was in part a consequence of nearly unprecedented macroeconomic instability and, in part due to factors specific to cotton markets. Looking ahead, cotton price volatility over 2018-27 is likely to be greater than the volatility experienced during 2016-17, when volatility was unusually low, likely reduced by China’s large sales from its National Reserve.
N50|An Assessment of Association between Natural Resources Agglomeration and Unemployment in Pakistan|Mostly, economists believe that due to non-existence of agglomeration economies, there are less chances of employment spatial distribution in an economy. Following the strands of previous literature about agglomeration special impacts, this study has uplifted the curtain from some interesting realities. This study has examined the association between unemployment and natural resources agglomeration in Pakistan from 1980 to 2016. For measuring natural resources agglomeration, an index has been constructed based on coal production, oil production, forest area and agricultural land as a percentage of total land area. The study utilized autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method of co-integration. The results show that natural resources agglomeration, secondary school enrollment, foreign direct investment and inflation have a negative and significant impact on unemployment in Pakistan. The results reveal that population is putting a positive impact on unemployment in Pakistan. The study finds that natural resources agglomeration is an important factor for reducing unemployment in Pakistan. There are some other factors for agglomeration economies, i.e. Local economic policies, natural resources availability and amount of manpower for employment spatial distribution in Pakistan. So, efforts are needed to mega scale for exploration, proper usage and the functioning of natural resources in Pakistan.

N50|Inmersión en los ecosistemas digitales, una forma de mejora de la educación en las áreas rurales en Colombia<BR>[Immersion in digital ecosystems, a way to improve education in rural areas in Colombia]|From the social, economic and educational gaps that prevail today in rural areas of Colombia, it is necessary to think of alternatives that seek to improve such situation. Thus, as technologies and the immersion of these in educational processes become a possible response, which would ensure an improvement in coverage and quality in education, however, this presents multiple challenges that will be taken into account in the development of work, in addition to the conceptualization of digital ecosystems and how they achieve an impact on education from the implementation of them in schools. Without leaving aside, the peasant economies and what they mean.
N50|What’s in the annual database of Global Wine Markets, 1835 to 2016?|This paper documents a new, unique annual database of global wine markets covering 1835 to 2016. The database expands enormously the opportunities for conducting studies on wine production, consumption and trade from an historical perspective for the world as a whole and for most relevant countries. The combination of this basic information with other economic variables such as real GDP, population, total merchandise trade, total crop area and the consumption of other alcoholic drinks has enabled us to generate myriad derived variables that are helpful for comparative analyses as well as for studying the two waves of globalization.
N50|La Historia Agraria contemporánea española en claroscuro|This study analyses the trajectory of the Spanish rural history in the last decades. For the aims of this work, we have limited to the rural history of the late modern period. Though the evolution of the discipline is analysed since the seventies, we presents special attention to the evolution of historiography during the last 15 years. Both historiographical changes and institutional dynamics of the profession are considered. In the first section, we analyze the path of the discipline up to the turning point of 2001. In the second section, we analyze the recent institutional changes and the problems arisen from the economic crisis and the reduction of the research budgets in Spain. In the last section, we show some of the topics and recent debates that, in our opinion, can be more promising for the future of the contemporary rural history research in Spain.
N50|El paisaje rural medieval: del estudio de los dominios monásticos a la arqueología agraria|This study analyses the main lines of research developed in medieval Rural History in the last twenty years in the Iberian Peninsula, both in the Andalusian society and in the Christian kingdoms. We present special attention to the take-off of agrarian archeology, the characterization of the medieval peasantry and the study of livestock.
N50|Spatial distribution of the international food prices: unexpected randomness and heterogeneity|"Global food prices are typically analysed in a times series framework to assess the causes of volatility and to highlight spikes, that are interpreted as a signal of food crises. We address the spatial dimension of the issue at hand by focusing on the spatial food price dispersion, at the country-scale, in the international food trade network (IFTN) for ten relevant commodities. We base our study on bilateral trade by focusing on both the ""internal"" variance, which indicates that an exporter sets di erent prices to different importers for the same commodity, and the ""external"" variance, that is a measure of market price competitiveness. We nd that spatial price dispersion is remarkable and persistent over time and that there exists a strict correlation between price spikes (in level) and peaks in spatial price variability. This entails that during price crises the market is more fragmented and a higher spatial price dispersion is found. Moreover, we implement a randomness test on the country-scale price distributions to test whether they can be replicated through a random process of extraction. It results that the actual distribution of prices of several commodities is well described by a random distribution. It follows that the process of data aggregation is not neutral because, in several cases, the information at the micro-level scale (firms' decision) is lost at the macro-scale due to the complexity of the international food trade network (IFTN). We suggest some possible economic explanations of this occurrence and we discuss the main methodological consequences."
N50|Genetic Diversity and Economic Development : Assessing the Key Findings in Ashraf and Galor (2013)|We replicate Ashraf and Galor (2013) and find that its conclusions concerning the association between human genetic diversity and economic development depend substantially on coding errors and sample selection. We correct the coding errors and add or update data on genetic diversity and population density from high-quality sources. We find little support for the hypothesis that variation in genetic diversity among subpopulations has a systematic relationship with economic development.
N50|The world periphery in Global Agricultural and Food Trade, 1900-2000|In the last two hundred years, agricultural trade has grown at a remarkably rapid rate. In the first globalizing wave, international trade was based on the exchange of primary products for manufactured goods. This provided important opportunities for complementarity in certain countries on the periphery that took advantage of the opportunity to base their economic development on the growth of their exports and the linkages between them and the rest of the economy. However, most of the agricultural exporting countries, obtained few benefits from this model of development. In the second wave of globalisation, an intra-industrial trade increasingly replaced this pattern of trade. In addition, the more developed countries tended to protect their agricultural production, which have been a major obstacle to agricultural trade.
N50|The persistent effects of novelty-seeking traits on comparative economic development|The issue of novelty-seeking traits have been related to important economic attitudes such as risk-taking, entrepreneurial, and explorative behaviors that foster technological progress and, thus, economic development. However, numerous molecular genetic studies have shown that novelty-seeking bearing individuals are prone to certain psychological “disadvantages” such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), leading to occupational and educational difficulties in modern societies. Using a recent compilation of DRD4 exon III allele frequencies – a particular gene variant that population geneticists have found to be sometimes associated with the human phenotype of novelty-seeking behavior – this paper advances a new country-level measure on the prevalence of novelty-seeking traits for a large number of countries worldwide. The results suggest a stable non-monotonic inverted U-shaped relationship between the country-level DRD4 exon III allele frequency measure and economic development. This finding is suggestive of the potential “benefits” and “costs” of novelty-seeking traits for the aggregate economy.
N50|The impact of crude oil prices on financial market indicators: copula approach|Oil price changes have varying impacts on the financial indicators of global markets and economies. This study aims to explore the dependence structure between crude oil prices and stock market indices, as well as the exchange rates in a number of economies categorized with respect to their status as developing/emerging markets, and oil importer/exporter countries. Dependence structures in this study are evaluated in considerable depth using copula models. The broad time period covered allows the investigation of the effect of global financial crisis on the mentioned dependence structure. An additional feature of this study is the inclusion of 1 to 30-day analysis to capture the variation of dependence on duration change. To serve these aims, as well as ARIMA and GARCH models, various copula measures are used to illustrate the level of the association. Additionally, a special focus on the Turkish case is given to illustrate its sensitivity to oil prices. We find that exchange rates and stock indices of most oil exporter countries show higher oil price dependency, whereas, emerging oil importer markets are less vulnerable to price fluctuations. Considerable impacts were found for the global crisis and the continuing recent sharp decrease in oil prices.
N50|Differential impacts of currency undervaluation on growth and exports in natural resource vs. manufacturing exporting countries|In the existing literature, we find a huge debate on the impact of exchange rate undervaluation (depreciation) on growth and exports. Some argue that undervaluation has positive effects on growth, especially in the case of developing countries. However there is ample criticism against the undervaluation leads to growth argument as well. The critics argue that large undervaluation discourages investment and in fact may lead to negative economic growth. Our premise is that the impact of currency undervaluation (overvaluation) would be different in countries with different exports structure, particularly between manufacturing vs. mineral exporting countries. This paper aims to analyze the differential impact of exchange rate undervaluation on growth and exports in different countries. We consider two sets of countries in our dataset-18 countries are included in manufactures- exporting sample while 16 countries are included in the minerals-exporting sample; Countries included in the former group have at least 70 percent share of manufactured products in total exports in 2010; while those in the latter contribute to more than 40 percent in total exports. This paper uses a cross sectional panel analysis using both five years average data and one year average data; pooled OLS, panel fixed effects, random effects estimations. It controls for the endogeneity problem by using a system generalized method of moments estimations. Estimation results of our study suggest currency overvaluation is good for mineral resource exporting countries. Moreover, results show a negative impact of undervaluation on growth and exports in both the long-run and the short-run for mineral and manufacture exporting countries. At the same time, negative coefficients on share of mineral exports on growth and exports implies the need of export diversification in many Latin American countries and Africa.
N50|The ecological footprint of early-modern commodities Coefficients of land use per unit of product|Land availability and overseas trade have been central topics in economic history. The current paper contributes to this literature by setting the empirical foundations necessary for the calculation of the direct ecological footprints of more than eighty traded commodities throughout the 19th and early 20th century. The main focus is placed upon products which were heavily traded by and within the British Empire during this period. Various secondary sources have been reviewed and are critically discussed while the methodological steps that have been followed for the calculation of an acreage conversion factor for each product are analyzed in detail. The data presented here can be useful for researchers examining the importance of ghost acreages and ecological footprint historically but also the role of natural resources and land use in a long term perspective.
N50|Between the Engine and the Fifth Wheel: An Analytical Survey of the Shifting Roles of Agriculture in Development Theory|Over the last decade, attention to agricultural development in less developed countries has increased. However, two opposing views on its role in economic development exist within the scholarly debate, either as a potential engine for economic growth or as a fifth wheel unlikely to generate transformative growth. Taking these contrary opinions as a point of departure, this paper reviews the origins of prominent views of the role of agriculture in development theory. Next it bibliometrically assesses the pattern of fluctuating scholarly attention to agriculture, and attempts to understand the reasons behind this pattern. The paper identifies four influential views on agriculture in development theory; five distinct phases of ups and downs in the scholarly attention to agriculture and discusses five potential reasons behind these fluctuations.
N50|The Expansion of Modern Agriculture and Global Biodiversity Decline: An Integrated Assessment|The world is banking on a major increase in food production, if the dietary needs and food preferences of an increasing, and increasingly rich, population are to be met. This requires the further expansion of modern agriculture, but modern agriculture rests on a small number of highly productive crops and its expansion has led to a significant loss of global biodiversity. Ecologists have shown that biodiversity loss results in lower plant productivity, while agricultural economists have linked biodiversity loss on farms with increasing variability of crop yields, and sometimes lower mean yields. In this paper we consider the macro-economic consequences of the continued expansion of particular forms of intensive, modern agriculture, with a focus on how the loss of biodiversity affects food production. We employ a quantitative, structurally estimated model of the global economy, which jointly determines economic growth, population and food demand, agricultural innovations and land conversion. We show that even small effects of agricultural expansion on productivity via biodiversity loss might be sufficient to warrant a moratorium on further land conversion.
N50|How do oil producers respond to giant oil field discoveries?|The classical Hotelling model predicts that the optimal extraction level rises immediately after an unexpected resource discovery, whereas, in reality, there are substantial adjustment costs in petroleum production and an average lag of several years between a discovery and the start of production. Using a large panel of country-level production data and a difference-in-differences identification approach, I show that domestic production levels respond before a newly found oil field comes on line and that this increase is driven by non-OPEC producers, consistent with different responses of OPEC and non-OPEC drilling activity. Offshore fields and exceptionally large “super-” or “mega-giant” fields are also more likely to raise country-level production. Given that domestic petroleum consumption rises by less in response to a discovery, at least part of the increase in production seems to go into (net) oil exports.
N50|Male-biased Demand Shocks and Women’s Labor Force Participation: Evidence from Large Oil Field Discoveries|We study whether male-biased demand shocks affect women's labor force participation (LFP), using major oil field discoveries in the US South between 1900 and 1940. We find that oil wealth has a zero net effect on female LFP due to two opposing channels. Increased male wages lead to a higher marriage rate of young women, which could have depressed female LFP. But at the same time, oil wealth also increases demand for female labor in services, which counterbalances the marriage effect.
N50|Valuing sunshine|Sunlight influences people's housing decisions, but city intensification may reduce sunlight exposure for neighboring properties, causing a negative externality. There are hitherto no rigorous estimates of the cost of this externality. Using over 5000 observations on house sales in Wellington, New Zealand, we derive the willingness to pay for an extra daily hour of sunlight, on average, across the year. After controlling for locational sorting and other considerations in an hedonic regression, we find that each extra daily hour of sunlight exposure is associated with a 2.6% increase in house sale price. This estimate is robust to a variety of alternative specifications in which we test for non-linearities and amplifying factors by interacting sunlight with a range of other influences. Our results can be used to price negative externalities caused by new development, so replacing or augmenting regulations designed to address impacts of development on neighbors’ sunshine.
N50|The Ant and the Grasshopper: Seasonality and the Invention of Agriculture|During the Neolithic Revolution, seven populations independently invented agriculture. In this paper, I argue that this innovation was a response to a large increase in climatic seasonality. In the most affected regions, hunter-gatherers abandoned their traditional nomadism in order to store food and smooth their consumption. Their new sedentary lifestyle greatly simplified the invention and adoption of agriculture. I present a model that captures the key incentives for adopting agriculture, and I test the resultant predictions against a global panel dataset of climate conditions and Neolithic adoption dates. I find that invention and adoption were both systematically more likely in places with higher seasonality. The findings of this paper imply that seasonality patterns 10,000 years ago were amongst the major determinants of the present day global distribution of crop productivities, ethnic groups, cultural traditions, and political institutions.
N50|Agricultural Returns to Labor and the Origins of Work Ethics|We examine the historical determinants of differences in preferences for work across societies today. Our hypothesis is that a society’s work ethic depends on the role that labor has played in it historically, as an input in agricultural production: societies that have for centuries depended on the cultivation of crops with high returns to labor effort will work longer hours and develop a preference for working hard. We formalize this prediction in the context of a model of endogenous preference formation, with altruistic parents that can invest in reducing their offsprings’ disutility from work. To empirically found our model, we construct an index of potential agricultural labor intensity, that captures the suitability of a location for the cultivation of crops with high estimated returns to labor in their production. We find that this index positively predicts work hours and attitudes towards work in contemporary European regions. We find support for the hypothesis of cultural transmission, by examining the correlation between potential labor intensity in the parents’ country of origin and hours worked by children of European immigrants in the US.
N50|Why Countries Shouldn't Sell Their Natural Resources To Foreigners|Years ago, I recommended that my City, my Polis, Gloucester, MA, never sell its natural resources to any outsider. Last year, with the passing of Fidel Castro, I saw a possibility for Cuba to become finally free. Naturally, I urged Cubans not to repeat the errors made by Russia and China at the collapse of communism; I urged Cubans not to sell their natural resources to the oligarchs, whether local or foreign. This time around, I also urged Cubans not to repeat the political errors of the past, namely trying to correct horrors of the left with horrors of the right; this time around I urged Cubans and anyone else who might want to hear to achieve a revolution from the center of the political system. With the forthcoming elections in Kenya, in the hope of averting the bloodshed that followed the 2007 elections there, I recently felt impelled to enlarge my focus to appeal to every nation in Africa, and the rest of the world for that matter, not to sell their natural resources to foreigners. The financial resources to achieve this goal are the same the world over: One must organize local financial resources, through: 1. Any such instrument as a Local Interdependence Fund; and 2. A reform of central bank operations to issue a) loans only to create real wealth; b) loans at cost; c) loans to benefit as many people as possible, hence loans to individual entrepreneurs, cooperatives, corporations with ESOPs and/or CSOPs, and to public agencies with taxing power to fund public works projects.
N50|Effects and characteristics of the implementation of the 1921 agrarian reform in Iași county|The historiographical and socio-economic topic of the 1918-1921 agrarian reform, marked by a considerable degree of difficulty due to a multitude of objective, quantitative as well as qualitative factors, represents a point of reference in the research endeavours focused on the social and economic evolution of Romania. In fact, the major difficulties in the scientific approaches dedicated to the reform initiated by decree in 1918 are inherently determined by the statistical and historical sources, the causes being the stages of registration, sampling, centralization and processing processes, as well as the material and personnel resources which were very limited at that time. The issue of statistical and economic data volume deficiencies can be easily observed upon consulting archived documents, which contain numerous modifications, alterations and other interventions, researchers encountering real difficulties in extracting data and exploiting their real potential. The effects of the 1921 agrarian reform on the evolution of the inter-war society of Iasi County were overall multiple and complex, influencing to a greater or lesser degree all spheres of activity: economy, politics, culture, a.s.o. Substantial changes in the agricultural property structure following the implementation of the agrarian reform resulted in the small peasant household as a basic economic unit in the primary sector of Iasi County. The inter-war agricultural censuses corroborated with the statistics compiled by the authorities show that land ownership in Iasi county underwent substantial changes, compared to the situation prior to the year 1918.
N50|Promovendo a subericultura? A política florestal de Espanha e Portugal (1852-1914)|Portugal currently leads worldwide all the facets of the cork business, from the forest market, through manufacturing and the trade of cork products. This scenario is enhanced with the fact that in Portugal the cork oak trees have the best conditions for their development. However, up to 1930s, this role was played by other countries, especially by Spain, and is important to understand the factors that contributed to this situation. Recent historiography has highlighted the public policies pursued by Portugal during the Estado Novo, in comparison with those followed by the Franco regime, as one of the main reasons for the rise of the portuguese cork sector, which includes forestry policy. Therefore, it’s important to carry out a similar exercise for the chronology in question, thus the aim of this work is to analyze, in a comparative perspective, the nineteenth-century forest and cereal policies of Portugal and Spain, in the latter case due to the implications that cereal protectionism had towards the cork oak forests. Legislative sources, technical reports and official agricultural statistics were used, and it was concluded that there was no clear advantage derived from any agroforestry public policy by the spanish cork industry compared to the portuguese one. In the matter of fact, as we will demonstrate, both States procedured with great similarity.
N50|Las bioenergÃ­as en EspaÃ±a. Una serie de producciÃ³n, consumo y stocks entre 1860 y 2010|This paper presents the methodological and statistical basis of a new data series of Spain's bioenergy consumption between 1860 and 2010. We have estimated the primary production, appropriation, and the type of final use of all woody biomass, which represents the most consumed bioenergy. The series distinguishes the production source, including forests, olives, vineyards, and the rest of woody fruit orchards, as well as regional disaggregation at partido judicial level (425 in Spain) between 1860 and 1960. The bioenergy consumption series is represented both in primary (by energy source) and final (by energy carrier) energy. Our findings point out that i) consumption was higher than traditionally assumed in the previous literature; ii) there are four major phases in the period, including a slow decline from 1860 to 1914, a return to firewood with a small increase until 1955, a rapid decline from then to 1980, and finally, a return to bioenergies (with modern uses) from 1980 to the present; iii) there are strong regional disparities in firewood consumption between 1860 and 1960, ranging from 1 to 5 kg hab-1 dÃ­a-1; iv) in the supply of bioenergies, geography also explains the type of product consumed: in Mediterranean provinces, woody crop-based consumption gained prominence, as they expanded over traditional forest areas; and v) stock of woody biomass has multiplied unprecedently since the mid-20th Century due to the abandonment of forestlands, the introduction of fast-growing species, and the optimal geographical allocation.

N50|200 years diversifying the energy mix? Diversification paths of the energy baskets of European early comers vs. latecomers|The changes in the composition of the energy basket in the long run lead to energy transitions. Primary energy substitution models allow addressing these phenomena. However, the diversification paths of the energy mix of different countries in a long term compared perspective have not been studied yet. This paper proposes an indicator, based on the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, the Energy Mix Concentration Index (EMCI), to quantify the degree of diversification of the primary energy basket of eight European countries over the last two centuries. The results reveal that early comers, which are large energy consumers, required a huge concentration of their energy basket in the 19th century; however, the observed countries had converged to similar levels of diversification of their energy mixes from the second half of the 20th century, and more crucially after the oil crises. For some countries, today’s degree of diversification is the largest in their energy histories, but it is not the case for all of them. Our results suggest that small energy consuming countries would be able to achieve higher diversification, and therefore to do a faster transition to a low carbon economy, than large energy consumers.
N50|Male-biased Demand Shocks and Women’s Labor Force Participation: Evidence from Large Oil Field Discoveries|Do male-biased demand shocks affect women’s labor force participation? To study this question, we examine large oil field discoveries in the US South from 1900-1940. We find that oil wealth has a zero net effect on female labor force participation due to two opposing channels. Oil discoveries increase demand for male labor in oil mining and manufacturing and consequentially raise male wages. This leads to an increased marriage rate of young women, which could have depressed female labor force participation. But at the same time, oil wealth also increases demand for women in services, which counterbalances the marriage effect and leaves women’s overall labor force participation rate unchanged. Our findings demonstrate that when the nontradable sector is open to women, male-biased de-mand shocks in the tradable sector need not reduce female labor force participation.

N50|Comparisons of Capital Input in OECD Agriculture, 1973-2011|This paper provides a farm sector comparison of relative levels of capital input for 17 OECD countries for the period 1973-2011, with an explicit distinction between land and depreciable assets. Methodologically, we adopt the constant efficiency model to derive capital services from capital stocks and construct the purchasing power parity between countries for crosscountry comparison. Our estimates show that, after accounting for cyclical fluctuation in the relative price of capital inputs, fifteen of the sixteen countries in the comparison had higher levels of capital input relative to the United States in 2011 than at the beginning of the sample period in 1973. Moreover, our analysis shows that increases in relative capital use on farms in OECD countries were accompanied by change in the structure of the capital input, away from land and towards depreciable capital items.
N50|The Danish agricultural revolution in an energy perspective: a case of development with few domestic energy sources|We examine the case of Denmark - a country which historically had next to no domestic energy resources - for which we present new historical energy accounts for the years 1800-1913. We demonstrate that Denmark’s take off at the end of the nineteenth century was relatively energy dependent. We relate this to her well-known agricultural transformation and development through the dairy industry, and thus complement the literature which argues that expensive energy hindered industrialization, by arguing that similar obstacles would have precluded other countries from a more agriculture-based growth. The Danish cooperative creameries, which spread throughout the country over the last two decades of the nineteenth century, were dependent on coal. Although Denmark had next to no domestic coal deposits, we demonstrate that her geography allowed cheap availability throughout the country through imports. On top of this we emphasize that another important source of energy was imported feed for the cows.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N50|Modelo para el análisis de la quiebra financiera en pymes agroindustriales antioqueñas|El riesgo de quiebra en el sector agroindustrial antioqueño no ha sido ampliamente explorado a partir de modelación estadística, que puede proveer importantes elementos y tendencias para conocer el comportamiento de este sector determinante en la economía regional. Este análisis se basó en un modelo lineal mixto, que utilizó como variable respuesta el puntaje obtenido con el índice Z de Altman, el cual es un índice latente estimado a partir de variables financieras observables y que, dependiendo de su valor, clasifica las empresas en solventes e insolventes. La metodología utilizada determinó, en primera instancia, el tamaño de muestra por subsector, y luego estimó el índice Z de Altman por empresa y año, para el periodo comprendido entre 2010-2014. Con dichos índices como respuesta por empresa, se estableció un modelo lineal mixto, que permitió identificar la presencia de cambios significativos entre los diferentes subsectores de la agroindustria antioqueña, para evaluar y diagnosticar problemas de insolvencia futuros para el sector.
N50|Two Blades of Grass: The Impact of the Green Revolution|We examine the impact of the Green Revolution, defined as the diffusion of high-yielding crop varieties (HYVs), on aggregate economic outcomes in developing countries during the second half of the 20th century. We use time variation in the development and diffusion of HYVs of 10 major crops, and the spatial variation in agro-climatically suitability for growing them, to identify the causal effects of adoption. In a sample of 84 counties, we estimate that a 10 percentage points increase in HYV adoption increases GDP per capita by about 15 percent. This effect is fully accounted for by a combination of the direct effect on crop yields, factor adjustment in agriculture, and structural transformation. Our analysis also reveals that the Green Revolution reduced fertility and that the reduction was only partly offset by decreasing mortality rates. The net effect on population growth was therefore negative.
N50|Long-run cultural divergence: Evidence from the Neolithic Revolution|This paper investigates the long-run influence of the Neolithic Revolution on contemporary cultural norms as reflected in the dimension of collectivism–individualism. We present a theory of agricultural origins of cultural divergence, where we claim that the advent of farming in a core region was characterized by collectivist values and eventually triggered the out-migration of individualistic farmers towards more and more peripheral areas. This migration pattern caused the initial cultural divergence, which remained persistent over generations. Using detailed data on the date of adoption of Neolithic agriculture among Western regions and countries, the empirical findings show that the regions which adopted agriculture early also value obedience more and feel less in control of their lives. The findings add to the literature by suggesting the possibility of extremely long-lasting norms and beliefs influencing today's socioeconomic outcomes.
N50|Gold and silver manipulation: What can be empirically verified?|The issue of gold and silver price manipulation, in particular price suppression, is examined. We use a mixture of normal approach to decompose the returns into abnormal and control samples. Price suppression is a form of market manipulation of the runs type, where longer negative runs with lower returns than expected would be observed. To explore whether this form of manipulation can be empirically detected the length of runs and the total return observed during a run were computed for modelled abnormal and control clusters in gold and silver. In both metals the proportion of negative runs in the abnormal cluster is greater than the proportion of negative runs in the control cluster. In both cases the average return for negative runs is significantly lower in the abnormal cluster than in the control cluster. When average returns over positive runs are compared the abnormal group has significantly higher expected returns than the control group. Given the short maximum run lengths in the abnormal cluster and the fact that positive runs have significantly higher average returns in the abnormal cluster than in the control cluster, it is likely that that the high volatility associated with the abnormal cluster is the driver of the results presented in this study, as opposed to manipulation.
N50|On the use of palynological data in economic history: New methods and an application to agricultural output in Central Europe, 0–2000AD|In this paper we introduce a new source of data to economic history: palynological data or, in other words, information about pollen grains which are preserved in the bottom sediments of various water basins. We discuss how this data is collected and how it should be interpreted; develop new methods for aggregating this information into regional trends in agricultural output; construct an extensive dataset with a large number of pollen sites from Central Europe; and use our methods to study the economic history of Greater Poland, Lesser Poland, Bohemia, Brandenburg, and Lower Saxony since the first century AD.
N50|Income inequality and the oil resource curse|Surprisingly, there has been little research conducted about the cross-country relationship between oil dependence/abundance and income inequality. At the same time, there is some tentative evidence suggesting that oil rich nations tend to under-report data on income inequality, which can potentially influence the estimated empirical relationships between oil richness and income inequality. In this paper we contribute to the literature in a twofold manner. First, we explore in depth the empirical relationship between oil and income inequality by making use of the Standardized World Income Inequality Database – the most comprehensive dataset on income inequality providing comparable data for the broadest set of country-year observations. Second, this is the first study to our knowledge that adopts an empirical framework to examine whether oil rich nations tend to under-report data on income inequality and the possible implications thereof. We make use of Heckman selection models to validate the tendency of oil rich countries to under-report and correct for the bias that might arise as a result of this – we find that oil is associated with lower income inequality with the exception of the very oil-rich economies.
N50|The global EKCs|A substantial fraction of the production in the emerging economies satisfies the consumption in the developed countries. This causes the notorious carbon leakage problem where the embodied carbon emissions in exports are not counted in the traditional territorial production-based emission accounting (PBA). We calculate the consumption-based emissions using latest available Eora data in a multiregional input–output (MRIO) model and then perform fixed effect and random effect panel regressions, dynamic panel regression, and heterogeneous panel regressions using the PBA data and consumption-based accounting (CBA) obtained from the MRIO model. The results show that the inverted-U-shaped Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) does not exist for CBA. Indeed, results obtained in this paper show that the consumption-based EKC is linearly increasing.
N50|What drives commodity price booms and busts?|What drives commodity price booms and busts? We provide evidence on the dynamic effects of commodity demand shocks, commodity supply shocks, and inventory demand shocks on real commodity prices. In particular, we analyze a new data set of price and production levels for 12 agricultural, metal, and soft commodities from 1870 to 2013. We identify differences in the type of shock driving prices of the various types of commodities and relate these differences to commodity types which reflect differences in long-run elasticities of supply and demand. Our results show that demand shocks strongly dominate supply shocks.

N50|The mining sectors in Chile and Norway, ca. 1870 - 1940: the development of a knowledge gap|Chile and Norway are two ‘natural resource intensive economies’, which have had different development trajectories, yet are closely similar in industrial structure and geophysical conditions. The questions of how and why Chile and Norway have developed so differently are explored through an analysis of how knowledge accumulation occurred and how it was transformed by learning into technological innovation in mining, a sector which has long traditions in Norway and has by far been the largest export sector in Chile for centuries. Similar types of ‘knowledge organisations’ with the direct aim of developing knowledge for mining were developed in both countries. Formal mining education, scientifically trained professionals, organisations for technology transfer and geological mapping and ore surveys are compared in search of differences which may explain the underlying reasons for variations in economic growth.
N50|Unequal lands: Soil type, nutrition and child mortality in southern Sweden, 1850-1914|Child mortality differed greatly within rural regions in Europe before and during the mortality decline. Not much is known about the role of nutrition in such geographic differences, and about the factors affecting the nutritional level and hence the resistance to diseases. Focusing on nutrition, we analyse the effects of soil type, used as an indicator of the farm-level agricultural productivity and hence of nutritional status, on mortality of children aged 1-15 living in five rural parishes in southern Sweden, 1850-1914. Using longitudinal demographic data combined with unique geographic micro-data on residential histories, the effect of soil type on the mortality risks are analysed considering as outcome all-cause mortality and mortality from non-airborne and airborne infectious diseases. Soil type primarily affected the mortality of farmers’ children, but not labourers’ children. Particularly, farmers’ children residing in areas with very high proportions of clayey till (75-100% coverage) experienced lower risks of dying compared to children residing in areas with other soil types such as clay and sandy soils. Certain soil types seem to have influenced the agricultural productivity, which, in turn, affected the nutrition of the farmers’ children and thus their likelihood of dying. The results indicate a relatively important role of nutrition as a mortality predictor for these children. As, to our knowledge, the first longitudinal study on the micro-level that analyses the effects of soil type on mortality in a historical rural society, we contribute to the literature on the role of nutrition on the risk of dying in a pre-industrial society
N50|Air Emissions Performance: A Dynamic Analysis for Spain|This paper investigates the dynamic performance of air pollution in Spain from 1960 to 2010. First, we evaluate the relationship between economic growth and pollution through the Environmental Kuznets Curve. Second, we test the hypothesis of regional convergence in air pollution intensity from 1995 to 2010, in order to analyse whether regional taxes intended to abate emissions have been effective. For the first issue, our results show that a quadratic relationship is satisfied, but an out-of-sample turning point is generated. For the second, regional convergence is rejected, although those regions which haveimplemented a pollution tax seem to perform differently.
N50|Is Africa’s dependence on agriculture the cause of poverty in the continent? An empirical review|The continent of Africa is blessed with natural resources and most especially large expanse of land area suitable for agricultural production. But despite this huge deposit of untapped resources and opportunities in the continent, it is very appalling to know that many of the countries in Africa are homes to the poorest of the poor and vulnerable people across the globe. The continent is faced with multi-faceted problems of insecurity arising from the activities of violent extremists and marginalized sect, decaying infrastructural facilities exacerbated by corruption and prolonged neglect, rising youth unemployment occasioned by bad governance and inadequate planning coupled with dwindling income resulting from poor and inadequate production technologies. However, in spite of the worsening food crisis situation and constraints to agricultural transformation in Africa, agriculture, which is the main source of livelihood for most Africans (especially those residing in the rural areas) remains the economic nerve centre considering its contribution to the African economy in terms of labor employment and share of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Thus, the task of poverty reduction in Africa portends a moving target as the number of poor and undernourished people keeps increasing. This paper therefore examined the link between agriculture and poverty in Africa. The problems and prospects of African agriculture were x-rayed, the poverty situation in Africa and the likely causes were also highlighted. The paper suggests a bottom-up (also called community-driven development) approach to policy formulation through involvement of farmers in policy discussions at both national and international levels starting from project/problem identification to evaluation. There is the need for partnerships between government and private sector in the area of input and infrastructure provision. This is very important considering the fact that government alone can no longer shoulder the responsibility of providing and maintaining infrastructures due to declining revenue. Farm level processing and value addition should be encouraged by government through the provision of enabling environment and farmers should endeavour to join and participate in cooperative activities so as to enhance their access to credit, markets and benefit from collective bargaining power in terms of input acquisition and getting support from government and prospective funders.
N50|The Effects of Oil Supply and Demand Shocks on U.S. Consumer Sentiment|This paper investigates how the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment responds to oil price shocks. While oil supply shocks play only a limited role, the effect of aggregate demand shocks is positive for the first few months and negative thereafter. A typical other oil demand shock has a significant negative impact for up to 2 years. By studying the responses of individual survey questions, we find that expectations of future inflation and a change in real household income as well as perceived vehicle and house buying conditions are the main transmission channels of oil supply and demand shocks.
N50|Institutional Reform in the Rural Sector with Labor and Capital Flows: Factor Income Effects, Structural Changes and Misallocations|We analyze the general equilibrium effects of a fundamental property regime transition in the rural sector - agricultural or resource - when both labor and (reproducible) capital are free to move. In contrast to manufacturing, rural production has two characteristic features: it uses a fixed natural asset (land or other natural resources) and operates under one of two property regime types: common property versus exclusive property. Common property is fundamentally characterized with sharing, thus corresponding to such institutions as the family farm (Lewis 1954), free access to resources, and collective use, but adapted for the presence of capital use. We show that labor may actually gain from being effectively forced out of the rural sector. More generally, relative factor intensities determine the factor return effects of the transition, as well as either capital or labor deepening in both sectors. And while the unit cost of effective input efforts decrease, both factors flow out of the rural sector. Under a common property regime, the agricultural productivity gaps for labor and capital are uniquely determined by the output elasticity of land.
N50|Keynes and the interwar commodity option markets|In the first quarter of the twentieth century, options began to be widely employed in the main financial centres in Europe and the USA for trading in spot and futures markets. From 1921 onward, Keynes embarked upon investment in these derivatives mainly—but not exclusively—in the commodity markets, showing a true fascination for this method of speculation. This type of financial investment he pursued mainly in the 1920s, with only a few operations undertaken during the 1930s. The option markets in which Keynes traded were metals—in particular copper, lead, spelter and, especially, tin. Besides metals, Keynes dealt in options also in other commodity markets, such as rubber and linseed oil, and sparingly in ordinary stocks and government securities. In this paper we offer a reconstruction of Keynes’s speculative activity in commodity options, drawing on the archival material kept in the Keynes Papers held at King’s College, Cambridge. This reconstruction is, to the best of our knowledge, entirely new to the literature and aims to provide an analysis of this particular aspect of Keynes’s investment behaviour, investigating his capacity to predict market trends and offering a preliminary assessment of his performance.

N50|Genuine Savings in developing and developed countries, 1900-2000|This paper traces the long-run development of Genuine Savings (GS) using a panel of eleven countries during the twentieth century. This panel covers a number of developed countries (Great Britain, Germany, Switzerland, France, the US, and Australia) as well as a set of resource-abundant countries in Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico). These countries represent approximately 50 percent of the world’s output in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 1950, and include large economies and small open economies, and resource-rich and resource-scarce countries, thus allowing us to compare their historical experiences. Components of GS considered include physical and human capital as well as resource extraction and pollution damages. Generally, we find evidence of positive GS over the course of the twentieth century, although the twoWorldWars and the Great Depression left considerable marks. Also, we found striking differences between Latin American and developed countries when Total Factor Productivity (TFP) is included; this could be a signal of natural resource curse or technological gaps unnoticed in previous works.
N50|The fish is the friend of matriliny: Reef density and matrilineal inheritance|This paper studies the influence of marine ecology on social institutions of inheritance and descent. In a sample of 79 small-scale horticultural fishing communities in the Solomon Islands, and in samples of 186 to 1,265 societies across the world, we find that coral reef density systematically predicts the prevalence of matrilineal inheritance. Moreover, this result likely reflects adaptation of institutions to ecological conditions, as it holds within ethno-linguistic groups. Reef density explains as much as 10% of the variation in inheritance rules across villages in the Solomon Islands. Explanations based on the sexual division of labor and on inclusive fitness arguments support our results. We also document some of the demographic consequences of matrilineal inheritance, including smaller household and village population size, but find at best weak evidence that matrilineal inheritance translates into higher female economic or political agency.
N50|On the causes of economic growth in Europe: why did agricultural labour productivity not converge between 1950 and 2005?|The objective of this study is to make a further contribution to the debate on the causes of economic growth in the European Continent. It explains why agricultural labour productivity differences did not converge between 1950 and 2005 in Europe. We propose an econometric model, one combining both proximate and fundamental causes of economic growth. The results show that the continuous exit of labour power from the sector, coupled with the increased use of productive factors originating in other sectors of the economy, caused the efficiency of agricultural workers to rise. However, we offer a complete explanation of the role played by institutions and geographical factors. Thus, we detect a direct and inverse relation between membership of the EU and the Communist bloc and the productivity of agricultural labour. In addition, strong support for agriculture affected productivity negatively.
N50|Is Poverty in the African DNA (Gene)?|A 2015 World Bank report on attainment of Millennium Development Goals concludes that the number of extremely poor has dropped substantially in all regions with the exception of Subâ€ Saharan Africa. We assess if poverty is in the African gene by revisiting the findings of Ashraf and Galor and reformulating the â€œOut of Africa Hypothesisâ€ into a â€œGenetic Diversity Hypothesisâ€ for a â€œWithin Africa Analysis.â€ We motivate this reformulation with five shortcomings largely drawn from the 2015 findings of the African Gerome Variation Project, notably: limitations in the conception of space, an African dummy in genetic diversity, linearity in migratory patterns, migratory origins and underpinnings of genetic diversity in Africa. Ashraf and Galor have concluded that crossâ€ country differences in development can be explained by genetic diversity in a Kuznets or inverted Uâ€ shaped pattern. Our results from an exclusive African perspective partially confirm the underlying hypothesis in a contemporary context, but not in the historical analysis. From a historical context, the nexus is Uâ€ shaped for migratory distance, mobility index and predicted diversity while for the contemporary analysis; it is hump shaped for ancestryâ€ adjusted predicted diversity.

N50|Bioenergy Crops As New Components Of Rural And Agricultural Landscapes: Environmental And Social Impact, Biodiversity, Cultural Heritage And Economy| Large scale cultivation of bioenergy crops can substantially alter the appearance and the ecology of rural and agricultural landscapes, which constitute a valuable asset of our cultural heritage. The ecosystems and the built heritage of agricultural landscapes require holistic management structures built on self-sustaining ecological cycles and the sustainable use of ecosystem services put into the context of economical and demographical conditions of local and regional development strategies. Furthermore, the natural and cultural heritage of rural landscapes can play an important role for boosting economic growth and social cohesion if protected and used with a long term sustainability approach. This is particularly important for those rural landscapes, where establishing large scale traditional monoculture of bio energy crops might threaten both previously well functioning agro-ecosystems and the cultural values of the agricultural landscapes. However, sensible cultivation of energy crops, particularly energy forests, in degraded, polluted areas or on territories of low soil quality may be beneficial and serve as means for ecological reconstruction and creation of new habitats. We propose to apply renewable energy based, landscape centered, sustainable micro-regional development strategies in rural areas, where ecologically acceptable level of bioenergy feedstock production supports not only organic agriculture including grey water irrigation and control of invasive species, but even the protection, reconstruction and sensible use of the built and intangible cultural heritage of the cultural landscape. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A bioenergia termények nagybani művelése jelentősen megváltoztathatja a kulturális örökségünk értékes elemeit képező vidéki és mezőgazdasági tájak kinézetét és ökológiai viszonyait. A mezőgazdasági tájak ökoszisztémái és épített öröksége az önfenntartó ökociklusokra épülő, komplex menedzsment struktúrákat igényel, melyek egyaránt figyelembe veszik az ökoszisztéma szolgáltatások fenntartható hasznosítását továbbá a helyi és regionális fejlesztési stratégiák gazdasági és demográfiai feltételeit. A vidéki tájak természeti adottságai és kulturális öröksége jelentős szerepet játszhatnak a vidék gazdasági fellendítésében és a szociális kohézió erősítésében abban az esetben, ha biztosítjuk védelmüket és használatukat egy hosszú távú fenntarthatósági koncepció alkalmazásával. Ez különösen fontos lehet azokon a tájakon, ahol a bioenergia termények nagybani termesztése fenyegető lehet mind a korábban jól működő agro-ökoszisztémákra mind a mezőgazdasági tájak kulturális értékeire. Mindezek ellenére, a bioenergia terményeknek, különösen az energiaerdőknek a céltudatos telepítése csökkent értékű, szennyezett területeken vagy alacsony minőségű talajokon kifejezetten hasznos lehet, mint a fitoremediáció és új élőhelyek létrehozásának eszköze. Javasoljuk a megújuló energiákra épülő, kultúrtáj központú, fenntartható mikroregionális fejlesztési stratégiák alkalmazását a vidéki területeken, ahol a bioenergia alapanyagok termelése nem csupán a biológiailag tisztított szennyvizes öntözést is alkalmazó biogazdálkodást és az invazív fajok ellenőrzését teszi lehetővé, de biztosítja az adott kultúrtáj épített és eszmei örökségének védelmét, rekonstrukcióját és ésszerű használatát is.
N50|Sustainability Certification and Palm Oil Smallholders’ Livelihood: A Comparison between Scheme Smallholders and Independent Smallholders in Indonesia| Most sustainability certifications in Indonesia are developed by Northern-based businesses and NGOs to regulate the production of agricultural commodities in the South. However, research still shows a lot of uncertainty about what sustainability certifications imply for the livelihood of smallholder farmers. Given these uncertainties, this paper explores the potential of certifications to improve the livelihood of smallholder farmers. To achieve this objective we developed an amended livelihood framework applied to an exploratory study of Indonesian smallholders who participate in the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Although access to markets and vulnerability are not improved through certification, indirect effects through organizational changes increase productivity. If certification schemes are weakly institutionalized, farmers will easily shift to a more profitable way of production. Further analysis is needed to discover the balance between the ethical aspects of certification while improving economic profitability for participating smallholders.
N50|Natural Resources and Economic Development. Some lessons from History|In this work, we highlight the “lessons from history” that can be drawn from a historical discussion and understanding of the past and present of resource-rich developing economies to obtain conditions for successful natural resources-based development. The conceptual core of our answer to those questions will be based on three key ideas. First, abundance of natural resources is closely associated with levels of economic development. Second, we emphasize that an abundance of natural resources is not a fixed situation. It is a process that reacts to changes in the structure of commodity prices and factor endowments, and progress requires capital, labour, technical change and appropriate institutional arrangements. Finally, history shows that institutional quality is the key factor to deal with abundant natural resources and, especially, with the rents derived from their use and exploitation. The ways in which natural resources interact with economic development are mediated by the performance of institutional arrangements in at least three dimensions: (i) institutions’ ability to limit rent-seeking opportunities that divert innovation and resources from productive avenues; (ii) political competition and participation relate to rules governing chief executive recruitment and selection, the fairness and impartiality of electoral processes, and constraints on executive power; and (iii) the characteristics of institutions that reduce transactional risk through proper enforcement of property rights. In sum, history is very clear in showing that natural capital is non-neutral for economic performance but it is a systemic component of economic development where institutional quality is the key component to deal with and create “curses” and “blessings” of natural resources.
N50|International Agricultural markets after the war, 1945-1960|The objective of the present study is to offer a general overview of the evolution of international trade in agricultural and food products between 1945 and 1960. The developed countries not only maintained policies of stimulating agricultural production implemented during the war, but also deepened their intervention and support with regard to the agricultural sector. The culmination of such policies was, in the case of Western Europe, the creation of the European Economic Community in 1957 and the implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy. This was one of the first community-wide policies and had a notable impact on international agricultural trade.To achieve the objective proposed we concentrate on two principal themes. On the one hand a reconstruction will be performed of the international flows of agricultural trade for that period. Furthermore, we shall attempt to analyse the principal determinants of the development of agricultural trade, paying special attention to the political economy which led to the taking of crucial decisions for its evolution, such as its exclusion from the GATT agreements.
N50|The Local Economic Impacts of Natural Resource Extraction|Whether it is fair to characterize natural resource wealth as a curse is still debated. Most of the evidence derives from cross-country analyses, providing cases both for and against a potential resource curse. Scholars are increasingly turning to within-country evidence to deepen our understanding of the potential drivers, and outcomes, of resource wealth effects. Moving away from cross-country studies offers new perspectives on the resource curse debate and can help overcome concerns regarding endogeneity. Therefore, scholars are leveraging datasets that provide greater disaggregation of economic responses and exogenous identification of impacts. This article surveys the literature on these studies of local and regional effects of natural resource extraction. We discuss data availability and quality, recent advances in methodological tools, and the main findings of several research areas. These areas include the direct impact of natural resource production on local labor markets and welfare, the effects of government spending channels resulting from mining revenue, and regional spillovers. Finally, we take stock of the state of the literature and provide suggestions for future research.
N50|The Role of Women in Traditional Agriculture: Evidence From Italy|Gender roles in the past may affect current perceptions of the 'rightful' place of women in the society, with potential major consequences on economic development. This paper explores the historical roots of gender roles by focusing on female work in agriculture, which accounted for most employment in traditional societies. We rely on a newly compiled data-set of female occupation and crop mix for Italy in the 1930s. We show that crop mix did determine the level of female gainful employment in a complex way. Some products could be classified either ‘male-intensive’ (like wheat and cow milk) or ‘female-intensive’ (like corn and beef), but quite a few were largely ‘gender-neutral’ (like wine and oil).
N50|The Impacts of Oil Price Fluctuations on Revealed Comparative Advantage of Manufacturing Commodities for ASEAN-5 Economies|This paper attempts to quantify the effects of oil price fluctuations on revealed symmetric comparative advantage (RSCA) for 95 manufacturing commodities of 5 ASEAN countries from 1991 to 2012. Using Zellner’s (1962) seemingly unrelated regression model, oil price fluctuations negatively affect RSCA of more than 60% of the manufacturing commodities estimated. This is true especially for low-technology (LT1 and LT2) and mediumtechnology (MT3) commodities. The paper also found that endowment variables such as labour and capital stock significantly affects RSCA for more than 50% of the equations, giving support to Ricardian and Heckscher-Ohlin theorem of comparative advantage.
N50|Variations in the price and quality of English grain, 1750–1914: Quantitative evidence and empirical implications|Interpretation of historic grain price data may be hazardous owing to systematic grain quality variation — both cross sectionally and over varying time horizons (intra-year, inter-year, long run). We use the English wheat market, 1750–1914, as an example to quantify this issue. First, we show that bushel weight approximates grain quality. Then we show that cross sectional and intra-year variation are substantial and problematic, generating erroneous inference regarding market integration. Long run variation is significant, due to sharply declining international quality differentials, and this impacts estimated cost of living changes. By contrast, inter-year variation is smaller and controlled for more easily.
N50|Risorse collettive e comunità locali: un approccio storico|"Il controllo e lo sfruttamento delle risorse ambientali (agro-silvo-pastorali) nel passato è stato a lungo legato a forme di appropriazione di natura collettiva, sia nelle pratiche che nella rivendicazione dei diritti di uso e di possesso. Tali forme sono state poi quasi del tutto cancellate dalle riforme otto e novecentesche, che hanno interessato il diritto di proprietà, il potere politico locale e la gestione economica, tecnica e ""ambientale"" delle risorse stesse. Il tema dei commons è stato oggetto a partire dagli anni Novanta del Novecento di un dibattito storiografico intenso, che ha visto prevalere una lettura neo-istituzionalista, ma che ha aperto strategie di analisi alternative, spesso legate ad un approccio locale ed analitico. Si farà riferimento brevemente a questo dibattito, e si illustreranno due casi studio in cui la categoria del ""collettivo"" caratterizza i processi storici di ridefinizione del rapporto tra comunità locali e risorse fino ai nostri giorni, in bilico tra discontinuità e resilienza, per mostrare come essa costituisce la base stessa dell’esistenza di molti dei nostri paesaggi rurali storici."
N50|Sovereign States and Surging Water: Brahmaputra River between China and India|Brahmaputra river basin is one of the most vulnerable areas in the world subject to combined effects of glacier melt, extreme monsoon rainfall and sea level rise. Water is emerging as a new possible irritant between China and India. For India, Water of Brahmaputra constitutes a major lifeline for people of Tibet and North Eastern states. The building of dams and diversion projects in Tibet by China is a matter of grave concern for lower riparian states. For China, it is having hidden inclination to create employment potentials for more than millions of people by making Brahmaputra diversion project forward. The requirement of fresh water as the pollution grows and population rise has forced China to have the Tsangpo-Brahmaputra River project. The objective of this paper is to focus the reaction of both people on the water diversion issue, disastrous ecological consequences and the urgent necessity for having a water treaty between Asian giants. It also examines the hegemonic tendencies of China on Brahmaputra River & exercise of power for economic gains and outcomes. The policies China takes on trans- Boundary Rivers are not symptom of peaceful nature of its rise. In addition, it establishes the fact that sharing of information, ecosystem-friendly policies, thought and mutual understanding will dispel the suspicion and develop trust between two countries, creating an enabling environment for better management of Brahmaputra River.
N50|Section 3. Money Markets and Financial Institutions|In 2014, Russia was hit by a new round of financial crisis manifesting itself in the national currency devaluation, capital flight and sagging stock market. The RTS (Russian Trading System) Index has been moving along a W-shaped pathway since 2008, which is most typical of countries whose financial crises are associated with deep disproportions in economy, for example, in South Korea since 1989 or in the U.S. innovation marketplace since 1999. As of 31 January 2015, the RTS Index was 30.0% below the pre-crisis peak level of May 2008 and, kept searching for new lows. In January 2009, the Index dropped to 21.8% below the 2008 peak level.
N50|Long-Run Cultural Divergence: Evidence From the Neolithic Revolution|This paper investigates the long-run influence of the Neolithic Revolution on contemporary cultural norms and institutions as reflected in the imension of collectivism-individualism. We outline an agricultural origins-model of cultural divergence where we claim that the advent of farming in a core region was characterized by collectivist values and eventually triggered the out-migration of individualistic farmers towards more and more peripheral areas. This migration pattern caused the initial cultural divergence, which remained persistent over generations. The key mechanism is demonstrated in an extended Malthusian growth model that explicitly models cultural dynamics and a migration choice for individualistic farmers. Using detailed data on the date of adoption of Neolithic agriculture among Western regions and countries, the empirical findings show that the regions which adopted agriculture early also value obedience more and feel less in control of their lives. They have also had very little experience of democracy during the last century. The findings add to the literature by suggesting the possibility of extremely long lasting norms and beliefs influencing today's socioeconomic outcomes.
N50|Weather shocks and English wheat yields, 1690-1871|We estimate a time series model of weather shocks on English wheat yields for the early nineteenth century and use it to predict weather effects on yield levels from 1697 to 1871. This reveals that yields in the 1690s were depressed by unusually poor weather; and those in the late 1850s were inflated by unusually good weather. This has led researchers to overestimate the underlying growth of yields over the period by perhaps 50 per cent. Correcting for this effect would largely reconcile the conflicting primal and dual estimates of productivity growth over the period.
N50|Commercial and Economic Aspects of Antarctic Exploration From the Earliest Discoveries into the 19th Century|Antarctic exploration always had strong scientific as well as political motives. This paper argues that commercial motivations more often than not, also were an interwoven part of the rationale of the expeditions. The paper analyses the commercial and economic motivation in early Antarctic exploration, by the explorers themselves as well as their sponsors (governments, private businessmen, scientific communities). It reviews the earliest expeditions that searched for the still unknown continent that was hoped to advance commerce and trade. The eventual discoveries did not reveal a prosperous continent in a traditional sense. The exploitable resources – seals and whales were instead found in the ocean, at the islands and around the continent. The paper reviews the earliest discoveries and plans to exploit those resources, and the origins of what was to become the first industries of the Antarctic region. The paper deals primarily with the period before the ‘Heroic Age’ when the focus of the explorers became the penetration of the Antarctic continent itself.
N50|Periods of converging carbon dioxide emissions from oil combustion 1973-2004|This paper examines convergence of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions caused by oil combustion for a panel of 86 countries considering the importance of analyzing several sub-periods separately. Also, the investigation points at the necessity of choosing a restricted global sample, which takes into account that, for instance, eastern bloc countries reacted differently to increasing world market crude prices than the Western economies. The analysis builds on examining the beta-convergence hypothesis in a neoclassical growth model setting with additional control variables such as combustion of solid fuels. The results reveal evidence in support of beta-convergence of CO2 emissions intensity due to oil combustion for the sub-periods 1973-1979 and 1979-1991, while no evidence for convergence was found for the post-1991 period. This is true both for the restricted global sample and the sub-samples comprised of western OECD economies. One possible interpretation of the results is that international carbon taxes or permit trading schemes may first be introduced for oil only.
N50|Modern gender roles and agricultural history: the Neolithic inheritance|This research proposes the hypothesis that societies with long histories of agriculture have less equality in gender roles as a consequence of more patriarchal values and beliefs regarding the proper role of women in society. We test this hypothesis in a world sample of countries, in a sample of European regions, as well as among immigrants and children of immigrants living in the US. This evidence reveals a significant negative relationship between years of agriculture and female labor force participation rates, as well as other measures of equality in contemporary gender roles. This finding is robust to the inclusion of an extensive set of possible confounders, including historical plough-use and the length of the growing season. We argue that two mechanisms can explain the result: (1) societies with longer agricultural histories had a higher level of technological advancement which in the Malthusian Epoch translated into higher fertility and a diminished role for women outside the home; (2) the transition to cereal agriculture led to a division of labor in which women spend more time on processing cereals rather than working in the field.

N50|The Relationship Between Novelty-Seeking Traits and Comparative Economic Development|This paper suggests a theoretical framework and provides empirical evidence for a hump-shaped relationship between the fraction of novelty-seeking traits in society and current levels of per capita income. The hypothesis is that novelty-seeking traits produce two countervailing effects on aggregate productivity and hence economic development. The beneficial effect consists in explorative knowledge acquisition, which contributes significantly to the process of economic development. The detrimental effect results from a certain amount of this knowledge not being used reliably for capital accumulation due to the high fraction of individuals engaged in exploration rather than in production. One main conclusion of the empirical analysis is that the high fraction of novelty-seeking individuals in society engaged in short-run explorative knowledge acquisition prevent permanent settlement and therefore act as an obstacle to the development of centralized states, which are a precursor to modern industrial production.
N50|Economic stratification - The remedy and demise of humanity|The paper shows that the world economic stratification, as well as that of all natural, social and political systems is a natural law and a prerequisite for progress. Stratification itself may mean, however, both the remedy, but also the demise of systems, by exacerbating social inequalities. The database includes the evolution of gross domestic product per capita for different time frames at European level and worldwide. The main methods employed in processing database are the indices method and expectation values of position (quartile values) used to assess the structure of Europe and world countries according to the size of the gross domestic product. In Europe, for a century, stratification has increased visibly. If in 1913, the richest country in Europe achieved a GDP per capita of 3.94 times higher compared to the poorest country, in 2013 the ratio is 13.82 to one. The status of key statistical indicators that characterize the polarization of the world by size of gross domestic product, demonstrates that stratification is less pronounced inside continents, becoming however severe, worldwide. In this regard, it is alarming that in 1994, 75% of world countries were making only 7% of the GDP per capita in the richest country (Monaco). Given that information has now become increasingly more fluid, one can include among beneficiaries, the least developed countries. Circulation of information is, however, under the command of polarizing forces, belonging to the same great powers of the world. In this way, by means of more refined methods, the benefits of progress preserve world hierarchies.
N50|An Evaluation of the Economic Theoretical Potential of the Rural Environment Mismanged During 1956-2010|Under the context of the essential role and growing importance of the rural environment in the development of a country, we focus on evaluating the economic theoretical potential of the rural environment that we consider to have been mismanaged during 1956-2010. For this purpose, in this paper we define, describe and explain the main concepts, as to be able to evaluate the economic potential of the rural development and further contribute to its improvement. The study focuses on the correlations between the population of working age, occupancy, unemployment and the wasted economic potential, putting forward a new concept, statistically valid, demographic named the absolute able overpopulation.
N50|Un régime monétaire traditionnel contesté par la monnaie d’État : l’histoire du kip au Nord-Laos de 1975 à 2000|Le gouvernement de la République démocratique populaire lao impose un nouveau modèle économique en 1986. Les réformes engagées cherchent à promouvoir une « économie de marché » et à diffuser la monnaie nationale, le kip. Monétiser l’économie constitue un objectif de premier ordre et, en même temps, un moyen pour mettre en œuvre les processus de marchandisation. Cependant, imposer une nouvelle monnaie ne va pas de soi dans la mesure où elle conteste directement l’ordre monétaire antérieur et les pratiques sociales correspondantes. À Phongsaly, province isolée au nord de la République, l’État s’appuie sur la fiscalité et sur les transferts pour diffuser sa monnaie dans un environnement où elle occupait, au départ, une place ténue. Le kip s’impose, il transforme les représentations monétaires et les monnaies traditionnelles ; les biens dotés d’attributs monétaires sont relégués au niveau de la marchandise. L’action de l’État impulse un nouveau paysage monétaire au sommet duquel se trouve une monnaie idoine au développement des échanges marchands. Ainsi, les mutations sociales recherchées s’enclenchent et le programme politique voté en 1986 se réalise.
N50|The dynamics of international trade in cereals, 1900-1938|The aim of this paper is to analyse the dynamics of international trade in cereals in the first third of the twentieth century. To this end we will study its evolution over this period, comparing it also with the general trade of food and agricultural products. In addition, we will examine the structure of this trade. For wheat, maize and rice we will examine the operation of their respective markets, with special attention to the import and export flows between consumers and producers. To better understand the functioning of the market for these products, we will examine the changes in supply, demand and prices.
N50|Capital Stock Simulation by Hartwick Rule in Iran|Fully reinvest of natural resource rents in foreign assets or productive capital such as buildings, roads, machines, human capital or health so-called Hartwick rule. The aim of this paper is to estimate the capital stock in Iran by Hartwick Rule. In other word we estimate PIM method and Hartwick rule for calculate capital stock. The result show that estimated capital stock by Hartwick rule is more than PIM method. Therefore, in Iranian economy, Hartwick rule is not applied because part of natural resource income consumed and genuine saving is negative. If the Hartwick rule would have been followed during the last few decades, Iranian economy would have been much less dependent on oil and other resources.
N50|Do energy natural endowments matter? New Zealand and Uruguay in a comparative approach (1870-1940)|Settler economies are characterized by abundant natural resources, but natural capital is not homogeneous between countries and it can produce different consequences in terms of economic performance. This paper discusses the effect of natural resources on economic performance as part of the debate about the “curse of natural resources hypothesis”. We consider energy natural resources and focus on two settler societies, New Zealand and Uruguay. There is very little literature about the economic development of settler economies that identifies differences within the “club” countries that have different natural resources. We look for differences in energy natural endowments, basically coal and suitable conditions for hydroelectric generation, to explain at least partially the different welfare levels between the two economies. In the nineteenth century and the early decades of the twentieth century, New Zealand and Uruguay were similar in many ways such as production structure, movements in production factors and insertion in international markets, but there were huge differences in income per capita levels. To explain this, we need to study other aspects of the economic system. The analytical framework associated with the curse of natural resources offers some interesting lines of argument for our inquiry. The conformation of a “modern” production structure requires there to be sufficient energy supply at competitive costs, to justify exploiting the corresponding natural resources. Our analysis shows that New Zealand’s better performance in coal production and better natural conditions to generate electric energy at low cost –thus offering energy at low prices– explain those differences. New Zealand's advantage in energy endowments at least partially explains the development of a dairy sector, certain energy-intensive manufactures and a more efficient use of railways
N50|Global water in a global world a long term study on agricultural virtual water flows in the world|: Agricultural and food products have been increasingly exchanged during the last half century. With them, water has been virtually transferred among countries. Thus, this paper studies the evolution of virtual water flows on the long term, analyzing the main factors driving them by means of a Decomposition Analysis. In particular, our study points at a gradual increase in virtual water consumption as a result of agricultural and food products trade in the world from 1965 to 2010. At the global level, the increase in the volume of trade has been the main factor driving water consumption increase.
N50|Unfair Incentives: A Behavioral Note on Sharecropping|We conducted a field experiment with real-life tenants in Ethiopia to test the incentive effects of fixed-wage, sharecropping, fixed-rent, and ownership contracts. The experimental task resembles a common process in agricultural production. The sharecropping contract is essentially a piece-rate scheme framed as a profit sharing agreement. The sharecropping output was about 11 percent smaller than the fixed-rent output. Surprisingly, it is statistically indistinguishable from the fixed-wage output, despite substantial piece rates. This effect is driven by real-life sharecroppers. Their sharecropping output was significantly smaller than that of non-sharecroppers, and in one region, it was even 10 percent lower than sharecroppers fixed-wage output. Based on qualitative interviews and historical accounts, we argue that our subjects dislike sharecropping contracts because of the unfair profit sharing and the controversial allocation of the land. The contractual performance may therefore depend on the perceived fairness of the incentive scheme.
N50|Culture and the formation of gender-specific skills in an agrarian society|This study examines whether cultural norms arising from traditional agricultural practices affect the formation of gender-specific skills. We hypothesize that a culturally induced division of labor along gender lines generates gender-specific skills. As opposed to the traditional measurement of skills, which measures skill levels based on the type of tasks or abilities observed in certain occupations, we measure skills directly using a controlled field experiment in rural Ethiopia. Comparing women with exposure to the plow culture with women without exposure to such cultural norms, and with men in general, we find a clear division of labor along gender lines between domestic and non-domestic work. We show that women exposed to the plow culture are particularly skilled in exercising a light manual task resembling everyday work in the domestic sphere. Drawing on secondary data on the time-use of Ethiopian adults, we find supporting evidence that women with exposure to the plow culture specialize in tasks from the domestic sphere. Thus, culturally-induced skill differences arguably are a neglected explanation for gender disparities in labor income.
N50|Une approche historique du développement comparé : Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson (AJR) et Jared Diamond sont-ils complémentaires ?|In this paper we provide empirical evidence of the complementarities between the geographical approach of Diamond (1997) and the institutional approach of Acemoglu et al. (2002) to explain gaps in economic performance worldwide since 11, 000 BC until today. While the biogeographical endowments of Diamond are suitable to explain development paths until 1500 AD, the reversal of fortune of Acemoglu et al. (2002) is able to explain gaps in economic performance since 1500 AD. Those results display the positive impact of institutional framework on economic development, and focus on the complementary of two different fields of literature on long-run development.
N50|A Spatial Approach to Energy Economics: Theory, Measurement and Empirics|This paper sets out a simple spatial model of energy exploitation to ask how the location and productivity of energy resources may affect the distribution of economic activity around the globe. This is a very large research question, and we take one small step towards answering it by combining elements from resource and energy economics into one framework that links the spatial productivity of energy sources (both renewable and non-renewable) to the incentives for economic activity to concentrate. Our theory provides a novel scaling law; a magnification effect; and reveals a complementarity between infrastructure investment and spatially productive energy resources. Our empirical work provides estimates of key model attributes and reviews related empirical work supporting our approach.
N50|Institutions and Economic Growth in Historical Perspective: Part 1|This is Part 1 of a two-part paper which surveys the historical evidence on the role of institutions in economic growth. The paper provides a critical scrutiny of a number of stylized facts widely accepted in the growth literature. It shows that private-order institutions have not historically substituted for public-order ones in enabling markets to function; that parliaments representing wealth holders have not invariably been favourable for growth; and that the Glorious Revolution of 1688 did not mark the sudden emergence of either secure property rights or economic growth. Economic history has been used to support both the centrality and the irrelevance of secure property rights to growth, but the reason for this is conceptual vagueness. Secure property rights require much more careful analysis, distinguishing between rights of ownership, use and transfer, and between generalized and particularized variants. Similar careful analysis would, we argue, clarify the growth effects of other institutions, including contract-enforcement mechanisms, guilds, communities, serfdom, and the family. Greater precision concerning institutional effects on growth can be achieved by developing sharper criteria of application for conventional institutional labels, endowing institutions with a scale of intensity or degree, and recognizing that the effects of each institution depend on its relationship with other components of the wider institutional system. Part 1 of the paper discusses public-order institutions, parliaments, the distinction between generalized and particularized institutions, and property rights.

It concludes by drawing the implications of both parts of the paper for institutions and economic growth in historical perspective.
N50|How do oil producers respond to oil demand shocks?|This paper analyzes the response of international oil producers to demand-induced changes in the price of crude oil during 1975–2011, focusing on potential differences between OPEC and non-OPEC countries. The goal is to derive consistent estimates of the short-run price elasticity of crude oil supply at the country level. I find that oil producers hardly respond to demand shocks within the same month, and that the corresponding impact price elasticities of supply are statistically indistinguishable from zero. While there is little evidence of differences in the dynamic responses to a typical flow demand shock, on average over the sample period, OPEC members seem to curtail production in response to a speculative demand shock, whereas non-OPEC production expands significantly. Flow and speculative demand shocks account for a nontrivial fraction of the total variability in country-level crude oil supply.
N50|The effect of collective forestland tenure reform in China: Does land parcelization reduce forest management intensity?|China implemented a new round of collective forestland tenure reform during 2003–2013. In this reform, forestland owned by villages or township collective organizations were divided into a great number of small plots and allocated to member households of the collectives. A widespread concern about the reform is that parcelization of forestland might limit farmers’ incentives to invest in forest management. This paper examines the factors affecting farmers’ investment in forest management using household data collected in four provinces in 2010. The results show that the intensity of a household's investment in forest management is negatively affected by its nonfarm income and the average size of forest plots, but positively affected by the easiness in obtaining loan and the technical assistance the household receives. We argue that the counterintuitive effect of nonfarm income on investment intensity is due to the increasing marginal cost of own labor input. The effects of forest plot size and easiness in obtaining loan suggest that households have limited amount of capital to invest in forest management. Because of this constraint, parcelization of forestland resulted from the recent reform has not yet caused any reduction of the intensity of investment in forest management.
N50|French Colonial Trade Patterns: European Settlement|We investigate how the colonial strategy through the settlement decision affected French trade patterns. In this regard, we construct a new database relying on various primary historical sources containing information on the value of French sectoral trade between 1880 and 1913. Our results show that French colonies with more European settlements traded more with France, whereas the opposite is true for other colonies. We also investigate two channels through which European settlements might have affected the French trade pattern with colonies: institutions and networking. We find that better institutions brought by European settlements had a negative impact on trade with French colonies, while it promoted trade with British colonies. These results are consistent with the extractive nature of French trade relations with its colonies. As for networking, it increases overall French trade within French colonies but reduces it in other colonies.
N50|The Case for a Supra-national Control on Commodities in the post WWII World: Novel Perspectives from FAO and Kaldor Archives|Commodity markets are characterized by high price volatility, inefficient resource allocation and the cyclical reappearance of excessive surpluses and shortages. Historically, these problems and their relevant socio-economic implications have been tackled by means of protectionist measures at the national level, with cartels among producers or, in some rare cases, with international agreements among producers and consumers of a single commodity. At the end of World War II, however, a number of ambitious projects were put forth by multilateral organizations and by individual economists. These projects (e.g. World Food Board, International Commodity Clearing House, International Commodity Reserve Currency) aimed at overcoming traditional commodity problems by means of supra-national institutions and the coordinated management of all the main commodities within a unified scheme capable of combining stable prices and abundant supplies. The goal of this paper is to reconstruct some of these proposals, their theoretical underpinnings and the debate they roused. In particular, we intend to focus on the role played by the Food and Agriculture Organisation and by the experts who were involved in its projects. While individual contributions by some economists belonging to this group of experts have been widely investigated in the literature, their reciprocal influences and the relevant intellectual and historical context have received much less attention. Recent important publications bearing on this question and the re-opening of FAO archives add new angles on and insights into this issue.
N50|Land Allocation between Food and Energy|Many countries are promoting biofuels as a substitute for scarce oil. This paper develops a dynamic model of land allocation between food and energy and shows how the model can be calibrated using standard optimization techniques. Some possible implications of the trade-offs between food and energy are discussed. Specifically, we show that the effect of mandates is mainly felt through increased land conversion, which increases indirect carbon emissions. Crude oil prices do not decrease significantly because of leakages.
N50|Industrialization and the demand for mineral commodities|This paper uses a new data set that begins in 1840 to investigate how industrialization affects the derived demand for mineral commodities. I establish that there is substantial heterogeneity in the long-run effect of manufacturing output on demand across five commodities. A one percent increase in per capita manufacturing output leads to an approximately 1.5 percent increase in aluminum demand and a roughly 1 percent rise in copper demand. Estimated elasticities for lead, tin, and zinc are below unity. My results suggest that the experience of Japan and South Korea’s industrialization, for example, may be used to infer the impact of China’s industrialization on future demand for metals. The results imply substantial differences across commodities with regard to future demand. Adjustment to equilibrium takes 7–13years, which helps explain the long duration of commodity price fluctuations.
N50|150 Years Of Boom And Bust: What Drives Mineral Commodity Prices?|My paper is the first to provide long-run evidence on the dynamic effects of supply and demand shocks on mineral commodity prices. I assemble and analyze a new data set of prices and production levels of copper, lead, tin, zinc, and crude oil from 1840 to 2010. Price fluctuations are primarily driven by demand rather than supply shocks. Demand shocks affect the price persistently for up to 15 years, whereas the effect of supply shocks persists for a maximum of 5 years. My paper shows that price surges caused by rapid industrialization are a recurrent phenomenon throughout history. Mineral commodity prices return to their declining or stable trends in the long run.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N50|A Review of Renewable Energy Supply and Energy Efficiency Technologies|Electricity consumption will comprise an increasing share of global energy demand during the next two decades. In recent years, the increasing prices of fossil fuels and concerns about the environmental consequences of greenhouse gas emissions have renewed the interest in the development of alternative energy resources. In particular, the Fukushima Daiichi accident was a turning point in the call for alternative energy sources. Renewable energy is now considered a more desirable source of fuel than nuclear power due to the absence of risk and disasters. Considering that the major component of greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide, there is a global concern about reducing carbon emissions. In this regard, different policies could be applied to reducing carbon emissions, such as enhancing renewable energy deployment and encouraging technological innovations. Two main solutions may be implemented to reduce CO2 emissions and overcome the problem of climate change: replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources as much as possible and enhancing energy efficiency. In this paper, we discuss alternative technologies for enhancing renewable energy deployment and energy use efficiency.
N50|Agricultural Literature in Eurasia circa 200 BCE – 1500 CE|Agricultural literature is one of the most important and oldest non-fictions genres in the world. This text gives us the first overview of extant agricultural treatises in Eurasia before c. 1500. With this overview, it is possible to give a better foundation to discussions on the role of knowledge. This literature also gives us indications about the importance of agriculture in different periods for a number of regions in Eurasia. An important part is discussion on method. The goal is to arrive at comparable numbers – to form the basis for analyze.
N50|Connecting strategy, environmental and social indicators: a study of oil and gas producers|This paper studies the integration of social and environmental objectives into strategy through performance indicators based on a sample of multinational world-leading oil- and gas producers. Also, we inquire if the companies under study, which identify certain areas as strategic objectives, do better than their peers. We show that top management of the companies did indeed identify different areas of interest, had different strategic foci, and used different performance indicators. This is often explicable through a company’s own history and past experiences. When comparing a sample of greenhouse gas emissions, safety measures, and energy efficiency indicators between the different companies, we could not identify a consistent development over time trends. In fact, some did worse over time and collective improvements were largely absent. We suggest further research into the link between strategic objectives and a company’s relative position in industry.
N50|Estimating the impact of climate change on agricultural production: Accounting for technology heterogeneity across countries|We estimate the impact of climate change on agricultural production in a panel of 127 countries from 1961 to 2002. In contrast to the existing literature we account for cross-sectional dependence and technology heterogeneity. We find no significant impact of climate change on agricultural production in high income countries, but significant adverse effects in middle and low income countries. These adverse effects include a moderate negative impact of increases in temperature on agricultural output and for low income countries also negative effects of reductions in precipitation and of increases in the frequency of droughts. The latter two effects are particularly strong in Sub-Sahara Africa where low-tech rain-fed agriculture with very limited climate change adjustment capacities dominates. Thus, our findings reinforce the importance of proper adaptation strategies to climate change considering heterogeneous production technologies across countries.
N50|The Effect of Renewable Energy Development on Carbon Emission Reduction: An Empirical Analysis for the EU-15 Countries|The increased concerns about climate change have made renewable energy sources an important topic of research. Several scholars have applied different methodologies to examine the relationships between energy consumption and economic growth of individual and groups of countries and to analyze the environmental effects of energy policies. Previous studies have analyzed carbon emission savings, using renewable energy usage as an individual source or in combination with traditional sources of energy (e.g., hybrid plants) in connection with life-cycle analysis methods. It is shown that after a certain period, economic growth leads to the promotion of environmental quality. However, econometric modeling critiques have opposed the results of these studies. One reason is that the effectiveness of governance-related parameters has previously been neglected. In this research, we analyze the impact of renewable energy development on carbon emission reduction. We estimate a model to evaluate the effectiveness of renewable energy development, technological innovation, and market regulations in carbon emission reduction. The empirical results are based on a panel data estimation using the EU-15 countries data observed from 1995 to 2010. The elasticities of CO2 emissions are estimated, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of each parameter. The finding show that the effects of a negative climate change could be mitigated by governance-related parameters instead of economic development..

N50|Agriculture, transportation and the timing of urbanization: Global analysis at the grid cell level|This paper addresses the timing of a location’s historical transition from rural to urban activity. We test whether urbanization occurs sooner in places with higher agricultural potential and comparatively lower transport costs, using worldwide data that divide the earth’s surface at half-degree intervals into 62,290 cells. From an independent estimate of each cell’s rural and urban population history over the last 2,000 years, we identify the date at which each cell achieves various thresholds of urbanization. Controlling for unobserved heterogeneity across countries through fixed effects and using a variety of spatial econometric techniques, we find a robust association between earlier urbanization and agro-climatic suitability for cultivation, having seasonal frosts, better access to the ocean or navigable rivers, and lower elevation. These geographic correlations become smaller in magnitude as urbanization proceeds, and there is some variation in the effects across continents. Aggregating cells into countries, we show that an earlier urbanization date is associated with higher per capita income today. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
N50|Greenhouse emissions and economic recessions: Did industrial economies “Stay Cool” during the 1930s economic crisis?|In this historical economic interdisciplinary research we investigate the impact of the 1930s economic crisis and their relationship to global warming. We investigate two consecutive hegemonic powers: the United Kingdom and the United States. Our assumption was that a reduction in demand would lead to a decrease in mean global temperatures during depressions. We find that in fact reduced carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulting from lowered production does not result in cooling temperatures.
N50|Feeling The Heat: Financial Crises And Their Impact On Global Climate Change|This interdisciplinary paper uses world-systems analysis as a theoretical framework to argue that both the 1870s, 1930’s economic depressions reduced mean global temperatures. As global consumer demand fell, factories worldwide began producing less commodities and, as a result, emitted less greenhouse gasses. We find that in both instances there is evidence to support the hypothesis that financial crises lead to cooler temperatures.
N50|Geography and institutions: Plausible and implausible linkages|In recent years, empirical investigations have shown that various aspects of physical geography are closely related to the quality of a country’s economic institutions. For instance, distance from the equator in latitude degrees is positively correlated to both institutional quality and to levels of economic development. In order to reach a better understanding for this type of regularities, this article reviews the growing empirical literature on geography and institutions, as well as a large body of older and newer theoretical works on the social impacts of geography. It is argued that the most plausible candidates for explaining the broadest cross-continental variance in institutional quality are those focusing on historical differences in biogeographical potential for early agriculture and on the importance of disease geography for European colonization strategy.
