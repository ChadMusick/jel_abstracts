A30|A Framework for Brand Rejuvenation: Private Universities in Malaysia|Objective – University branding becomes critical issue due to increasing number of private universities in Malaysia. Although education efforts in Malaysia has been continuously progress, institutions have difficulties to maintain as a powerful brand in competitive industry. Methodology/Technique – Bringing back a brand that consumers already familiar can save a lot of money. While some of institutions are able to maintain its brand image, some are still struggling even to meet the break even and unable to reposition the brand. While there are past studies and experiences on brand knowledge structures in hand, it is still confusing stage for how one could rebuild the brand image to achieve the intended positioning. Findings – The academic literature is particularly sparse in addressing this, and it is a confusing issue for the practitioners. The research discovers the theoretical foundations that relate to rebranding concepts and most critical factors that contribute to rebuilding the brand image of private institutions in Malaysia. Novelty – The current study seeks to shed light on the challenges of undertaking a rebranding exercise and introduce a framework that caters to the needs of brand managers at higher education institutions in Malaysia. Type of Paper: Review.
A30|On the Controversies behind the Origins of the Federal Economic Statistics|Our federal economic statistics originated in the economic and political divisions in the United States and the bitter debates over economic policy they engendered at the end of the 19th century and during the world wars and Great Depression. Workers were angry because they believed that they were being exploited by robber barons who were capturing all of the benefits of economic growth, while employers were just as sure that the second industrial revolution had brought workers an unparalleled increase in real wages. Other debates centered on the effects of unrestricted immigration on wages and employment opportunities of native-born Americans, on the effects of tariffs on prices paid by consumers, on the effects of frequent financial panics on employment, and, during the world wars, on the effects of wage and price controls on the living standards of workers. Participants on all sides of these debates believed that nonpolitical and accurate statistics constructed by experts would help to win support for the policies they favored. In most cases, the development of these statistics was led by individuals, private organizations, and state governments, although the federal government eventually took over the role of producing these statistics on a regular basis. Here I provide brief histories of the origins of US statistics on prices, national income and product, and unemployment to illustrate this story.
A30|Interdisciplinary Classification Studies|Classification of different kinds of objects is an important source of information in different areas of science. We show examples of classification diagrams of objects related to bioinformatics, medicine, and social science. In particular, we present a bioinformatics method designed by us and called 2D-Dynamic Representation of DNA/RNA Sequences [1,2]. In this non-standard approach the sequences are represented as point-masses in a 2D space. This mathematical method facilitates the creation of the classification diagrams in which different kinds of sequences are separated. Analogous diagrams we have obtained in social science - different groups of people are separated according to some, properly selected, criteria. In this case, a classifier is a kind of an answers to some questions. We have shown that this method can be a good tool for studies of the retirement threshold [3,4]. In the present work we also show some unpublished results related to the quality of life of the patients with voice disorders in inflammatory, neoplastic and neurological diseases of the larynx.[1] D.

A30|Structural change and female participation in recent economic growth: A multisectoral analysis for the Spanish economy|Economic growth has different impacts on gender gaps. Despite that the incorporation of women into the labour market drove towards a convergence with male participation in recent decades, a notable gender pay gap still persists standing at around 15% on average in the European Union. In this context, this paper evaluates the impact of economic growth patterns on the evolution of female employment and gender pay gaps. As a case study, we examine Spanish economic growth from 1980 to 2007 and the influences on the size, composition (by skill), and distribution (by sector) of female and male employment, as well as the consequences for gender gaps. First, sectorial feminization, direct discrimination, and structural change factors are identified and evaluated as sources of change in gender pay gap. Second, we explore the influence of demand, technology, and intensity factors on the evolution of employment in Spain, combining gender, skill, sectorial, and temporal perspectives.

A30|Study on the effect of leadership style, reward systems, and working conditions on employee work performance (case study of the state plantation of Merbau Pagar, Indonesia)|The purpose of this study was to observe the influence of leadership style, reward system, working conditions on the work performance of employees of The State Plantation of Merbau Pagar, Indonesia. The samples obtained were 105 respondents, according to the above objectives, this study was formulated using respondent testing, hypothesis testing and questionnaire testing. Data collection techniques used in this study consisted of observations, interviews (interviews), questionnaires and documentation studies in the form of primary and secondary data. To facilitate problem solving, this research was carried out using a linear regression analysis method with the help of SPSS 23. The results of the study showed that, 1) Simultaneously leadership style, reward system and working conditions significantly influence work performance, 2) partially each each factor of the leadership style variable, reward system and working conditions have a significant effect on Work performance, 3) the results of the partial regression analysis indicate that the value of the working conditions factor is the most dominant factor in Work Performance.
A30|The Impact Of Psychological Characteristics And Environment On Work-Family Conflict|The purpose of the study was to investigate how individual characteristics, family environment, and work environment predicted work-family conflict. Work-family conflict has the two directions of conflict (family to work conflict and work to family conflict). The sample consisted of 702 government officials in Bangkok, Thailand. Self-report inventories with a five-point rating scales ranging from always true to never true were administered to collect data. Data were analyzed using hierarchical regression. The results indicated that psychological characteristics and environment taken together accounted for 54 % of the variance in family-to-work conflict and 75 % variance in work-to-family conflict, respectively. The most powerful predictors for family-to-work conflict were workload, family load, optimism, and work support respectively. Similarly, family load contributed to work-to-family conflict the most whereas workload was the second in terms of the strength of its contributions. Family-friendly organizational support, intrinsic motivation, and work involvement were the third, fourth, and fifth powerful predictors of work-to-family conflict, respectively. The results support the importance of psychological characteristics and environment impact on work-family conflict. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.
A30|Empowerment: Era of expanding sustainability|The current world is experiencing rapid changes and transformations steps are hastily and powerfully continuous, and developments that have occurred in an unprecedented manner. Although the twentieth century had been described as being a condensation of five years from human civilization through scientific inventions and discoveries, the twenty-one century is full of technologies, commutations, and knowledge where the culture of image and supposed reality. Accordingly, the world goes as a village but more than to the extent that it can be gathered in the electronic device and less than one's hand palm in size.This is the era of abbreviating what has been already abbreviated, Nanotechnology, Cybernetics and control, open space where the speed, accuracy, and effectiveness for decision-making in terms of power and experience. This era depends on information, deep combination of specializations, and the serious search for strengthening the cultural democracy, and confirming the transparency through constructive dialogue and active participation, and spreading the tolerance and co-existence. Consequently, it is important to review the most prevalent relations and patterns.
A30|Utopian Left-Wing Expectations and the Social Consequences of the 3rd Memorandum in Greece|In January 2015 the radical left SYRIZA has won the Greek national elections and formed a coalition government with Independent Greeks (ANEL), a right-wing populist party. After a seven-month negotiation with Greece’s creditors and the agreement for the implementation of a third memorandum of fiscal adjustment, SYRIZA announced the conduction of a second round of national elections in September 2015. After a second electoral victory, SYRIZA formed again a coalition government with ANEL. The main characteristic of SYRIZA’s pre-electoral campaign was that it has primarily focused on the commitment for austerity measures termination and on the implementation of tax alleviation. Even during the second electoral campaign in September 2015, after the agreement for the implementation of the third memorandum of fiscal adjustment, SYRIZA was promising that its implementation will be socially endued in order to reduce negative social consequences, such as those created by the previous memoranda. Practically though, after the first months of the new memorandum implementation, it is obvious that the government has introduced an unprecedented tax policy. Interestingly, this policy is not different from a traditional left logic of tax enforcement but actually leads to the implementation of horizontal austerity policies which firstly affect the socially vulnerable groups. From this point of view, while SYRIZA emphatically declare that it aims at resolving the crisis, its policies seem to deepen the depression. For instance, its inability to find alternative options to finance the social security system, leads to the implementation of restrictive policies which dismantle the welfare state. This paper aims at analyzing the policies of the first left government in Greece by focusing on the tentative social consequences of the third memorandum and at the same time, studying some of the basic factors for its electoral victory, such as populism.

A30|Conflict and Reconciliation Motives in the Hebrew Curriculum for the Arabic Junior High Schools in Israel|The curriculum for Hebrew literature in the Arab sector (Arabic Junior high schools) was approved by the Minister of Education and Culture in 2008. Along with declared aims connected to the discipline itself, such as the usefulness of the Hebrew language and the beauty of its literature, the curriculum also includes specific ideological social and civic aims. These include acquiring knowledge about the cultural traditions of the Jewish people as well as developing consideration for their social and cultural sensitivities. The three anthologies based upon the very curriculum were published in 2009. The fundamental assumption of this research, which relies on an extensive foundation of theoretical work, maintains that the literary curriculum does have the ability to achieve these social aims. The aim of the research was to examine how the corpus of Hebrew literature in the curriculum reflects the relationship between Arabs and Jews in Israel, as individuals and as representatives of different cultures and traditions especially concerning the issues of conflict and reconciliation. The findings, based upon combined qualitative content analysis tools, revealed that only a small part (12%) of the literary works in the three anthologies indeed dealt with matters of conflict and reconciliation. Most of those literary works avoid direct implications to the Arab-Israeli coexistence.
A30|The Political Economy of Deregulation Policy in the Downstream Sector of the Petroleum Industry in Nigeria (1999-2015)|Successive governments in Nigeria since 1999 have faced the challenge of whether or not to adopt deregulation policy in the downstream sector of the petroleum industry. In fact, the decision of whether or not to adopt deregulation policy as a panacea for remedying the perennial fuel scarcity and arbitrary price increases in petroleum products has been an albatross around successive governments in Nigeria. This paper interrogates the political economy of deregulation policy in the downstream sector of the petroleum industry in Nigeria since the enthronement of democratic rule in 1999, hence contends that the subsidy regime of successive governments has not addressed the perennial scarcity and arbitrary price increases of petroleum products in the country. The paper maintains that the fuel subsidy regime has been an epitome of corruption as it has failed to address the original intentions of its founding fathers. It is the view of this paper, therefore, that a complete deregulation policy in the downstream sector that will ensure government?s outright removal of fuel subsidy, remains the only antidote to addressing the perennial scarcity and arbitrary price increases of petroleum products by ambitious petroleum marketers in Nigeria. It is by so doing that market forces shall become the major determinants of the prices and distribution of petroleum products for the teeming consumers in Nigeria. The paper concludes that savings that would accrue from fuel subsidy removal could be channelled into addressing the ailing infrastructure and human capital in the country.
A30|Ways Of Using Humor In Interpersonal Relationships: An Analysis Between Turks And The Spanish|Humor is an effective and significant part of interpersonal relations. Humor has always had a slight role in maintaining or ending relationships, and in relational conflict management. People make their addressee laugh by cracking a joke, receive their approval, and win them over or gain self-confidence.Besides the fact that humor facilitate the solution of many problems in relationships, the partners may choose to use humor at the breaking points of their relationships, and this may cause the relationship to end.Expressions (actions) are created by using various functions of humor in relationships (Affiliative humor, Self-enhancing humor, Aggressive humor, Self-defeating humor). Since it facilitates the hardships, humor has always been the most popular way of dealing with stuff in relationship conflicts. Humor is most frequently used when solving problems. However, this may lead to adverse outcomes if the partner?s vulnerabilities are neglected. A sense of humor on a common ground is one of the essential building stones of a sound relationship.This study has been designed to reveal the most common function of sense of humor used by the Turkish and the Spanish in their ?nterpersonal relationships. In-depth interviews conducted with 5 Turks and 5 Spaniards through questions regarding four different styles of humor in HSQ Humor Styles Questionnaire (Martin et al., 2003) form constitute the research methodology of this study.
A30|Advocating For Integrating Business Intelligence In Virtual Communities Of Practice|In the age of information and technology, Virtual Communities of Practice represent a reachable, cost effective and viable solution. For their advantages, they become more popular between the members of the cluster communities that share the same interest. Virtual Communities of Practice bring together people through online platforms and put them into the collaborative relation, so that they can share, learn, experiment and improve their activity. To this, there is always an informational input came from document resources shared into the community. But the challenge come with the management of this hole information and the use of it in order to go further and use the proper information to obtain knowledge and take decisions. For this, in our paper, we propose a model of using Business Intelligence into Virtual Communities of Practice, focusing on the advantages that this approach brings not only to the virtual community, but also to the local communities, improving their activities and being an innovation accelerator.
A30|The influence of the globalization on causality between energetic sector and differentiated wages|Paper aims the influence of globalization across causality between energetic sector and differentiated wages. We used the conceptualization of the Michelle Baddeley and Bernard Fingleton for the Fujita, Krugman and Venables (FKV) non-linear model of wage differentials. In order to develop this spatial econometric model for Romanian context we asses a corelation error process of data from different geographic area. In a polarized area of energy sector, desideratum of moderating and coordinating for macroeconomic policy should be an inflexion point in the European Union nationâ€™s governance, especially in Romania. The impact of global crises on Romanian energy sector could be reduced through smart sustainable development and convergence in financing and funding, inclusively foreign direct investment (FDI).
A30|Systemic approach on the implementation of European grants in Romania|The article addresses the use of the European grants, approved after Romania joined the European Union, conducting a technical analysis of the first programming period 2007-2013 and of the next period 2014-2020, with direct applicability on the degree of their absorption in Romania. In the first part of the paper is done analysis of legal regulations at European level and at national level, for the two funding period, highlighting the role of institutions involved in the implementation of Structural Funds in terms of the influence they have in establishing coherent policy achievement indicators set by the Lisbon Strategy for the 2007-2013 programming period and, subsequently, by the Europe 2020 Strategy for 2014-2020. Also, an important aspect of the paper is the analysis of the importance of proper implementation of the Partnership Agreement for 2014-2020, applicable at the system level by the management authorities, as well as beneficiaries of externally projects using European grants
A30|Socio-economic evolution of Transylvanian Saxons in the context of the Austria-Hungarian collapse and the formation of Greater Romania|The economic relations between Romanians and Germans at the end of XIV century until the middle of the sixteenth century, for over a century and a half had, in large part, other characteristics than in the previous period or the one that followed. If at the end of the XIV century Saxon economic relations were more intense with Romanian Country, favored by the reigns of Sigismund and Mircea stable at the beginning of the fifteenth century Saxon trade is going to the same extent and for Moldova's Alexandru cel Bun. The economic relations between Romanians and Germans were often hampered by the Ottoman military campaigns. At the beginning of the sixteenth century, the Ottoman offensive decades characterized by intensification and the collapse of the Hungarian feudal economic relations occurred secondary stagnation of all kinds of prohibitions. In relation to its external Principality of Transylvania which lasted a century and a half, has evolved between the two great powers engaged in southeastern Europe. In this era Roman Saxon relations have continuatsa manifest on several levels. In the second half of the sixteenth century economic relations between Romanians and Germans were determined largely by internal unrest in Transylvania. At the end of the autonomous principality historical stage was reached in inequality lots of land and wealth, and ultimately, social and ethnic contradictions worsening, which then manifested fully in the eighteenth century AustroHungarian pact concluded in 1867 between the Austrian and Hungarian ruling classes, has historical roots earlier than the act of 1867, which are searchable from the early decades of the establishment of Habsburg rule in Transylvania and can be pursued systematically ever since 1867, with a permanent tendency of political compromise Hungarian and Austrian ruling circles of the Habsburg monarchy. The period of forty-eighter Revolution and World War Transylvania was one of transition for what I look at Saxon, they became a nation with a range preserved since the time of colonization, an ethnic minority. Period up to World War I was the Saxon community in Transylvania, one of the major changes, especially in politics, but have not left unaffected areas of economics or social.
A30|Environmental campaigns versus skeptical / Lobbysts. Romania on climate changes map|"A novelty of our time is that mankind is facing a global phenomenon whose consequences are still difficult to assess by scientists, but that few still doubt: climate change / global warming, a phenomenon which tends to become the most complex problem human societies have ever faced. If the phenomenon is dangerous, favorable or neutral for the global ecosystem it depends on the perspective from which we analyze it. It may seem utopian to fight for saving planet Earth, but we need to consider seriously about the need to maintain a stable climate for the survival of all inhabitants of the planet, as long as possible. In this article I intend to describe the ""fight"" between those involved in climate campaigns versus climate skeptics / industrial groups, the ultimate goal being the influence on the public of climate policy. A part of this article is devoted to the pros and cons of climate change, but I will also focus on the absence of a climate debate in Romania."
A30|Middle Kingdomâ€™s Un Diplomacy In The Xxist Century: Some Thoughts On Multilateralism With Chinese Characteristics|The growing importance of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China in the last four decades is definitely one of the most important changes on the international arena. A fifth generation of leaders has emerged in 2013, with even more pragmatic and articulated visions of what China is to become in the next twenty years. For the Chinese leadership, foreign policy is a continuation of domestic policy. Rising powers invariably use in time their new found economic strength for wider political, cultural and military ends. The fifth generation of leaders will have to deal with the responsibilities that come with Chinaâ€™s emergent â€œregional superpowerâ€ status in the Asia-Pacific region
A30|Russian Federation from a regional power to a great power status? a realistic perspective|After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, international politics entered in a unipolar period, typified by the United States. But, after Vladimir Putin came to Kremlin, Russia became more pragmatic, more aggressive, earning its influence on its former strategic sphere. It became a power center, and, along with other emerging powers, counterbalanced the United States hegemony, bring the internaÈ›ional arena into multipolarity. The aim of this paper is to explain, from the realistic point of view, the notion of power and to show if Russia achieved its great power status or it remains at the regional one
A30|The communication of accounting information and risk establishment in the economy|The accounting informaÈ›ion is a valuable good that we must treat with particular attention. Itâ€™s necessary to keep in mind the old say â€œBetter safe than sorryâ€ . By establishing the policies for information security and the procedures to be followed within the financial-accounting department, we will eliminate a part of the possible future events, caused by negligence or information diversion, due to a person, human or physical error. Doing a more efficient control of the data and accounting documents contributes to a transparent and correct information to all the users, in order to minimize the risks they take
A30|The national security â€“ an academic perspective|Defining security encompasses as fundamental notions both risks, threats, and means to acknowledge, prevent and counteract them. The ideological overtones of the concept have generated a series of opinions and points of view regarding security and defining security, based on the fact that in terms of liberalism and neoliberalism, or social democracy â€“ in general, the allegedly right wing/ left wing movements â€“ security (especially internal aspects, public order) can embrace various visions. If the first type of doctrines above-mentioned implies a state preoccupied of assuring free business administration by citizens and the existence of strong associations, made up of independent citizens and volunteers, whose activity may even determine a competition between institutions; others are often pleading for a strong state formula, responsible for controlling, in accordance with the legal framework, all aspects of social life. But beyond these differences derived from ideological orientations belonging to the sphere of politics, both democratic and totalitarian states face, in the current era, a number of risks and global threats, common to some extent. Security can no longer be reduced to the contractual or de facto obligation of the states towards its own citizens to ensure security against external threats undertaken by other state entities. Contemporary social contract between the state and its citizens has more provisions, some of which have been imposed in the collective public consciousness and in international law as axioms.
A30|Secret services and the national interest in Romanian interwar period|The European context after the end of the First World War forced Romania to rethink its national security architecture. Romania reacted than and continues to react to preserve the national interest in relation with the countries of the region. To insure the countryâ€™s security and national integrity, Romanian diplomacy was active in building a system of treaties with the neighbouring states, in an attempt to put in place a security mechanism for regional security. Consequently, the Romanian Secret Service (SSI) played a key role in the prevention and countering of revisionist actions and domestic risk factors. The research focuses on the interwar period Romanian official position toward the risk factors issue. This study provide an analysis on the interrelated domain of action of the interwar Romanian intelligence and diplomacy, in order to generate a corpus of knowledge, essential for the intelligence field, known under the generic title of â€žlessons learnedâ€ .
A30|Early detection of hybrid-type security crisis|The term of hybrid warfare has gained access in the specific terminology of conflict theory in early 2000â€™s, but it has become a reality for the wide audience in 2014, once the security crisis in southern and eastern Ukraine has burst. This paper approaches the concept of hybrid warfare from a theoretical point of view, aiming at identifying the particular elements of this type of crisis by analyzing the specific literature and studying selected cases. It also highlights the challenges this type of crisis poses to national intelligence, especially in the indicators building activities and early detection of vulnerabilities, risks and threats to national security
A30|Etno-linguistic conflicts in the Post-Soviet and Eastern Europe space|After the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, post-Soviet and Eastern European countries as a whole have emerged as a contested linguistic space, where emotional exchanges over language-related issues and disagreements over language policies â€“ supported by Russia in a covered manner â€“ have led to riots and even military conflicts and secession. In some cases (in Crimea and in Eastern Ukraine) Russia acted in an overt manner by coming to help the Russian-speaking people. Rusisia was giving legitimacy to military intervention by using clear statements, by both the Russian government and medias, witch asserted that ethic Russians and the use of the Russian language were under threat. My working hipotheses argue that one of the Russian asymetrical way to act toward post-Soviet and Eastern European countries was to influence the Russian language status and policies by supporting pseudo human-rights movements and referendum for Russian to be declared second official language, or by offering military help to Russian-speaking people in order to obstructing regional security at the border of European Union and NATO. In this study I will consider data (press, official documents and academic papers) from six post-Soviet and Eastearn Europe states (Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova) regarding the evolution of the Russian language status and linguistic policies applied, in order to demonstrate the asymetric Russian tactics to support inter-ethnic tensions, to divide societies and to increase social exclusion among comunities.
A30|Freedom and reforms versus national security|The main purpose of a democratic state is that of protecting the civil rights and liberties. The fundamental condition for a good government and for guaranteeing social and individual freedom is based on the the deployment of a democratic national security system. Geo-political movements and the globalization phenomenon are real challenges for the national security system, regarding organized crime, weapons of mass distruction, international terrorism. All these threats require flexible laws to allow the national security system to function and accomplish its objectives without tainting or restricting civil rights and liberties. For these reasons, both government and civil society have the opportunity and responsibility to work together in creating a formal agenda on public policy reforms regarding the protection of civil rights and liberties while redesigning the national security system.
A30|Analysis mechanism of crisis situation evolution having a major impact on international security|The plurivalence of the crisis situations triggering factors to which is added, almost always, the divergent interests of the international actors involved in crises, as well as the different areas of their manifestations, make the period in which we live to be one rich in tensions, in conflict manifestations at different levels of intensity, but always looked upon with concern by the international community and the countries directly or indirectly affected by this kind of situations.
A30|Bridging The Gap Between Theory And Practice In Organizations Â€“ An Intelligent Way To Promote The National Interest|The article proposes a a direct and explicit connection between the use of theoretical knowledge in organizations and the pursuit of national interest. A comprehensive interpretation of the national interest is advanced, one that has at its core the functionality and becoming of the nation. By centering investigations on knowledge at different levels of integration within a nation, the organizational levelâ€™s information processing capacity emerges as an important target. However, the gap between theory and practice constitutes a major obstacle in front of such a line of thought. A solution is proposed consisting in intensifying interaction between theory and practice from both bottom-up and top-down levels of organizational hierachy.
A30|The Degree of Absorbing the New Forms of Expression Promoted by Contemporary English and its Significance in Addressing English-Learning Professionals|Ensuring high-quality training to experts is a major concern of contemporary society. To facilitate the high degree of absorbing the new forms of expression in English, educators must literally take into consideration that approaching different sectors of technical English requires a high degree of awareness regarding the elements characteristic of these language sectors. Linguistics has a very generous scientific scope and is able to plainly reveal a whole array of processes and phenomena deriving from this educational process to the very benefit of the teaching-learning activity addressing professionals.
A30|Strengthening Populationâ€™s Resilience Against Significant Risk by Exercising Democratic Control over Institutions of National Security Sector|The article addresses the mechanism of democratic control over the institutions of the national security system as a factor in strengthening the populationâ€™s resilience against significant risk, which generally represents threats to the security of individuals. One of the ways in which social resilience can be operationalized is a democratic control over institutions of national security sector, mainly due to its dependence on factors such as public confidence in these institutions and mutually beneficial cooperation, sense of safety and well-being, affiliation to common social and national values etc. All these are forms of expression in genuine democratic societies, where institutions serve the public interest and civil society exercises effectively its control role over their operation.
A30|An Attempt to Define the Concept of Charisma in Orthodox Theology|Gifts of the Holy Spirit occupy a place of honor in the teaching of the Orthodox Church. However, after the emergence of the Pentecostal-Charismatic Movements, the Eastern Church paid more attention to this doctrine. In this paper, we aim to analyze how Orthodox theologians define the charisms of the Holy Spirit; as we shall see, they do not provide a perfectly homogeneous perspective on this topic, a fact which requires clarification of this very important theological concept.
A30|Analytical Hubs in Intelligence - Collaborative Platforms for Promoting the National Interest|In the last 15 years, the necessity to put together knowledge from different expertise areas placed the fusion centers that provide analysis and evaluation in various specific fields in the middle of intelligence organizations' strategic plans and visions. The inclusion of academia, universities, research centers, and business sector in the intelligence process has become a sine qua non condition of the intelligence workflow, especially on the strategic level. This paper consists in a short evaluation of the existing models and presents the so-called analytical hubs as proposal for an integrative working model. OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) plays an important role within these collaborative platforms as the most appropriate resource to introduce and use outside expertise into the intelligence system and to inform the beneficiaries in order to adopt the best decisions to promote the national interest.
A30|Populationâ€™s Resilience: A Social Perspective on Security Strategies|In front of the risks and terrorist threats or crisis caused by natural disasters, authoritiesâ€™ conventional means of intervention appear to be limited in managing vulnerabilities, especially in the communities affected directly or indirectly. Thus, populationâ€™s resilience, defined as that set of characteristics or factors, which expresses the response capacity of individuals to face and to recover after a traumatic event or a crisis situation, seems to be a concept designed to complement the traditional ways of action to maintain an optimal level of populationâ€™s security. In this article, will be reviewed some of the main elements of resilience and will be analysed those of its characteristics, which recommend it to be adopted in national security policies and strategies, especially due to possible preventive action and remedial intervention at social level, in significant risks.
A30|Reconsideration of Democratic Control Over the Institutions of the Romanian National Security in the Context of the Evolution of Current Risks and Threats|The article provides a documentation of the main risks and threats to national security and analyze the mechanism of cooperation and double determination, civil society - responsible institutions in terms of improving the democratic control of the security sector, the main instrument for ensuring the balance between efficiency strategies in this area and the fundamental rights of the population. Romania, a member of NATO and the EU, geostrategic positioned in relation to new sources of threat, has become an important pillar of regional security, being more involved in preventing and managing potential conflicts in South-Eastern Europe. In order to fulfill the obligations imposed by membership in the two organizations and to ensure optimum climate of national security in relation to new challenges, the institutions encharged in Romania are forced to adopt new security strategies and refine, so to answer effective current risks and vulnerabilities. In this transformation process, strengthening democratic control over the institutions of the national security system becomes an essential element of the success of their mission, both in terms of strengthening public confidence in the measures taken by them, as well as the correlation of security strategies and the legal framework in the field with the constitutional principles of the rule of law. Thus, it requires mechanisms to exercise parliamentary control over these institutions to improve in order to answer appropriately both to the consequences of the evolution of the security environment and the demands and the concerns of civil society, increasingly concerned about the possibility of damaging fundamental rights and freedoms in exchange for the best environment for social security.
A30|The strategic importance of intellectual property protection|Whoever we are, wherever we live and in all circumstances, we all have the ability to create. This human creativity and innovation is able to improve our quality of life, in all domains. The purpose of intellectual property is to promote the conditions that enable creativity and capacity for innovation to bear fruit on a planetary scale. Intellectual property rights are social constructions whose objective is to promote the wellbeing of society. They have become a major issue in trade negotiations and in the growth strategies of developed countries. What separates developed from developing countries, is a gap in knowledge. Inappropriately designed regimes of these rights can present an important impediment to closing the knowledge gap and therefore to development.
A30|Climate security, an important concept in the post cold war era|After the end of the Cold War, the threats to international security are no longer the same as in the previous period. Despite the diversification of threats, the concept of security has continued to remain the same. More than that, the concept of climate security is not usual for the international relations and political sciences theorists. It may be precisely the lack of appropriate conceptual tools to be the most important obstacle in order to seek solutions to a global problem such as climate change.
A30|Physicians â€“ culture creators|Many physicians, along Romanian artistic history, have tried to create as broad as possible training, as scientists, literary men, artists. The proof is that numerous pursuers of Hippocrates, either have attended besides Faculty of Medicine, courses of other faculties, or have had a self-taught manner of approaching different fields such as literature, journalism, literary, drama or music critique. If science is a faithful reproduction, art goes beyond reality through the inner filter of the artist, it is a decomposition and a re-composition, at the same time, of the environment. The piece of art is a blend between the artistâ€™s vocation and societyâ€™s aspirations, being animated by the willingness of communicating, of having an echo in consciousness.
A30|National cultural heritage from the intellectual property perspective. Conservatism versus modernity|National cultural heritage provides reliable information about life and peopleâ€ s occupations in different times and about how they developed their artistic, technical, communication skills over time, through various means. The whole modern civilization is concerned with this aspect, we could say cultural and national identity, traces which can prove age of civilizations and creations of special or exceptional value. Both judicial bodies and personnel security structures must meet the challenge of national cultural heritage protection as part of European and world cultural heritage as spiritual contribution made by the Romanian people of European culture and global integration process circuit values universal and globalization of culture. Protecting our cultural heritage we have the chance and certainty of identity affirmation and support the economy and resources.
A30|Aspects of the construction / deconstruction of the myths of Frenchness in the work of some French writers of the 20th century. Prolegomena|This paper explores some facets of the construction and deconstruction of the myths of Frenchness, a broad notion crystallized over many centuries, at two levels, the cult level, of elites, and the popular level, not negligible at all, as they are reflected in the work of some French writers representative for the twentieth century.
A30|Development of vulnerable groupsâ€™ parental competence as mediating factor for the next generationâ€™s socioeconomic integration - research project|A lot of studies have proven the importance of the parental conduct for childrenâ€™s formation and development and also the fact that difficult social situations, the lack of an adequate economic support and poverty can lead to deficiencies in the application of the parental roles and can also facilitate the child to develop deviant behaviours leaning towards infantile criminality and later (in the adulthood) a low socioprofessional insertion. Although there are numerous intervention programs for the vulnerable groups that focus on combating poverty and on professional reconversion and integration, there are no studies and programs dedicated to the improvement of the way persons from vulnerable groups relate to their children. The general objective of the research is to study and develop the parental competence of the members of vulnerable groups, in order to ensure the bases for their children to develop a harmonious personality, thus contributing to an increase of next generationâ€™s socioeconomic potential and integration. The final purpose is to reduce the costs of the countermeasures taken to deal with certain social issues (criminality, violence, social alienation and marginalization etc.).
A30|The â€œDark Sideâ€ of the personality in organizational context|The current article sets out to review industrial â€“ organizational psychology literature relevant to dark side of personality. We address several models used to describe subclinical characteristics, their relationships to the most common bright side taxonomies (i.e., the Big Five model and the HEXACO model), conceptual and methodological challenges in the study of dark traits and research relevant to understanding the importance of the dark side of personality in the workplace. We present arguments for assessing dark side characteristics at work and to continue research on the topic.
A30|The role of the Gattung in the prophetic call narratives|â€žThe call of the prophetâ€œ is the expression used in the Bible to indicate the first dialogue between God and his future prophet. There is the theory according to which the prophets themselves or the biblical writers chose to narrate this moment not according to its real development but to the representation the community had about this sort of meeting. The main question of this paper is: why? The explanation the scholars gave, according to which the Gattung itself along with the confessional and apologetic meanings would be the explanation for the choice seemed shallow. It proved as such. We formulated two hypotheses: one is that using the familiar pattern hinders the access to the meaning of a text, including those of the call narratives; the other is that the level of the human being development in becoming a subject gives the person the capacity to get beyond the form to its significance. The results of social psychology, psychoanalytic and Jungian psychology researches supported both our hypotheses. We may conclude that the sharing of their dialogue with YHWH in the form of Gattung was intended so. The reason is that allowing the veiling of the meaning under a friendly, common appearance, the Gattung contributes to the awakening of the subject.
A30|Predisposition evaluation in locus of control placement in patients with oncologic diagnosis|The literature in the field of psycho-oncology shows a significant relationship between personality structure and the occurrence and evolution of the neoplastic disease. In this context some talk about personality type C, as one prone to cancer (Eysenck, H.J., 1988), a non-assertive personality, unable to effectively manage interpersonal relations, and with strong tendencies to perfection - all of these characteristics generate psychological distress that, ultimately, affect strongly the psychosomatic ensemble. This paper presents the case of a patient with an oncological diagnosis, aiming at the evolution of personality before and after diagnosis, and also considering the characteristics already mentioned. The purpose of the paper is to highlight the specific mode of the placement for locus of control in relationship with others, analyzing the decision-making style characteristically before and after diagnosis. To assess the placement of the locus of control in the relationship, and the patient's ability to handle stress before cancer diagnosis, were used the following psychological instruments: anamnesis; Life Events Schedule - LES, authors T.H. Holmes ÅŸi R.H. Rahe (1967); Locus of Control Scale, author J.B. Rotter (1966). For the assessment of stress management and placement of locus of control after diagnosis, were used: a en_US 3 clinical interview; psychological observation; Anxiety and Depression Diagram â€“ HARD, authors J. Rufin ÅŸi M. Ferreri (1984); Freiburg Personality Inventory â€“ FPI, authors J. Fahrenberg, H. Selg, R. Hampel (1978). The patient had major difficulties in managing stress before and after diagnosis, showing almost a permanent predisposition to an internal placement of locus of control. The patient also formulates unrealistic expectations towards close people, shows a negative self-image, presents major difficulties in expressing emotions, and develops certain phobic tendencies. Psychologically, neoplastic disease may be associated with an inability to establish and maintain secure social relationships, caused by a deficiency in the settlement of locus of control, placed almost in an exclusively internal manner. The person begins to attack the self-image of the other, perceived as unable to manage their existence, reason for wich she is overloading of responsibilities in a irrational way.
A30|Medical language and literary expression|SaÅŸa PanÄƒ, â€œ(â€¦)walking and ubiquitous archive, ready to reestablish both archeology and history of the Romanian avant-gardeâ€ (Ierunca, 1993:190), is the pen name of Alexander Binder-the physician and he is known to the vast majority of Romanian readers for his contribution within the avant-garde movement, being one of â€œthe most competent theoreticians of surrealism.â€ (Rotaru, 1997:87) In SaÅŸa PanÄƒâ€™s case, the nihilistic language specific to avant-garde was influenced by his profession: physician. In a more careful analysis of his texts we can notice the influence of medical terminology, actually this was the purpose: to shock, to vex and take out the reader from the previous literature routine. If other avant-garde representatives found appealing the city and industrial language, SaÅŸa PanÄƒ managed to create the same novel images by using medical vernacular which was at hand.
A30|The place of the charismata in the orthodox church life and teaching|In this paper our aim is to observe the place of charismata in the life and teaching of the Eastern Church. In treating the subject, we will address issues such as: receiving of charismata, their purpose and function, the relationship between charismata and the ecclesiastical office and the issue of charismata continuity throughout history.
A30|Influence of some microclimate elements on quantity and quality of yield on tomatoes crop under polyetilenne tunnel conditions|The research was conducted in 2014 in the conditions from HusasÄƒu de Tinca in northwestern Romania, under polietylenne tunnel conditions. Two hybrids were studied: Marissa F1 and F1 Cristal. The elements of microclimate studied focused on recording of daily temperatures of air and from soil in variants with mulch with black foil and unmulched variant, elements that influence vegetative growth and increases of early yield. The processes of vegetative growth of the plants were weaker in unmulched variants comparison with mulched variants and early yield was most strongly influenced by soil mulching system. The research highlights the need to study the elements of microclimate in conditions of polietylenne tunnels as technology element with impact on yield and quality of tomato fruit
A30|Hearing failure as a defendant putting forward followed by arrest|This paper aims to analyze the different ways in which courts hearing treats a person as a defendant after the initiation of criminal proceedings followed by the presentation to the judge to remand.
A30|Tax administration reorganization through regionalization and the simplification of legislative procedures and the tax procedures|"Simplification and modernization of tax administration represent an important component of activity of the National Agency for Fiscal Administration, registered in the Strategy for services provided to taxpayers from 2013 to 2017. The simplification of procedures and increasing service quality is the first tool that taxpayers are e encouraged to comply voluntarily. Also, simplification of procedures may entail a decrease operating costs of tax Administration. Romania began a major administrative reform: territorial regionalization and decentralization of public administration to overcome the difference it has to Europe, bringing public services and policy decisions closer to the people. Regionalization process started in 2013 with the regionalization of tax administration by creating eight regional directorates-general of public finances. Also, simplifying access of taxpayer to their own file is a prerequisite for comply voluntarily. In this respect, was approved the communication procedure by electronic means of transmission distance between the National Agency for Fiscal Administration and of individuals by ""virtual private space ' and services ' fiscal Newsletter"" In order to develop an electronic communication between tax authorities and taxpayers was introduced the possibility of issuing tax administrative documents and communications in electronic form. Regarding the simplification of tax claims management we mention another priority objective included in the fiscal and budgetary strategy for the period 2013-2015, namely rewriting the tax code and tax procedure code. This paper presents some aspects of the reorganization and modernization of tax administration by simplifying of the tax procedures."
A30|National sectorial strategies that Romania should assume on the long term, taking into account the regional, European and global challenges|Our work proposes a qualitative analysis of sectorial strategies that Romania should develop to achieve the objectives of national interest. Our analysis also aims to highlight the main challenges to regional, European and global level that could impede the achievement of these objectives.
A30|Space and voting patterns: urban influences on periurban voting behaviour in the Romanian 2014 presidential elections|Post-communist sociological and electoral geography studies have ignored the importance of physical geography on voting behaviour. By analysing the 2014 Romanian presidential elections, this study shows that the voting behaviour of rural communities located in close proximity to cities is different than the electoral behaviour of communities located at larger distances from urban centres. From an electoral standpoint, rural communities located on city peripheries behave in very similar ways to their neighbouring urban settlements. There is a â€˜neighbourhood effect at work hereâ€™, with city managing to impose voting behaviours. Accordingly, this study points towards the need for new and more complex investigations that incorporate ecological data in reaching their conclusions.
A30|Russiaâ€™s strategy to reintegrate the Eastern and Central-European area in a â€œPost-Soviet Commonwealthâ€|"The elaboration of any analysis concerning the risk factors for national security in the next period it must take into account the ""Russian factor"". The Russian elites are currently resurrecting the Russian idea by recovering the imperial past and by obsessively invoking the geopolitical catastrophe that the collapse of the Soviet Union represented. The connection between the construction of contemporary Russian identity and Russiaâ€™s actions in the face of the potential NATO and EU enlargement to include ex-soviet states (Russiaâ€™s near abroad) and Russiaâ€™s strategy to reintegrate the Eastern and Central-European area in a â€œpost-soviet commonwealthâ€ have not been investigated. The way Russia employs its political connections, commercial agreements and historical legacy to undermine democratic institutions in this area and to bring it closer to its interest are in need of research. Rather than acting as the USSR during the Cold War, Russia, as several times before in history, is taking advantage of the realignment of global centers of influence and of the absence of a deterring foreign power to impose a neo-imperial political project in the Central and Eastern European area."
A30|Application of the Criminal Executional Legislation on the Matter of Probation - Difficulties and Solutions -|:Based on empirical research conducted performed at probation services from Bucharest and Ilfov, the author tried to point out the main difficulties facing probation counselors in the implementation of the new criminal legislation and the solutions which they propose to overcome them.
A30|Added Value and Challenges regarding the Implementation of a Social Working and Collaboration Platform in Intelligence|This paper contains an assessment of the main benefits and challenges in implementing a social working and collaboration platform in intelligence. This platform aims to pool knowledge from different areas of expertise - intelligence services, academia, business and non-governmental organizations - in order to develop appropriate responses to beneficiaries' intelligence requests from various areas of national security. The benefits of implementing this platform in intelligence are highlighted on three levels - cogenerated knowledge, intelligence products and manner of working - as reflected in the structure of the proposed platform. The challenges identified are related to the principles of social development (that have been adapted to the intelligence realm), to technological, logistic, financial and legislative aspects arising from the development and implementation of such a platform, and to those aspects related to the specificity of organizational culture.
A30|Placing the locus of control on their own existence in patients diagnosed with cancer|The literature on behaviourist psychology has revealed that there is a direct relation between attitude and the manner of orientating the locus of control towards oneâ€™s own existence. Thus, investigating the relation between the prestige of the source and attitude change, Ritchie and Phares (1969) noted that there is an immediate connection between the attitude of people and the prestige of the source expressing an opinion or displaying a certain behaviour, and identified two types of attitudes â€“ externalized, on one hand, and internalized, on the other. In their studies focusing on children, Nowicki ÅŸi Strickland (1973) have identified three directions: externalized, internalized and ambivalent. This paper aims to provide a theoretical analysis of the concept of locus of control placed on oneâ€™s own existence, to bring theoretical and practical contributions to the development of this concept, and to outline the specific manner of placing the locus of control in relations with others, in case of patients diagnosed with cancer and within the context of coping with PTSD.

A30|Using benchmarks from the social sciences in organizationsâ€™ headship|The article proposes an exploration of the significance associated with the concept of headship within the larger context of the roles that emerge in organizaÅ£ions. In order to avoid biased decisions in favour of one definition or another, I conduct a concise comparative analysis of the General Systems Theory and the Processual-Organic Theory. From choosing the processual system of reference derives the distinction between the roles of headman, leader, administrator, manager and evaluator. The degree in which the role of headman is assumed in a functional fashion, using scientific benchmarks, is tested by means of a sociological inquiry based on a questionnaire. Processing and interpreting data have revealed a modest appetite and an average competence in using benchmarks from the social sciences in the everyday activities of organizations
A30|The prophet like the poet or a comparative analysis of the moments of the encounter with the speeches of the unconscious|The resemblance between the poet and the prophet has been pointed out many times along the history, in order to indicate the transcendence of the poetical inspiration. On the other hand, a great amount of time the prophetic activtiy has been thought putting the human dimension of the prophet aside, the latter one imagine beeing only a surface for the divine projection. Nowadays researches have demonstrated that at least some of the prophetic calls narratives were composed many years, decades after the actual meeting between the prophet and YHWH. Due to the pattern they are build upon we surmise they may be intended to indicate the moment of birth of what we may call the prophetic creation. In the present paper we try a comparative analysis between the moments of the prohetic call narratives as they have been isolated by N. Habel and those of the creational labour, documented by D. Anzieu.
A30|The person and work of the Holy Spirit, as reflected in the orthodox liturgic life|In the Eastern area, the liturgy is seen as one of the most important elements of the spiritual life of the Church. Orthodox Church â€Ÿremains a liturgical Church par excellence, not only in the sense of an uninterrupted tradition of worship, but also due to the cult place that it occupies in the lives of believers, and to the special love that the believers have for the church building and its officesâ€ . But the interest for liturgy derives also from the fact that it is part of the Tradition, and hence an important source of inspiration for dogmatic theology. In such conditions, a thorough observation of the liturgical experience provides us valuable information on the subject of pneumatology. In this paper we will look at some of the mystical aspects related to the person and work of the Spirit, seen from the perspective of liturgical life.
A30|Frozen conflicts, economical relations and political ties. considerations on the components of political actions of russian federation in the near abroad in the post cold war years|The article summarizes the constitutive components of the foreign and security policies of the Russian Federation adressing the ex-soviet space. In the same time the demarche analizes also the means and the frames of the russian foreign and security policies and their evolution in time depending on developments in the security environment and international relations system.
A30|Strengthening the resilience of civil society in possible crisis and improving parliamentary oversight over the intelligence services current premises of the developement security strategies of Romania|"On the background of approval by the Romanian Parliament of the National Defence Strategy for 2015-2019, which introduced the concept of ""civil society's resilience"" as an element of the new concept of extended security, motivated by ""ensuring convergence with the European principles of security"" and the need to adopt, the â€ big brotherâ€ legislation in Romania, especially due to the rejection legislative initiatives taken in this area, as unconstitutional, this paper proposes two levels of analysis - strengthening population's resilience against significant risk and improving parliamentary oversight of the intelligence services, which provides current insights to improve national security strategies. Thus, the main proposed arguments aime at strengthening the population's resilience factors in relation to significant threats to national security, such as terrorism or natural disasters, coupled with a more efficient exercise of parliamentary oversight on intelligence services, with an increased credibility among the public, both solutions representing important ways to increase public confidence in the authorities and the preconditions for effective cooperation with them in crisis situations."
A30|The Romanian minority from Serbia and the right to education in the mother tongue|In order to provide the relationship between education, identity and societal security and to give an exploratory dimension to my research project, I propose a case study: the analysis of educational policy and practices regarding the Romanian minority in Serbia, between 2012 and 2015. The legal framework is crucial for the protection of human rights, but more important is the implementation of the legislation or educational practices. The status of minorities in Serbia has been continually monitored by international organisations as EU and OSCE, as well as local non-governmental organisations. Despite the Serbiaâ€™s progress in this area, with the creation of a complex legal framework, the protection and implementation of human rights in society are still far from accomplishment. In this context, the aim of this paper is to uncover Serbia's progress towards minorities rights protection in a scientific, welldocumented report, using a case study: the protection of Romanian minority rights, especially the right to education in mother tongue, practices implemented in 2012-2015 period.
A30|Innovation in accounting - integrated reporting|Financial results are no longer sufficient to provide an overview of a business. To provide an overview on the activity carried out by an entity, the reports will have to include both the traditional financial and non-financial part to provide information on sustainable development, the impact of the activity on the environment, social responsibility. The main purpose of this article is to present the concept of integrated reporting and national strategy on equality, social inclusion and active aging, with implications on the entities' sustainable development.
A30|The cost assessment for protection and prevention of activities carried at height|Since labor accidents due to falls from height can mean suffering and disability having simultaneous effect on both employee health and at the performances of the company, the need to pay high attention to the enterprise in terms of improving safety and health is essential. Given that nationally there is no systematic information on the impact of occupational accidents due to falls from height have on the sustainable development of enterprises, through the study conducted want to highlight the importance of economic indicators in making decisions about investment in health and safety at work. However, the article provide the advantages that arise at individual and organizational level when there are adopted measures of health and safety at work.
A30|Cost evaluation of work accident|Safety and health are a priority in national social agenda together with the development of a culture of risk prevention, based on a safe and healthy working environment. The article deals with the importance of injury and occupational disease in terms of economic impact. Achieving measurable improvements in working conditions and a reduction of occupational accidents and diseases is an integral part of any successful management approach. In our opinion, such management approach is based on the intrinsic link between productivity, work quality and safety in the workplace.
A30|Study on the level of attention to students faculty physical education and sports|"It is sometimes said that one of the most important qualities of alpine skiers must be ""lack of emotion"". It is wrong, because we can not conceive of a man without emotional feelings, likened it to a robot. Just an individual operating in difficult conditions, which implies a degree of danger, it needs a certain amount of emotional resonance and emotional in dealing with critical situations. Otherwise it would be disarmed when he would be required to defeat them because such precise and fast action situations Advertise with intense mobilization of resources and mental energy. Or, between emotions and energy mobilization there is close relationship addiction. Thanks to all the particular conditions Alpine skiing activity involves a high coefficient of emotional tension and stress. This voltage is continuously maintained at a certain percentage of risk consciousness itself, as well as other factors."
A30|The environmental side of the crimes committed to the forest regime|The flora, this great achievement of nature, the source of all goods, wellspring of health, happiness and spiritual wealth of man opens many interesting pages in front of the man who wants to look more closely, who will use trips, his travels not only to fins a place for eating better or more convenient to clean his car, but who will seek to understand this natural worls that surrounds, delights him. True happiness is of those who know and not for ignorants, ignorance is making the man indifferent and indifference grows slowly but irreversibly. As a consequence of differences between local forest-dependest communities, due to a lack of unity and homogeneity, the uncertainty of ownership, material and educational gap, ends in that they themselves become local factors of pressure and conflict. The desire for immediate enrichment at all costs, poverty, food and daily living needs, made anthropogenic pressure to reach alarming levels irreversibly affecting local forest ecosystem. Are determined mainly by the existence and involvement of transnational companies, the heterogeneity of local communities, policy interventions, economic and cultural.
A30|Social and economic effects of the restitution of the properties in Romania|The defining feature of ownership is to provide an objective criterion to resolve potential conflicts in society. After 1990, restitution claims began as real assets to the rightful owners, either through compensation. Thus it was established the Property Fund which seeks the restitution of properties confiscated by the communist state of the market value. An economic problem of computability occurs in this situation, since it is necessary to estimate the outside market mechanisms, compensation. New shareholders will bear the risks or will enjoy benefits associated activities economic, which will be the absence of restitution or unearned income. Monetary compensation by the state of their rightful owners experiencing difficulties ethically and economically. Given that situation nationalized properties in Romania during the communist period it has not been resolved in a fair, owners are still waiting for practical solutions. The number of requests addressed to European courts faced with a difficult situation Romania, the considerable economic implications - social
A30|The analysis of Romania's loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and International Monetary Fund between 1973-1989|Between 1973-1981, Romania benefited for loans from the IMF amounting to USD 1667.263 million (excluding interest), money that helped balance the balance of payments deficits. Because the Romanian has consistently refused to provide certain information confidential to the Fund, staff of the IMF imposed conditionality clause , which obliges the government in Bucharest to adopt stabilization programs. After 1982, Nicolae CeauÈ™escu considered policy conditionality as â€œinterference in internal affairsâ€ of Romania, and has decided to discontinue credit relations with the Fund. The loan agreements with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, signed during the period 1974-1982, Romania has received a loan amounting to USD 2182.8 million (excluding interest) for 33 investment projects. Bank has agreed to co-finance investments included in Romania's five-year plans, thus relaxing performance criteria when authorized loans. Socialist economy was unable to comply with the new construction plans for industrial- agricultural objectives, and therefore have not provided timely investment foreign currency necessary for the payment of due installments. In the early 80â€™s, Romania's external debt exceeded nine billion dollars.
A30|Enhanced binary diff algorithm for secure and high performance cloud computing forensics infrastructures|Binary diffs represent one of the most important and used methods when we need to synchronize the content of two binary files. It is also a vital component in the Cloud Computing security ecosystem as it permits efficient storage of results in case of a digital forensics investigation, but also for saving multiple versions of a monitored virtual machine. In this paper we propose a new solution in this direction, which applies with success in our implemented Cloud Forensics Framework, specially designed in order to prevent security breaches in a datacenter and also for conducting digital forensics actions in case of incidents. We will present the problems existing in a datacenter, the need for a new high performance binary diff algorithm specially tailored for our needs and we propose a new model created especially for these computing environments
A30|RSA algorithm implementation using FPGA|Communications in the modern society rely more and more on the Internet. A major problem in computer networks and communications via the Internet is the information security. Public-key cryptography algorithms are used to ensure confidentiality, authenticity and nonrepudiation of data through the Internet. This paper analyzes the mathematical algorithms used in implementing an RSA algorithm architecture using FPGA devices.
A30|Transient signal characrecterization using multi-lag phase space analysis|Transient signals are very difficult to characterize because of their short duration and broad spectrum. Classical methods based on the time-frequency analysis are successfully used for their detection, but their characterization is limited when it comes to signals with similar parameters. This paper presents the multi-lag phase space analysis, an alternative to the classical signal characterization methods. New tools developed for this method are applied on synthetic signals and the results are compared with the results obtained from the time-frequency analysis.

A30|Structural stability of buildings exposed to the risk of terrorist bomb attacks|Terrorist acts of the past two decades have resulted in major changes in approaches further military actions, while having consequences for all areas of social life. Many of terrorist attacks targeted or collaterally affected buildings, destroying them entirely or causing significant damage on them. Therefore, the international response has included measures to protect buildings against bomb attacks for government buildings, diplomatic headquarters, military objectives etc. This paper aims to make a summary of current measures that can be taken to ensure the frame structures against terrorist bomb attacks. On the other hand, using numerical analyzes, there will be establish new possibilities to adapt the structural system of reinforced concrete buildings so that the effects of blasting to be limited.
A30|Fluid-structure interaction using the method smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). SPH - flexibility, efficiency, accuracy|In challenging with a modern, complex and advanced engineering system, specialists must use a very sophisticated process in modelling, simulation, visualisation, analysis, designing, prototyping, testing, fabrication and construction. In analysis of advanced engineering systems there are a large number of physical phenomena, so many that is not possible to model and simulate them all, just the major phenomena which affect the performance of the system. In this paper will try to establish the benefits of using meshfree methods (SPH). In the traditionally FEM (finite element method), the problem spatial domain is discretized into meshes. The meshfree method is used to establish a system of algebraic equations for the whole problem domain without the use of predefined mesh. The most important goal is developing meshfree methods reduced cost to create a quality meshes for practical problems with complicated geometries.
A30|Progressive collapse in civil engineering|Progressive collapse of a building occurs when the actions on the resistance structure or boundary conditions are changed so that some components are loaded beyond their bearing and collapse. The remainder of the structure needs to create a redistribution of inner forces to take external loads. As a result of this redistribution, other elements may collapse, causing the structure redistribution process to continue until either external loads cannot act because the structure collapse, or find an alternative structure stable equilibrium. The initial causes that can lead to a progressive collapse are multiple and often based on an event are several causes combined. This can include violent change of air pressure (accumulation of gas explosion, bomb attacks, tornadoes) controlled explosion, earthquake, fire, impact of vehicles, weather conditions (snow, frost, wind), agglomerations of people, design mistakes , execution errors.
A30|Cold-formed steel structures an economic and a green alternative|As much as natural resources are decreasing, the people are focusing on finding alternative solutions to classical ones or to find new approaches to their concerning. In the last years the field of building materials is very active, there are a lot of new discoveries regarding innovative materials with higher level of technical performance but they are involving huge fabrication costs. Another important direction is that who develops higher efficiency elements by using new processing technologies and the same raw materials as classical solutions do. The field of cold-formed steel elements is continuously developing, as a result of their use in increasingly more fields due to their multiple advantages regarding structural efficiency, raw material economy and recycling.

A30|The electromagnetic field and the human body - methods of calculation and experimental for determining the value of SAR cellular phone interference|Nowadays the mobile phones are the most common sources of electromagnetic field and a significant part of global telecommunications. Most of the equipment used are the type of mobile transmitters ones, worldwide more than 6 billion mobile terminals and in Europe the percentage of people using mobile phones, PDA, tablet exceeded 100%. Before entering the market it is necessary that the equipment to be checked and to be in accordance with guidelines set by various organizations such as IEEE approved (Institute of Electrical and Electronical Engineers), ICNIRP (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection), and fits within the absorbed permitted power limits by the human body. This paper presents numerical and experimental methods for determining a specific SAR for some phones models
A30|Unconventional metalworking technologies. Explosive forming of metal|The metalworking of the high strength materials can be difficult and expensive, since the required pressure for plastic deformation is generated using complex hydraulic systems and, most often, the technical solution involves the heating of the processed parts. Similarly, for the process of obtaining very large pieces as single part or for small-scale production, the forging dies production costs increase extremely the price for the final product. These disadvantages can be eliminated by using the unconventional technologies of explosive forming.
A30|Economic prominence of energetic materials development|The national defense industry ensures the protection of Romanian essential security interests by: connecting domestic industry to the activities of the European defense industry; compliance with NATO standards and access to high standards technology and know-how; sustaining the endowment efforts of institutions within the national defense, public order and national security (SNAOPSN) for compliance with the obligations assumed by Romania under international treaties and agreements; stimulating investment in national defense industry, scientific research, technological development and innovation. The assessment of the situation at national level, in terms of the possibility of developing new products in the field of energetic materials, conducted to the fact that technological advantage, together with legislative and economic and financial opportunity constitute a good climate to embark on extensive research-development and innovation activities in the field. The establishment of new formulations of energetic materials has a long-term impact, which targets both to reduce costs and decrease risks during manufacture, use and disposal.
A30|Updating old armored vehicles vs. buying new products. Experimental research - making decision in updating|The paper introduces a methodology, further applied to a specific situation, to assess the advantages of using the experimental research in order to make the decision between updating the existing military automotive and buying new ones. The existing equipment, within the context of a permanent change of the armament system's requirements and the public road traffic regulations, can be partially updated without major modifications, after performing a thorough analysis of the updating costs vs. buying a new product. The older amphibious personnel carriers have non-ABS braking systems. To establishing the opportunity of equipping them with ABS, we proceeded in developing an experimental research program that allowed us to determine the braking process parameters that help in deciding whether to buy an aftermarket ABS for the existing carriers. The tests were performed according to some specific procedures and qualified equipment of the LACEBAT laboratory of the MTA.

A30|Is there anything new to say about American foreign Policy?|Today it is broadly agreed that innovation is at the core of society development. The mass media, the national and European institutions, the top management of the companies highlights the importance of this concept in the survival and development of the companies. Innovation is treated more as a result and not regarded as a complex process in which several dimensions compete with the major impact on the innovation potential of the company. This paper aims to determine the importance of the dimensions of the innovation management in evaluating the innovation capability of the firms in the IT and telecommunications industry in Romania. The usefulness of the research comes from the possibility of achieving benchmarking analyzes on innovation management among various companies in different industries. The existence of some tools that enable a thorough and objective analysis of the innovation management developed by the companies, it becomes really useful. Such a tool is useful for both the company's management and the bodies that offer European funding by bringing at the common denominator of the concerns of the firms directed towards innovation in several industries.
A30|Advantages and disadvantages of cloud computing services, from the employee's point of view|Cloud computing is a relatively new field, and this is likely the reason why it is still poorly understood by potential users in Romania, while also being an incompletely regulated field from a legal standpoint, as we see ourselves bound to enforce regulations that were issued in different circumstances, and which are thus showing their shortcomings. Cloud services are already a reality, and even if they are one step ahead of the legislation, a thorough analysis can identify, in most cases, solutions that cover most of the risks related to the use of a system of this type. Cloud computing is the long-awaited solution by large corporations - and not only by them - to simplify the network infrastructure required to conduct their activity and to reduce equipment and maintenance costs. Despite the widely known benefits of cloud computing, large-scale introduction of cloud computing services can generate a number of risks associated with data protection, particularly in what concerns the lack of control over personal data and insufficient information on how, where, and who is in charge of data processing. These risks should be carefully evaluated when a company intends to contract the services of a cloud computing service provider.This study aims at analysing the advantages and disadvantages of a cloud computing system from the perspective of the employee, as the party who interacts directly with this system.
A30|Using virtual space in human resources management|Cloud computing represents a modern technology that revolutionize the process of a company, the ways of working and interaction betwen employees, being a solution for the use of external information resources through the Internet. With the help of cloud computing platform the employers can have a clear record of all employees, including here personal data and information (deductions, payroll situations, generation registers, payroll timesheets based on working time, overtime, bonuses and vacations), which can be easy to access and use. Therefore, every employer can hold a strict record of all activities of the employee, online platform providing speed in accessing databases from anywhere (not only from company headquarters) and special protection on data processed. In the same time, employers can keep track of overtime activities and vacations,having the opportunity to plan the vacations by themselves.
A30|Cloud computing and client-attorney privileged information|Cloud computing is not legally defined nor in national legislation or in European regulation. There are some legal provisions, for instance, Directive 95/46/CE, implemented in national legislation by Law no. 677/2001 regarding the protection of personal data of individuals, Directive 2002/58/CE implemented by Law no. 506/2004 regarding personal data and the protection of private life in electronic communication. Although there is no unity in the EU process of regulating the concept of cloud computing, several entities, institutions and authorities have elaborated guides for the cloud computing beneficiaries in order for them to make the best decision when choosing the provider of this service (for example: Guidelines On The Use Of Cloud Computing Services By Lawyers provided by the European Bar Association). The lack of regulation determines the lack of a clear definition of the concept. For better understanding the notion, we can refer to the definition provided by the US National Institute of Technology Standards (NITS): clod computing is a model that makes available, when required, the access on line to configurable resources that can be procured and delivered with minimum of effort and interaction with the service provider. Cloud computing can be public, hybrid or private in accordance with the functionality characteristics. Giving the easy access to information saved in cloud, it becomes arguable if cloud computing is compatible or not with Client-Attorney privilege provided by art. 6 of the Statute of the profession of lawyer: the Client â€“Attorney relationship is based on honesty, trust, loyalty and confidentiality. In accordance with the same regulation the professional secret concerns all kind of information entrusted by the client to his lawyer for legal assistance and all the drafted documents that provide privileged information. Using cloud computing services in accordance with Client â€“ Attorney legal privilege should be subject to legal regulation. For instance, in USA, in July 2013, in 13 States of 15 States, the Bar Associations adopted legal provisions for using the cloud computing services. The Bar Associations from Maine, New Jersey and New York provided that cloud computing service provider is obliged to guarantee the confidentiality of the information.
A30|Efficient measures to mitigate effects of terrorist bomb attacks on buildings|This paper aims to present concepts that can help structural engineers mitigate the threat of hazards associated with terrorist attacks on new and existing buildings. The first part of the paper briefly refers to the bomb blast effects, to the damage of exposed buildings and to the reasonable measures adopted in the concept stage of design (urban planning layout, blast barriers). The second part presents the potential occurrence and propagation of the progressive collapse for reinforced concrete structures. For a better understanding of this phenomenon, an experimental test was carried out: a column situated at the ground level of an industrial multi-storey reinforced concrete structure was destroyed using explosive charges placed in boreholes. The test results were compared to data obtained from a 3D model analysis performed using the Applied Element Method, which combines features from finite element and discrete element methods. According to the results obtained, the paper offers the possibility to better understand the behavior of a building structure directly affected by a terrorist bomb attack.
A30|Study about the role of the lawyer in contracting safe cloud computing services|Using cloud computing is inevitable because its benefits are imposing it as a necessity for the society. Both in the private and public sectors, first on the international and the European level and then on the national, the concept is expanding rapidly and this situation involves multiple security issues. This is the context in which this epistemological approach proposes a discussion on the role of the lawyer in contracting safe services of cloud computing, by analyzing and correlating concepts, asking questions and proposing solutions.
A30|Tourism destination competitiveness - expression of Spain superiority in tourism|From a strictly economic point of view, the notion of competitiveness is defined as the capacity to cope with competition in an effective and efficient manner. World tourism is currently characterized by a strong competition between destinations. The foundations of the tourism destination competitiveness are the attractions and tourism resources. However, the real and long-term success of a destination is determined by the capacity to guarantee and ensure tourists, throughout its entire offer, an authentic experience, of a level at least equal, if not superior to the one of other existing alternatives. While tourism potential is a prerequisite for the act of tourism, a crucial factor for the development of the tourism industry is the overall infrastructure. The World Economic Forum has developed, since 2007, a model of measuring factors and policies for tourism development in countries around the world: the travel and tourism competitiveness index. The ranking of 2015 brought a change of leader: Spain became the most competitive country in tourism. Spain's position is strengthened by the number of foreign tourists who visit it, but also its tourism generated revenue. The regions that attract most tourists are the Canary Islands, Catalonia, and Andalusia. Located on the Costa Daurada, Tarragona is the capital of the southernmost province of Catalonia with the same name. We propose in this paper an approach to tourism competitiveness through a qualitative research, based on a case study on the city of Tarragona, a major tourist attraction of Catalonia and part of UNESCO World Heritage Site
A30|The correlation between economic development and effective use of intellectual property|Each state must protect its technological creations against third parties offenders in cyberspace and lately against cloud crimes, due to development programs of computing clouds. This means protecting computer programs and databases, whether they represent the works of authors, or they represent another type of works - created by some other factories, and even though, due to the investments that have been made, they require protection. In this respect, copyright protection covers IT creations.
A30|Importance of the geographical localization of the commercial provider of cloud storage services with regard to the protection of consumer's rights through European Union rules|"The article provides an outline of the issues raised by cloud storage from the perspective of consumer rights in the European Union. Cloud storage, whether of pictures, videos, text messages or other significant personal data involves the distributed storage of such information over a wide network of servers (i.e., ""the cloud""), located geographically in several jurisdictions, both within and outside the European Union. While the location of data is dynamic and can even be partitioned (i.e., the information pertaining to one physical person can move from server A to server B and can be also split or shared between them), within the general ""cloud"", the view of each jurisdiction is static. Thus, each country claims jurisdiction over the information located on servers within that country from the point of view of various legislative enactments. This creates a wide gap between the fundamental assumptions of the legislator and reality. It is also a fact that the consumer does not and cannot know where the data are located at a particular point in time. When the consumer contracts a cloud storage agreement with a provider, he gives a general agreement regarding the privacy policy of the provider. However, just as usually, the provider does not make specific undertakings, and also contracts cloud storage services from a further, third provider, such as Google, Amazon (who are renowned for their server farms) or others. The norms of the European Union are established so as to be effective. One of the most problematic areas where personal rights are at stake is that of privacy and the dissemination of personal information. This is because, even though the European Union has very strong legislation on this topic, the fact that data moves outside the Union puts it within the reach of jurisdictions with diluted data protection laws, thus enabling third parties, or government authorities to use the data other than prescribed by the European Union norms. When such data moves ""in the cloud"" outside the Union, and maybe even on the servers of a third party ""cloud"" provider, this provider may, according to its own rules, diminish the level of protection afforded to such data, enabling vast hacking, such as what has happened with Sony Studios after the launch of the movie ""The Interview"", when millions of data points, including personal identification data and passwords of its users were stolen and exposed on the internet. The risk is such that, by passing into a lesser-protection jurisdiction, information 225 may be exposed on-line, creating a great image, economic and even personal danger to the consumer. One method to ensure that such risk is diminished is holding the provider responsible for ensuring the same, high, level of protection for private information as that provided by the European Union. This, in turn, raises a question of jurisdiction over the provider. In other words, whether any particular country in the European Union has jurisdiction to hold the provider to account so as to ensure the respect of the consumer's rights. The article discusses this issue and posits that the better view is to base jurisdiction on the provider's physical presence because only the consumer protection authorities from such a place have the means and effective contacts required to ensure an efficient communication with the provider, taking proactive steps to protect the consumer's data. The lesser option is for the consumer to appeal to his national courts in order to obtain the protection of his data. However, this option if wrought with obstacles, the most important of which is the dynamic nature of the internet, much unlike the slow-paced approach of the courts. Therefore, for a preventive approach, it is the responsibility of the consumer protection agency of the country where the cloud storage provider is located to ensure a high level of protection for all consumers contracting with that provider, wherever they are located."
A30|Directing the strategies of the electricity production sector in Romania based on the results of the integrated analysis - economic and environmental|The energy sector is one of the most important economic sectors, so an appropriate orientation of the strategies in this sector represents a vital element for the sustainable development of society. Problems associated to GHG emissions, especially carbon dioxide emissions, resulting from fossil fuel combustion, and those regarding the depletion of existing fuels, are global, European as well as national challenges. Adopting environmentally friendly technologies and increasing the use of renewable energy resources contribute to the mitigation of climate change, a phenomenon that is one of the greatest threats humanity faces today. The following paper will develop an eco-economic analysis scheme for the energy sector, which will be used for evaluating the electricity production technologies, as well as for the analysis and assessment of medium and long term development scenarios for the electricity production sector from Romania. Based on the results obtained from the integrated analysis, proposals regarding measures targeting strategies in the field of electricity production in our country will be formulated.
A30|Evaluation of the management of PTSD patients with oncological diagnosis|The literature on psychotraumatology has revealed a significant relation between the patientâ€™s awareness of cancer diagnosis and the development of the post-traumatic stress disorder. DSM- 5 describes as potentially traumatic events such as â€œbeing diagnosed with a life threatening disease witnessing events witnessing serious injury or death of another person unexpectedly witnessing a dead body or body partsâ€ . This paper aims to assess the level of posttraumatic stress disorder in a young patient, M.C. aged 39, diagnosed with cancer, and to follow the stress-coping methods in relation to the evolution of the disease.The following psychological instruments were used to assess the level of posttraumatic stress disorder and the patientâ€™s capacity to cope with it after being diagnosed: anamnesis, Freiburg Personality Inventory - FPI, authors J. Fahrenberg, H. Selg and R. Hampel (1978), the Impact assessment scale critical situations â€“ SISC, authors Horowitz, Wilner and Alvarez (1979), the Social Support Questionnaire - SSQ authors Sarason et al. (1983), Beckâ€™s depression inventory, author A. T. Beck (1981), the Stress Perception Questionnaire â€“ SPQ authors Levenstein et al. (1993), the Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced â€“ COPE questionnaire, authors Carver, C. S., Scheier, M. F., Weintraub, J. K. (1998) and the Locus of Control Scale, authors Nowicki and Strickland (1973). The patient faced major difficulties in coping with the stress after being diagnosed, displaying a constant tendency of internal locus of control over his own experience. He displays significant difficulties in expressing himself emotionally and developed certain phobic and aggressive tendencies towards family members and friends. â€œThe neoplastic disease can be associated, in terms of psychological processes, to an inability to create and maintain social relationships that provide security, which is partly due to a deficit related to the locus of control, which is almost exclusively internal. Such persons can even go so far as to attack the otherâ€™s self-image, perceived as incapable to manage their own existence, and therefore overburden themselves with irrational responsibilities.â€ (IliuÈ›Äƒ and TÄƒnÄƒsescu,2015)
A30|China in the un security council: the dynamics of change at the beginning of a new millenium|The study examines the contours of a growing Chinese influence in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and seeks to establish the reasons for its varied cooperation with the other permanent members of the Council. It attempts to extract patterns of foreign policy behavior and looks beyond the array of apparently inconsistent reactions embedded in broader political relationships. Several questions are raised: What can help to explain the variance in Chinaâ€™s mixed cooperativeness in the Council and what does the answer suggest about the constraints on the other members in the UNSC? What consequences may arise if Chinaâ€™s actions are based on a set of values and national interests different from those of the major Western powers? Could Chinaâ€™s attitude disrupt the traditional working and normative practice of the United Nations?
A30|Romanian energetic security - a dimension of the national security|This paper aims to analyzing the Romania's energy security, both, overall and specific in terms of recent developments. The purpose of this paper is to stress the fact that energy security, both globally and in Romania, is one of the cornerstones for individual and nation's security. The paper postulates that at the national level, economic security is facing major threats that intertwine and influence each other: black economy, corruption and organized crime. In the economic dimension of security we may distinguish also various types of threats to the basic values and specific issues, such as energy security or critical infrastructure security, which are currently high on the security agenda for most states. The importance of energy security in the complex of security threats is highlighted in the National Defense Strategy for 2015-2019. The strategy emphasizes the importance of a strong energetic sector in Romania related to Europe and also to the worl enery situation,, into the chapter entitled â€ The economic and energetic dimensionâ€ . According to this document, energetic security is carried out by operational adapting and optimizing the structure of the consumption of primary energy resources, increasing energy efficiency, developing projects aimed to ensure diversification of the resources acces, increasing the interconnection capacity and competitiveness, including through implementing the objectives of the Energy Union.
A30|Between Theory and Pragmatism|This paper is a review about the book ‘Stress Test: Reflections on Financial Crises’ by Timothy Geithner. The book mainly discusses the policy decisions and implications of T. Geithner during his job as New York FED president and US-Treasury secretary under president Obama. The book reveals some hidden information about the decision-making process in both institutions. But it lacks a scientific foundation in order to explain the financial crisis in more detail. Hence, I think the book is less convincing than recognized in public. No doubt, Geithner crisis response deserves appreciation especially the ‘Stress Test’. However, the overall book does not demonstrate that the response is sustainable in the long run and scientifically sound. Consequently, it is more a book on public policy and governance than economics.
A30|Code of Conduct for MNCs in relation to Environment Issues|?Meeting environmental objectives are part of a dynamic and integrated process in which economic, social and environmental objectives are closely intertwined?. This declaration made at the Rio+20 Declaration on Justice, Governance and Law for Environmental Sustainability encapsulates the basis of legal framework governing and regulating Multinational Corporations. Globalisation has benefited MNCs largely and the world has noticed that countries often undervalue their natural resources in order to attract investments from such gigantic corporations. Regulating and controlling MNCs is a complex task since they have become global actors with great economic power and political influence. Therefore, the international community, comprising of global and civil society organizations, expressed concerns about environmental degradation caused by industrial activities and demanded greater awareness with respect to business decisions that might have a prospective impact on the environment. Resultantly, considerable number of international instruments and multilateral agreements providing for environmental protection were adopted. However, what concerns us is the skewed debate on the role such MNCs play in ensuring sustainable development.So, what is the real threat that is posed by MNCs? The authors, through this paper, have highlighted the major affects of operations of MNCs on environment and the role played by governments at national level, in trying to reduce the negative impacts. International law does not provide easy solutions to the social and environmental issues posed by the activities of MNCs, since it is addressed to state parties and therefore, does not impose obligations directly upon such corporations. This trend led to the proliferation of international as well as domestic codes of conduct for MNCs. The authors seek to establish the nexus between MNCs and the environmental issues, highlighting the incidents of Ecuador, India, Bougainville, Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Papua New Guinea. The sanctity of these codes of conduct for MNCs, in promoting standards of ethical business practices, is marked well through case analysis and changing legal systems of different nations.This paper dwells upon the aspects of state sovereignty, sustainable development; polluter pays principle, precautionary principle, and principle of preventive action, co-operation, and principle of common but differential responsibility. In review of some of the most significant codes of conduct at international level, we have tried to propose a socially desirable standard which the MNCs could unhesitatingly self-apply in their business plans. Lastly, the paper summarizes the role of MNCs in imparting environment friendly technology and ideas in developing states through foreign investment.
A30|Self-Knowledge, The Intellectual, Liberation And The Afro-Constructivist Strategy|This paper is motivated by the level ofself deception with the attempts at genuine national liberation are replete on the African continent, even among the intellectuals.The situation is that which we want to save ourselves when we do not know ourselves.Consequently therefore, this paper seeks to demonstrate that the Afro-constructivist strategy vould be a lead way in the right direction as African struggles for liberation.Following this strategy, the paper will also establish specifically that; a) the African ideological framework is not comprehensive enough for the kind of liberation she so desire; b) the African educational system/intellectual seem to keep perpetuating and recycling this comprehensiveness; c) the true project of liberation consist in keying into the project of pluri-versality as a universal project.In sum, our liberation consists in us freeing ourselves from the clutches of self-deception.
A30|Effects of Psychological Factors in Life|"Psychologists explore concepts such as perception, cognition, attention, emotion,intelligence, phenomenology, motivation, brain functioning, personality, behavior, and interpersonal relationships, including psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind.[5] Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causaland correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In addition, or inopposition, to employing empirical and deductive methods, some?especiallyclinical and counseling psychologists?at times rely upon symbolic interpretationand other inductive techniques. Psychology has been described as a ""hub science"", with psychological findings linking to research and perspectives from the social sciences, natural sciences, medicine, humanities, and philosophy. While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatmentof mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. By many accounts psychology ultimately aims to benefit society. The majority of psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing in clinical, counseling, or school settings. Many do scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior, and typically work in university psychology departments or teach in other academic settings (e.g., medical schools, hospitals). Some are employed in industrial and organizational settings, or in other areas[9] such as human development and aging, sports, health, and the media, as well as in forensic investigation and other aspects of law. We will consider social factors of psychological problems in life through this paper."
A30|Developing a Survey on Aesthetic Labour: Women Frontline Employees|All kinds of organizations have recently focused on being a part of unstable market and as a shareholder, increasing their shares in their markets. Especially, hospitality managements as being parts of highly competitive market and having a very tentative element such as ?human? have an aim to provide full satisfaction of their customers. Protecting their brand urges them to search for new trends to differ their service systems and that causes an increase in their expectations from employees. One of them is having employees that have eligible physical properties and attitudes. Nowadays, hospitality managements pay attention to physical properties of a front line employee especially in the recruitment process. They look for a person who is looking good and sounding right. Finding an employee with perfectible properties is the first step that must be fulfilled. Then, through selection and training, managements modify and develop employees ?abilities and attributes and convert them into aesthetic abilities. This, a creation of the management, the style of an employee with new abilities and attributes is called as aesthetic labour. The aim of this research is to reveal women frontline employees? efforts while being an aesthetic labour. Departing from that, a questionnaire was developed under the light of international studies as there are few studies in national literature. A pilot implementation was conducted in 5 star hotels in Antalya, Turkey. As one of the noble seashore and having many 5 star hotels, Antalya is chosen for pilot implementation. 150 questionnaires were disturbed, 130 of them were collected. In order to conduct a reliable survey, 12 of them were eliminated as being fulfilled by other employees rather than frontline. 118 questionnaires were used to verify the data. Factor analysis was conducted to prove the dimensions predicted. 52 questionnaire items predicted within six factors were proven as 37 items within 6 factors. Factors are labelled as ?Aesthetic Labour Requirements in Recruitment, Organizational Codes on Aesthetic Labour within Working Hours, Trainings on Becoming an Aesthetic Labour, Being an Aesthetic Labour in Customer Interactions, Effort to Preserve Aesthetic Labour Identity in Time off Work, Evaluations of Employees on Being an Aesthetic Labour.? According to the reliability analysis, the survey?s Cronbach Alpha value is 0.94. As there is few quantitative studies on aesthetic labour, this study takes a preliminary step for composing a questionnaire used for further researches both by national and international researchers.
A30|Why The Press Freedom ?S Necessary|"The theme of "" Press Freedom"" was animated both by fear of state control and by the perceived dangers of large commercial monopolies. The core princeples relating to media performance have often found clearest expression at crisis or turning points in national or media history; for instance when media were re-established in many European countries after enemy occupation during the second world war.In modern times there has been virtual unanimity that the press should enjoy full freedom of publication, within the limits set by the individual rights of citizens and, the need to safeguard the integrity and security of the state which guarantees freedom in the first place.In this framework I want to discuss the ""press freedom"" and why is it necessary all our life."
A30|Editorial statement: Lessons from Goodhart’s law for the management of the journal|In this editorial statement we summarise some of the discussions we have had in the last months regarding the risks associated with the use of indicators for the measurement of research outputs, and how these risks should affect the management of the European Journal of Government and Economics. In particular, we focus on the consequences of the so-called Goodhart’s law, which states that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. We also explain the latest developments in the journal in the light of our previous editorial statements, and present our strategy for the upcoming years.
A30|The Potential of the Relationship Capital|Assessing human capital contribution to the value generated by an organization is one of the major concerns of the organization management. This emphasizes the potential of an organization as regards its human resources and how these relate to the players in the business environment. Obviously, when speaking about employees’ skills, we should also consider the quality of the relationships created by them. Thus, we are to define the consistency of such relationships by analysing the relationship capital within an organization and its relations to the outer environment.
A30|Literary Globalization|The present paper intends to view literature in light of the recent overlydebated phenomenon of cultural and linguistic globalization and to prove how necessary it is for us to accept this reality. I'm not going to avoid the vehement opinions of non-believers, but the idealists that already dream of a global library that includes world literature by harmonizing the national and global. I will attempt to draw attention upon this new approach of the issue in question and to the role that the English language (along with other languages circulating internationally) is playing within this equation. Especially being part of a small culture, which to become well-known, must inevitably resort to translation.
A30|El rol del mercado de bonos de carbono europeo (EU–ETS) como gestor de inversión en medioambiente en Europa y países en desarrollo|Esta investigación intenta proveer una mejor comprensión acerca del rol que juega el mercado de bonos de carbono Europeo (EuropeanUnion – Emissions Trading System) como gestor de inversión privada en medioambiente. Se explora el comportamiento macroeconómico de la inversión privada en medioambiente antes y después de la implementación del mecanismo en el año 2005 hasta el final de la Fase I del mismo. Además, la inversión privada en medioambiente es contrastada con variables como crecimiento económico, tasas de interés y precios de energía (electricidad y gas) con el fin de cuantificar el impacto de estas variables sobre decisiones de inversión en medioambiente y evaluar el nivel de impacto (pequeño, moderado o fuerte) de todas estas variables junto con la implementación del mecanismo de mercado sobre decisiones de inversión en medioambiente. Para este propósito se utiliza una aproximación estadística mediante las regresiones lineales múltiples para los casos de Alemania, España, Francia y Holanda y una estimación de datos de panel con la información estadística de todos los países mencionados. Los resultados muestran que la firma del Protocolo de Kyoto en el año 1997 – como preámbulo a la implementación del mecanismo EU-ETS- otorgó incentivos perversos hacia las inversiones privadas en medioambiente hasta el año 2004. Durante la Fase I (2005 – 2007) del mecanismo de mercado EU-ETS, las inversiones en medioambiente mostraron una recuperación positiva e importante que no fue suficiente para alcanzar los niveles vistos antes del Protocolo de Kyoto.

A30|Boko Haram Insurgency: A Re-Visit To Economic Community Of West African States Free Movement Policy|BOKO HARAM INSURGENCY: A RE-VISIT TO ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST AFRICAN STATES FREE MOVEMENT POLICY ABSTRACT Nigeria is facing security challenges occasioned by activities of a terrorist group called Boko Haram. The main objective of the group is establishment of an Islamic Theocracy with 7th century Wahhabis dictum enunciated in the Quran and Hadith. Boko Haram have demonstrated capacity to perpetrate act of terror in both military and civilian zones in most parts of Northern Nigeria and Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Testimonies of BOKO HARAM combatants caught in action and surviving victims established the fact that, most of the top echelon and other ranks are citizens of neighbouring States who used ECOWAS citizens free movement agreement to come into the country, and most of them without their national identification papers. Because of this development and its threat to national security, Nigeria needs to weigh the implication of upholding clause warranting unhindered entry and exit of citizens of neighbouring countries. It is possible to be a member of the Sub-regional body and pull out of the clause of free movement of citizens, consequent to the insecurity facing the nation. Once that is done, threat and capacity to unleashed terror by Boko Haram will be drastically scaled down to negligible proportions. National interest and survival should supersede any sub-regional solidarity policy that is becoming a threat to the survival of the state and the wellbeing of its citizens. Keywords: Boko Haram, ECOWAS, Free Movement and Security
A30|The prospects of developing Suez Canal Region ? A futuristic vision|Located strategically between three continents which hold thousands of markets and industrial global zones, the Suez Canal is considered to be the shortest link between the east and the west due to its unique geographic location.This importance is getting augmented with the evolution of maritime transportation of the world trade, being the cheapest means of transportation, whereas more than 80% of the world trade volume is transported via waterways.Saving the distance for ships has its potential effect on the cost of time and on operational costs for materials and commodities that are shipped through the Canal, maximizes this importance.After the Egyptian revolution on 2011 and the increasing need to develop the national economy of Egypt, a major project to develop the Suez Canal passage way was launched by the Egyptian government on 2012. This paper aims to investigate the impact of developing the region of the Suez Canal passage on Egyptian economy and the world economy. In order to achieve this purpose a research methodology consisting of literature review is used to achieve an in depth understanding of the importance of Suez Canal in global trade. Second part of the paper investigates the plans laid by the Egyptian government to develop the corridor as a world logistics hub. The third part introduces the idea of constructing a similar route of Suez Canal in Sinai to maximize the benefits of the developed area and the impact this can have on Egyptian and global trade.
A30|Editorial statement: The first two years of EJGE|In this editorial statement we explain the developments in the European Journal of Government and Economics in its second year of existence. In this period, the journal has continued its international expansion, entered some new indices and started to experience its impact, as measured by the number of citations in other journals. After two years of publication, we have also learned some lessons that should help us redefine the role of EJGE.

A30|Optimal choice of an exchange rate regime: a critical literature review|This paper set out to review the main theories and empirical methods employed in selecting an appropriate exchange rate regime.In order to achieve this, the paper is organized as follows : Section 2 introduces the distinct classifications of exchange regimes(de jure exchange rate regimes versus the facto exchange rate regimes), and the different theoretical approaches which illustrate how an optimal exchange rate regime is determined . Despite their initial popularity, the theoretical considerations have not escaped criticism.Section 3 reviews the criticism of these theories.A conclusion is provided in Section 4.
A30|Dynamic and Topicality in Romanian Scientific Publishing|Scientific publishing is the destination of research results. Publications are the receivers of “products” resulted from scientific researches, but they are also incentives for researchers due to the provided informational resources. Thus, scientific journals “trade” information, and researchers are engaged in activities that constantly enrich the scientific fund with “finished products” that afterwards become “raw material” for other researchers during “the scientific cycles of production”. As such, scientific publishing is a dynamic phenomenon, and scientific literature is constantly developing. The goal of this paper is to research Romanian scientific publications by conducting dynamic analyses and by providing researchers with new information about national scientific publishing.
A30|National Publications For The Young Economists|The publishing of a specialised paper, no matter the category and dimensions, representsa real challenge on the research way, moreover as the target is not only the receiving of the accept forpublication, but also the use of the conclusions for the fundament of the future investigations. Theresults of the research which constitute the object of the publications are interdependent of thepreocupations and the interest domains of research, and solidary with the age and experience obtainedby this way. Thus, every reseacher in the economical domain, and especially the young economists,have to proceed to the identification at the regional, national and even international journals whichpublish economical research for the accomplishment of the proposed conclusions. The organised,structured, presentation, on recognised and ordered aphabetically categories of the scientificaljournals from the economical domain, will mean a support given to the economists interested in thedisemination of the obtained results in the realised research. In this way, it will be possible an easieridentification of the destination which correspond to the articles and papers realised by the researchersfrom the economical area.
A30|Quality Development Guidelines For Project Management Education And Training|In the context of globalization, economic activities become more complex and are influenced by a large number of factors, which need to be controlled and managed effectively. This also happens with projects, thus an increased need for qualified and competent project managers arose. The result was a greater focus on competence development in the field of project management, mainly through education and training activities. The paper aims at developing a set of recommendations regarding quality development for education and training in project management in the framework of the International Project Management Association (IPMA) standards.
A30|Establishing Data Collection Procedures Equivalence in International Business Research|Following a number of earlier studies on data equivalence in cross-cultural international business research, this article uses a content analysis of articles published in four leading international business journals from 2000 to 2009, to uncover the equivalence in current state of data collection procedures used by researchers in mail surveys. The results show that, despite repeated calls and the existence of a well established theoretical framework for mail survey data collection by Don Dillman (1978, 1999), international business scholars have not been inspired to adopt and report the data collection procedures adequately in their work. We hope this work will draw due attention to the aspect in international business research.
A30|Book or paper, the trends in financial research|Traditionally, research results produced within the community of scholars in economics of financial intermediaries has been published as a book, while recently an alternative output, the «paper», often in English, published by an international journal after a review process, has gained ground.The Italian association on banking studies (Adeimf) has supported the creation of a web catalogue of recently published of Italian books.

A30|Ethics of conducting qualitative social science research in the emerging field of nanotechnology|In educational research, qualitative studies have varied meanings. This short paper reviews the conceptual underpinnings of ethics in qualitative social science research and its importance to the emerging field of nanotechnology. The paper is aimed at showing a pathway by which the researcher might tackle ethics in a more effective way to achieve the desired results and whether different ethical values are needed in qualitative social science research of nanotechnology.
A30|Evidence review and experts’ opinion on consumer acceptance of agrifood nanotechnology|Nanotechnology is becoming increasingly important for the food sector, and advances and products are already being made in the areas of food packaging and food safety. However, there are several potential issues associated with the commercialization of agricultural and food (agrifood) nanotechnology that may limit its full potential, including uncertainty about whether consumers will accept or reject its products. Thus, this study aims to better understand key variables that are likely to affect consumer acceptance of agrifood nanotechnology, so that policies and programs can be better designed to address issues important to consumers prior to market entry. Factors that may influence consumer acceptance of agrifood nanotechnology were identified by examining historical experiences with other emerging technologies in food and agriculture and eliciting the opinions of experts and stakeholders. In this work, perceived risks and benefits and trust in regulatory agencies and industry were identified as the key factors influencing consumer acceptance. Our results compare favorably with other published studies in this area, and collectively they suggest that increasing consumer knowledge of agrifood nanotechnology products;ensuring high consumer benefits; minimizing risks; and increasing trust in decision makers and producers are important for consumer acceptance and the success of the emerging agrifood nanotechnology industry.
A30|Citing Reprinted Material|Journal articles are sometimes later reprinted as chapters of edited books. The question whether citations of this material should mention the book or the journal has significant implications. I describe several advantages of citing the journal: it allows the readers to locate the material more easily and to handle it more conveniently (when it is available electronically); it gives a better signal about how important and updated the material is; and it gives the journal proper credit, which is important because journals are ranked based on citations. Finally, several reasons for citing the book are also discussed.
A30|Data Collection Procedures Equivalence in International Business Research|Following the work undertaken by Hult el al., (2008) on data equivalence in cross-cultural international business research, this study examines mail survey administration procedures equivalence within 94 studies published in the Journal of International Business Studies from 2000-2008.The results show that, despite the existence of a well established theoretical frameworks for mail survey data collection by Don Dillman (1978, 1999), international business researchers have not been inspired to adopt and report the data collection procedures adequately in their work. We hope this work will bring to an end continuance of this neglect.
A30|Creative Economy-Feasible Option for România|The paper’s objective is the scientific foundation of the necessity to implement the topic of creative economy in Romania. The term of creative economy is widely used in the context of the knowledge-based society. Its importance to sustainable development, wealth and prosperity is commonly recognised mostly due to the amplified crisis effects. The creative communities and industries have moved from the fringes to the mainstream. The special needs of creative industries are reflected more in policy development at national, regional and microeconomic levels. The paper presents part of the results obtained within the research project “IDEI 1224”: “The creative economy and knowledge-based society. Challenges and opportunities for Romania” The general perspective of this paper is aimed at presenting our vision regarding the most important challenges and opportunities for Romania on its road towards a knowledge-based society and creative economy. Creative economy is crucial for Romania while it is facing the global crisis. In order to manage the current crisis (its complex nature derives from the fact that it is much more than just an economic crisis) in a competent way we have to seriously take into account the opportunities creative economy can provide. According to the authors’ vision, creative economy is a feasible option for Romania. The creative economy has to foster a holistic vision of development including socio-cultural, economic and environmental dimensions, offering new opportunities for Romania on its road towards a knowledge-based society.

A30|Integrated Agribusiness Model- A Public Sector Success Story of Instructional Dairy Farm|Agribusiness is the buzzword these days and is the main force behind the commercialization of the agriculture. Contract farming, One stop shop, Opening of the retail stores, starting of the terminal markets, establishment of processing units etc. has proved that agribusiness is very much happening in India. It has not only helped strengthen the forward and backward linkages but has also created opportunities for employment. With the advent of corporate players, many successful agribusiness models have been developed. Even Co-operatives like Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation has developed a model that has become a successful case study (Amul). Many agribusiness projects are being undertaken by both public and private parties on Public Private Partnership mode. State Governments are also trying to develop agribusiness models with the help of their agricultural universities. G B Pant University, Pantnagar, Uttarakhand, is one of the universities that have created milestones not only in academics but also in agribusiness. The university started commercial seed production on 10000 acre farm in 1960; launched a seed company in 1969 has now launched agribusiness model on its Instructional Dairy Farm. The farm has 13 units that are closely interrelated to each other. Out of these 13 units two units vermicompost and fodder bank have been recently developed and making good commercial impact on IDF. The unit is conducting all the livestock farming activities on commercial lines. The case study aimed at evaluating this agribusiness model. The model is found working very well and is worth replicating. The model also showcases the successful establishment of agribusiness unit on public private and NGO relationship mode.
A30|Teaching Islamic finance in madaris – need, difficulties and solutions|At present Islamic banking and finance has become a fast growing discipline. It ia the most practiced part of Islamic economics. At the same time there is increasing gap between the supply of and demand for the experts in the field. In spite of having advantage of teaching Islamic economics and finance, Islamic schools have not paid due attention to this subject. The paper emphasizes that to learn and teach Islamic economics and finance is the double responsibility of madaris. It will add to the credibility and insight of those qualified from madaris. They will not only be able to prove their worth but their demand in these financial institutions will also increase. In this way they will be able to check the deviations that have crept into these institutions which is a religious obligations on them as they are the inheritors of the Messengers. The paper provides an outline of such a course.

For so doing, the authors relied on the most representative journal databases on the field as well as on the journal’s archives.
A30|The Economic Approach To Education|Economics education is circumscribe a multiplicative feedback through expansion, diversification, intensive interaction between the economy and education, as being in an economic perspective on education, along with sociological, psychological, technological, religious, family, public, etc. pespective, in other words, an application of economic theories, paradigms and approaches to economic education act, act deeply human, spiritual nature. In practice perspective, the economy has education as a central educational capital, dual component of human capital, the defining element, the immanence of work, the economy.
A30|Continuous Professional Training Within The Learning Organization|Continuous professional training represents a systematic approach of learning and development, having as purpose the improvement of the individual’s, team’s or organization’s efficacy. This can play a very important part and can affect not only the human resources strategy, but also the general strategy of the organization. The concept of “learning and development” used by Rosemary Harrison (3, 2003), signifies a change in terminology, marking the moving forward from the traditional term of “human resources development” or “employees’ development”. The new concept describes in a more emphasized manner the importance of learning in a company and underlines the fact that the people who work in and for an organization have to be seen rather as “people who are learning” than as human resources.
A30|Critical Thinking - A Pedagogical Approach|"The qualitative and quantitative investigation of the curricular documents that regulate high school education (the model of the graduate of compulsory and high school education, the plan - framework and the curricula) reveals that the concept of “critical thinking” is used constantly by curriculum designers when formulating competencies, values and attitudes that high school education proposes to generate. Also, the curriculum reform implemented in higher education in order to correlate university education with the labor market needs continues to bring to attention, also at this level of education, the growing need for """"critical thinking"""" as a functional - action professional competence."
A30|Capacidades Societales de Innovación. Su desarrollo en Empresas de Producción Social en el contexto del Socialismo del siglo XXI en Venezuela|"This paper aims to determine the overall development of Innovation Capacities in Society (CSI) in Social Production Companies (EPS) within a 21st-century Socialist framework in Venezuela. The methodology consisted on the research of official documentary information at national level as well as specialized social economy topics, innovation and an interview. The most relevant result is that it is not possible to develop CSI in EPS in the short term, nor within the context of 21st-century Socialism nor any other development model adopted in Venezuela due to the non-existent and / or precarious ""culture of innovation"" and ""culture of partnership"" in Venezuelan society in general, as these are essential conditions to advancing innovative, partnership processes. The conclusion is the need to carry out educational and cultural values with the aim to promote societal innovation processes in EPS and in the various innovative Venezuelan actors."
A30|Stylebook:Tips on Organization, Writing, and Formatting|Fifteen years of copy-editing experience – with theses (both in economics and in several medical fields), journal articles, book chapters and books, conference presentations, government reports, etc. – are distilled here. Papers are often sent to me for “language correction”, but what I usually find is that, far more than that, what they most need is major work on organization, writing, and formatting (including presentation of tables and figures). Even good writers can improve their writing by paying attention to the points herein, I believe. Of course digging deeply into issues of organization, writing, and even formatting improves readability (and thus the probability of being published, read, and cited), but it can also help to improve the quality of the thinking, i.e., the content of the paper. I first review the standard organization of most empirical papers in economics, with suggestions for improvement (including a brief discussion of some issues in reporting of statistical and econometric results). Then I discuss many points of good (and bad) writing (including sections on The Language of Economists and on Overused/Misused Words) as well as points of formatting (including many choices, where – even more than in writing – consistency is the most important rule). Throughout, some differences between Swedish and English practice are discussed, as well as some between American and British practice.
A30|Social Quality and Precarity: Approaching New Patterns of Societal (Dis)Integration|The main issue of this article is to discuss the question of ‘precarity’ in the context of the theory of social quality (see Beck et al, 2001), with which to pave the way for developing further the theoretical foundation of precarity. Societal practice is the main challenge this concept tries to address. However, the danger is to introduce a new term, yet maintaining a discussion on traditional problems as poverty, marginalisation and exclusion. Our thesis is that these problems, far from being sufficiently tackled, are currently going along with and being adjunct to another challenge, namely precarity. Although the ‘old problems’ are not problems of individuals and expression of their ‘personal failure’, precarity – seen in the context of the theory of social quality – means a new stage of socialisation of the problems by further individualisation of the victims. In principle, we can say that this understanding of precarity is an expression of a further erosion of society, characterising especially periods of transformation of economic systems.
A30|Evaluation of Second National Fadama Development Project in Nigeria: A Rapid Policy Appraisal|The Second National Fadama Development Project was borne out of the need to ensure all year round agricultural production using available Fadama resources in Nigeria and also a follow – up to Fadama 1 that was adjudged successful. Its approach was Community Driven Development (CDD) with emphasis on social inclusiveness and empowerment of the rural people to take charge of their development agenda. The Project focused on increasing sustainably the incomes of Fadama Users via empowerment in terms of capacity building, advisory services, acquisition of productive assets and rural infrastructure development. As at mid – term, beneficiaries have increased their income by about 25%. So far, an estimated 2.3 million Fadama households have benefited from the expansion in incomes and wealth (asset) derived from the previously unavailable services provided by the project. The project had created about 126, 000 permanent jobs and an additional savings of more than $40.8 million have been realized by the majority of the participating states.
A30|Analýza siete ŽP Group podľa vybraných oblastí skúmania Novej ekonomickej geografie a teórie učiacich sa regiónov|Paper is based on theoretical knowledge of current trends in regional development – New Economic Geography and the theory of Learning regions. Paper is primary focused on a large company – located in the Banská Bystrica region – and on a network created by it and their importance for regional development. We explore processes within the Mother Company and its network that are enacted during creation of industrial network which was initiated by the Mother Company. In addition, we also explore importance of such a network for regions; knowledge and information flows within this network and their importance for regional development; innovations and investments to human capital through Mother Company and importance of these activities for region.
A30|Accounting Information - Power Instrument for Advanced Management in Knowledge Based Organizations|In elaborating the paper, we started from the idea of the necessity of knowing the reasons that determined the reconsideration of the importance of accounting information, in order to ensure survival, performance and durability of businesses in the context of the new challenges launched by the world economy. Continuous adjustments that influence companies impose the necessity of reassessment of accounting information as a management instrument, to determine the situation, to notice the opportunities and risks derived from the company’s overall policy, to observe strengths and weaknesses, to make adequate decisions in time and, more than that, to control the results obtained. Finally, we concluded that the difficulty of reflection of operations generated by the phenomenon of the sustained development of organizations determined reconsideration of financial-accounting information systems and generated new terms such as: knowledge management, knowledge transfer, knowledge sharing and knowledge organizations.
A30|Are Islamic banks in Malaysia really ‘Islamic’?|Understanding the underlying wisdom of the origin of Muamalat could clear some misconceptions towards Islamic banks in Malaysia. These misconceptions arise when we talk about transformation from conventional bank to Islamic bank. The development process of Islamic banking and the services offered by Islamic banks may be similar to those of conventional banks with some exception that include general banking principles. Therefore this term paper combine both practitioners and academicians thoughts and ideas regarding the Islamic banking and finance operating mechanisms and its possible impacts to clear some common misgivings.
A30|Production Possibilities in Catchment Areas Under Dharabi Dam in Chakwal|Water is a limiting factor for sustainable agriculture in Barani (Arid). However, rainfall is the only source of water the spatial and temporal variation of which is very high. Therefore conservation and management of this source is vital for agriculture development and socio-economic uplift of the area. This study was, mainly, also devised to address land distribution problems and consequent farm productivity in the study area. Furthermore, level of land distribution disparities was focused on to observe its relationship with different on-farm and socio-economic indicators including gross margins, cropping intensity, crop intensity and crop diversity, income distribution disparities and institutional credit availability etc. All of the aforesaid indicators were also assessed for small, medium and large farm size categories. The farmers were divided into two main categories irrigated and rainfed farmers. Land was observed evenly distributed in irrigated area while land distribution was found most skewed in rainfed area. The performance of most of the indicators i.e. yield, gross margins, farm income, labour productivity, income distribution, cropping intensity and crop diversity was found better in irrigated as compared to rainfed. While marginal factor productivity, irrigation productivity and rate of institutional credit availability was higher in irrigated area. However, rainfed area was always least efficient with respect to all of the quantified indicators. The findings of the research are helpful for the farmers of the study area in decision making among different farm enterprises. Hence it can alleviate poverty and help to bring food security in the deprived regions.
A30|Riscurile Şi Performanţele Bancare|Universul bancar se caracterizează prin multiple dimensiuni ale riscurilor financiare care afectează performanţele. Această multiplicare a riscurilor bancare ridică probleme de definire a diferitelor riscuri. În aceşti ultimi ani s-au făcut progrese odată cu reglementarea riscurilor pentru care acest capitol propune un inventar. În afară de aceasta, riscurile şi performanţele sunt indisolubil legate. Pentru performanţe, măsurile contabile clasice constituie o referinţă de bază. Dar ele nu sunt totdeauna adaptate. Măsurile de performanţe, ca valori de piaţă, sunt complementare şi adaptarea, conform riscurilor, este o grijă constantă. Definirea riscurilor şi performanţelor este un demers clasic, dar important, căci ea constituie punctul de plecare al gestionării riscurilor. Acestă lucrare evidenţiază, într-o manieră critică, definiţiile obişnuite în materie de riscuri şi prezintă definiţiile pe care le considerăm de bază. El este organizat în patru părţi. Prima reaminteşte marile etape ale evoluţiei riscurilor în lumea bancară şi financiară, pentru a ajunge la situaţia de astăzi unde necesitatea de a măsura diferitele riscuri şi de a le controla a devenit o evidenţă. A doua parte propune un inventar comentat al diferitelor noţiuni de risc. A treia parte descrie cadrul măsurării riscurilor şi performanţelor. O ultimă parte este consacrată măsurării performanţelor ca valori de piaţă.

A30|Misallocation and Manufacturing TFP in China and India|Resource misallocation can lower aggregate total factor productivity (TFP). We use microdata on manufacturing establishments to quantify the potential extent of misallocation in China and India versus the United States. We measure sizable gaps in marginal products of labor and capital across plants within narrowly defined industries in China and India compared with the United States. When capital and labor are hypothetically reallocated to equalize marginal products to the extent observed in the United States, we calculate manufacturing TFP gains of 30%–50% in China and 40%–60%.in India.
A30|Status Of Women In The Rural Khasi Society Of Meghalaya|The issue of empowerment of women has been much discussed at various levels to find out the solution to age old problem of gender discrimination, exploitation of women and to uplift their status and position in the society. However, in most of the tribal societies even if poor, women always have an instilled special position and role they play in different spheres with great responsibility vis a vis their counterpart men. The Khasi society of Meghalaya is such a society, commonly known as matrilineal where authority, title, inheritance, residence after marriage and succession are traced through female line. So it is presumed that they do not require any special effort to make them aware and get social, economic, political or psychological understanding and knowledge to establish their rights along with men in their society as they are automatically placed on an esteemed level. They are presumed to have access to education, ownership of property, authority in their family and society; they are the heads of their families and decide what to be done or not etc. But a recent survey by us in the rural areas of Meghalaya shows that about one-third of the families are headed by the male. Also many of the families headed by females who are either widow or deserted. Also in the political sphere, hardly anybody is there who is female and even in the Dorbar; females are not allowed to take part in the meeting or decision-making. But in most of the socio-economic activities, still now dominance on female is observed even though they are assumed to be physically weak. Also, even though some families are headed by males it may be that they are just to carry out activities with the guidance of their female counterpart who has better control over assets and therefore no fear of loosing anything even if they are deserted by their husbands. Therefore, a question may arise whether in Khasi tribe the status of women is ascribed or prescribed by the society. Also it is pertinent to enquire about the direction to which the position and status of women are moving with the development of the society. This paper is thus an attempt to examine the dynamics of status and role of tribal women in Meghalaya, especially of Khasi women. It is examined through a number of social, economic, political, cultural, psychological and attitudinal indicators on the basis of the primary data on such factors collected from two villages in East Khasi Hills District of Meghalaya.
A30|An Outline Of The History Of Social Statistics And Its Methods|The roots of statistics are concealed far away in ancient times. Although hidden with many unknowns and uncertainties one may see bright and impressive moments even in the farthest history. In its development social statistics has left deep marks on the whole statistics and human knowledge in general. One may see clear links with philosophy, logic, sociology, economics, politics, natural and engineering sciences, etc. The problems of social statistics have pushed forward the development of its methodology too with the incorporation with mathematics, mathematical modeling, and rationalizing its inductive method and its position in human comprehension of reality. This has provided a significant impetus for the development of the ideas about randomness and probabilities. There are many great names associated with the social statistics that made remarkable contribution for the development of civilization. Particularly rapid is the expansion of social statistics in twentieth century which makes very difficult if not senseless the question of its perimeter and frontiers. Simultaneously however definite tendencies could be noticed and it is anticipated in this study to outline some future developments of social statistics.

A30|Cost Return Analysis of Cocoyam Production at NRCRI, Umudike|A cost return analysis of cocoyam production at the National Root Crops Research Institute Umudike showed that the enterprise is profitable. Labour constituted about 50% of total variable cost of production, which is the most important resource in cocoyam enterprise. A hectare cost of cocoyam production was N140, 114 while total revenue was N257, 400 and net return was N117, 286. The study showed that small-holder cocoyam enterprise is profitable by returning N1.27 for every N1.00 spent.
A30|Magison-ison: A parallel reality construction of war among Joloano Muslim Survivors in Sulu, Philippines|The Mindanao conflict in Southern Philippines is a long-standing controversy that has eluded comprehensive solutions. Despite efforts of the Government of the Philippines (GRP) and the representatives from the peoples of Mindanao in undertaking peace initiatives, “the war:” continues. The establishment of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) as embodied in an organic law provided in the 1986 Philippine Constitution has not seemed to bring about the much-anticipated progress. Even with the so-called “autonomy” already in place to substantiate the clamor of the Muslims for self-rule in the Tripoli Agreement, conflict has escalated signifying unrest among the people. Instead of dealing with the problem from the standpoint of an “outsider” who may know about the Mindanao conflict from what they hear, the study attempted to get a glimpse of “the war” from the “insiders” who have survived and lived to tell their own stories. From the perspectives of two distinct peoples of Sulu- the Christian and Muslim Joloanos, the study was able to penetrate the heart of conflict in Mindanao. The study was able to visualize “the 1974 war” and the on-going conflicts from two cultural lenses and in the process was able to demonstrate a “parallel reality construction” among the war survivors who provided interesting insights of “the war” from their “fantasy themes”. The research has not only surfaced conflicting notions in their revelations of “the war” as experienced (subjective realities) but has generated elements of “convergence” as their experiences were correlated with the institutionalized beliefs of war (objective realities) or the war as told. Despite distinct subjective realities, they have shown proclivity towards parallel perceptions. The Joloano war survivors’ subjective realities as applied in the study include their psycho-social trauma of the war and their portrayal of the role of “the other” culture as co-survivors of war. Among the elderly, descriptions of their fears and negative emotions have strongly echoed “old prejudices”. Among the middle-aged, “prudence” and tact in their narratives revealed a tendency to rationalize and to show sympathy towards “the other” culture. From the young war survivors a propensity towards confronting their dilemma suggested optimism and resilience in their perceptions. Transitions in the subjective realities of the war survivors are apparent across culture and age. Opposing views are very strong among the elderly except for one Christian and a Muslim who are associated with “the other” culture by reason of marriage with them. The older Christian Joloanos for instance believe that the war was “unnecessary” while the older Muslims were convinced it was “inevitable”. The study has strongly shown that “shifts” in perceptions could be anchored on the participants’ religious beliefs and changing circumstances that come with age, political set-up, economic climate and inter-marriage among others. Their reactions towards the prevailing issues of war (media war issues, other concepts and beliefs of war) which constitute the institutionalized-objective realities as defined in the study are “convergent” despite distinct experiences and personal circumstances. They have for example generally shown disagreement towards the commonly held concept that the mass media function to crystallize relevant issues, like the war in Mindanao. The majority of the co-authors furthermore negated the belief of the general public that “Christians and Muslims can never co-exist peacefully, and that the 1974 war was a form of “jihad” or a religious war among Muslims. In the study therefore, communication has been proven once again to play a vital role in clarifying issues of the Mindanao conflict. It performed an emancipatory role in ways that provided rhetorical and psychological relief by allowing an occasion for war survivors to deconstruct their realities through their narratives. And to reconstruct their meaning of war by actively taking part in correcting prevailing notions of war to bring about the much needed change in a war-torn community like Sulu.
A30|Earthquake 2005: Some Implications for Environment and Human Capital|Loss of human capital in the form of skills and experiences is one of the outcomes of any natural hazard such as earthquake, drought, famine, and floods. Generally such losses have many implications for further growth of individuals, communities and nations. Disaster management and risk assessment has established a new need to constitute a paradigm of planning frameworks to develop modules for dealing with interactive rehabilitation and reconstruction activities. However, such management still lacks due attention in perspective of the remedy of human capital loss particularly in environmental management. This paper discusses the post-disaster situations with respect to human capital flow and stock losses and some of their implications and suggests some measures to apply in the earthquake-affected areas of Azad Kashmir and NWFP.
A30|The Integration and Efficiency of the Scandinavian Foreign Exchange Market 1873-1914: A Quantitative Analysis|This paper applies theories and methods from modern economics and finance to new sets of historical financial data in order to study the integration and efficiency of the Scandinavian foreign exchange market. Series of the monthly prices of sight sterling bills have been collected and subjected to statistical testing. The results clearly indicate that the degree if integration increased dramatically during the period 1879-1914. The price differentials recorded among the, geographically separated, national sub markets for this identical asset decreased substantially. It is clear that market integration took a giant step forward after the establishment of the Scandinavian clearing mechanism in 1885. This study provides the first empirical evidence that the clearing mechanism actually had the effect predicted by theory. The question of market efficiency was also addressed in this paper. It concludes that the undoubted progress towards market integration eliminated all systematic patterns in the price differences among the national Scandinavian sub markets. In other words, the over all Scandinavian foreign exchange market was efficient during most of this period.
A30|Hemispheric dominance and language proficiency levels in the four macro skills of Western Mindanao State university college students|This study was conducted to determine the relationship between the hemispheric dominance (HD) and the English proficiency (EP) scores in the four macro skills of the Western Mindanao State University college students. It hypothesized that students’ HD would have a significant correlation a) with their EP scores in listening, speaking, reading and writing, b) with their global EP score, c) with both the macro and global scores when respondents would be grouped according to age, gender and area of specialization. In this study, there were 240 respondents selected through purposive, stratified, and random sampling techniques from the 5,096 students of the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Education. Using the standardized HD Test, the standardized Listening and Reading Comprehension Tests, the researcher-made Speaking and Writing Skill Tests and Cloze Test and employing mainly the Pearson r for the statistical analysis, the study concluded: 1) that most of the students of the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Education of Western Mindanao State University were left-brained (74.6%); 2) that the students were “good” in speaking, “fair” in listening and writing skills but “ poor” in reading and in global English; 3) that there was no significant relationship between the students’ hemisphericity and their EP scores in listening, speaking, reading, writing and global proficiency tests; and 4) that a significant relationship was shown between HD and EP scores when respondents were grouped according to age and area of specialization only.
A30|The Economic Return to School Quality: A Partial Survey|We present a survey of the literature on the economic returns to school quality. A dozen studies conducted over the past 20 years show remarkably consistent estimates of the effect of school quality on students' subsequent earnings. A 10 percent increase in school spending is associated with 1 to 2 percent higher annual earnings for students later in life. We argue that the similarity of the findings across data sources and research methods suggests that school quality has a true causal effect on student earnings. Increases in school resources are also associated with significantly higher educational attainment, although the range of estimates of the effect is relatively wide.

A30|An Agenda for the 21st Century|"""If you do not think about the future, you cannot have one,"" the British author John Galsworthy wrote at the beginning of this century. In An Agenda for the 21st Century, Rushworth Kidder, award-winning columnist for the Christian Science Monitor, has taken up Galsworthy's challenge. He conducts wide-ranging interviews with 22 of the world's most compelling thinkers - artists, scientists, statesmen, and philosophers - asking each one this fundamental question: What are the major issues that will face humanity in the 21st century? The answers that emerge are thoughtful, often surprising, and as diverse as the respondents themselves. While the group generally agrees on the set of issues most critically in need of addressing - the arms race, overpopulation, the environment, the North-South gap, education, and morality - there is often sharp disagreement over the course the future will take. Educator Michael Hooker, for instance, foresees a world in which technology has solved humanity's survival questions, and in which the main problem is an excess of leisure time. The Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky, on the other hand, worries about human beings becoming increasingly standardized, resembling more and more the robots they have created. Philosopher Mortimer Adler calls for a massive commitment to education in critical thinking, without which, he says, democracy cannot survive. Historian Barbara Tuchman and novelist Carlos Fuentes each focus on the need to restore a greater sense of morality, both public and private. Repeatedly the interviewees argue that life in the 21st century will not be shaped simply by technology, but by our ability to come to terms with the social impact of new inventions. Others interviewed by Kidder include Sissela Bok, Jimmy Carter, Norman Cousins, Freeman Dyson, Amitai Etzioni, Douglas Fraser, Theodore Gordon, Hanna Gray, Paul Johnson, Shuichi Kato, Robert McNamara, Olesegun Obasanjo, David Packard, Lloyd Richards, Abdus Salam, Richard von Weizsacker, and Marina Whitman. Kidder has written brief portraits of each interviewee and a concluding chapter. The interviews were originally published as a series in the Christian Science Monitor where Rushworth Kidder covers social issues and trends. He is also the author of books on poets Dylan Thomas and e.e. Cummings."
