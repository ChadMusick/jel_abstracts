M54|Strategic Investment Decisions in Multi-stage Contests with Heterogeneous Players|We study strategic investment decisions in multi-stage contests with heterogeneous players. Our theoretical model of a round-robin rank-order tournament predicts that players conserve resources in a current contest to spend more in the subsequent contest if the degree of heterogeneity in the current (subsequent) contest is sufficiently large (small). We confirm these predictions using data from German professional soccer, where players are subject to a one-match ban if they accumulate five yellow cards. We find that players with four yellow cards facing the risk of being suspended for the next match are (i) less likely to be fielded when the heterogeneity in the current match increases and (ii) more likely to receive a fifth yellow card in the current match when the heterogeneity in the next match increases or when the heterogeneity in the next match but one (for which they return from their ban) decreases.
M54|Making moves matter: experimental evidence on incentivizing bureaucrats through performance-based postings|Bureaucracies often post staff to better or worse locations, ostensibly to provide incentives. Yet we know little about whether this works, with heterogeneity in preferences over postings impacting effectiveness. We propose a performance-ranked serial dictatorship mechanism, whereby bureaucrats sequentially choose desired locations in order of performance. We evaluate this using a two-year field experiment with 525 property tax inspectors in Pakistan. The mechanism increases annual tax revenue growth by 30–41 percent. Inspectors whom our model predicts face high equilibrium incentives under the scheme indeed increase performance more. Our results highlight the potential of periodic merit-based postings in enhancing bureaucratic performance.
M54|High Performance Work Systems and Employee Outcomes: A Meta-analysis for Future Research|This paper consists of a literature review of the impact of High Performance Work Systems (HPWS) on employee outcomes such as job satisfaction and organizational affective commitment, based on employees’ perceptions. After reviewing the strategic importance of Human Resources Management, we draw on theories like AMO and Social Exchange to understand the impact of HPWS on employee outcomes, suggesting possible relations that can shed some light into the “blackbox” of HPWS-performance linkage.
M54|Unethical behavior and group identity in contests|Using a real-effort experiment, we study whether group identity affects unethical behavior in a contest game. We vary whether minimal group identity is induced or not, whether individuals have to report their own outcome or the outcome of their competitor, and whether pairs of competitors share the same group identity or not. We show that individuals misreport in the same proportion and to the same extent by inflating their outcome or by decreasing their opponent’s outcome, except when any possible scrutiny by the experimenter is removed. Regardless of the possibility of scrutiny by the experimenter, misreporting is affected neither by the competitor’s group identity nor by the individual’s beliefs about others’ misreporting behavior. This suggests that in competitive settings, unethical behavior is mainly driven by an unconditional desire to win.
M54|Socialist Legacies and Human Resource Management in European Transition Economies : An Analytical Survey|This paper takes up the human resource management studies targeting European transition economies (ETEs) in the context of transition economies and empirically examines the relationship between the existing studies, which discuss the institutional and cultural legacies of their socialist period, and the attributes of the literature. This analytical survey clarifies that the major studies in human resource management in ETEs still keep focus on the old socialist legacies, particularly in traditional industries, and that the socialist institutional legacies are actively and continuously discussed in ETEs to understand the diversity of European HRM, though there is a possibility that the divergence theory based on cultural legacies may become inapplicable in accordance with their deepening integration with the EU economy.
M54|Management and Shocks to Worker Productivity|The assignment of workers to tasks is an important feature of the organization of production within firms. We study how task allocation across workers changes in response to productivity shocks. Pairing hourly productivity data from a ready-made garments firm with granular data on exposure to particulate matter pollution, we show that productivity suffers as a result of pollution shocks; this effect is heterogeneous across workers and tasks. Managers respond by reassigning workers to tasks in which they perform better on average during shocks. This response is larger for managers who we identify, via survey-based measurement, as exhibiting greater managerial attention, and these same managers are also the ones who are most able to mitigate resulting productivity declines.
M54|Returns to different forms of job related training: Factoring in informal learning|This study aims at disentangling the returns to formal, non-formal and informal training and fills key knowledge gaps. Informal learning is found to be by far the most common form of job-related learning at work. Learning informally at work is found to be associated with 3.5% higher wages, on top of the wage returns of non-formal training which amount to about 11%. Work environments which apply high performance work organisation practices – i.e. where workers have more autonomy and work in teams – are found to nurture a training culture that yields high returns. Workers in these contexts are 12% more likely to experience informal learning. In addition, they also reap higher returns from the training they attend, both non-formal and informal. This suggests that HPWP may amplify the benefits of learning at work, possibly giving workers more opportunities to turn what they learn into immediate use because of the increased flexibility in organising once work.
M54|"A study on the discriminability, effect and factors of ""Soshiki wo seou ishiki h, new type of organizational commitment"|"Traditionally, organizational commitment has been viewed as an important theme in management, and employees with high organizational commitment has less intension to leave or change jobs and are willing to behave according to the organization's values and standards. Although high organizational commitment is taken positively, the high level of organizational commitment may also be treated as negative for avoiding or inhibiting change when organizational change and innovation are considered important. In this study, we assumed that there might be another concept of organizational commitment that captures consciousness to carry or manage the organization and apart from affective commitment and continuous commitment. It is the new relationship between the organization and employees that leads to transformational behavior, positive voice to the organization, and a role commitment to take on important responsibilities as a core member. A survey was conducted with 132 employees of company X (general chemical indutry). As a result, a new type of organizational commitment named as gSoshiki wo seou ishiki h, was not be distinguished from affective commitment, but it was different from continuous commitment. It was also confirmed that a broader affective commitment including ""consciousness to bear the organization"" promotes positive voice and is promoted by career hope and career support mainly by their superiors."
M54|Managing Small Business Human Resources: An International Approach|While much of our knowledge concerning traditional HR topics (e.g., recruiting, compensation, or performance management) in large firms may also apply in small or emerging organizations, evidence suggests that new ventures are different and that management of people within them may not clearly map to management within larger, more established organizations. This paper reviews extant research on managing people within small and emerging ventures and highlights additional questions that have not yet been addressed. Our review suggests that as scholars, our understanding of the HR issues important to small and emerging firms is limited. While we have begun to understand how these firms should hire, reward, and perhaps even motivate their employees, we lack much of the theory and data necessary to understand how small and emerging firms train their employees, manage their performance, promote or handle organizational change, or respond to potential labor relations and political issues. The existing literature presents an often-confounded relationship between size and age, between the issues important to small firms and the issues important to young ones. Given the potential early HR decisions must impact the organization's downstream success, it is important that we understand how these functional areas of HR (as well as their integration and evolution) affect small and emerging firms, and how the HR decisions made during the formative stages of firm development impact the firm's long-term goals.
M54|Effective Leadership Selection in Complementary Teams|This paper considers effective leadership selection in a simple two-person team production model with heterogeneous agents. We demonstrate leadership success through synergy by showing that the existence of synergy makes effort complementary, implying that the leader devote more effort than the follower and that a team with a leader yields greater production than a team without a leader. We also show that, to elicit greater team production, a principal should appoint the agent with higher (lower) opportunity cost as the leader (follower). Even if the agents' opportunity costs are unobservable to the principal, the principal can select a better leader by proposing a larger position allowance for the leader. The results may explain why many organizations indeed favor leadership styles and why real-world leaders receive higher compensation than followers.

M54|Job Performance Motivation of Employees Case study of ABC Co., Ltd. Suphanburi, Thailand|The objective is to study the motivation level of the employees of ABC Company Limited and compare personal factors and motivation of employees of ABC Company Limited. The equipment is a questionnaire, a sample group of 200 people and statistics used in data analysis: frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation and value measurement result of T-Test and F-Test. According to the study, it has been found that work motivation level of employees stays at a moderate level in all 3 factors: working environment, income and growth at work. The hypothesis test results show that the different age, income, years of job experience can cause significantly different work motivation (p 0.05).
M54|Control in the era of surveillance capitalism: an empirical investigation of Italian Industry 4.0 factories|Abstract We explore the extent to which the current technological trend, dubbed Industry 4.0, might increase forms of control inside organisations, by focussing on pivotal firms in the so-called Italian Motor Valley currently embracing its adoption. We find that Industry 4.0 technologies open up great possibilities for incorporating the three forms of control identified by Orlikowski (Account Manag Inf Technol 1(1):9–42, https://doi.org/10.1016/0959-8022(91)90011-3 , 1991), i.e. personal, bureaucratic, and social, into technological artefacts, often blending them together. If, on the one hand, this implies a technical and theoretical feasibility of enforcing forms of ‘Big Brother’ surveillance within the boundaries of organisations, and thereby of the workplace, on the other hand, the actual achievement of these possibilities depends on the organisational environment within which the new technologies are implemented.
M54|Wage Oﬀers and On-the-job Search|We study the wage-setting problem of an employer with private information about demand for its product when workers can engage in costly on-the-job search. Employers understand that low wage oﬀers may convey bad news that induces workers to search. The unique perfect sequential equilibrium wage strategy is characterized by : (i) pooling by intermediate-revenue employers on a common wage that just deters search; (ii) discontinuously lower revealing oﬀers by low-revenue employers for whom the beneﬁt of deterring search fails to warrant the required high pooling wage; and (iii) high revealing oﬀers by high-revenue employers seeking to deter aggressive raiders
M54|Birthplace diversity and team performance|We present a simple model to illustrate how birthplace diversity may affect team performance. The model assumes that birthplace diversity increases the stock of available knowledge due to skill complementarities and decreases effciency due to communication barriers. The consequence of these two opposing effects is a humpshaped relationship between birthplace diversity and team performance. To verify this prediction, we exploit self-collected data on the first division of German male soccer. Our data set covers 7,028 matches and includes information about 3,266 players coming from 98 countries. We propose two different instrumental variable approaches to identify the effect of birthplace diversity on team performance. Our findings suggest that an intermediate level of birthplace diversity maximizes team performance.
M54|Understanding Youth in Arab Countries:|The following contribution is a synthesis of many contributions (Driouchi & Harkat, 2017a; 2017b; 2017c; 2017d; 2017e; Harkat, Driouchi, and Achehboune, 2016a; 2016b; and Harkat and Driouchi, 2017) and aims at analyzing the situation of the youngest segments in Arab economies. Findings indicate that the values, and the way women is perceived as a player in the economy by older generations did not change. But with regard to work attribute, they have changed significantly. With regard to macroeconomic threats, they are perceived more by young individuals in non-GCC countries than young individuals in GCC countries. The remaining four sections indicate the impact of vocational and general education on macroeconomic and social variables, the status as well as the determinants of youth unemployment, the status and determinants of young individuals not in education, not in employment, and not in training (or NEETs), and the impact of the demographic dividend on the NEETs. Empirical results indicate that the situation and impact of the youth differs from each Arab economy to another.

M54|Corporate scientists as the triggers of transitions towards firms' exploration research strategies|Exploration-oriented research strategies represent a critical factor for firms’ innovation performance and long term survival since they influence the capacity of these organizations to develop breakthrough innovations and move up the quality ladder of product development. However, setting in motion and sustaining exploratory research strategies are not straightforward. In this study, we contend that the availability of corporate scientists (i.e. personnel with PhD qualifications in R&D units) is a triggering factor for two critical transitions in firms’ R&D strategies: i) initiation of exploration-oriented research activities (exploration-enacting strategy); and ii) increased commitment to exploration-oriented research activities (exploration-deepening strategy). We conduct our analysis on a large sample of Spanish manufacturing firms. We address endogeneity concerns by using the exogenous supply of PhD graduates as an instrumental variable. Our results show that firms recruiting doctoral graduates (PhDs) to their R&D units increase the likelihood of initiating and strengthening exploration-oriented research strategies. The implications of these findings for innovation management and policy are discussed.
M54|HPWS in the Public Sector: Are There Mutual Gains?|Few studies investigate the links between high-performance work systems (HPWS) on public sector organizational performance and worker job attitudes. We fill this gap with analyses of these links using linked employer-employee surveys of workplaces in Britain in 2004 and 2011. We find robust evidence of positive associations between the use of HPWS and organizational performance in the public sector but no associations with worker attitudes. The implication is that, in contrast to similar work on the private sector in the United States (Appelbaum et al., 2000) HPWS is not delivering mutual gains for employers and employees in the British public sector.
M54|Wage Offers and On-the-job Search|We study the wage-setting problem of an employer with private information about demand for its product when workers can engage in costly on-the-job search. Employers understand that low wage offers may convey bad news that induces workers to search. The unique perfect sequential equilibrium wage strategy is characterized by: (i) pooling by intermediate-revenue employers on a common wage that just deters search; (ii) discontinuously lower revealing offers by low-revenue employers for whom the benefit of deterring search fails to warrant the required high pooling wage; and (iii) high revealing offers by high-revenue employers seeking to deter aggressive poachers.
M54|Current trends of employers? brands and strategies to improve the attractiveness of employers|The article deals with the attitude of HR specialists to current HR trends. It addresses the question of building an employer's brand as a competitive advantage in the labor market. Companies have begun or are slowly starting to deal with the Employer Branding concept. They do not want to leave anything to chance and want to manage their business with a long-term perspective. With a long-term perspective which helps firms to promote themselves on the external labor market in front of potential candidates and on the internal labor market in front of their own employees. This promotion must be able to address, attract, retain and motivate talented and qualified employees and ensure the engagement of their own employees. It is and will be a major challenge in recent years. Employer brand should serve as a useful organizational framework for strategic human resources management.For the purpose of these findings, an online survey is conducted every year, involving HR specialists. Research was conducted in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. The analyzes of individual years were evaluated and the results are compared on a year-to-year basis. The results show four main recommendations for companies operating in the Czech Republic. This paper is a part of a research ? project IGA (Internal Grant Agency) No. PEF_DP_2018004, Department of Management, FBE, MENDELU in Brno.
M54|Perceived Organisational Support, Job Satisfaction And Organisational Citizenship Behaviour Of South African Police Service Officials|The current research study is premised on theoretical frameworks that are embedded in different human behaviour studies, which have been conducted by researchers in the past. The different theories underlying the research will be discussed. This study aims to provide a more complete picture of the Organisational Citizenship Behaviour (OCB), Perceived Organisational Support (POS) and Job Satisfaction (JS), in the South African Police Service (SAPS) and contribute towards cultivating a more professional corps of SAPS officials. A quantitative and descriptive research method was used to investigate a sample size of 300 police officials working at police stations in the Tygerberg Cluster of SAPS. Data was collected with the aid of a structured questionnaire. The reliability and validity were increased by conducting a pre-test and a pilot study prior to the final study. A factor analytic procedure was followed for each of the three constructs. The results of the correlation analysis revealed a negative relationship between POS and OCB and between JS and OCB. The data, however, indicated positive correlations between JS and POS. Findings and recommendations in this study are important to government, SAPS, individual members and commanders as it provides information regarding types of activities and interventions to enhance perceived organisational support, job satisfaction and behaviours associated with organisational citizenship.
M54|Different Generations In The Labor Market ? Implications For The Workplace: The Case Of The Czech Republic|The issue of generations, namely the focus on their characteristics and the current and future impact on business practices, is the key factor for business management due to the diversity of this generations. The paper on this issue aims to analyze the current and future trend of generation groups in the Czech Republic with respect to their characteristics and to the demography development on the Czech labor market. The paper theoretically defines issues of demographic development and generations (Baby Boomers, X, Y, Z), including their often different timing anchors and qualitative characteristics. Subsequently, on the basis of statistical data analysis, the labor market situation in the Czech Republic is characterized by a focus on individual generations. The paper also analyzes the population development of individual generations with the presentation of the 5 and 10-year forecasts. In the end, there are presented possible threats (change of generation groups, occupying higher positions, similarity of generations) or opportunities (unique diversity) that companies should take into account in their business practices. There are also three areas (evaluation, communication and mentoring) where the author presents the possible management of business processes and their limitation.
M54|Workers' intervention authority in Italian 4.0 factories: autonomy and discretion|The present contribution aims at investigating the relationship between the introduction of Industry 4.0 technological innovations and the ensuing implications for workers' skills composition, their empowerment, and their authority of intervention in the work process, within three Italian firms exhibiting a wide range of organisational practices: from Japanese Toyotism, to a mix of Taylorism and co-determination, up to the example most akin to the German 'Mitbestimmung'. By distinguishing between the notions of discretion and autonomy in identifying the spheres of workers' intervention authority, our findings corroborate the presence of hybrid workforce empowerment, reflected into an increase of workers' discretionary intervention, and the lack of a similar increase in terms of autonomy, the latter meant as the possibility of establishing their own routines.
M54|Choking under Pressure: Evidence of the Causal Effect of Audience Size on Performance|We analyze performance under pressure and estimate the causal effect of audience size on the success of free throws in top-level professional basketball. We use data from the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the seasons 2007/08 through 2015/16. We exploit the exogenous variation in weather conditions on game day to establish a causal link between attendance size and performance. Our results confirm a sizeable and strong negative effect of the number of spectators on performance. Home teams in (non-critical) situations at the beginning of games perform worse when the audience is larger. This result is consistent with the theory of a home choke rather than a home field advantage. Our results have potentially large implications for general questions of workplace design and help to further understand how the social environment affects performance. We demonstrate that the amount of support, i.e. positive feedback, from a friendly audience does affect performance.
M54|Bargaining and the Role of Negotiators’ Competitiveness|This paper experimentally tests the relation between subjects’ competitiveness and bargaining behavior. Bargaining is investigated in a demand-ultimatum game, where the responder can request a share of the pie from the proposer. The re-sults show that highly competitive proposers earn less, since they make lower oﬀers, which are more often rejected. Similarly, highly competitive responders achieve lower payoﬀs, since they request excessive amounts which induces lower proposals. These ﬁndings establish a link between competitiveness and bargaining as suggested by social and evolutionary psychology. Thus, we identify one driver of the empirical heterogeneity of bargaining behavior and outcomes. From a management perspec-tive our ﬁndings highlight that giving thought to employees’ competitiveness before delegating them to participate in negotiations may pay oﬀ.
M54|Workers’ awareness context in Italian 4.0 factories|The study of the co-evolution of processes of technological innovation and the resulting organisational changes has been a topic of interest since the first appearance of the idea of division of labour and specialisation in Adam Smith’s works. The major phases of organisational change are in fact the result of ‘waves’ of technological innovations attributable to the various industrial revolutions. Nowadays, a new potential technological paradigm dubbed ‘Industry 4.0’ is shaping the manufacturing output of USA, Europe, and China, particularly in the automotive/engineering industry. With reference to the latter, the present research contribution aims at investigating, by means of field-work research activity, the degree of openness of the awareness context of workers and their intervention authority on the production process within three factories in the so-called Italian ‘Motor Valley’. Together with state-of-the-art 4.0 technology adoption, these firms exhibit different organisational practices ranging from the Japanese Toyotism (Cesab-Toyota), to a mix of Taylorism and co-determination (Ducati), up to the example most akin to the German ‘Mitbestimmung’ (Lamborghini). This technological wave is fostering the process of making the production system lean. Our findings corroborate the presence of a hybrid process of Industry 4.0 adoption, reflected into a hybrid process of workforce empowerment.
M54|Crowdsourced Innovation: How Community Managers Affect Crowd Activities|In this study, we investigate whether and to what extent community managers in online collaborative communities can stimulate crowd activities through their engagement. Using a novel data set of 22 large online idea crowdsourcing campaigns, we find that active engagement of community managers positively affects crowd activities in an inverted Ushaped manner. Moreover, we evidence that intellectual stimulation by managers increases community participation, while individual consideration of users has no impact on user activities. Finally, the data reveal that community manager activities that require more effort, such as media file uploads instead of simple written comments, have a larger effect on crowd participation.
M54|Welche Kriterien befördern den Aufstieg auf internen Karriereleitern? Eine empirische Untersuchung auf Basis des IW-Personalpanels|Eine Auswertung der 16ten Welle des IW-Personalpanels aus dem Jahr 2017 dokumentiert die Verbreitung von internen Karriereleitern. In fast jedem zweiten Unternehmen wurden die zuletzt vakanten Führungspositionen ausschließlich aus den eigenen Reihen besetzt. In weiteren drei von zehn Betrieben fiel die Wahl neben internen auch auf externe Kandidaten. Besonders Unternehmen mit 250 und mehr Beschäftigten nutzen ihre internen Arbeitsmärkte zur Auswahl von Führungskräften - nur lediglich 3 Prozent der großen Unternehmen besetzen Führungspositionen ausschließlich extern. Für drei Viertel der Unternehmen sind die persönlichen und die fachlichen Kompetenzen sehr wichtige Auswahlkriterien für die Besetzung von Führungspositionen. Die bisher erbrachten Leistungen haben für 55 Prozent ein sehr hohes Gewicht bei der Besetzungsentscheidung. In vier von zehn Unternehmen sind Kompetenzen und bisherige Leistungen gleichermaßen von hoher Bedeutung. In größeren Unternehmen, in denen Führungskräfte häufiger reine Managementaufgaben wahrnehmen, sind persönliche Kompetenzen wie die Kommunikationsfähigkeit oder Durchsetzungsstärke deutlich häufiger für die Beförderungsentscheidungen sehr wichtig. In kleinen Unternehmen, in denen Führungskräfte stärker operativ eingebunden sind, ist dagegen die fachliche Kompetenz wichtiger als in den großen Unternehmen. [...]
M54|Identifying leadership skills required in the digital age|Is leadership changing in an increasingly digitalised work environment? This question arises in corporate practice, societal debates, and in business management research. The evolution of digital technologies changes working environments considerably and creates new challenges for executives. So far, however, only little research has been conducted on how these challenges and technology-driven changes are associated with altered requirements for the skill set needed by executives. In this paper we bridge that gap by applying a three-stage research design. First, we develop a novel conceptual framework in which we categorise leadership skills and associate them with tasks, management level, and leadership experience. Building on this, we conduct semi-structured interviews with executives and systematically investigate job advertisements at the management level. Our interview results show that communication skills, subject-specific knowledge, self-organisation skills, and self-reflection skills are considered particularly relevant in times of rapid technology-driven change. Furthermore, many interview participants identify empathy and an open-mindedness towards the new as crucial personal traits. Our job advertisement analysis further reveals that executives need to be able to speak English, have IT skills, and be flexible, motivated, and stress tolerant.
M54|Designing wearables for use in the workplace: The role of solution developers|Wearables (such as data glasses and smartwatches) are a particularly visible element of Industrie 4.0 applications. They aim at providing situation-specific information to workers, but at the same time they can also be used for surveillance and control because they generate data on the work process and sometimes even on movement patterns and vital data of the employees. Wearables technology is at an early stage of development, in which the interests and perspectives of relevant stakeholders, especially technology developers and the management, are of particular importance. This article explores the role of solution developers and their understanding of work processes in which wearables are to be used. It is based on expert interviews with solution developers, academic and company experts. The analysis shows an ambivalent understanding of work: On the one hand, it is characterized by the perception of workers as potential sources of error. It focuses on the optimization of individual workplaces and their ergonomics, while broader questions of work design and work organization are ignored. On the other hand, the technology developers see and discuss the potentials and dangers of wearables technologies with regard to individualization, data protection and control in a differentiated manner.
M54|From lean production to Industrie 4.0. More autonomy for employees?|The article examines the relationship between lean production and Industrie 4.0 focusing on the question of autonomy in the work process. In contrast to the claim made by official Industrie 4.0 concepts that the autonomy of the employees would increase, we see in the current implementation projects a tendency towards greater standardization and control of work. This is in continuity with concepts of lean production, but neglects the participation-oriented elements of lean production such as teamwork and shop-floor-based improvement activities. Our argument is developed by analyzing practical examples from three relevant fields (digital assistance systems, data-based process management, modular assembly). The conclusions of this article also discuss the extent to which the concept of individual autonomy is suitable for the assessment of Industrie 4.0 concepts, given the high levels of interdependence already achieved in production processes.
M54|Effects of Timing and Reference Frame of Feedback: Evidence from a Field Experiment|Information about past performance has been found to sometimes improve and sometimes worsen subsequent performance. Two factors may help to explain this puzzle: which aspect of one's past performance the information refers to and when it is revealed. In a field experiment in secondary schools, students received information about their absolute rank in the last math exam (level feedback), their change in ranks between the second-last and the last math exam (change feedback), or no feedback. Feedback was given either 1-3 days (early) or immediately (late) before the final math exam of the semester. Both level feedback and change feedback significantly improve students' grades in the final exam when given early and tend to worsen them when given late. The largest effects are found for negative change feedback and are concentrated on male students, who adjust their ability beliefs downwards in response to feedback.
M54|Managing Social Comparison Costs in Organizations|"This paper studies how organizations manage the social comparisons that arise when their employees' pay and tasks, and hence their status vis-à-vis peers, differ. We show that under a ""pay transparency policy"", the organization may compress pay and distort the employees' tasks to minimize social comparison costs. We subsequently show that if the organization can credibly commit to informal agreements, it may remove social comparisons by implementing a ""pay secrecy"" policy. Under such a policy, the organization makes employees ""officially equal"" by granting them similar formal terms, while optimally differentiating their pay through self-enforcing informal adjustments."

Moreover, we evidence that intellectual stimulation by managers increases community participation, while individual consideration of users has no impact on user activities. Finally, the data reveal that community manager activities that require more effort, such as media file uploads instead of simple written comments, have a larger effect on crowd participation.

M54|Teamwork, Leadership and Gender|We ran a field experiment to investigate whether individual performance in teams depends on the gender of the leader. About 430 students from an Italian University took an intermediate exam that was partly evaluated on the basis of teamwork. Students were randomly matched in teams of three and in each team we randomly chose a leader with the task of coordinating the work of the team. We find a positive and significant effect of female leadership on team performance. This effect is driven by the higher performance of team members in female led teams rather than due to an improvement in the leader’s performance. We also find that, in spite of the higher performance of female led teams, male members tend to evaluate female leaders as less effective, whereas female members are more sympathetic towards them.
M54|Employee Involvement and Job Satisfaction: A Tale of the Millennial Generation|The purpose of this paper is to empirically study the effect of employee involvement in the workplace on job satisfaction for millennial workers in Colombia. Data were obtained from a sample of 2103 millennial employees working in 11 companies of different sectors located in the five main cities of Colombia. Ordered probit models were estimated to study the effect of employee involvement on job satisfaction, in general, and how different forms of participative decision-making in the workplace produce different impacts on individual satisfaction with objective and intrinsic aspects of the job, in particular. The empirical results show that, for millennial workers, there is a positive link between employee involvement and job satisfaction. Moreover, there is a higher positive impact on job satisfaction when millennial workers participate in decisions on general aspects of the company than when they participate in specific decisions such as those concerning teamwork or main tasks at work. Another interesting result is that millennial workers attach high importance to intrinsic aspects of their jobs (such as the possibility to use their knowledge in the work), which may improve their satisfaction in a higher participative environment.
M54|Team-specific capital and innovation|"We establish the importance of team-specific capital in the typical inventor's career. Using administrative tax and patent data for the population of US patent inventors from 1996 to 2012, we find that an inventor's premature death causes a large and long-lasting decline in their co-inventor's earnings and citation-weighted patents (–4 percent and –15 percent after 8 years, respectively). After ruling out firm disruption, network effects, and top-down spillovers as main channels, we show that the effect is driven by close-knit teams and that team-specific capital largely results from an ""experience"" component increasing collaboration value over time."
M54|La dynamique de changement des formes de gouvernance : le cas français (2000-2014)|(VF)Cet article se donne pour objectif d’examiner une dimension cruciale et pourtant méconnue de la gouvernance des entreprises. Nous étudions la dynamique de la gouvernance des sociétés cotées françaises (SBF 120) sur une longue période d’observation (2000-2014) qui englobe les principales réformes françaises. Plus précisément, nous analysons les variables susceptibles d’influencer la stabilité de la structure de gouvernance. Pour cela, nous mobilisons des modèles de durée multi-états de type semi-markovien afin d’analyser à la fois la durée et les transitions d’une forme de gouvernance à une autre des sociétés cotées françaises. Nos résultats montrent que la stabilité de la structure de gouvernance est essentiellement liée aux caractéristiques personnelles du dirigeant en poste, à la performance de l’entreprise et la structure actionnariale. Cependant, un examen approfondi par type de transition montre l’influence multiple et parfois contrastée de certaines variables. (VA) The aim of this article is to examine a crucial and yet unknown aspect of corporate governance. More precisely, we analyze the variables which are likely to influence the stability of the governance structure of French listed companies (SBF 120 index). We study the dynamics of corporate governance over a long period of observation (2000-2014), which encompasses the main French reforms. We use duration models based on Markovian-type processes to examine both the transitions from one form of governance to the other, but also the duration and therefore the stability of the forms of governance of listed French companies. Our results show that the stability of the corporate governance structure is linked to the personal characteristics of the CEO, the performance of the company and the shareholder structure essentially. However, a thorough examination by type of transition shows the multiple and sometimes contrasted influence of some variables. Our article brings a new light on the dynamics of the governance of French listed companies.
M54|Goal setting in the principal–agent model: Weak incentives for strong performance|We study a principal–agent framework in which principals can assign wage-irrelevant goals to agents. We find evidence that, when given the possibility to set wage-irrelevant goals, principals select incentive contracts for which pay is less responsive to agents' performance. Agents' performance is higher in the presence of goal setting despite weaker incentives. We develop a principal–agent model with reference-dependent utility that illustrates how labor contracts combining weak monetary incentives and wage-irrelevant goals can be optimal. The pervasive use of non-monetary incentives in the workplace may help account for previous empirical findings suggesting that firms rely on unexpectedly weak monetary incentives.
M54|Revisiting the Tradeoff between Risk and Incentives: The Shocking Effect of Random Shocks|Despite its central role in the theory of incentives, empirical evidence of a tradeoff between risk and incentives remains scarce. We reexamine this empirical puzzle in a controlled laboratory environment so as to isolate possible confounding factors encountered in the field. In line with the principal-agent model, we find that principals increase fixed pay while lowering performance pay when the relationship between effort and output is noisier. Unexpectedly, agents produce substantially more in the noisy environment than in the baseline despite lesser pay for performance. We show that this result can be accounted for by introducing agents’ loss aversion in the principal-agent model. Our findings call for an extension of standard agency models and for a reassessment of apparently inefficient management practices.
M54|Gay Glass Ceilings: Sexual Orientation and Workplace Authority in the UK|"A burgeoning literature has examined earnings inequalities associated with a minority sexual orientation, but far less is known about sexual orientation-based differences in access to workplace authority â€“ in contrast to well-documented gender and race-specific differences. We provide the first large-scale evidence on this question using confidential data from the 2009-2014 UK Integrated Household Surveys (IHS) (N = 607,709). We are the first to document that gay men and lesbians are significantly more likely to have objective measures of workplace authority compared to otherwise similar heterosexual men and women. However, we also find clear evidence that gay men face glass ceilings: their higher likelihood of attaining workplace authority is driven entirely by their significantly higher odds of being low-level managers. In fact, gay men are significantly less likely than comparable heterosexual men to be in the highest-level managerial positions that come with higher status and pay. Oaxaca decompositions suggest that this differential access to workplace authority for gay men is due to discrimination as opposed to different skills and characteristics. Moreover, this ""gay glass ceiling"" is stronger for racial minorities than for whites. Corresponding effects for lesbians exist but are notably weaker. These results provide the first direct evidence of social stratification in the workplace associated with a minority sexual orientation and reveal that differences are exacerbated for individuals with multiple marginalized identities."
M54|Choking under pressure - Evidence of the causal effect of audience size on performance|We analyze performance under pressure and estimate the causal effect of audience size on the success of free throws in top-level professional basketball. We use data from the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the seasons 2007/08 through 2015/16. We exploit the exogenous variation in weather conditions on game day to establish a causal link between attendance size and performance. Our results confirm a sizeable and strong negative effect of the number of spectators on performance. Home teams in (non-critical) situations at the beginning of games perform worse when the audience is larger. This result is consistent with the theory of a home choke rather than a home field advantage. Our results have potentially large implications for general questions of workplace design and help to further understand how the social environment affects performance. We demonstrate that the amount of support, i.e. positive feedback, from a friendly audience does affect performance.
M54|How Common Are Bad Bosses?|Bosses play an important role in workplaces. Yet little is currently known about a foundational question. Are the right people promoted to be managers, team leaders, and supervisors? Gallup data and the famous Peter Principle both suggest that incompetent bosses are likely to be all around us. This paper's results uncover a different, and more nuanced, conclusion. By taking data on 35 nations, the paper provides the first statistically representative international estimates of the extent to which employees have 'bad bosses'. Using a simple, and arguably natural, measure, the paper calculates that approximately 13% of Europe's workers have a bad boss. These bosses are most common in the Transport sector and large organizations. The paper discusses its methodology, performs validation checks, and reviews other data and implications.
M54|Teamwork, Leadership And Gender|We ran a field experiment to investigate whether individual performance in teams depends on the gender of the leader. About 430 students from an Italian University took an intermediate exam that was partly evaluated on the basis of teamwork. Students were randomly matched in teams of three and in each team we randomly chose a leader with the task of coordinating the work of the team. We find a positive and significant effect of female leadership on team performance. This effect is driven by the higher performance of team members in female led teams rather than due to an improvement in the leader’s performance. We also find that, in spite of the higher performance of female led teams, male members tend to evaluate female leaders as less effective, whereas female members are more sympathetic towards them.
M54|Employee Absence: An Organizational Perspective|We study employee absence in Danish organizations. In contrast to Steers and Rhodes (1978), who stress the importance of individual and organizational characteristics in shaping employees' motivation to attend work, we show that absence is predominantly an individualized phenomenon. Because the within-group variation in absence clearly dominates the between-group variation in absence, we argue that companies need to invoke individualized policies to reduce employee absence and demonstrate that HR Analytics is a useful tool in the process; policies targeting particular employee groups such as women or senior workers are inefficient. An additional intriguing finding is that incentives (through promotions and dismissals) are linked to individual absence.
M54|HPWS in the Public Sector: Are There Mutual Gains?|Few studies investigate the links between high-performance work systems (HPWS) on public sector organizational performance and worker job attitudes. We fill this gap with analyses of these links using linked employer-employee surveys of workplaces in Britain in 2004 and 2011. We find robust evidence of positive associations between the use of HPWS and organizational performance in the public sector but no associations with worker attitudes. The implication is that, in contrast to similar work on the private sector in the United States (Appelbaum et al., 2000) HPWS is not delivering mutual gains for employers and employees in the British public sector.
M54|Effects of timing and reference frame of feedback: Evidence from a field experiment|Information about past performance has been found to sometimes improve and sometimes worsen subsequent performance. Two factors may help to explain this puzzle: which aspect of one's past performance the information refers to and when it is revealed. In a field experiment in secondary schools, students received information about their absolute rank in the last math exam (level feedback), their change in ranks between the second-last and the last math exam (change feedback), or no feedback. Feedback was given either 1-3 days (early) or immediately (late) before the final math exam of the semester. Both level feedback and change feedback significantly improve students' grades in the final exam when given early and tend to worsen them when given late. The largest effects are found for negative change feedback and are concentrated on male students, who adjust their ability beliefs downwards in response to feedback.
M54|Adoption of High Performance Work Organization, trade unions and employment redundancy in India|Following Osterman’s research framework of High Performance Work Organizations (HPWOs), the author, using his data sets from the three surveys conducted in India in 2001 and in 2011-2012, examined the adoption and diffusion of HPWOs in India and the factors behind them. It was found that HPWOs spread in India between 2000 and 2011, showing the regional variations in the diffusion and the contributing factors behind the adoption. The opposition of the trade unions against the HPWOs would become less significant once a single HPWO practice was introduced in the workplace. While the HPWOs did not show any significant association, the analysis suggests that trade unions affect managerial decisions to a greater degree than India’s restrictive labor law against employment downsizing.
M54|Ajustements de l'emploi et des salaires : quels compromis en temps de crise ? Une analyse quantitative et qualitative à partir de l'enquête REPONSE 2010-2011|Since 2008 in France, the establishments implemented wage, employment and working time adjustments to deal with the effects of the economic crisis. This paper aims at understanding the way social actors have negociated wage and employment adjustments. Did personal representatives influence managerial decisions in terms of adjustment ? Were they involved in concessions bargaining by relying on cross referencing of the REPONSE 2010-2011 survey (provided by French Ministry of Labour) on French industrial relations between 2008 and 2010 and of case studies conducted in French establishments between 2012 and 2014. Our analysis allows underlying different kinds of concession bargaining which depend on the nature of industrial relations and of the impact of economic downturn on companies' activity. We also show that concessions may have some more or less durable effects on the employment relation. Finally, our analysis sheds light on the implications of recent reforms in collective bargaining in France, which may facilitate unbalanced concession bargaining in favour of employer
M54|Can Innovators be Created? Experimental Evidence from an Innovation Contest|Existing theories and empirical research on how innovation occurs largely assume that innovativeness is an inherent characteristic of the individual and that people with this innate ability select into jobs that require it. In this paper, we investigate whether people who do not self-select into being innovators can be induced to innovate, and whether they innovate differently than those who do self-select into innovating. To test these questions, we designed and implemented an innovation contest for engineering and computer science students which allowed us to differentiate between those who self-select into innovative activities and those who are willing to undertake them only after receiving an additional incentive for doing so. We also randomly offer encouragement to subsets of both the induced and self-selected contest participants in order to examine the importance of confidence-building interventions on each sample. We find that while induced participants have different observable characteristics than those that were ‘innately’ drawn to the competition, on average, the success of induced participants was statistically indistinguishable from their self-selected counterparts and encouragement does not change this result. Heterogeneity in treatment effects suggests an important role for the use of targeted interventions.
M54|Peer influence in the workplace: Evidence from an enterprise digital platform| We study how the broadcasting of peer success on an enterprise digital platform affects worker productivity. Using sales workers in an IT service company as our research context, we leverage the unexpected resignation of several HR staff members as an exogenous shock to the sharing of peer success and implement a difference-in-differences estimation. The empirical evidence shows that sales workers exert less effort when peer success messages are absent. We next investigate how the framing of peer success messages may generate different forms of peer influence, and particularly explore two ways of framing—messages that highlight peer’s ability (i.e., ability-based messages) and messages that highlight peer’s effort (i.e., effort-based messages). We find that although both types of peer success messages have a positive influence on worker productivity, there exists important heterogeneity. For ability-based messages, workers respond most strongly if their peers are socially close or have worse historical performance. By contrast, the effect of effort-based messages does not vary by peer characteristics.
M54|Job Quality, Health and Productivity: An evidence-based framework for analysis|The nature, content and milieu of work – i.e. the quality of the working environment – matter in many ways for people, firms and society as a whole. There is a great deal of evidence to show clear associations between job quality and the health of workers, their ability to successfully combine work and life while fully mobilising their skills and abilities to build a career, and their productivity. Investments in quality working environments can be welfare enhancing and economically efficient. Policies and practices reflect these findings insufficiently, an apparent paradox that finds its roots in various market failures. There is scope for public intervention to raise awareness, to ensure better coordination of key stakeholders (employers, workers’ representatives and various public entities) and to put in place the right financial incentives for firms to invest in better working conditions. Action in this field is also important in view of ongoing considerable changes in the labour market. The future of work is very uncertain at this stage; the digitalisation and uberisation of work have the potential for improvements in working conditions but also bear the risk of de-skilling, lower pay, lower job security and poor working conditions for parts of the labour force.
M54|The fiscal cost of weak governance: Evidence from teacher absence in India|The relative return to strategies that augment inputs versus those that reduce inefficiencies remains a key open question for education policy in low-income countries. Using a new nationally-representative panel dataset of schools across 1297 villages in India, we show that the large public investments in education over the past decade have led to substantial improvements in input-based measures of school quality, but only a modest reduction in inefficiency as measured by teacher absence. In our data, 23.6% of teachers were absent during unannounced school visits, and we estimate that the salary cost of unauthorized teacher absence is $1.5billion/year. We find two robust correlations in the nationally-representative panel data that corroborate findings from smaller-scale experiments. First, reductions in student-teacher ratios are correlated with increased teacher absence. Second, increases in the frequency of school monitoring are strongly correlated with lower teacher absence. Using these results, we show that reducing inefficiencies by increasing the frequency of monitoring could be over ten times more cost effective at increasing the effective student-teacher ratio than hiring more teachers. Thus, policies that decrease the inefficiency of public education spending are likely to yield substantially higher marginal returns than those that augment inputs.
M54|The power of individual-level drivers of inventive performance|We combine two lines of research on inventive and creative performance that have been separated before. We use empirical models of the performance of inventors over their careers based on an established theoretical framework of the drivers of creativity, the Knowledge, Skills, Abilities, and Other (KSAO) model. We link survey information spanning the inventors’ entire careers and psychometric test evidence with patent history data for more than 1000 inventors. We also control for variables that have traditionally been used in studies of inventive performance including inventor age, applicant type, technology, patent, and time information. We show that educational level, skills acquired during the career, personality traits, career motivation, cognitive ability, and cognitive problem-solving style are significantly related to inventive performance.
M54|Do Performance Appraisals Decrease Employees’ Perception of Their Psychosocial Risks?|This paper uses cross-sectional linked employer-employee data col- lected from the French Working Conditions Survey, to assess the po- tential positive or negative effect of performance appraisal interviews administered by firms on employees’ reported levels of psychosocial risk. A subjective measure of the psychosocial risks is used and in- dicates a perceived level of risk. In order to obtain a more objective evaluation, we compare the employees’ perceived level of psychosocial risk and the level of risk reported by firms. The results show that the reported levels of psychosocial risk decrease when employees receive performance evaluation reviews on a regular basis; reviews whose ef- fects vary depending on the type of psychosocial risk.
M54|Antecedents of Training Effectiveness in Bahrain|This study focuses on antecedents of the training programs’ effectiveness at public sector organizations in Bahrain. A Kirkpatrick model is utilized as a partial research framework and tested as the dependent variable training effectiveness in this study. This study further examines the relationship between the independent variables, trainer and social support toward training effectiveness. The survey instrument was developed for data collection and the questionnaires were distributed to the staff working in the public sector in Bahrain. The total usable questionnaires are 128. The study adopts a quantitative approach using SPSS statistic approach. The outcomes also discover that both antecedents have a positive and a significant relationship with the training effectiveness at various Kirkpatrick’s levels.
M54|Whistle Blowing in The Police Sector: The Importance of Control Behaviour Factor and Professional Commitment|"""Objective – This study aimed to examine the effect of perceived behaviour control and professional commitment to the interest of doing whistleblowing. This research was conducted at the police department in Riau province. Methodology/Technique – The sample in this study was taken by using the method of data collection is called purposive sampling. The samples used in this research were 90 respondents which were all police officers working in the finance department. Data were analysed using SPSS version 20. Findings – The results showed that perceived behaviour control affects the interests do whistleblowing. Secondly, professional commitments do affect the interest of whistleblowing. Novelty – The research contributes to the related literature with its original data."""
M54|The Relationship between Contemporary Holacratic Models of Management and Company Performance: Evidence from Global Corporations in the World|"""Objective – This paper explores how global corporations apply contemporary approaches in management known as holacracy, and its impact on company performance. The paper argues that the number of corporations with an incorporated model of holacracy is growing and that it leads to an increase of employee’s creativity and engagement, which directly affect a companys’ performance. Furthermore, the study sheds light on broadening the theoretical link between holacratic management models and company performance in the context of global corporations at the level of internationalization. Methodology/Technique – The study provides evidence from over fifty selected worldwide companies for the period between 2014 and 2016. The data has been collected from annual reports and other secondary based sources and consists of companies possessing features of holacracy, which is one of the phenomena of management in the twenty-first century. In this paper, empirical data has been operationalized and several OLS regression models have been employed, in order to discover the link between modern management models and firm performance. Findings – The paper’s findings outline the fact that holacracy positively affects a companies’ performance and that the number of global companies using holacratic models is growing. Novelty – The study suggests that holacratic management models are connected to company success and performance through breakthrough innovative approaches in the context of employee communication and employee satisfaction, as a step-by-step approach that allows organizations to change gradually."""
M54|Is Financial Reward Still an Important Motivator for the Indonesian Multi-Generational Workforce?|"""Objective – Considering the importance of work motivation in the workplace for staff performance and organizational success, employers need to be sensitive and focusing more on work motivation of their employees to avoid losing them. However, previous studies still have conflicting results on this issue whether there is a significant difference on intrinsic and extrinsic motivators or not among employees from Baby Boomers, Gen X and Gen Y because many studies find generation is not the only driver influencing work motivators. The objectives of this study are to investigate whether a three-generation workforce differs in the level of work motivators and whether differences in generational work motivation are better explained by gender, education, or types of job to design effective human resources development programs. Methodology/Technique – Using survey method to collect data, 415 respondents who work in a manufacturing company were gathered and analyzed by applying descriptive and multivariate analysis. Intrinsic and extrinsic motivators were the subscales of work motivators. Findings – Results indicate that all generations are intrinsically motivated, in which Gen Y employees are found to have higher intrinsic motivators than Gen X and Baby Boomers. However, this study reveals that financial rewards are still considered as an important motivator for the three generations. Novelty – The study presents evidence that work motivators should not only be measured based on generational alone because other factors, such as gender, education, and types of job, can give impact to various outcomes."""
M54|Resistance to Change (RTC): A Taxonomical Perspective|"""Objective – This paper debatably argues that there is rather limited and effective framework in managing resistance to change. Thus, a different concept in assessing resistance to change is proposed. Methodology/Technique – This study is conducted through review of qualitative data based on organizational change literature. It was discovered that previous change research accentuated more on human aspect while missing other potential and critical aspect of change resistance. Findings – The past studies put more weightage on individual reactions to change. Study believes that everyone has own unique defence mechanisms that protect them from the change which act as barrier from allowing the individual to adapt with the change. Resistance correlates with individual’s mind reflecting one’s willingness and receptiveness to change while being influences by one’s thinking and behavior. Thus, evaluating resistance to change based on human aspect alone will produce dissimilarities in results. Novelty –Albeit the simplicity of the proposed model, the model will enable the assessment of resistance to change with the larger perspective in tandem with past recommendations of a dire need of better framework in managing resistance to change."""
M54|Power Distance as A National Culture Observed in Organizational Scope|"""Objective – Cultural factors have significant roles in creating behavior in an organization. This research claims that national culture like power distance that is usually measured in a national scope actually can have a better result when it is measured in the organizational scope. The goal of this research is to find out the level of power distance among private lecturers in Banjarmasin, Indonesia, and compare it to Hofstede’s power distance for the whole country. Methodology/Technique – This research uses explanatory research that tries to understand the degree of power distance among private university lecturers in Banjarmasin. The populations used were all lecturers in private colleges in Banjarmasin City. The samples used were 86 lecturers who have become a lecturer for at least 2 years. The analysis is done through a descriptive quantitative method measuring the level of power distance among lecturers in Banjarmasin and with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to understand which indicators that have the strongest influence in creating power distance culture among lecturers in Banjarmasin. Findings – The results of the research show that power distance culture is low among the lecturers in Banjarmasin City, with indicator “The level of authority used by the leader” as the lowest factor. The result also finds that the indicator “subordinates Exclusion in decision-making” as the strongest indicator to form power distance culture. Novelty – This research conducted in the context of Indonesia using primary data."""
M54|Happiness in Higher Education Leader|"""Objective – This study examines Happiness Leaders in the higher education context. Methodology/Technique – Using Positive Psychology perspective, data were collected through an in-depth interview with 30 Indonesian heads of Department in some faculties of Higher Education Malang from December 2016 to February 2017. Respondents were selected using non-probability purposive sampling technique. Findings – The results of this study indicate that the respondents focused their happiness factor more on relationship (R) and meaningfulness (M), but less on positive emotion (P), engagement (E) and accomplishment (A). Almost all respondents agreed that good relationship ensured a sense of safety and comfort and helped gain social support, especially when they were in Bad Condition. Otherwise, most respondents tended to lack focus in setting targets and did not enjoy through the process of achieving the target. Responsibilities were exercised only to meet the demand of the institution. Novelty – This research developed five aspects: positive emotion, engagement, relationship, meaningfulness and accomplishment (PERMA) as a key question and tested it in the context of Indonesia."""
M54|Team Structure and the Effectiveness of Collective Performance Pay|The adoption of performance related pay schemes has become increasingly popular in the public sector of several countries. In the UK, the scheme designers favoured collective performance pay with the aim to foster cooperation across offices. The resulting team structure included several offices (subteams) within the same team, defined by the remuneration scheme. In this paper we analyse the strategic interactions across subteams created by a two-level team structure, in order to assess whether rewarding collective performance necessarily promotes cooperation. We show that such team structure creates conflicting incentives to free-ride across and within subteams. Moreover, the relative size of subteams can be a powerful means to deliver incentives when funds for performance rewards are limited. Using data for one of the incentive schemes piloted in the UK, we analyse the role of the target level and of the relative size of subteams on subteams' performance.
M54|One Size Fits All? Gender Differences in the Effect of Subjective Feedback|The effect of objective feedback on performance is often studied, while subjective feedback is largely neglected in the economics literature. We estimate the impact of positive subjective feedback - encouragement and praise - on effort and performance, and compare the effect by gender. We use a computer game, during which players are randomly chosen to be given either no feedback (control) or positive subjective feedback (treatment), and analyze the treatment effect on effort (clicks) and performance (score). Based on previous economic and psychology theories, we test the pathways through which subjective feedback can have an impact: on (1) effort, due to the updating of expected performance or direct (dis)utility from the feedback, or (2) marginal productivity. The results point to significant differences in the mean effects of subjective feedback by gender. For women, encouragement has a significant positive effect while praise has a significant negative effect on performance, while men are less responsive to subjective feedback in general. Gender differences are mostly explained by different confidence distributions, while there are no gender differences in treatment effects if confidence level is held fixed. The effects are mostly realized through changes in effort. These results suggest that better targeted supervisory communication in schools or workplaces can improve the performance of lower-confidence individuals and thereby decrease the gender gap in performance.
M54|Working hours and productivity|This paper studies the link between working hours and productivity using daily information on working hours and performance of a sample of call centre agents. We exploit variation in the number of hours worked by the same employee across days and weeks due to central scheduling, enabling us to estimate the effect of working hours on productivity. We find that as the number of hours worked increases, the average handling time for a call increases, meaning that agents become less productive. This result suggests that fatigue can play an important role, even in jobs with mostly part-time workers.
M54|Contribution Of High-Level Structures For Management Integration, Aportes De La Estructura De Alto Nivel En La Gestion Integrada|"This article presents the results of a study analyzing the contributions of the high-level structure proposed by the International Organization for Standardization ISO. The goal is to meet the requirements on quality management and management of health and safety working in private sector organizations. To do this, the scientific literature was consulted. This search was performed using the key terms ""integrated management"", ""integration of management systems"" and ""High-level structure. Additionally, an iterative search of the publications of the two main authors took place. Further, the current legal regulations in Colombia were analyzed on applicable management companies analyzed. The texts that met the criteria were retrieved and analyzed following the methodology of critical reading on the proposal for Alvarado 2012. They were subsequently contrasted with Annex SL directives of ISO / IEC. We concluded that highlevel structure facilitates the integrated quality management and safety and health at work and optimizes resources to achieve the objectives organizational"
M54|Choking under pressure of top performers: Evidence from biathlon competitions|"Psychological pressure affects performance. This is especially true for individuals completing precision tasks in decisive situations, such as assessment tests, job talks, or sports competitions. In this paper, I shed light on detrimental effects of pressure on performance, a phenomenon known as ""choking under pressure"". I analyze a unique setting in which the effect of pressure on performance is naturally observable: Biathlon World Cup competitions. As the last shot in the final bout of shootings is regularly decisive for the victory, pressure is highest on the leader of the competition not to miss this last shot. Using event data from 11 seasons of Biathlon World Cup, I find strong evidence for ""choking under pressure"", implying that especially leaders are more likely to fail decisive shots. Furthermore, taking more time for the last shootings bout leads to a decrease in performance. Finally, I show suggestive evidence for a momentum effect - after missing a shot during the last shooting bout, the probability of missing the last shot decreases."
M54|Does Job Support Make Workers Happy?|Using linked employer-employee data for Finland we examine associations between job design and ten measures of worker wellbeing. In accordance with Karasek's (1979) model we find positive correlations between many aspects of worker wellbeing and job control. However, contrary to the model, job demands have no adverse effects on worker wellbeing. We find a strong positive correlation between job support and all aspects of worker wellbeing that is independent of job controls and job demands, a finding that has not been emphasized in the literature. The effects are most pronounced in relation to supervisor support. We also find evidence of unemployment scarring effects: substantial experience of unemployment has long-term consequences for the wellbeing workers experience in their current jobs, even controlling for the quality of those jobs.
M54|On the effectiveness of elected male and female leaders and team coordination|Abstract We study the effect on coordination in a minimum-effort game of a leader’s gender depending on whether the leader is democratically elected or is randomly selected. Leaders use non-binding messages to try to convince followers to coordinate on the Pareto-efficient equilibrium. We find that teams with elected leaders coordinate on higher effort levels. Initially, the benefits of being elected are captured solely by male leaders. However, this gender difference disappears with repeated interaction because unsuccessful male leaders are reelected more often than unsuccessful female leaders.
M54|Where's the Teacher? How Teacher Workplace Segregation Impedes Teacher Allocation in India|Social or ethnic segregation can impede the equitable allocation of public resources in developing countries. We study an under-explored dimension; the allocation of public sector teachers in India. Using a register database for 2006-12, we construct indicators for the equality of teacher allocation and workplace segregation of teachers by gender and caste within districts. While pupil-teacher ratios have improved, the equality of teacher allocation has not. We show that allocation and segregation are connected; in districts with a higher degree of initial teacher segregation, a lower share of schools met pupil-teacher norms imposed by the Right to Education Act (2009).
M54|HRM and Small-Firm Employee Motivation: Before and after the Recession|A long-running debate in the small firms' literature questions the value of formal 'human resource management' (HRM) practices which have been linked to high performance in larger firms. We contribute to this literature by exploiting linked employer-employee surveys for 2004 and 2011. Using employees' intrinsic job satisfaction and organizational commitment as measures of motivation we find the returns to small firm investments in HRM are u-shaped. Small firms benefit from intrinsically motivating work situations in the absence of HRM practices, find this advantage disturbed when formal HRM practices are initially introduced, but can restore positive motivation when they invest intensively in HRM practices in a way that characterizes 'high performance work systems' (HWPS) and 'strategic human resource management' (SHRM). Although the HPWS effect on employee motivation is modified somewhat by the recessionary transition, it remains rather robust and continues to have positive promise for small firms.
M54|Mutual Gains? Is There a Role for Employee Engagement in the Modern Workplace?|I examine the history of employee engagement and how it has been characterised by thinkers in sociology, psychology, management and economics. I suggest that, while employers may choose to invest in employee engagement, there are alternative management strategies that may be profit-maximising. I identify four elements of employee engagement – job ‘flow’, autonomous working, involvement in decision-making at workplace or firm level, and financial participation – and present empirical evidence on their incidence and employee perceptions of engagement, drawing primarily from evidence in Britain. I consider the evidence regarding the existence of mutual gains and present new evidence on the issue. I find a non-linear relationship between human resource management (HRM) intensity and various employee job attitudes. I also find the intensity of HRM use and employee engagement are independently associated with improvements in workplace performance. I consider the implications of the findings for policy and employment practice in the future.
M54|The Twin Track Model of Employee Voice: An Anglo-American Perspective on Union Decline and the Rise of Alternative Forms of Voice|We present a simple framework for analyzing decline in union voice in the Anglo-American world and its replacement by non-union, often direct, forms of worker voice. We argue that it is a decline in the in-flow to unionisation among employers and workers, rather than an increase in the outflow rate, that accounts for this decline. We show how union decline is predicted by experience good and cost-disease models of trade unionism and is linked to specific institutional and policy constraints on union organizing in the Anglo-American world. We show how the co-existence of union and non-union forms of worker voice is predicted by transaction cost economics, while the growth in non-union forms of worker voice is aided by declining costs of employers ''making'' voice mechanisms. We draw on ''spurt'' theories of unionisation to help understand factors underpinning union decline, including falling costs of employer opposition to unionisation as density falls, as discuss possibilities for ''bottom-up'' growth in union-like forms of worker voice implied by ''spurt'' theories.
M54|Can firms oversee more workers with fewer managers?|Managers are supervising more and more workers, and firms are getting flatter. However, not all firms have been keen on increasing the number of subordinates that their bosses manage (referred to as the “span of control” in human resource management), contending that there are limits to leveraging managerial ability. The diversity of firms’ organizational structure suggests that no universal rule can be applied. Identifying the factors behind the choice of firms’ internal organization is crucial and will help firms properly design their hierarchy and efficiently allocate scarce managerial resources within the organization.
M54|Teleworking as a mode of working for women in Sri Lanka: Concept, challenges and prospects|Labor force participation of women in Sri Lanka has been continuously low despite their remarkable educational achievements when compared to men. Teleworking mode facilitates flexibility at work and work-family balance. However, developing countries encounter numerous challenges in making the teleworking mode a reality. This paper examines the possibilities of introducing teleworking mode for women in Sri Lanka. It understands that the government, technological institutions, work organizations, training institutions, outsourcing companies, career-counseling centers, teleworkers themselves and prospective teleworker associations have major roles to play in this endeavor.
M54|Strategic feedback in teams: Theory and experimental evidence|We theoretically and experimentally analyze public and private feedback in teams that are characterized by different performance technologies. We consider a setting where the principal has some performance relevant private information and can either report this information truthfully or strategically withhold feedback. We find that if team performance is determined by the best performer (the “best-shot technology”), then both public and private feedback are better than no feedback unless the team is composed of all low performers, in which case no feedback is best. If, on the other hand, team performance is determined by the worst performer (the weakest-link technology), then no feedback is the best regime unless the team is composed of all high performers, in which case public or private feedback is better. Our results have implications for feedback policies in teams, organizations, and the workplace.
M54|On the Economics of Audit Partner Tenure and Rotation: Evidence from PCAOB Data|This paper provides the first partner tenure and rotation analysis for a large cross-section of U.S. publicly listed firms over an extended period. We analyze the effects on audit quality as well as economic tradeoffs related to partner tenure and rotation with respect to audit hours and fees. On average, we find no evidence for audit quality declines over the tenure cycle and little support for fresh-look benefits after rotations. Nevertheless, partner rotations have significant economic consequences. We find increases in audit fees and decreases in audit hours over the tenure cycle, which differ by partner experience, client size, and competitiveness of the local audit market. More generally, our findings are consistent with efforts by the audit firms to minimize disruptions and audit failures around mandatory rotations. We also analyze special circumstances, such as audit firm switches and early partner rotations, and show that they are more disruptive than mandatory rotations, and also more likely to exhibit audit quality effects.
M54|Mutual Gains? Is There a Role for Employee Engagement in the Modern Workplace?|I examine the history of employee engagement and how it has been characterised by thinkers in sociology, psychology, management and economics. I suggest that, while employers may choose to invest in employee engagement, there are alternative management strategies that may be profit-maximising. I identify four elements of employee engagement – job 'flow', autonomous working, involvement in decision-making at workplace or firm level, and financial participation – and present empirical evidence on their incidence and employee perceptions of engagement, drawing primarily from evidence in Britain. I consider the evidence regarding the existence of mutual gains and present new evidence on the issue. I find a non-linear relationship between human resource management (HRM) intensity and various employee job attitudes. I also find the intensity of HRM use and employee engagement are independently associated with improvements in workplace performance. I consider the implications of the findings for policy and employment practice in the future.
M54|The Manager in Specialized Institutions and Community Services|The social manager’s role in social services is becoming increasingly important in recent years. The object of study in this elaboration is social manager and the subject –his role in social services. The aim is to highlight the importance of social manager for the appropriate functioning of social services. Specific tasks in this exhibition are limited to disclosure of the essential characteristics and requirements which must meet social manager; style and method of social managers’ work; factors that cause stress in subordinates, and the social manager’s role in stress management in the workplace.
M54|Effects of Top Management Team Characteristics on Corporate Charitable Activities: Evidence from the Board for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in China|Employing data from Chinese companies listed on the board for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the research examines the relationship between top management team (TMT) characteristics and corporate charitable activities in China. My findings confirm: 1) Firms less engaged in charitable activities are likely to have TMTs characterized by more educational specialty in science and engineering, and more functional background in output functions; 2) TMT age heterogeneity has a significant and positive effect on corporate charitable activities, while TMT educational specialty heterogeneity has a negative influence on corporate charitable activities; 3) TMT age, tenure, educational level and these heterogeneities of tenure, educational level and functional background have little or no influence on corporate charitable activities. Based on the upper echelons theory, the study can provide evidence for further research on top management teams and corporate social responsibility in an emerging economy.
M54|An Empirical Study of Social Skill fs Impact on Career Decision Making|The purpose of this study is to investigate the relation between social skill, career decision making abilities, and career decision making self-efficacy (CDMSE) using statistical analysis.Although prior research discussed whether people can or not decide their own career and its factor that promote career decision making, the relation between social skill, career decision making abilities and CDMSE is rarely investigated. A questionnaire survey of 44 undergraduate students of Japanese national university was conducted. We analyzed the relation quantitively based on Bandura fs self-efficacy theory. We found that social skill promotes career decision making abilities and CDMSE directly and career decision making abilities partially mediate between social skill and CDMSE. Finally, we discussed theoretical and practical implications and addressed future research.
M54|Direct Participation of a Higher Education Institution Employees in the Organisational Change Process – a Study Report|Changes in the organisation require its adjustment through the process of organisational change. For changes to bring expected, positive results, all employees should be involved. Employee direct participation is one of the most effective methods of winning them for change and leading them to positive reaction in form of cooperation, engagement and reduction of resistance. The objective of this study is to analyse the process of change of the organisational structure (number of departments) at a faculty of a Pomeranian university, in terms of direct participation of the research and teaching and the teaching staff in the process. The study involved direct polling. The study sample (the faculty and its employees) has been intentionally selected. The study revealed that the employees participate in the change cycle in a limited way, indifference and resistance being their main attitudes. The results suggest that causes of this state are the autocratic style of the change initiators, little time devoted to involve employees in the process, and the negative atmosphere caused by staff rotation (dominant internal factor).
M54|Application of the Principle of Fairness in the Distribution of Rewards: Evidence from Serbia and Bosnia & Herzegovina|In the search for additional data, which would enable the conclusion on the implementation of the principle of fairness in the distribution of rewards as one of the key ethical concepts in relations between employers and employees, a survey was conducted, which entailed the corresponding proportional number of respondents from Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, to enable comparison of results. On the basis of secondary data, this research started from the assumption that the principle of Procedural justice in the distribution of income in Serbia and B&H has been insufficiently applied in practice in organizations in these two countries. It has been assumed that the ownership structure of the company (organization) affects the degree of implementation of the principles of fairness. The aim of this paper is to identify elements of the system of rewards which determine the perception of fairness among employees and to what extent they are implemented in organizations in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In this paper the authors are looking for the identification of elements that form the basis of fairness in the distribution of rewards and their importance for the perception of fairness. Methodologically, the paper is based on the analysis of the existing literature, secondary sources and statistically processed results of the survey conducted in 328 organizations in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The results of this analysis indicate that the elements of fairness in distribution of rewards were neglected in the organizations analyzed in this research. According to the presented data of the research conducted on the sample of 325 respondents in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina hypotheses are confirmed that the principles of procedural justice are not sufficiently applied in organizations in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Their application depends on the form of ownership. Low perception of procedural practice in distribution of rewards may have negative impact on business results, which can be the subject of some future research.
M54|The Interrelationship betweeen Motivation, Organizational Culture and Engagement.The Next Challenge for 21st Century Leaders|Research background: The huge research interest in the interrelationship between motivation, organizational culture, and engagement can be explained psychologically and economically. Psychological reasons include work individualization, increasing interest in positive psychology, and the role of human resources, perceived as a key resource in enhancing business competitive advantage. The economic reason is “engagement deficit” resulting from low employee engagement rates in organizations. Business organizations around the world pay a heavy price for unengaged and uncommitted employees. Leaders today are exerting tremendous pressure on their workforces to achieve optimal results. It is, therefore, becoming increasingly important for organizations to attract, engage, develop and build loyalty among their employees, based on their organizational culture, to gain a competitive edge in today's global marketplace. Purpose of the article: The article’s main purpose is exploring the interrelationship between three variables: motivation and organizational culture, which are independent variables, and engagement which is the dependent variable. This is important in the light of 21st century leaders' challenges to establish a solid organizational culture to engage their employees. Methodology: Methodology is based on a multidisciplinary literature review in the fields of organizational psychology and management theory, including nearly 100 articles, reports and books. Findings: Building an engagement organizational culture means leaders must understand the interrelationship between organizational culture and engagement and its contribution to achieving business goals. Managing organizational culture requires leaders to focus on human aspects like motivation and employee values. The engagement organizational culture lies, profoundly, at the center of the ethical value-based organizational culture.
M54|Gender, Communication Styles, and Leader Effectiveness|We study gender differences in the behavior, communication, and effectiveness of randomly selected leaders in a laboratory experiment using the turnaround game. Leaders can send nonbinding pre‐play text messages to try to convince followers to coordinate on the Pareto‐efficient equilibrium. The treatment variations consist of the gender of the leader, and whether the communication is one‐way (only leaders send messages) or two‐way (first followers send messages to their leader, and subsequently the leader sends messages to the group). We find that male leaders communicate more assertively. Communication with the followers induces female leaders to express significantly more often that they are part of the group, rather than standing above the group. Despite the different paths in communication, both men and women are equally likely to request the highest effort contribution. Men and women are equally effective leaders.
M54|Men and Women Are Equally Effective Leaders|We study gender differences in the behavior and effectiveness of randomly selected leaders in a laboratory experiment using the minimum effort coordination game. Leaders can send non‐binding numeric messages to try to convince followers to coordinate on the Pareto‐efficient equilibrium. The treatment variations consist of the gender of the leader, and whether participants know or do not know the gender of the leader in their group. We find that female leaders choose more often to send a riskier high message in the beginning of the game, which hurts their effectiveness especially if gender is not revealed. However, if gender is revealed, both male and female leaders make more careful choices, and thus we do not observe any significant gender difference in leader effectiveness.
M54|An empirical study of Job satisfaction of university staff|The paper examined university staff overall job satisfaction in Sunyani Technical University in a survey of 100 respondents in a cross-sectional study and a quantitative design. Using standard ordinary least square (OLS) method the findings of the study show that employees are satisfied with overall job satisfaction, and satisfied with the elements of satisfaction identified in the survey, with salary and workload been the most satisfied elements. The findings of the research in addition, indicate that elements of job satisfaction influence overall job satisfaction. Management of higher institutions should take into account the findings of the current study in motivating employees for enhance performance resulting from better service and quality service, since university workers are the first members of the community in dealing with students who are junior members of the community.
M54|Social trust, workplace organization, and the comparative advantage of nations|In this paper, I consider a specific channel through which trust between parties to an exchange can go on to affect nations’ comparative advantage in certain industries. My approach revolves around the autonomy that employers (principals) grant to workers (agents), which is a key feature of workplace organization. I hypothesize that social trust generates a comparative advantage in industries with more autonomous micro production environments. I employ individual-level data on work autonomy to construct a measure of the extent to which industries are characterized by autonomy in the production process. Results of a cross-country cross-industry analysis confirm that countries with higher levels of social trust have a comparative advantage in high-autonomy industries and vice versa. Results are robust to the possibility of reverse causality. The paper’s key contribution is to provide a link between the microeconomic literature on workplace organization and the comparative macroeconomic literature on social trust.
M54|An Empirical study of the Role of Demographics in Job Satisfaction of Sunyani Technical University staff|The paper analyses the effects of demographic variables on overall job satisfaction and satisfaction elements for Sunyani Technical University using standard Ordinary Least Square method (OLS). The estimates of the regression analysis indicate that demographic variables have insignificant positive and negative effect on overall job satisfaction. However, the estimates show significant positive and negative effect of demographic variables on some elements of job satisfaction. Managements of academic institutions should take into account the findings of the study to ensure that workers are well satisfied with their job so that productivity will not be affected. Future study should replicate the current study in a comparative study of private and public academic institutions.
M54|The Twin Track Model of Employee Voice: An Anglo-American Perspective on Union Decline and the Rise of Alternative Forms of Voice|"We present a simple framework for analyzing decline in union voice in the Anglo-American world and its replacement by non-union, often direct, forms of worker voice. We argue that it is a decline in the in-flow to unionisation among employers and workers, rather than an increase in the outflow rate, that accounts for this decline. We show how union decline is predicted by experience good and cost-disease models of trade unionism and is linked to specific institutional and policy constraints on union organizing in the Anglo-American world. We show how the coexistence of union and non-union forms of worker voice is predicted by transaction cost economics, while the growth in non-union forms of worker voice is aided by declining costs of employers ""making"" voice mechanisms. We draw on ""spurt"" theories of unionisation to help understand factors underpinning union decline, including falling costs of employer opposition to unionisation as density falls, as discuss possibilities for ""bottom-up"" growth in union-like forms of worker voice implied by ""spurt"" theories."
M54|Boss Competence and Worker Well-Being|Nearly all workers have a supervisor or â€œboss.â€ Yet little is known about how bosses influence the quality of employeesâ€™ lives. This study offers new evidence. First, the authors find that a bossâ€™s technical competence is the single strongest predictor of a workerâ€™s job satisfaction. Second, they demonstrate using longitudinal data, after controlling for fixed-effects, that even if a worker stays in the same job and workplace, a rise in the competence of a supervisor is associated with an improvement in the workerâ€™s well-being. Third, the authors report a variety of robustness checks, including tentative instrumental variable results. These findings, which draw on U.S. and British data, contribute to an emerging literature on the role of â€œexpert leadersâ€ in organizations.
M54|Student Personality, Lecturer Competency, Campus Facilities, and Students? Learning Motivation in Private Univ|The aim of the study is to identify the effect of student personality, lecturer competency, and campus facilities toward the student learning motivation. Motivation is an important factor which affects the student?s academic performance. The participants were 187 students from various classes in Telkom University in Bandung. We implemented the mutiple regression analysis to measure the simultaneous and partial relation. 35 items used in the questionnaires which distributed using convenience approach. Simultaneously, all three independent variables had significant and positive effect on student? learning motivation (R2 0.250 and Sig. 0.000). Furthermore, partially, student personality, lecturer competency, and campus facilities also had significant and positive effect on student? learning motivation. Beta? results for those three independent variables are 0.203, 0.285, and 0.154 respectively with the Sig. below 0.000. The university or faculty need to improve the teacher competency and their learning facilities if they want to enhance student motivation. Since the personality of students also played impportant part, the selection process should need to consider types of student personality which help to improve the performance.
M54|Do Good Job Conditions Matter for Wages and Productivity? Theory and Evidence from Latin America|Abstract Based on Akerlof and Kranton (2005) In Journal of Economic Perspectives, 19(1), 9–32, who argue that group identity and social norms influence individual preferences towards work effort, a model is developed to understand why firms create good job conditions, taking into account the cost of implementing them and their impact on wages and productivity. Then, using individual-level data from the Gallup World Poll for 18 Latin American countries, the main predictions of the model are tested using propensity score matching. We find a positive link between good job conditions and wages when there are several simultaneous signals of a good work environment. We conclude that there is a positive payoff of investing in good job conditions for both workers and firms.
M54|Determinants and effects of formal target agreements: an empirical investigation of German firms|Abstract We investigate organizational determinants and performance effects of formal target agreements for employees based on the IAB establishment panel, a representative panel of German establishments. The results show that establishments with a high employee turnover rate, a large proportion of temporary workers, and a highly qualified workforce are significantly more likely to implement target agreements. Also, establishments with works councils installed are more likely to do so, controlling, among others, for firm size. Concerning organizational performance, we apply a first-difference and a fixed effects approach and find that establishments that implement target agreements achieve around 5 % higher total sales compared to firms that did not introduce this practice. Hence, organizations seem to benefit from the implementation of formal target agreements for employees.
M54|Local Support Mechanisms for Entrepreneurship: The Approach of Local Development and Innovation Institutions|Purpose: The growth potential of SMEs entrepreneurship is examined at regional and local level, initially on a Global scale and then for the case of Greece. Additionally, the possibility of an economic development policy beyond the macroeconomic approach is examined, focusing on business growth and competitiveness in the light of meso and micro-economic policy approach. Design/methodology/approach: This research leads to the proposal of building knowledge mechanisms and direct and efficient systematic development and innovation at the local level, particularity during a time of economic crisis. The establishment of Institutes of Local Development and Innovation (ITAK) is primarily geared towards promoting innovative entrepreneurship and extroversion of locally installed businesses. As part of the proposal for the establishment of ITAK, a questionnaire was developed - a tool to initially measure companies' opinions on the need for outside help in the macro, meso and micro environment, in order to demonstrate that ITAK local-level structures could be developed. Findings: The survey results were accrued via the analysis of questionnaires distributed to companies. The results of the questionnaires in the micro-environment in relation to those in the macro-environment shows a lower tendency to change business, which may be because managers perceive economics several times more in macroeconomic terms rather than in meso and micro economic (terms). Research limitations/implications: The restrictions of this particular research are the small sample of study of businesses in one country (Greece); this is because the approach of study, which is quantitative-qualitative, limits analysis to small data sets in the current phase. Originality/value: The results in the micro-environment, in relation to those at macro-environmental, shows a lower tendency to change business, something which may be because managers perceive economics several times more in macroeconomic terms, rather than in meso and micro economic (terms).
M54|Motivating Public Sector Employees: Evidence from Greece|Purpose: The object of this research is to investigate work motivating factors in the public sector in Greece, as well as to study demographic attributes, placing emphasis on age and gender as determinants of employee motives. Design/methodology/approach: To answer our research questions, a questionnaire was distributed at the beginning of 2015 to a public - sector organization in central Greece. A total of 318 anonymous survey responses were collected and analysed with SPSS. Findings: In the public organization under survey, the leading employee motives are an increase in salaries, opportunities for hierarchical advancement in the organization, as well as the development of personal skills. Moreover, motivational differences are noted among Baby Boomers, Generation X and Generation Y. Research limitations/implications: As the present study has been conducted on a single public organization, awareness should be raised as far as the generalizability of the results providing useful insights for further exploration. Originality/value: Limited research has been conducted in the Greek public sector comparing motives among generations.
M54|Wage delegation and intrinsic motivation: an experimental study|The aim of this study is to investigate experimentally whether and to what extent subjectsâ€™ intrinsic motivation and performance change when they are allowed to self-set their own wage for performing a task; moreover, it investigates how differently motivated people react to the possibility of deter- mining their own wage. We propose a novel experimental design, in which the subjects are asked to perform a complex real-effort task under two different conditions: wages can be either chosen by the subjects themselves, or randomly determined. With this setting, we are able to disentangle intrinsic motivation from the reciprocity concerns that are likely to characterize the standard principal-agent interaction. Our main result is that subjects increase their performance more when they are delegated the wage choice than when they receive a random payment; moreover, subjects who are both highly motivated and delegated their wage choice are those who perform better. Finally, subjects with higher motivation ask for lower wages.
M54|Globalisierung und betriebliche Mitbestimmung|Der vorliegende Beitrag diskutiert verschiedene Szenarien zum Einfluss von Auslandsdirektinvestitionen auf die betriebliche Mitbestimmung in Deutschland. Vorliegende Studien sprechen dafür, dass die Funktionsfähigkeit betrieblicher Mitbestimmung in Betrieben mit ausländischen Eigentümern beeinträchtigt ist. Ein positiver Zusammenhang zwischen dem Vorhandensein eines Betriebsrats und der betrieblichen Produktivität sowie der Nutzung personalpolitischer Maßnahmen zur Steigerung der betrieblichen Leistungsfähigkeit lässt sich nur in Betrieben mit inländischen, nicht aber in Betrieben mit ausländischen Eigentümern nachweisen. Darüber hinaus sind kooperative Beziehungen zwischen Betriebsrat und Management in Betrieben mit ausländischen Eigentümern weniger wahrscheinlich als in Betrieben mit inländischen Eigentümern. Trotz der eingeschränkten Funktionsfähigkeit haben die Beschäftigten in Betrieben, die sich in ausländischem Eigentum befinden, ein erhöhtes Interesse an betrieblicher Mitbestimmung. Dies dürfte mit einer erhöhten Beschäftigungsunsicherheit und einem verstärkten Druck zur kurzfristigen Gewinnerzielung zusammenhängen.
M54|Working Hours and Productivity|This paper studies the link between working hours and productivity using daily information on working hours and performance of a sample of call centre agents. We exploit variation in the number of hours worked by the same employee across days and weeks due to central scheduling, enabling us to estimate the effect of working hours on productivity. We find that as the number of hours worked increases, the average handling time for a call increases, meaning that agents become less productive. This result suggests that fatigue can play an important role, even in jobs with mostly part-time workers.
M54|Choking Under Pressure in Front of a Supportive Audience: Evidence from Professional Biathlon|Performing in front of a supportive audience increases motivation. However, it also creates a psychological pressure, which may impair performance, especially in precision tasks. In this paper we exploit a unique setting in which professionals compete in a real-life contest with high monetary rewards in order to assess how they respond to the presence of a supportive audience. Using the task of shooting in sprint competitions of professional biathlon events over the period of sixteen years, our fixed effects estimations show that high-profile biathletes miss significantly more shots when competing in front of a supportive audience. Our results are in line with the hypothesis that a friendly environment induces individuals to choke when performing skill-based tasks.
M54|Gender differences in motivational crowding out of work perfomance|This paper studies motivational crowding-out effects after financial incentives are lowered. In a real-effort setting, workers receive a piece rate before financial incentives are substituted by a one-time payment. Under the fixed payment, effort is significantly lower only when preceded by piece-rate incentives. The decrease is driven by a fraction of men who reduce their effort by 12%, whereas women constantly perform well. We find that this motivational crowding-out effect disappears when men do not have prior experience of a piece rate. In a series of control treatments, we discard all alternative explanations besides from motivational crowding out.
M54|Friends and Foes at Work: Assigning Teams in a Social Network|In many firms, production requires the division of staff into teams. If only team performance is observable, moral hazard in teams is inevitable. This variant of moral hazard can be overcome or exacerbated by the interpersonal relationships among team members. I investigate how the division of staff into teams should account for the agents' social network of interpersonal relationships. Considering piece rate compensation for teams, I identify rules for efficient team assignment. Depending on the shape of individual effort costs, team assignment follows either a maximin or maximax rule with regard to team members' willingness to cooperate. Generally, the preferences of staff for team composition can collide with efficient production. A universal mechanism guaranteeing efficiency while delegating responsibility for team assignment to the agents does not exist. Successful staffing thus requires knowledge of the interpersonal relationships at work and, at times, control instead of delegation.
M54|"Temporary agency employment in Germany: A strategic ""buffer"" for firms and regions in the crisis?"|In many European countries the number of employees hired via temporary work agencies has increased considerably over the past two decades, up to around 2% of the total workforce in the European Union today. Different studies have found the demand for agency employment to precede GDP growth. This paper explores to what extent firms utilised agency work as a strategic 'buffer' to adapt to variation in labour demand in Germany over the period 2006-2014, i.e. before, during and after the crisis of 2008/2009. Drawing on microdata from a representative employer survey (IAB Establishment Panel) and statistics on regional labour markets, the analysis finds only limited evidence on a systematic firm-level buffer function of temporary agency work. Rather, in many firms hiring from agencies is possibly part of a business strategy relying on flexible recruitment. An analysis of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) using a propensity score matching procedure suggests that particularly in regions with high unemployment, such flexibility during the crisis supported adaptation of client firms to economic change, since they were less reluctant than non-clients to hire after the crisis.
M54|Verzerrungen bei Personalbeurteilungen durch Führungskräfte<BR>[Biases in performance appraisals by managers]|Personalbeurteilungen sind ein wichtiges Führungsinstrument in Unternehmen. Da die Personalbeurteilungen von Personen durchgeführt werden, unterliegen die Beurteilungen auch subjektiven Einschätzungen. Bei der Durchführung von Personalbeurteilungen treten Verzerrungen auf, die teils vermieden werden können. Führungskräfte sollten diese Fehler daher kennen.
M54|Sind gewählte Teamleiter besser als ihr Team? Analyse am Beispiel von BWL-Professoren und ihren Zitationen<BR>[Are elected team leaders better than their teams? Analysis at the example of management professors and their citations]|Am Beispiel deutschsprachiger BWL-Professoren wird untersucht, ob Führungspersonen, konkret Dekane, Prodekane und Vorsitzende von wissenschaftlichen Kommissionen des VHB, in der operativen Arbeit, hier der Forschung gemessen über Veröffentlichungen und Zitationen bei Google Scholar, erfolgreicher sind als andere Teammitglieder, in diesem Fall Professoren ohne entsprechende Positionen. Empirisch ist dies der Fall, was gegen andere Erklärungsansätze spricht, die keinen oder sogar einen negativen Zusammenhang zwischen erfolgreicher Teamleitung und normaler Arbeit annehmen.
M54|Endogenously Emerging Gender Diversity in an Experimental Team Work Setting|We study gender diversity and performance in endogenously formed teams. Participants choose to either perform a cooperation task with members of the own gender only or in a mixed-gender team. We find that independent of the team choice, initially men cooperate significantly more than women. In subsequent periods, men prefer the successful men-only teams, resulting in significantly higher profits for men compared to women. Only over time, this endogenously emerged “gender profit gap” closes.
M54|Accountability one step removed|In a repeated real effort team production experiment workers receive a distorted signal about their co-players’ previous efforts. We vary the degree to which production can be directly traced back to a participant’s real or randomly drawn effort level. We find that individuals produce much less and the decline of contributions over time is significantly steeper under high as compared to low accountability. In an additional endogenous accountability condition observe the highest effort level.
M54|Peer Effects in the Workplace|Existing evidence on peer effects in the productivity of coworkers stems from either laboratory experiments or real-world studies referring to a specific firm or occupation. In this paper, we aim at providing more generalizable results by investigating a large local labor market, with a focus on peer effects in wages rather than productivity. Our estimation strategy--which links the average permanent productivity of workers' peers to their wages--circumvents the reflection problem and accounts for endogenous sorting of workers into peer groups and firms. On average over all occupations, and in the type of high-skilled occupations investigated in studies on knowledge spillover, we find only small peer effects in wages. In the type of low-skilled occupations analyzed in extant studies on social pressure, in contrast, we find larger peer effects, about one-half the size of those identified in similar studies on productivity.
M54|Envy in Mission-Oriented Organizations|"According to the labor donation theory, workers adhering to their firms' mission are willing to donate a portion of their paid labor. In this paper, we study how workers' fairness concerns limit the firm's ability to extract labor donation from its employees. We find that, in sectors where the firm's mission is important, optimal contracts are such that high-ability employees perceive their wage as less fair than low-ability employees and they must be rewarded with an “envy rent"". The opposite is true in sectors where the firm's mission does not play a relevant role. We empirically test the predictions of the model using the German Socio-Economic Panel finding support for our theoretical results."

M54|La « face cachée » de l’actionnariat salarié : Etude empirique sur l’indice SBF 120 (2000-2014) - The dark side of employee ownership in french listed companies, an enquiry on the SBF 120 between 2000 and 2014|(VF)L’actionnariat salarié se développe de manière inexorable et tend à faire des salariés des acteurs incontournables de la gouvernance des entreprises. Face à cette transformation importante de l’actionnariat, les recherches les plus récentes évaluent de manière ambivalente les effets de l’actionnariat salarié. Cet article se focalise sur un phénomène jusqu’à présent très peu étudié : l’actionnariat salarié significatif c’est-à-dire l’incidence d’une présence majeure voire majoritaire des salariés dans le capital et au sein des organes de gouvernance. Nos résultats démontrent un effet négatif de l’actionnariat salarié significatif sur la performance économique des entreprises. Cet effet est renforcé par la présence d’administrateurs salariés dans les instances de gouvernance. Nos tests économétriques sont basés sur la méthode d’estimations des GMM en panel dynamique qui permet de traiter les problèmes d’endogénéité. Notre étude quantitative examine les 120 plus grandes entreprises françaises sur une période d’observation inédite (2000-2014). (VA)Employee stock ownership is a growing phenomenon and nowadays employees tend to play a key role in corporate governance. Researchers have largely documented this shift in ownership and corporate governance processes and they show that employee ownership has mitigated effects. In this article, we focus on situation of ownership where employees have significant shares and occupy majority positions. We show that in these contexts, employee ownership has negative consequences on firm performance. These negative consequences are reinforced when employees are represented in board of directors. We applied the dynamic panel GMM model which appears particularly well suited to deal with potential endogeneity problem. Our data encompasses the largest French listed companies (SBF 120) form 2000 to 2014.
M54|Optimization by Integration: A Corporate Governance and Human Resource Management Dimension|Contemporary business entities that are keen to achieve measurable growth can no longer rely on inflexible corporate management frameworks for running their affairs. This viewpoint is adduced in the light of the emergence and re-emergence of unpredictable and likewise complex operating contexts. Notwithstanding the connected legal, financial, economic and social issues; business concerns must devise innovative ways to sustain holistic performance levels. Moreover, corporate and regulatory interests must collaborate to effectively mitigate corporate failures attributable to various business concerns. In furtherance of the debate on the nexus between corporate governance and human resource management, this paper presented a conceptual model that aggregates specific aspects of business processes that synergizes both concepts. Practical perspectives on the interrelatedness between corporate governance and human resource management provide a veritable basis to explore the theme of this paper. The paper opined that an appropriate balance must be achieved with regards to identifiable and fundamental aspects of the corporate structure and process. It was recommended that a diverse model of corporate integration enhances the functionalities of the corporate entity; facilitates optimization processes, thereby contributing to long term sustainability and growth.The central role of human actors in the governance of business entities is also duly emphasized, as this viewpoint underlies the essence of integrating the two concepts in general and specific terms.
M54|The Effect of Human Resource Management Practices on Employees’ Work Engagement and the Mediating and Moderating Role of Positive Psychological Capital|This study proposes and investigates a model of psychological capital as a mediator and moderator in human resource (HR) practices-employee work engagement relationship. Although there have been a lot of researches on the relationship between HR practices and individual and organizational outcomes, how occur this relationship is still unclear. In order to advance our knowledge about this relationship, there is need to investigate possible mediating and moderating variables that effective on it. To test developed model, we collected data from 590 white-collor employees who are working in private companies from different sectors in Turkey. As a result of this study the effects of motivation and skill enhancing HR practices on work engagement are significantly partial mediated by psychological capital but not moderated. On the other hand the effects of opportunity enhancing HR practices and working conditions on work engagement are significantly partial mediated and moderated by psychological capital at the same time.
M54|Managerial Attention and Worker Performance|We present a novel theory of the employment relationship. A manager can invest in attention technology to recognize good worker performance. The technology may break and is costly to replace. We show that as time passes without recognition, the worker's belief about the manager's technology worsens and his effort declines. The manager responds by investing, but this investment is insufficient to stop the decline in effort and eventually becomes decreasing. The relationship therefore continues deteriorating, and a return to high performance becomes increasingly unlikely. These deteriorating dynamics do not arise when recognition is of bad performance or independent of effort.
M54|Rational Inattention and Organizational Focus|This paper studies optimal communication flows in organizations. A production process can be coordinated ex ante, by letting agents stick to a prespecified plan of action. Alternatively, agents may adapt to task-specific shocks, in which case tasks must be coordinated ex post, using communication. When attention is scarce, an optimal organization coordinates only a few tasks ex post. Those tasks are higher performing, more adaptive to the environment, and influential. Hence, scarce attention requires setting priorities, not just local optimization. Our results provide microfoundations for a central idea in the management literature that firms should focus on a limited set of core competencies.
M54|Don't Demotivate, Discriminate|"This paper offers a new theory of discrimination in the workplace. We consider a manager who has to assign two tasks to two employees. The manager has superior information about the employees' abilities. We show that besides an equilibrium where the manager does not discriminate, equilibria exist where the manager discriminates in favor of the employee whom the employees expect to be favored. The manager, who has no taste for discrimination, discriminates in order to avoid demotivating the ""favorite"". We show that the nondiscriminatory equilibrium is unstable. Yet the manager would prefer to commit not to discriminate. (JEL D82, D84, J71, M12, M51, M54)"
M54|What Do People Want From Their Jobs? A Dual Factor Analysis Based On Gender Differences Drain|The objective of this paper is to offer a better understanding of the situation on emigration, with a focus on the emigration of the university-educated individuals, from 6 different Eastern European countries, namely Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the Slovak Republic. The main purpose of the paper is to identify what employees want from their jobs from the perspective of Herzberg’s’ two factor theory. The study wants to determine empirically the motivator-hygiene factors that have a significant impact on the overall level of Romanian employee job satisfaction using stepwise regression models, as well as to compare the existence of differences in the key dimensions of satisfaction according to workers' gender. The factor “work itself” was the most motivating aspect for Romanian employees while the least motivating aspect was “salary”. All of the job motivator and hygiene factors were moderately or substantially related to overall job satisfaction. The factors “working conditions,” “salary” and “achievement” explained the variability among Romanian employees’ overall level of job satisfaction. Furthermore, a gender analysis was conducted in order to identify if there are significant differences between men and women regarding the overall job satisfaction and the job factors resulted from the regression analysis. The empirical results of Mann-Whitney tests revealed that the gender characteristics were negligibly related to overall job satisfaction and also there are statistically significant differences between males and females about salary as one of factors that motivate employees
M54|How do leadership styles influence the creativity of employees?|The objective of organizational creativity is to identify those factors that could affect creativity. One of the most influential factors is the leadership style. Following the review of literatures, we investigated this phenomenon in the Hungarian labor market. We analyzed the answers of more than 600 Hungarian employees. We asked them to categorize their leader on the basis of which classic Lewin leadership style is most characteristic of him or her. After this, they needed to judge how the perceived leadership style would affect the two phases of their workplace creativity. Similarly to international results, democratic leadership style proved to be stimulating, while the authoritarian leadership style was inhibitory. It has also been proved that not only leadership style influences creativity, as the model of successful creative organization cannot be described with the behavior of the leader(s) only.
M54|Investigating Chef-Leader Behaviour Impacts on Subordinate Work Team Identification: A Pitch|This pitch letter outlines my personal experience applying Faff’s (2015a) two-page pitching template to my PhD research plan. It discusses how the process of completing the pitching template has enabled me to better organise and articulate my research plan. This letter provides support for the use of the pitching template to evaluate and assess research which is beyond the initial stages of development. This letter describes how the pitching process systematically enables a researcher to not only conceptualize a research plan, but also enables a researcher to critically evaluate and assess an already established research plan for greater clarity.
M54|Etyczne problemy w pracy na podstawie opinii pracowników wybranych banków / Ethical Problems at Work in the Opinion of Employees of Selected Banks|The paper presents ethical problems of employees in selected banks in Poland. The theoretical part of the paper deals with codes of ethics in banking, especially those concerning the moral aspects of working in banking. The empirical part of the paper presents the results of research on the ethos of bank workers. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were carried out using a specialist Internet forum devoted to the banking sector. The study includes an analysis of hundreds of comments posted on an Internet forum.
M54|Employee Subjectivity as a Key Value in Management|People, with their knowledge and potential, are undoubtedly the most important part in any organisation because, thanks to them, it might accomplish its goals, gain a competitive advantage and achieve success on the market. That is why each organisation should hire the most appropriate employees and provide working conditions that enable them to unleash their potential for the company’s benefit. The fundamental value for creating a good work environment is employees’ subjectivity, which can be perceived in two ways. The basic level of honouring a person’s subjectivity is respecting human rights and the employee’s dignity in mutual relations. The higher level, though, is to give people a certain amount of autonomy and responsibility in their workplace. The aim of this paper is to identify and analyse interdisciplinary concepts that managers can use in order to ensure that people are given the respect they deserve.
M54|The Phenomenon of Underemployment in Poland|The labour market is usually associated with phenomena such as unemployment, employment and professional activity/inactivity. The ways in which these categories are shaped depend on various factors of an economic, social and technological nature. It is impossible to disagree with the statement that the contemporary labour market – local, national, and global – is undergoing dynamic changes. In the public debate, the themes of flexicurity, flexible forms of employment, reconciling professional work with private life, and lifelong learning appear more frequently. They cause heated discussions and often also controversies, since their impact on the situation of workers and employers in the labour market is increasing. Observing the trends in the world economy and the global labour market, it can be argued that employment becomes a privilege. Due to the reasons mentioned above, in the paper, issues which relate to ‘incomplete’ employment are discussed. Theoretical considerations are focused on the terminological and methodological problems related to the interpretation of the concept of underemployment both in the Polish and foreign literature. Furthermore, the relationships between the phenomenon of underemployment and the concept of employment flexibility and security are presented, since they are extremely important from the perspective of the contemporary labour market. The theoretical analysis is complemented by a statistical analysis of empirical data that illustrates the current scale of the phenomenon of underemployment in the labour market in Poland compared to other European Union member states (EU-28). The article adopts the research thesis that in Poland there is a problem of ‘incomplete’ employment. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to attempt to identify the scale of this phenomenon on the Polish labour market. Implementation of this objective will be possible thanks to the study of national and foreign literature and a conducted statistical analysis of selected indicators of the labour market in the context of this phenomenon, obtained from the database of the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
M54|Multicultural business environment - management approaches, values, trends and stereotypes|The article explores the setting up of a system of management procedures and approaches under the conditions of a multicultural business environment. The trends, the stereotypes and the impact of cultural differences on the values in the work process are identified. An analysis is made of the tools for an evaluation of the challenges, facing the management in the organisation and society. The focus is on assessment of the five determinants (5-D model) of Geert Hofstede for measuring and comparing national cultures. The research justifies the argument that knowledge of cultural values, stereotypes and cultural trends is not sufficient for the effective leadership and management of human capital in a multicultural organisation. It is necessary to apply this knowledge in practice by different models of management and methods of motivating people to achieve optimum efficiency in the work process. Based on this, conclusions and recommendations are formulated to increase the effectiveness of management in a multicultural environment.
M54|The Organization Of Working Hours Of Selected Employee Categories In Czech Businesses|In the current dynamic working environment, the adaptation of working hours is an important instrument for supporting the work and performance of all groups of employees. It also serves as an instrument that encourages their identification with the company. The aim of this article is to identify and evaluate the utilization of individual methods of work organization among selected groups of employees in Czech companies across the gamut of the business sector. The analysed data comes from a quantitative questionnairebased survey (n=315). The results show that in the Czech companies, flexitime is most frequent among regular employees (51.7%) and graduates up to 30 years old (24.1%). A reduced work schedule is most frequently used by mothers with children and senior citizens (41.3%, 27%) and as part-time work among students (41%). The use of flexible working hours is an instrument of diversity management and builds the company brand through enlisting the cooperation of different groups of employees.
M54|"""Diversity Management"" Towards ""Diversity Engagement"": The New Key Drivers For The Corporate Performances"|"Among the different social variables listed by CRS model there is the protection of the ""Diversity"": the objective of the present analysis is represented by the attempt to give new meaning to this variable, where an innovative management of the ""Diversity"" should be able to become a new strategic tool for a company globalized and oriented to Business Ethics. By this new point of view, it is possible to observe the ""Diversity"" as ""Richness"", following a revised perspective to change from being a determinant of ""Diversity Management"" (traditional approach) to become a strategic key driver oriented to the ""Diversity Engagement"" (innovative approach)."
M54|The Visionary Leader And His Role In Business Development|In any domain, be it religion, politics, economy, medicine, business, philosophy, sociology, education, army, we can find true leaders. These are the ones that make the rules, based upon their own experience and vision leaving their mark in history for future evolution. The purpose of this article is to identify the role of a visionary leader in developing a successful business. To achieve this, I’ve used the analysis of specialty essays and quantified analysis based on a survey applied within several companies in Arges County.
M54|Working from Home - What is the Effect on Employees' Effort?|This paper investigates how working from home affects employees' work effort. Employees, who have the possibility to work from home, have a high autonomy in scheduling their work and therefore are assumed to have a higher intrinsic motivation. Thus, we expect working from home to positively influence work effort of employees. For the empirical analysis we use the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). To account for self-selection into working locations we use an instrumental variable (IV) estimation strategy. Our empirical results show that working from home has a significantly positive influence on work effort. Moreover, we find that also the frequency of working from home is crucial. The more often employees work from home, the higher is the work effort they provide.
M54|The Impact of Mentoring and Helping Relationships in the Informal Process of Employee Branding: Construction of the Measuring Instrument|The process of employee branding (EeB), according to Miles and Mangold (2004; 2005) promotes and strengthen the psychological contract between employees and the organization by increasing and maximizing the employees’ sense of commitment and loyalty. The object of this research focuses on the measurement of the impact of mentoring and helping relationships in the informal process of EeB, with a focus on People and on an integrated vision of the Human Resources Management and Organizational Behavior, based on the exchange ratio of Relationship Marketing. With the introduction of a new variable (mentoring and helping relationships), this article focuses on the construction of the measuring instrument and the confirmation of its validity and reliability, in order to measure the involvement and internalization of the “effect of employee brand” in organizations.
M54|Strategic Human Resources Management In The Romanian Organizations|Started in 2009, the study of specific processes in the Strategic Human Resources Management (SHRM), will be continued in this article by identifying less obvious processes in models already made for SHRM. Among them, succession planning in the organization or promoting employees, are processes influenced by the current economical context. So that the results of this research reflect as realistically as possible the situation of the Romanian companies in the current economic context of the human resources processes, additionally to the questionnaire method we have also used the interview method. Being part of the sociological survey, this method could confirm or deny the results obtained via the questionnaire. In the activity field where personnel fluctuation can be sometimes overwhelming as in trade marketing, the effectiveness of these processes controls turn-over rate of staff and also provide certainty to employees that they will have access to higher positions by promoting the talents in the organization.
M54|Romanian Business Women: Managers Or Leaders?|Leadership is a concept appeared in the second part of the twentieth century which developed later on because of the business necessity as the economic environment has become more and more complex and the classic managerial style was no more efficient. In this complex world of business, women were traditionally involved in business at the administrative level, with small chances to reach top structures in a company. Due to the modern times, they won their rights to prove their management skills and to obtain more important jobs in famous companies. This paper presents the results of a research based on interview method and getting responses from Romanian women involved in business at the middle and top management in multinational companies. The main goal of the study was to identify the main features that define the women as a leader or a manager by finding lateral thinking skills. This research revealed that most of the women interviewed have their features closer to the conventional leader and only few of them have developed strong lateral thinking skills.

M54|"Arbeiten in der Sharing Economy: die ""Uberisierung"" der Arbeitswelt?"|"Within a short period of time the sharing-phenomenon, originally triggered by altered consumer attitudes and preferences and enabled by modern networking technologies, gained momentum. Quickly sharing emerged from its niche existence. Today an increasing professionalization of the sharing economy can be observed: Many of the idealistic goals originally set are being abandoned. Also, sharing platforms are more and more recognized not only for their ability to provide alternative ways to satisfy consumption needs but also as sources of jobs and income. Sharing platforms’ specific economical principles bring forth a new sort of self-employed worker—the micro-entrepreneur. This new sort of worker is confronted with specific working conditions prevailing in the new platform economy. As a whole, the further proliferation of this form of working gives rise to concerns about an ""uberization"" of work. This development raises questions in terms of modern protective rights for workers as well as social security benefits and therefore calls for the attention of regulators. Innerhalb kürzester Zeit hat das durch veränderte Konsumeinstellungen angestoßene und durch moderne Vernetzungstechnologien ermöglichte Sharing an Fahrt gewonnen und trat schnell aus der anfänglichen Nische heraus. Heute ist eine zunehmendeProfessionalisierung der Sharing Economy zu beobachten, in deren Zuge ursprüngliche und idealistische Ziele des Sharings zunehmend über Bord geworfen werden. Sharingplattformen dienen auch nicht länger nur als Quelle alternativer Konsumbefriedigung, sondern zudem als Job- und Verdienstquelle. Dabei sind es die spezifischen ökonomischen Grundprinzipien der Sharingplattformen, die einen neuen Typus von Selbständigem hervorbringen – den Mikrounternehmer. Dieser ist unterspeziellen, den Funktionsprinzipien der Plattformökonomie geschuldeten Arbeitskonditionen tätig. Insgesamt lässt die weitere Verbreitung dieser neuen Wirtschafts- und Arbeitsform eine ""Uberisierung"" der Arbeitswelt erwarten. Diese Entwicklung wirftFragen hinsichtlich zeitgemäßer Schutzrechte für Arbeitskräfte sowie sozialer Absicherung auf und ruft Regulierungsinstanzen auf den Plan."

M54|Envy in the workplace|Envy affects the optimal employment contract offered to employees with different productivity. The employees’ envy towards colleagues distorts the effort exerted by the less productive employees. However, this distortion is mitigated when employees are also envious towards their boss.
M54|Team production, endogenous learning about abilities and career concerns|This paper studies career concerns in teams where the support a worker receives depends on fellow team members׳ efforts and abilities. In this setting, by exerting effort and providing support, a worker can influence her own and her teammates׳ project outputs in order to bias the learning process in her favor. To manipulate the market׳s assessment, we argue that in equilibrium, a worker has incentives to help or even sabotage her colleagues in order to signal that she is of higher ability. In a multiperiod stationary framework, we show that the stationary level of work effort is above and help effort is below their efficient levels.
M54|The role of verifiability and privacy in the strategic provision of performance feedback: Theory and experimental evidence|We theoretically and experimentally analyze the role of verifiability and privacy in strategic performance feedback using a “one principal–two agent” context with real effort. We confirm the theoretical prediction that information transmission occurs only in verifiable feedback mechanisms and private–verifiable feedback is the most informative mechanism. Yet, subjects also exhibit some behavior that cannot be explained by our baseline model, such as telling the truth even when this will definitely hurt them, interpreting “no feedback” more optimistically than they should, and being influenced by feedback given to the other agent. We show that a model with individual-specific lying costs and naive agents can account for some, but not all, of these findings. We conclude that although agents do take into account the principal's strategic behavior to form beliefs in a Bayesian fashion, they are overly optimistic and interpret positive feedback to the other agent more pessimistically than they should.
M54|Team building and hidden costs of control|In a laboratory experiment, we investigate the interaction of two prominent firm strategies to increase worker effort: team building and control. We compare a team-building treatment where subjects initially play a coordination game to gain common experience (CE) with an autarky treatment where subjects individually perform a task (NCE). In both treatments, subjects then play two-player control games where agents provide costly effort and principals can control to secure a minimum effort. CE agents always outperform NCE agents. Conditional on control, however, CE agents’ effort is crowded out more strongly, with the effect being most pronounced for agents who successfully coordinated in the team-building exercise. Differential reactions to control perceived as excessive is one explanation for our findings.
M54|Private equity and workers’ career paths: the role of technological change|We analyze a new dataset on workers’ career paths to examine whether private equity (PE) investments can have positive spillover effects on workers. We study leveraged buyouts in the context of recent information technology (IT) diffusion, and find evidence supporting the argument that many employees of companies acquired by PE investors gain transferable, IT-complementary human capital. Our estimates indicate that these workers experience increases in both long-run employability and wages relative to what they would have realized in the absence of PE investment. The findings underscore PE’s role in mitigating the effects of workforce skill obsolescence resulting from technological change.
M54|El tamaño de las empresas y la calidad del recurso empresarial: ¿causa o efecto?|This article explores the possible causes of the heterogeneity observed in the productivity of Spanish companies, looking for a link between management capacity and business size in the context of Spanish companies. The results indicate that there is a positive and direct relationship between quality management and company size. This quality management measured through different indicators (education level, competences and professional skills and the level of implementation of advanced management practices) is also related to the type of management, as well as the strategic direction of the company, which together also affect its size. Therefore, improving the quality management, moving towards professionalism, will enable companies to design strategies and structures to facilitate their adaptation to the business environment, and thus, achieve improvements in results.
M54|Measuring the use of human resources practices and employee attitudes: The Linked Personnel Panel|Purpose - – The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new data source available for researchers with interest in human resources management (HRM) and personnel economics, the Linked Personnel Panel (LPP). Design/methodology/approach - – The LPP is a longitudinal and representative employer-employee data set covering establishments in Germany and a subset of their workforce and is designed for quantitative empirical human resource research. Findings - – The LPP employee survey applies a number of established scales to measure job characteristics and job perceptions, personal characteristics, employee attitudes towards the organization and employee behaviour. This paper gives an overview of both the employer and employee survey and outlines the definitions, origins, and statistical properties of the scales used in the individual questionnaire. Practical implications - – The paper describes how researchers can access the data. Originality/value - – First, the data set combines employer and employee surveys that can be matched to each other. Second, it can also be linked to a number of additional administrative data sets. Third, the LPP covers a wide range of firms and workers from different backgrounds. Finally, because of its longitudinal dimension, the LPP should facilitate the study of causal effects of HRM practices.
M54|Good boss, bad boss, workers’ mental health and productivity: Evidence from Japan|It is widely believed that the relationship between a supervisor and his/her employees greatly affects employees’ well-being and/or productivity. However, only a few papers in the economics literature analyze how supervisors influence employees’ well-being and enhance productivity. This paper uses longitudinal data of employees with information about their immediate bosses’ ability, management skills, and characteristics (such as competency, communication skills, and personality traits) to investigate the influence of supervisors on employees. The main findings are as follows. First, even after controlling for individual-specific fixed effects and other job characteristics, such as those proposed in the job strain model, we find that supervisors’ good communication with staff and competency in managerial tasks significantly improve employees’ mental health. Second, we find that good communication between the boss and his/her staff enhances the latter’s productivity and lowers presenteeism. Third, supervisors’ bad communication and low competency increase the probability of quitting. Fourth, good communication partially depends on boss–staff compatibility, which is governed in part by their combined personality traits.
M54|Mechanisms for Quality Assurance of Universities in Cameroon|This paper takes a perspective look at the evolution of universities in Cameroon and the recent orientation of deregulation as it affects quality assurance in these universities. The paper identifies these flaws by attempting to elucidate the meaning of the mechanism for quality assurance in the face of deregulation. The regulatory mechanisms identified by this paper include inter-alia, appropriate scrutiny of new programs, relying on impartial advice from examiners using the state law NO.98/004 of1998 to compliment the efforts of internal school administration. And above all opening linkages between universities and relating universities education in the world of science and technology, this paper does not only enhance quality assurance but also builds on the idea of economic growth and development.
M54|Modeling the determinants of emotional intelligence, self-motivation and individual success. Evidence from Portugal|The emotional intelligence has a plurality of settings that have played a key role both in the organizational context and in people´s behavior at work. This study aims at understanding the interrelationship between emotional intelligence, self-motivation and individual success, as well as the specific determinants that influence the performance of these behavioral dimensions. It is expected that a person with high emotional intelligence will probably have more success and competitive advantage compared to the one with less emotional intelligence. Self-motivation is closely linked to emotional intelligence in order to achieve goals that lead to individual success. To assess the interconnection between these personal characteristics, a questionnaire was carried out in Portugal involving 519 individuals who had at that time a job occupation. This data-base allows us to model the relationship between Emotional Intelligence, Self-Motivation and Individual Success and find the main determinants explaining these personal qualities. The estimation of linear probability models and ordinal logistic models depict the close interrelation between these characteristics, as well as, the determinants which are specific to each case. The empirical findings can serve as guidelines for individuals to control their behavior with respect to emotional intelligence and in conjunction with self-motivation which can lead to individual success.
M54|Gender differences in absence from work: Lessons from two world wars|This paper traces the origins and early history of perceived gender differences in absenteeism in Great Britain and the USA. Among politicians and scholars, the problem was first articulated during World War I and reappeared as an issue of prime concern during World War II. The war efforts required mobilization and allocation of large numbers of women to jobs that had previously been done by men while maintaining high and continuous flows of production in an economy that was increasingly characterized by high capital intensity. The most common explanation of women’s higher levels of absenteeism was their double burden of wage work and unpaid household duties. Although researchers in the field were cautious to give policy recommendations, the studies on absenteeism revealed that ‘industrial fatigue’ could have negative effects on productivity and helped to motivate regulations on working hours. Studies on absenteeism also encouraged firms to professionalize personnel management and to reinforce apprehensions of differences between men and women as workers and employees. Some employers and other policy makers referred to gender differences in absenteeism to motivate wage discrimination.
M54|製品開発における問題解決行動は日中韓企業でどう異なるか？ : 調査結果の分析と３か国への提言|本稿では，日本・中国・韓国のエンジニア個人を対象にしたアンケート調査データに基づいた分析を行い，以下の点を析出した．まず第1に，製品アーキテクチャのタイプ，開発組織の構造，ならびに担当業務内で発生した問題の間に，整合性が高い関係が日中韓３か国でみられる．つまり，インテグラル・アーキテクチャ寄りの日本と韓国では，複数部門からエンジニアが参加する形で開発組織が編成され，「仕様変更」「不具合」の二大問題が発生する割合が大きい．これは，モジュラー・アーキテクチャ寄りの中国とは好対照である．第2に，担当業務内で発生した最難関問題について現場レベルで問題解決が行われる度合は，日本＞韓国＞中国の順である．しかし，担当業務内で発生した最難関問題を解決する際の労働時間配分をみてみると，「上司と打合せをする時間」が韓国＞中国＞日本となっている．この結果は，職務経験年数の短さに起因して，韓国のエンジニアが問題解決に必要な知見を欠いており，それを補うために上司に依存する度合が高いことを示唆している．また担当業務外で発生した問題を解決する際の能動性は，「納期遅れ」を除くすべての問題に関して日本＞中国＞韓国であった．この結果もまた，韓国エンジニアの職務経験の短さから説明できるであろう．第3に，仕事に関する意識については，日本において，「現在の会社に勤め続けたい」の得点が最大で，「もっと条件のよい会社に転職したい」「降格の不安がある」「解雇の不安がある」の得点が最小であった．また，韓国の勤続指向が最低で，解雇・降格不安，転職志向が最大であった．さらに，能力評価・業績評価に対する納得度は，いずれも中国で際立って高く，日本・韓国では同等に低い．以上より，韓国エンジニアの職場定着指向の低さ，評価納得度の低さが目立つ結果となっている．
M54|The Influence of Transformational Leadership on Personal Branding through the Learning Organization and Consideration of Future Consequences|This study aims to analyze the direct and indirect effects of transformational leadership on personal branding through the learning organization and consideration of future consequences. The research was undertaken at a corporation that provides its managers with leadership and management training for organizational growth and has formed learning organization teams for this purpose. A group of 439 employees participated in the study. After applying a confirmatory factor analysis to the scales used in the research, the relationships among the research variables were analyzed, using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). According to the results of the study, the following were determined: a) transformational leadership has positive influence on personal branding through the learning organization and consideration of future consequences, b) As the learning organization has direct positive influence on personal branding, it also asserts indirect positive influence through the consideration of future consequences, c) the consideration of future consequences has direct positive influence on personal branding.
M54|Paid Vacation Use - The Role of Works Councils|We investigate the relationship between co-determination at the plant level and paid vacation in Germany. From a legal perspective, works councils have no impact on vacation entitlements, but they can affect their use. Employing data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), we find that male employees who work in an establishment, in which a works council exists, take almost two additional days of paid vacation annually, relative to employees in an establishment without institution. The effect for females is much smaller, if discernible at all. The data suggests that this gender gap might bue due to the fact that women exploit vacation entitlements more comprehensively than men already in the absence of a works council.
M54|Relationships Between Organizational Support, Organizational Commitment And Retention: Evidence From High-Potential Employees|This study examines the effects of perceived organizational support on high-potential employeesâ€™ intention to stay with their organization in the short-, medium- and long-term, through the mediating effect of organizational commitment. Data derive from an online survey conducted among a sample of 221 highpotential employees working in organizations in the Centre-Val de Loire Region (France). Statistical analyses were conducted using the Macro MEDIATE developed by Hayes and Preacher (2014). In short, results revealed that the effect of organizational support on high-potential employeesâ€™ intention to stay varies according to the three time points and suggest that the effect actually progresses over time.
M54|Leadership Best Practices And Employee Performance: A Phenomenological Telecommunication Industry Study|This phenomenological study explored leadership best practices among senior managers at a major telecommunications organization in to determine the perceived effects that such routines had on actual employee performance. The study took place in State of Georgia in the United States from January 16 to February 18, 2014 and involved ten selected managers who held the role of customer service manager for a minimum of 2 years and were identified as a top performer based on the ranking and rating reports from the organizationâ€™s data. The major themes that emerged centered around four major areas: (1) employeeoriented perspective of best leadership practices, (2) performance perspective of best leadership practices, (3) process perspective of best leadership practices, (4) learning and growth perspective of best leadership practices. It was determined that leaders should create a working environment where there is increased employee engagement and participation; communicate goals, gain employee understanding, and apply communication styles that fit the need of each employee at all levels; identify and plan opportunities of growth for employees through training and development; recognize the importance of personally engaging with their employees; and, understand the importance of having regular meetings to update employees about new products and services.
M54|A Practical Management System For The Effective Use Of Offshore Software Project Opportunities|A qualitative, grounded theory research was conducted to explore and deepen the understanding of how middle and low level managers can initialize and manage information technology (IT) outsourcing projects. The study involved 17 managers and leaders working in Ukraine in offshore software development companies. A grounded theory was utilized to analyze data from participants to identify the interrelationship among seven core categories including: (a) project communication, (b) employee training, (c) flexible organization, (d) strategic communication, (e) team unit, (f) transparent management, and (g) vendor adaptability. The study results indicate that applying a combination of concepts in the new theory as strategies allow managers to overcome barriers and achieve the realization of opportunities beyond traditional benefits in outsourcing. Such opportunities include achieving value-added results, vendor motivation, improved software quality, efficiency and timely delivery, organizational growth potential. The study highlighted the importance of referring a practical management system with characteristics of easily understandable and imaginable management approaches. The study also raised public awareness of the specific outsourcing landscape in Ukraine formed by that countryâ€™s cultural, technological, and political situation. The findings contribute to the body of knowledge on a practical management system in outsourcing although its scope was constrained by limited resources
M54|Desing Of An Instrument For Measuring, Compensation System And Its Relationship With Commitment And Permanence, Diseno De Un Instrumento Para Medir La Relacion Sistema De Compensacion, Permanencia Y Compromiso|In this study, we discuss data related to the design, construction and validation of an instrument to measure the influence of the compensation system, in the permanence and commitment of workers in a Mexican manufacturing company. The instrument was designed based on Allen and Meyer (1990), Richards (2006) and Luhmann & De Georgi (1993). The instrument has 41 Items that assess the variables through ten dimensions. Two validation processes were performed; first a content validation process was performed, this process was conducted in consultation with experts. Subsequently, to obtain the reliability of the instrument, a pilot study was conducted, which results gave an Alpha Cronbach’s coefficient with a value of 0.864. It can be concluded that the instrument achieved the validity and reliability needed to measure the population studied
M54|High involvement management practices, technology uses, work motivation and job search behaviour|Nowadays, employers face the mobility of the most productive employees and large costs induced by labour turnover. This paper examines the impact of two management policies on employees? motivation on one hand and their quitting behaviour on the other hand. These two policies are i) the participation in High Involvement Management (HIM) practices and ii) the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Employees? motivation, which is at the heart of this question, has different facets. Some employees exert effort because their job is in line with their values, gives opportunities for personal growth and pleasure in performing tasks. Alternatively, employees may simply be driven by rewards or compulsion. Using recent survey-based data of employees, the results show that the HIM and ICT strategies are positively related to the two types of work motivation (personal growth and rewards/compulsion). However, these strategies affect differently the likelihood of staff to remain or leave their current employer by type of motivation. While the HIM strategy reduces the risk that employees motivated by personal growth search for another job, it encourages on the contrary those who are motivated by rewards or compulsion to leave. ICT appear to play no role in employee retention.
M54|Dynamic Incentive Effects of Team Formation: Experimental Evidence|Optimal team composition has been the focus of exhaustive analysis, academic and otherwise. Yet, much of this analysis has ignored possible dynamic effects: e.g., anticipating that team formation is based on prior performance will affect prior performance. We test this hypothesis in a lab experiment with two stages of a real effort task. Participants first work individually without monetary incentives and are then assigned to teams of two where compensation is based on team performance. Our results are consistent with a simple investment-cum-matching model: pairing the worst performing individuals with the best yields 20% lower first stage effort than random matching. Pairing the best with the best, however, yields 5% higher first stage effort than random matching. In line with the theory the latter result is more pronounced when the task has less scope for learning-by-doing. Moreover, pairing the best with the best achieves the same effort response as having explicit monetary incentives in the first stage.
M54|When does HRM 'Work' in Small British Enterprises?|Using nationally representative workplace data we find substantial use of high-performance work systems (HPWS) in Britain's small enterprises. We find empirical support for the proposition that HPWS have a non-linear association with employees' overall job attitude, with a positive association apparent where HPWS are used intensively. These associations are robust to factors often cited as obstacles to HPWS implementation such as informality and family ownership.
M54|The Effect of Announced Downsizing on Workplace Performance: Evidence from a Retail Chain|We estimate the effect of downsizing announcement on workplace performance using data from a German bakery chain of 193 shops. Faced with intensified competition, the firm decided to sell or close down 57 of its worst performing shops. We identify the effect of downsizing from a plausibly exogenous variation in the timing of the sale or closure announcement in the individual shops. We find that the announcements of the shop being sold to a new owner and being closed down reduce sales by six and 21 percent, respectively. The negative effect of downsizing increases with the share of workers with a permanent contract, even though permanent workers faced a much lower unemployment risk. We relate our findings to the literatures on downsizing and psychological contract.
M54|Does employee ownership improve performance?|Employee ownership has attracted growing attention for its potential to improve economic outcomes for companies, workers, and the economy in general, and help reduce inequality. Over 100 studies across many countries indicate that employee ownership is generally linked to better productivity, pay, job stability, and firm survival—though the effects are dispersed and causation is difficult to firmly establish. Free-riding often appears to be overcome by worker co-monitoring and reciprocity. Financial risk is an important concern but is generally minimized by higher pay and job stability among employee owners.
M54|The Impact Of Expatriates’ Home Country Culture On Their Time To Proficiency: Empirical Evidence From The Indian Context|The time required by expatriates to become proficient in their new positions is important to both employers and employees. The existing literature on expatriate success is largely blind to what may be significant factors in the process of creating and sustaining job performance amongst the expatriate group: the effect of time and the effect of home country culture. In this study, we examined the impact of five organizational antecedents (role clarity, role discretion, supervisory support, coworkers support and perceived organizational culture dissimilarity) on corporate expatriates’ Time to Proficiency (TTP) in four home country cultures (HCC) samples. We specifically examine the direct impact of HCC on expatriates’ TTP and the moderating effects of HCC on TTP’s organizational antecedents. We used a self-administrated questionnaire on a sample of 224 expatriated managers in New Delhi, India, from four different home countries: France, Germany, Korea, and Scandinavia. To analyze the data, we used PLS Graph version 3.00, a component based Structural Equation Modeling technique. We tested the impact of HCC on TTP by examining the mean scores in TTP across HCC. Differences between path coefficients across the four HCC were analysed using path coefficients’ comparison. Our results show that 1) on the full sample, all five organizational antecedents have a significant impact on expatriates’ TTP, 2) TTP mean scores significantly vary across HCC and 3) the organizational antecedents of expatriate TTP and their relative importance vary across HCC. Our results are broadly consistent with the cultural studies: except for the Korean expatriates, the larger the cultural distance, the longer the TTP. Knowledge that HCC is a significant predictor of TTP suggests that organizations may need to reconsider their international staffing policies, especially in the fields of recruitment, staffing policies and support policies.
M54|The impact of leadership on workplace innovation in Thai and Vietnamese SMES|It is accepted that SMEs play an important role in economic growth in many Asian countries. For example, Vietnamese SMEs represent 97% of the number of businesses of the country; employ 77 percent of the workforce and account for 80% of the retail market. Similarly, Thai SMEs have significantly contributed to the Thai economy and account for 99% of all business establishment, nearly 75% of total employment, and nearly 40% of total GDP. Yet the question of whether small firms are more or less advantageous in their ability to be more innovative is still unclear. In Asia, SMEs have possessed a number of strengths that could contribute to their capacity to innovate. The study compares the perceptions toward leadership, work value ethics and workplace innovation in Thai and Vietnamese SMEs. A survey was completed by 696 respondents drawn from Thai and Vietnamese SMEs. The survey was comprised of the Design Leadership Questionnaire (DLQ), the Workplace Innovation Scale (WVE) and the Work Values Ethic (WVE) instrument. The Cronbach’s alpha values for each instrument were a - 0.911 (Design Leadership), a - 0.913 (Workplace Innovation), and a -0.798 (Work Value Ethic). T-test results found that there was a statistically significant difference in the mean scores of Leadership behaviour and all of its dimensions. Also, the significant differences are found in the mean scores of Workplace Innovation and all of its dimensions between Thai and Vietnamese respondents. However, there was no difference in the perception toward Work Values Ethic between the respondents of these two countries. The findings provide empirical evidence to advance our understanding of the impact of work values on leadership behaviour and workplace innovation and assists in developing Government policy to further SME leadership behaviour for Thai and Vietnamese managers to lead their subordinates towards innovation practices.
M54|The effect of human resource management system on employees’ commitment: The mediating role of the AMO model|Although the field of Human Resource Management has been extensively studied in the previous decades, still remaining theoretical and methodological questions are yet to be answered. These questions were found to evolve around how to conceptualize and operationalize HRM as well as the mechanism through which HRM affects performance. Consequently, numerous models were proposed to address these questions and among which the AMO model is considered the one that grasp the attention of many scholars. The current study, therefore, aims to address these questions by investigating the mediating effect of employees’ Ability (A), Motivation (M), and Opportunity to participate (O) model on the relationship between HRM system and employees’ affective commitment. An abstract level of HRM system was operationalized and hypothesized to have an indirect effect on employees’ affective commitment via the AMO model. A cross-sectional data was gathered through a questionnaire survey distributed to 800 employees working in the telecommunications sector in Kuwait. Structural equation modelling (SEM) via AMOS22 was used to build and test the hypothesized model. The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) has revealed that the abstract level HRM system is better conceptualized as having three categories namely, Skill enhancing HRM practices, Motivation enhancing HRM practices, and Empowerment enhancing HRM practices. Moreover, the results have indicated that HRM system significantly and positively affect employees’ ability, motivation, and opportunity to participate. More importantly, the results have supported that the relationship between HRM system and employees’ affective commitment is partially mediated by the AMO model. This study has contributed to the field of Human Resource Management by empirically justifying the critical role that employees’ ability, motivation, and opportunity to participate (AMO) have in increasing employees’ affective commitment. Accordingly, the current study is directing the attention of the telecommunications companies’ managers toward designing their HRM system in ways that increase the three dimensions of the AMO model, which inn turn could result in increased level of commitment.
M54|Motivational factors influencing teaching (FIT) as a career: An empirical study of the expatriate teachers in the Emirates|This study aimed to investigate the motivational factors that lead to choice of teaching career in expatriate teachers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). A UAE version of the Factors Influencing Teaching (FIT)-Choice scale (Watt & Richardson, 2007) was developed following the pre-testing strategies used by Dillman (2000), Heinz (2013) and Sharif (2014) and applied to identify the factors that most influenced the expatriates choose teaching as a career in the UAE. In a proposed and successfully tested model in this study, altruistic &/or intrinsic and extrinsic factors were found to be the mediator in the relationship between prior teaching & learning experience and social influence, and choice of a teaching career. Some gender differences were observed in case of four factors, ie, fall back career, work with children and adolescents, salary and prior teaching and learning experiences, and implications were discussed. For recruitment campaigns, strategies based on this study findings and understanding of the expatriate teachers’ motivations to adopt teaching as a career in the UAE were discussed. Due to the fact that the most recent study by LinkedIn among 380 million global members highlighted the UAE to be the most popular destination for expatriates surpassing Australia, Canada and Singapore (Maceda, 2015), the findings of this study can be considered to be of value to: (a) altruistically/intrinsically motivated professionals who are international-minded and seeking greener pastures in the UAE, and (b) the UAE policymakers who are working hard to fill the demand-supply gap drawing the attention of expatriates with the right skills and expertise. Finally, the research attempts in this study are seemingly unique in the sense that no previous study on teaching motivation had a combined focus on ‘in-service’, ‘expatriate teachers’ and UAE using FIT-Choice scale.
M54|Overcoming coordination failure using a mechanism based on gradualism and endogeneity|We examine three tools that can enhance coordination success in a repeated multiple-choice coordination game. Gradualism means that the game starts as an easy coordination problem and moves gradually to a more difficult one. The Endogenous Ascending mechanism implies that a gradual increase in the upper bound of coordination occurs only if coordination with the Pareto superior equilibrium in a stage game is attained. The Endogenous Descending mechanism requires that when the game’s participants fail to coordinate, the level of the next coordination game be adjusted such that the game becomes simpler. We show that gradualism may not always work, but in such instances, its effect can be reinforced by endogeneity. Our laboratory experiment provides evidence that a mechanism that combines three tools, herein termed the “Gradualism with Endogenous Ascending and Descending (GEAD)” mechanism, works well. We discuss how the GEAD mechanism can be applied to real-life situations that suffer from coordination failure. Copyright Economic Science Association 2016
M54|Estimating the impact of interacting with sales representatives on customer-specific revenue and churn behavior|Abstract This paper uses transaction-level data from a firm in the High Technology sector to compare the revenue garnered from customers who purchase via sales representatives to that garnered from customers who purchase online. The interaction mode may be correlated with the customer’s unobserved valuation for the service, and this potential endogeneity is addressed using an instrumental variable. Specifically, the data indicate whether the customer’s details were recorded in the company’s information systems following an initial contact, such as the download of a free version from the company’s website. The availability of such leads facilitated representatives’ ability to contact customers, generating exogenous variation in the probability of interacting with a representative. Instrumental variable estimates indicate that such interaction lowers the total revenue garnered from a paying customer during the sample period. The primary driver of this result is a churn effect: customers who purchased online displayed a longer overall relationship with the firm, and were more likely to renew an expiring subscription. An alternative explanation, according to which representatives lowered revenues by reassuring customers regarding the adequacy of cheaper versions of the product, is not supported by the data.
M54|Misconduct and Leader Behaviour in Contests – New Evidence from European Football|This paper provides an empirical investigation of severe misconducts in contests based on data from European football championships. We extend previous studies by differentiating between two types of misconducts both resulting in a yellow card, namely dissents with the referee and other misconducts. Confirming the existing literature, we find that teams with lower ability are more likely to commit sabotage, i.e. fouls, to reduce the opponent’s chances for success. Sabotage is also more likely when the outcome of the contests is still open. In addition, we find that dissents with the referee are significantly more likely in the case of an unfavourable score. We introduce a new perspective to the study of football data by distinguishing misconducts of team captains from those of other players. We find that captains engage more in sabotage during important matches and challenge referees’ decisions in direct reaction to sanctions awarded to teammates. In contrast to regular players, however, captains do not participate in the escalation of series of retaliative misconducts. Finally, our analyses indicate that all types of misconduct have a negative effect on the likelihood of success.
M54|Informational Frictions and Practice Variation: Evidence from Physicians in Training|Substantial practice variation across physicians for seemingly similar patients remains an unresolved puzzle. This paper studies physicians in training to explore the behavioral foundations of practice variation. A discontinuity in the formation of teams reveals a large contribution of relative experience in the size of practice variation. Among the same physician trainees, convergence towards a common practice differs by practice environment, with more convergence in specialist-driven services. Rich trainee characteristics and training histories, including the practice styles of prior supervising physicians, explain little if any variation. These findings suggest a major role for informational frictions in the origins of practice variation.
M54|Using Lagged Outcomes to Evaluate Bias in Value-Added Models|Value-added (VA) models measure agents' productivity based on the outcomes they produce. The utility of VA models for performance evaluation depends on the extent to which VA estimates are biased by selection. One common method of evaluating bias in VA is to test for balance in lagged values of the outcome. We show that such balance tests do not yield robust information about bias in value-added models using Monte Carlo simulations. Even unbiased VA estimates can be correlated with lagged outcomes. More generally, tests using lagged outcomes are uninformative about the degree of bias in misspecified VA models. The source of these results is that VA is itself estimated using historical data, leading to non-transparent correlations between VA and lagged outcomes.
M54|Corporate Governance and Human Resource Management|In seeking to compare the consequences of different corporate governance regimes around the world, an initial focus was on overall growth consequences. However, given that different types of national corporate governance regime appear to do better than others at specific times, and the great variations in national development within the main broad national corporate governance families, there has been a growing interest in the specific effects on the firm itself [Morgan et al., 2010], rather than seeing it as a transmission belt between relative owner and stakeholder rights on the one hand, and macro-economic outcomes on the other hand [La Porta et al., 1997, 1999, 2000]. At the simplest, such analysis has sought to interpose relative worker rights and social protection under the law as a variable that might dilute owner rights, diverting firms from a shareholder value maximisation agenda [Botero et al., 2004]. However, this goes little beyond simple hierarchical models that suggest that a single institutional feature underwriting property rights can explain everything of significance that goes on in the firm. So a growing body of applied work looks at the consequences of dominant corporate governance regimes for a key stakeholder grouping that has sunk human capital within the firm. Indeed, arguments are made for a re-evaluation of types of institutional arrangement and associated patterns of firm finance in relation to what might best explain particular sets of HRM and employment practices, and the direct effect on organisational performance, alongside how this might affect overall economic growth [Goergen et al., 2012, Gospel and Pendleton, 2003, Black et al., 2008, Pendleton, 2005]. There are many different dimensions to national corporate governance regimes, encompassing the legal, the political, the economic, and, indeed, embedded patterns of social behaviour; there is much debate within the literature as to which is the most important aspect of each.

M54|"Do ""boss effects"" exist in Japanese companies? Evidence from employee-supervisor matched panel data"|This paper investigates whether bosses can significantly enhance their subordinates' performance using an eight-wave panel dataset from a medium-sized Japanese firm comprising approximately 500 employees. The dataset is of all regular employees working in one manufacturing company including in both blue-collar and white-collar occupations of various division: Product, Sales, R&D, Planning, and Admin. About 40 supervisors were matched to their subordinates, and the evaluation outcomes were used to evaluate the workers' performance. The results showed that 'boss effects' were heterogeneous, displayed a one-year lag, and lasted for 2 years. It was also found that these effects remained significant, even when employees were assigned new/different supervisors.
M54|What Is to Be Done to Reduce the Effects of Emotionality and Conflicts on One’s Satisfaction at Workplace|The author of this article intends to bring into attention aspects of the correlation between the employees’ emotionality, stress and conflicts at workplace, as well as some suggestions to improve the effects of all this. Since IT development facilitates information analysis and increases decision-taking powers (thus creating new jobs and rendering useless other jobs), people are hired for their skills to perform a temporary role, caused by temporary or unexpected changes in the external world. For the new employees, coming into an organization means an effort to give the measure of their professional competence and to understand and adapt to the environment, to organizational culture, policies and procedures.
M54|The High Performance Working Practices in Romanian Companies – an Empirical Study|The modern companies are facing an economical background marked by an intense competition. Therefore, the struggle to enhance the performance’s level became a major task for the management that brings into discussion the importance of high performance working systems. There are various approaches on this issue in the specialized literature. The practices implied by such systems are tightly connected with the human resources management practices that the companies are using in order to ensure their success and development This paper aims to investigate the presence of these specific practices such as recruitment and career management, training, variable payment schemes, in companies situated in Constanta county, Romania. The analysis is based on the results of an empirical study and tries to establish the level of development of such practices in the studied companies and the potential correlation between them and the size of the analyzed companies.
M54|The High Performance Work Practices and Labour Productivity in Romanian Companies|Human resources management practices represent an intensely debated field. One particularissue concerns the influence that some of these practices generate over the performance level of acompany. Specialists have identified the concept of high performance work practices and discussedthe relation existing with the labour productivity level registered by the companies. An image of this relation in the case of the Romanian companies is presented based on the dataoffered by the European Company Survey and other specialized studies concerning the humanresources management practiced in local companies. This paper intends to analyse the specific results of an empirical study on the companies locatedin Constanta County. The specific issues considered are the impact of recruitment policies, trainingprograms, and reward system on the employees' productivity. Further research could narrow the field of analysis by considering the data for a specificeconomic sector in order to obtain results that are more accurate.
M54|Talent management in conditions of globalization as a challenge for modern enterprises|The aim of the article is a descriptive approach and present the growing importance of the - talent management concept in enterprises. The discussed issues were to explain the definition, the essence and objectives of talent management and visualize them on the background of the changes caused by globalization. The scientific studies on the subject of human resources management and globalization are used as a main sources of the article. The analysis of the literature and self-analysis of the opportunities and threats arising from the implementation of the concept of talent management are used as a research methods.. These considerations helped to justify the importance of this concept, as well as the legitimacy of its implementation in enterprise, since the chances exceeded the associated risks. In the first part of the article the definition of talent, and talent management are presented. Several different approaches within the meaning of the talent management process are cited, and also the most important of its components are listed. In the second part the essence and the main objectives of talent management are presented. The next part describes shortly an idea, and the essence of the globalization. The last part is devoted to the analysis of opportunities and risks associated with the talent management in the enterprise. It allows to illustrate of both of these factors and to show the value and legitimacy of the talent management concept. implementation.
M54|What Workers Want: Job Satisfaction In The U.S|By using the 2014 wave of the General Social Survey (GSS), this paper presents several determinants of job satisfaction. In a nutshell, U.S. workers prefer fair and respectful treatment by their employees, but not stress factors, such as working over-time or absence of home office arrangements. In terms of an employer friendly human resource strategy, especially the softer, or psychological determinants are rather cost-less to implement, but effective. In this analysis gender differences are rather weak.
M54|The effect of crisis on employees’ stress and dissatisfaction|This study, using a random sample of employees working in the private and public sectors, investigates the effect of crisis on job stress and dissatisfaction. Two stage cluster sampling is first used to collect primary data and relying on our sample and the collected variables we model for the first time a number of qualitative variables as features representing crisis (especially stress and dissatisfaction but also migration, reprioritizing and behavioral changes). Logistic regressions are used next presenting us with many useful elements concerning the function of stress, dissatisfaction and supportive elements and offering the corresponding probability of the effect on employees during the crisis. There are many new findings like, among others, the acceptance of salary reductions, number of working hours, economic migration, behavioral changes between management and employees, reprioritizing, and minimization of career opportunities.
M54|Comparative Analysis of Theory X, Theory Y, Theory Z, and Theory A for Managing People and Performance|Organizational Behaviour in the context of people management consists of several theories in which Theory X, Theory Y, Theory Z are the newly introduced. Theory X and Y were created and developed by Douglas McGregor in the 1960s. Theory X says that the average human being is lazy and self-centred, lacks ambition, dislikes change, and longs to be told what to do. Theory Y maintains that human beings are active rather than passive shapers of themselves and of their environment. They long to grow and assume responsibility. The best way to manage them, is to manage as little as possible. Theory Z of William Ouchi focused on increasing employee loyalty to the company by providing a job for life with a strong focus on the wellbeing of the employee, both on and off the job. The above three theories were developed based on research conducted in various production related organizations in 20th century. In 21st century, due to changes in business models, automation of production process, changes in technology & business environment, and changes in people perception, organizations are transforming into global entities - a new theory in organizational behaviour called Theory A (Theory of Accountability) has been developed. In this paper, we have made an attempt to compare these four human motivational theories. A model framework for implementation of theory A in an organization is also discussed. The paper also consider the impact of theory A on modern organizational performance.
M54|Theory A for Optimizing Human Productivity|Optimizing human productivity is a challenging process for the organizations and this process involves getting the best performance from employees within the organizational constraints. Even though the performance of human resources in organizations mainly depend on technology and external environment, ways of thinking individually and by teams, and humanistic orientation are important. Various models are used in developing a strategy to improve the people’s performance in organizations. Such for example, are theory X, theory Y and theory A. All these in common are based on presumptions about the human behaviour at work. Theory X and Y are opposing each other in predicting human nature. Theory X describes human nature as lazy, dislikes work and avoids, lacks responsibility, seeks security, lack of ambition and therefore should be forced, controlled, threatened or closely supervised to get work. Theory Y believes in the exercise of self-direction and self-control investing faith in individual potential, imagination, creativity and its application to work. Against this is theory A which focuses innate human potential, inherent urge for creativity, self-expression and contribution to the organization as motivators. As such, managers have to transform average employee to real performers using role models and self-exploration. This paper attempts to compare factors affecting organizational performance in all these aforesaid theories. It also details a set of model operational steps in introducing the theory of accountability. It also makes an SWOC analysis of theory A and its application to different types of organizations.
M54|The Balanced Scorecard and Beyond – Applying Theories of Performance Measurement, Employment and Rewards in Management Accounting Education|This study applies the prevailing scholarly theories of strategic management, employment decisions, cost accounting and share reward schemes to a panel of questions raised by Colin Drury (2012) in the case study of the fictitious company Integrated Technology Services (UK) Ltd., ITS (UK). The paper provides model answers which can be used when working with the case study at institutions of higher education. The merit of the work lies in three areas. First, it provides an overview of theories accepted by the academia that can be utilized for further research. Second, it contrasts pro and contra arguments. Thus it shows the limitations of the very theories when applied to scenarios inspired by practical problems. Third, it develops an innovative Balanced Scorecard for ITS (UK). The scorecard can be used as an example when working with Drury’s case study. But it is also suitable for real life situations of business entities faced with oppressive overheads and deteriorating net margins, building on highly skilled workforce and trying to preserve its differentiated profile.
M54|Time Series Analysis & Choices for General and Vocational Education in Arab Economies|Abstract: The current research focuses on the analysis of the determinants of educational choices in Arab countries using time series. This is to reveal the likely model of choice between general and vocational training in these economies. The selected theoretical framework considers that educational choices are globally influenced by education and macroeconomic variables. These include unemployment, GDP growth, and GDP per capita. The empirical analysis is based on regression, time series analysis and causality tests as inspired by the above theoretical framework. The findings show different outcomes for each of the Arab countries as such revealed decisions depend globally on the macroeconomics and performance of education in each country. These economies show that vocational education accounts differently for the macroeconomic variables while few accounts but also differently, for the schooling performance. Even with these differences that are related to signs of the effects, the monitoring of vocational education versus general training in Arab countries needs to be pursued as this allows for a more balanced educational and employment systems.
M54|Leadership style and Performance of Small and medium size enterprises in Cameroon|In Cameroon, SMEs contribute about 50% of the GDP and accounts for about 92% of businesses (INS, 2009) but about 80% of this SME’s created in Cameroon die before their 5th anniversary with one of the principal causes being the lack of corporate leadership. The main objectives of this research it to show the effects of leadership style on the performance of Cameroonian SMEs. The research follows a Hypothetico- deductive methodology through which primary data was collected through the Multi Factor Leadership Questionnaire which was administered on 114 workers form 38 SMEs in 05 major towns in the southwest region of Cameroon between the period of November 2015 to January 2016, the data was analysed using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Ordinary Least Square Multiple Regression(OLS), the SPSS version 20 was used for regression. The Principal results showed that the Transformational Leadership style exerted a positive and significant effect on the performance of SMEs in Cameroon, while the Transactional leadership style exerted a positive and significant impact on performance, this results are in coherence with the results obtained by Bass and Avolio, 2004 in their work entitled “Leadership and Performance beyond Expectations”. This research will therefore propose that in order to achieve organizational performance, managers should use the Transformational alongside with the Transactional leadership style since a combination of the two leadership style will permit the enterprise to attain performance beyond expectations.
M54|Job satisfaction in a municipality|Article is focused on investigation of job satisfaction at Municipality - City of Cheb. Research was conducted in February 2015 and includes 102 filled questionnaires. Questionnaire construction followed the Manual for Research of Job Satisfaction, published by Research Institute for Labour and Social Affairs in 2007. Hypotheses were verified by using of T-test and results were reviewed on 95% level of significance. Results show that total satisfaction significantly correlates with satisfaction with workload, flexible worktime, salary, and job security. Results also show that total satisfaction in males and females do not differ. This could be affected by different work positions in males and females.
M54|Human Capital Theory in Connection with the Private and Public Rate of Return|This paper introduces and describes the concept of human capital theory in connection with the private, social and public rate of return to education. The main objective of this study is to provide a general reference to human capital theory, its historical development, and its major methodological progresses. The paper presents basic concepts in connection with the private, social and public rates of return to tertiary education and defines needs of the current system through the SWOT analysis. In the end of the paper, there are some the theoretical thesis of well known scientists and it is compared with OECD statistics for other countries of the EU/OECD.
M54|When Does HRM 'Work' in Small British Enterprises?|Using nationally representative workplace data we find substantial use of high-performance work systems (HPWS) in Britain's small enterprises. We find empirical support for the proposition that HPWS have a non-linear association with employees' overall job attitude, with a positive association apparent where HPWS are used intensively. These associations are robust to factors often cited as obstacles to HPWS implementation such as informality and family ownership.
M54|The interplay between cognitive styles and organisational change|In the process of organisational change, there are two broad categories of employees’ reactions: those who are open to change and those who have a difficult time accepting change in general, including organisational change. These differences can be linked to differences in cognitive style. Our hypotheses were tested and confirmed in two companies in different industrial sectors in Serbia (N=265). The results showed that cognitive style was a strong single predictor of general attitudes towards organizational change. We have proposed a procedure for obtaining the index of dispositional readiness for change, which is of critical importance for planning different strategies of change management.
M54|Family-friendly workplace: An analysis of organizational effects in the transition economy|Several transition economies have witnessed a decreased state support for work-life balance, which called for a more active role and increased support offered by employers itself. Consequently, companies started implementing a wide array of family-friendly practices, however there was very little understanding about the main organisational effects of introducing family-friendly practices in the context of a transition economy. We propose and test a model of the relationship between family-friendly practices at the organisational level and their effects on the organisation. We offer a detailed investigation of the impact of eight groups of family-friendly practices on the perceived improvement in organisational outcomes. We analysed data over the span of five consecutive years, following companies in Slovenia that had systematically implemented family-friendly corporate practices. We analysed the perceived changes in 20 identified organisational outcomes. Using a linear regression model, we tested which practices would be most able to explain the perceived improvement. We found that the introduction of family-friendly practices had a positive perceived improvement in most (70 percent) of the identified areas, though none of them exhibited a significantly greater impact. Practices affecting workplace arrangements, information and communication and services for families were the groups of practices that had the greatest effect on the perceived positive effects for companies.
M54|Expectations of the customer contact staff towards the employer and the possibilities of meeting them in banking institutions|To retain personnel and motivate them appropriately, banks must comply with the terms and conditions of cooperation specified in employment contracts (such as working hours and where work will be done, compensation, and career development opportunities). Additionally, they must respect the requirements of an unwritten agreement binding the employer and the customer contact staff – a psychological contract. This article presents the results of a survey of this staff working in commercial banks operating in Poland. The survey has allowed identifying the professional needs and expectations of bank staff built into employment and psychological contracts, their hierarchy, as well as the banking staff’s opinions on the possibilities of the needs being in their workplace.
M54|Elderly workers in Japan: The need for a new deal|This discussion draws on current literature and data from five case studies in order to highlight main explicative factors of the peculiarities in terms of how elderly workers continue to be employed in Japan. It assesses the direction followed by public authorities and private organisations to keep elderly people at work in acceptable social and economic conditions. Evidence suggests that Japan has been successful in social and economic terms in the management of older workers. Historically, policy-makers in Japan tend to encourage the unemployed or inactive back into jobs or urge those in employment to delay retiring in order to avoid a long disconnection from the labour market. As a result, older employees tend to stay in the labour market in larger numbers and for longer time than in most European countries. However, this discussion demonstrates how such policy outcomes come with complications, even paradoxes. For example, it could be argued that mandatory retirement age at 60 combined with de facto acceptance of age discrimination, and large differential of treatment between regular and non-regular employment have largely contributed to explain the higher labour force participation rates for older workers. Overall, this discussion concludes that traditional policies and practices of Japanese human resource management in relation to employing older workers are now unsustainable under the impact of demographics, the socio-cultural context, the regulatory environment and the subsequent need for changes in the social security system. Overall, the argument is developed that, in relation to the employment of elderly workers in Japan, there is a need for a new deal.
M54|HRM responses to ageing societies in Germany and Japan: Contexts for comparison|This brief introductory discussion develops contexts within which to compare human resource management (HRM) responses to ageing societies in Japan and Germany. Here we define key concepts that occur throughout this Special Issue. While giving due attention to the historical and current contexts for emerging challenges to HRM policy-makers, practitioners and researchers posed by ageing societies in Germany and Japan, we propose that the relevant contexts for interpreting these challenges are essentially global, national, and regional in nature. In conclusion we present a brief overview of the contributions to this Management Review Special Issue.
M54|Social reciprocity as a critical success factor for small and mid-size enterprises: Work relationships as reflections of social exchange structures|This study considers work relationships as social exchange relationships in small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs). It focuses on, in addition to economic determinants of exchange, the preconditions for and mechanisms facilitating the development of social reciprocity. Especially in SMEs, the integration of employees and the coordination of work tasks are determined by collectively developed and shared social rules and norms. The perception of the enterprise as a “collective project” represents an important success factor for internal cooperation.
M54|Kritische Analyse von Employer Awards im Kontext des Employer Branding|Viele Unternehmen sehen sich bereits aktuell mit einem Fach- und Fuehrungskraeftemangel konfrontiert, der sich aufgrund der demografischen Entwicklung noch verschaerfen und weitere Engpaesse auf dem Arbeitsmarkt hervorrufen wird. Im Wettbewerb um die besten Talente gilt es daher umso mehr, als attraktiver Arbeitgeber von der potenziellen Zielgruppe wahrgenommen zu werden. In diesem Kontext sind sog. Employer Awards durch ihre grossflaechige mediale Verbreitung in den Fokus beider Arbeitsmarktparteien gerueckt. Die relevanten Akteure (potenzieller Bewerber bzw. Arbeitnehmer, Unternehmen als Arbeitgeber und Award-Anbieter) stehen vor komplexen Entscheidungsproblemen, die es zu untersuchen gilt. Ziel ist es, einen Loesungsansatz fuer die Entscheidungsprobleme der Award-Anbieter zu entwickeln. Aus der Perspektive des Award-Anbieters ist demnach zu untersuchen, wie ein Employer Award konzipiert sein sollte, um sowohl den Anspruechen der Arbeitgeber als auch den Anforderungen der potenziellen Arbeitnehmer gerecht zu werden. Zur Bewaeltigung dieser Herausforderung untersucht die vorliegende Arbeit die uebertragbarkeit empirischer Erkenntnisse der allgemeinen Award-Forschung aus dem Konsumguetermarketing, der Rating- und Rankingforschung sowie der Verarbeitung von Unschaerfe auf den Kontext der Employer Awards. Fuer den Umgang mit dem letztgenannten Problemfeld soll die modelltheoretische Umsetzung mit Hilfe von Methoden des Fuzzy-Control erfolgen.
M54|Personal und Diversitaet|Im berufsbegleitenden Studium „Interdisziplinaere Arbeitswissenschaft“ an der Leibniz Universitaet Hannover finden immer wieder Lehrveranstaltungen statt, die eine Bruecke zwischen dem Personalmanagement und dem Umgang mit Diversitaet in Organisationen schlagen. Die Beitraege zu diesem Band sind alle in diesem Kontext entstanden. Einige verknuepfen aktuelle Themen wie Employer Branding, Personalauswahl, Digitalisierung oder Erfolgsmessung mit Diversity Management. Andere beschaeftigen sich mit Boreout, Intuition, Arbeitszufriedenheit und Glueck, die bisher kaum mit Diversitaet in Verbindung gebracht wurden. Weitere Beitraege stellen Erfahrungen aus diversity-orientierten Trainingsmassnahmen vor oder greifen bislang unterschaetzte Diversity-Aspekte in Organisationen (Attraktivitaet, Introvertiertheit, UEberforderung…) auf. Kritische Blicke auf das Diversity Management aus einer queeren Perspektive und aus Sicht der interkulturellen Kompetenzentwicklung runden das Spektrum ab. Wer an der Schnittstelle von Personal und Diversitaet lehrt, forscht und arbeitet, kann aus den Artikeln interessante Anregungen fuer seine Taetigkeit ableiten.
M54|Antecedents of Opportunity at Work: Evidence from White-Collar Employees in Turkey|Opportunities provided to employees at work facilitate important organizational outcomes. Although opportunity at work is a significant topic of research, antecedents of opportunity are under-explored. The study aims to analyze the relationships between opportunity at work and possible antecedents of opportunity, i.e. different types of leadership and high performance work practices. For this purpose, factor analyses and hierarchical multiple regression analyses are carried out using data from 550 white-collar employees. The results of analyses show that opportunity at work is explained with reference to three factors: Promotion, development, and recognition opportunities. Transactional, transformational, and participative leadership create at least one type of opportunity for employees. High performance work practices (HPWPs) predict development and promotion opportunity for employees working in different industries. The study fills a gap in the literature by exploring antecedents of opportunity at work, with important implications for both research and practice. Managers are advised to adopt the characteristics of transactional, transformational, and participative leadership in order to create opportunities for their subordinates. Moreover, organizations are recommended to employ HPWPs to create opportunities for their employees.
M54|The Effect of Perceived Quality of Meal Service Provided by Organization on Organizational Commitment and Job Satisfaction|This study aims to determine the effects of perceived quality of meal service provided by organization on organizational commitment and job satisfaction. In order to analyse these relationships, data is gathered from public employees (n=204) whose lunch is organizationally provided in Bitlis Province. The results of the analysis (exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, correlation and regression analysis) demonstrate that taste and management factors of perceived quality of organizationally provided meal service affect employees’ emotional commitment positively and significantly. Besides, the dimensions of the perceived quality of meal service namely taste, hygiene and managerial are observed to have no relationship with continual and normative commitment. In addition, management factors related to the way meal is served affect employees’ job satisfaction positively and significantly. It is also found that the demographic variables such as gender age and education have no significant effects on examined variables. The results are discussed through comparing with the studies in the literature.
M54|Workplace Support and Diversity in the Market for Public School Teachers|Mentoring, and to a greater extent support from high-level administrators, has been shown to decrease worker turnover in general, but little is known about its differential impact on minority workers. Utilizing four waves of the Schools and Staffing Survey, we find that administrative support is most strongly associated with retention for minority teachers working in schools where minorities are underrepresented. This effect is pronounced for teachers new to the profession and those in schools with more students from low-income families or located in rural areas. The results indicate that workplace support is essential in maintaining or growing minority representation in relatively less-diverse organizations.
M54|Work – Life Balance Practices in Romanian Organisations – A Pilot Study Conducted on HR Professionals|Work – life balance is becoming a very debated subject in the Romanian business context, especially in multinationals and large Romanian companies. This paper’s main objective is to conduct a pilot study regarding work – life balance practices on human resource professionals from Romania. The study’s main purpose is to validate a research questionnaire in order to conduct a more significant research in the future. The questionnaire was applied on 52 HR specialists from different organisations and is structured on five sections: working hours, WLB practices, holiday and time off, flexible working and information about the employer and the job.
M54|Creativity, Innovation and the Perspectives of Management|This paper aims to analyse the perspectives of management starting from the current challenges and the future environmental conditions. Business models will facilitate the disappearance of the border between professional and personal life and companies will consider the improvement plan regarding the welfare of the employees and improvement measures for the monitoring, control and evaluation processes to help boost performance. Thus, the importance of the share capital and the interpersonal relationships will increase, and the human resources departments will redefine their priorities given the fact that it will be possible for the organizational network of tomorrow to be made up of employees belonging to a global network. Therefore, companies’ employees will take courses and programmes regarding the learning and development of the organizational culture, and the companies’ management will have permanent access to the evolution of employees. Actually, the main issue to be discussed here is represented by the ratio between corporate behaviour and non-corporate behaviour and the way in which the combination between these two will contribute to the increase of the organisational performance. Technology will facilitate the disappearance of the demarcation between “life at work” and “life outside of work”. Complex strategies that will identify the competence sets needed by the company will contribute to finding candidates suitable for company tasks. In the future, we can talk of people management specialists who will need increasingly more financial, analytical, marketing and risk management competences. Companies will seek to promote and support networks of people and “The Y Generation” (which considers individuals who desire “not to get lost in the crowd”, but, on the contrary, they wish to be noticed, to matter within the contexts where they evolve and, at the same time, to have a harmonious development), a fact which will require the use of technology as an interface between professional life, social life, personal life and spiritual life with an emphasis on options, the antimonopoly thinking and the process of encouraging the use of innovation within the management field.
