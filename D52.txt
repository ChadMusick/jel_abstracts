D52|A Macroprudential Theory of Foreign Reserve Accumulation|This paper proposes a theory of foreign reserves as macroprudential policy. We study an open-economy model of financial crises in which pecuniary externalities lead to overborrowing, and show that by accumulating international reserves, the government can achieve the constrained-efficient allocation. The optimal reserve accumulation policy leans against the wind and significantly reduces the exposure to financial crises. The theory is consistent with the joint dynamics of private and official capital flows, both over time and in the cross-section, and can quantitatively account for the recent upward trend in international reserves.
D52|On the impact of government-initiated CfD's in Australia's National Electricity Market|An intriguing characteristic of Australian energy market policymaking is the almost exclusive focus on spot market dynamics. The policy development cycle displays a virtual disregard for, and of, power system financial markets. The irony is that forward contract prices form the defining wholesale price input to end-user consumer tariffs. In this article, the impacts of a wide-ranging program of government-initiated CfDs on power system financial markets are analysed. Government-initiated CfDs are highly effective in correcting market failures, but they need to be used judiciously because – while they add to demand-side liquidity, they simultaneously extract supply-side forward contract market liquidity. Consequently, when used en-masse in loosely interconnected energy-only markets, CfDs have pro-competitive effects in the spot market by introducing ‘quasi-market participants’ but damage power system financial markets via the loss of liquidity. Power system modelling in this article demonstrates that a wide-ranging policy of government-initiated CfDs can produce shortages of ‘primary issuance’ hedge contact supply. This is far more than theory. In the South Australian region of the NEM, shortages of primary-issuance hedge contract supply have arisen through renewable entry and coal plant exit. Hedge shortages have had the effect of raising forward contract price premiums above efficient levels, needlessly forced the most price-elastic (Industrial/Manufacturing) customers into accepting unwanted spot market exposures, and unintentionally foreclosed non-integrated (2nd tier) energy retailers, all of which ultimately harms consumer welfare. CfDs have a targeted role to play in energy markets by correcting market failure; but broad-based market mechanisms are preferred.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D52|Lessons from Australia’s National Electricity Market 1998-2018: the strengths and weaknesses of the reform experience|Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM) commenced in 1998 and after two decades it is timely to reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of the reform experience. The centrepiece of NEM reforms was the energy-only wholesale market and accompanying forward markets, and for most of the past 20 years it has displayed consistent economic and technical performance. But missing policies relating to climate change, natural gas and plant exit has recently produced results that have tested political tolerances. The piecemeal and random interventions that are now following are likely to inflame rather than resolve matters, at least over the near term. Network policy failures in the mid-2000s led to sharp regulated tariff increases from 2007 onwards. These policy problems were largely cauterized by 2012 but regulatory timeframes and business inertia meant network tariffs didn’t stabilise until 2015. The retail market has been forced to deliver sharply rising prices, and in consequence the problem of rising prices has been conflated with price discrimination; a largely unhelpful development in an otherwise workably competitive market.
D52|Booms and Busts with dispersed information|This paper lays down a model where dispersed information generates booms and busts in economic activity. Boom-and-bust dynamics start when firms are initially over-optimistic about demand due to an aggregate noise shock in their signals. Consequently, they over-produce, which generates a boom. This however also depresses their mark-ups, which, to firms, signals low demand and overturns their expectations, generating a bust. This emphasizes a novel role for imperfect common knowledge: dispersed information makes firms ignorant about their competitors' actions, which makes them confuse high noise-driven supply with low fundamental demand. Boom-and-bust episodes are more dramatic when the aggregate noise shocks are more unlikely and when congestion effects are stronger.
D52|The Fiscal Multiplier|This paper studies the size of the fiscal multiplier in a model with incomplete markets and rigid prices and wages. Allowing for incomplete markets instead of complete markets---the prevalent assumption in the literature---comes with two advantages. First, the incomplete markets model delivers a realistic distribution of the marginal propensity to consume across the population, whereas all households counterfactually behave according to the permanent income hypothesis if markets are complete. Second, in our model the response of prices, output, consumption and employment is uniquely determined by fiscal policy for any monetary policy including the zero-lower bound (ZLB) as opposed to most of the previous literature, where an infinite number of equilibria exists, leaving the researcher to arbitrarily pick one. Our preliminary findings indicate that the impact multiplier is quite large between 2 and 3 depending on whether tax or deficit financing is used and increase to values above 3 in a liquidity trap.
D52|A Macroprudential Theory of Foreign Reserve Accumulation|This paper proposes a theory of foreign reserves as macroprudential policy. We study an open economy model of financial crises, in which pecuniary externalities lead to overborrowing, and show that by accumulating international reserves, the government can achieve the constrained-efficient allocation. The optimal reserve accumulation policy leans against the wind and significantly reduces the exposure to financial crises. The theory is consistent with the joint dynamics of private and official capital flows, both over time and in the cross section, and can quantitatively account for the recent upward trend in international reserves.
D52|Global Collateral and Capital Flows|Cross-border financial flows arise when (otherwise identical) countries differ in their abilities to use assets as collateral to back financial contracts. Financially integrated countries have access to the same set of financial instruments, and yet there is no price convergence of assets with identical payoffs, due to a gap in collateral values. Home (financially advanced) runs a current account deficit. Financial flows amplify asset price volatility in both countries, and gross flows driven by collateral differences collapse following bad news about fundamentals. Our results can explain financial flows among rich, similarly-developed countries, and why these flows increase volatility.
D52|Migration and Informal Insurance|Do new migration opportunities for rural households change the nature and extent of informal risk sharing? We experimentally document that randomly offering poor rural households subsidies to migrate leads to a 40% improvement in risk sharing in their villages. We explain this finding using a model of endogenous migration and risk sharing. When migration is risky, the network can facilitate migration by insuring that risk, which in turn crowds-in risk sharing when new migration opportunities arise. We estimate the model and find that welfare gains from migration subsidies are 42% larger, compared with the welfare gains without spillovers, once we account for the changes in risk sharing. Our analysis illustrates that (a) ignoring the spillover effects on the network gives an incomplete picture of the welfare effects of migration, and (b) informal risk sharing may be an essential determinant of the takeup of new income-generating technologies.
D52|Exchange rate volatility and cooperation in an incomplete markets' economy|In this paper, we contribute to the debate on whether exchange rate volatility is detrimental or not for welfare by characterizing optimal monetary policies in a two-country OLG model where markets are incomplete. The equilibrium nominal exchange rate is volatile as a result of shocks against which agents are not able to insure. In a non-cooperative environment, central banks have an incentive to devaluate the domestic currency by giving monetary transfers to domestic agents. However, such policies result in higher exchange rate volatility. We show that cooperation reduces exchange rate volatility as: (1) the negative spillover effects due to the expansionary monetary policies are internalized; (2) cooperative policies smooth the effects of shocks to fundamentals on the exchange rate. For standard parameter values, the gains from cooperation are not negligible. However, for cooperation to be Pareto improving countries should be weighted differently in the social welfare function. This could explain the lack of cooperation across countries, instead of the negligible gains as previously argued.

D52|The Politics of Flat Taxes|We study the political determination of flat tax systems using a workhorse macroeconomic model of inequality. There is significant variation in preferred tax policy across the wealth and income distribution. The majority voting outcome features (i) zero labor income taxation, (ii) simultaneous use of capital income and consumption taxation, and (iii) essentially zero transfers. This policy is supported by a coalition of low- and middle-wealth households. Zero labor income taxation is supported by households with below average wealth, while the middle-wealth households prefer to keep the transfer (and thus other tax rates) low. We also show that the outcome is sensitive to assumptions about the voting power of household groups, the degree of wealth and income mobility, and the forward-looking nature of votes.
D52|Mixed Signals: Investment Distortions with Adverse Selection|We study how adverse selection distorts equilibrium investment allocations in a Walrasian credit market with two-sided heterogeneity. Representative investor and partial equilibrium economies are special cases where investment allocations are distorted above perfect information allocations. By contrast, the general setting features a pecuniary externality that leads to trade and investment allocations below perfect information levels. The degree of heterogeneity between informed agents' type governs the direction of the distortion. Moreover, contracts that complete markets dampen the impact of pecuniary externalities and change equilibrium distortions. Implications for empirical design in credit market studies and financial stability are discussed.
D52|International Welfare Spillovers of National Pension Schemes|We employ a two-country overlapping-generations model to explore the international dimension of household portfolio choices induced by the asymmetric provision of government-run pensions. We study the resulting patterns of risk-sharing and the corresponding welfare effects on both home and foreign agents. Introducing the de?fined benefi?ts pay-as-you-go system at home increases the welfare of all other agents at the expense of the home workers and improves the degree of intergenerational risk sharing abroad. Conversely, a defi?ned contributions system leads to welfare losses of both home cohorts accompanied by gains abroad, but does increase the extent of intergenerational risk sharing at home.
D52|Business Cycles and Production Networks|Where do business cycles originate? The traditional view is that a business cycle is the result of shocks correlated across sectors. This view is complemented by a recently emerging literature showing that idiosyncratic shocks to large or highly interconnected sectors contribute to aggregate variation. This paper addresses the relative empirical importance of these two channels of business cycle variation. Results indicate that up to one-third of the business cycle is driven by idiosyncratic productivity variation together with network amplifications.
D52|Gains from Policy Cooperation in Capital Controls and Financial Market Incompleteness|We examine how the degree of financial market incompleteness affects welfare gains from policy cooperation in capital controls. When financial markets are incomplete, international risk sharing is disturbed. However, the optimal global policy significantly reverses the welfare deterioration due to inefficient risk-sharing. We find that when financial markets are more incomplete, the welfare gap between the optimal global policy and the Nash equilibrium increases, and the welfare gains from policy cooperation in capital controls then become larger.
D52|Dropping the Cass Trick and Extending Cass' Theorem to Asymmetric Information|"In a celebrated 1984 paper, David Cass provided an existence theorem for financial equilibria in incomplete markets with exogenous yields. The theorem showed that, when agents had symmetric information and ordered preferences, equilibria existed on purely financial markets, supported by any collection of state prices. This theorem built on the so-calles ""Cass trick"", along which one agent had an Arrow-Debreu budget set, with one single constraint, while the other agents were constrained à la Radner (1972), that is, in every state of nature. The current paper extends Cass' theorem to economies with asymmetric information and non-ordered preferences. It refines De Boisdeffre (2007), which characterized the existence of equilibria with asymmetric information by the no-arbitrage condition on purely financial markets. The paper defines no arbitrage prices with asymmetric information. It shows that any collection of state prices, in the agents' commonly expected states, supports an equilibrium. This result is proved without using the Cass trick, in the sense that budget sets are defined symmetrically across all agents. Thus, the paper suggests, in the symmetric information case, an alternative proof to Cass'"
D52|Refinements to the generic existence of equilibrium in incomplete markets|The paper demonstrates the generic existence of general equilibria in incomplete markets with well behaved price properties. The economy has two periods and an ex ante uncertainty over the state of nature to be revealed at the second period. Securities pay off in cash or commodities at the second period, conditionally on the state of nature to be revealed. They permit financial transfers across periods and states, which are insufficient to span all state contingent claims to value, whatever the spot price to prevail. Under smooth preference and the standard Radner (1972) perfect foresight assumptions, equilibrium is shown to exist, except for a closed set of measure zero of endowments and securities. The proof provides additional arguments and insights to Duffie-Shafer's (1985) on the same subject and refines it in two ways. First, equilibrium in shown to exist generically for any norm values of commodity prices on any spot market, and for any collection of state prices. Second, assets need no longer pay off in commodities, but may in any mix of cash and goods

D52|Recourse Loans and Ponzi Schemes|Non-recourse borrowing leaves no room for Ponzi schemes, as shown by Araujo, Pascoa and Torres-Martinez (2002). This is not the case with recourse loans, for which, in the event of default and on top of the foreclosure of the collateral, the debtor's estate can be seized or (in a way common in the GE literature) the debtor can suffer utility penalties. We focus on the latter and show that infinite horizon equilibrium with recourse exists in some interesting cases: (i) if utility penalties are low enough and the collateral does not yield utility (for example, when it is a productive asset or a security) or (ii) for a nominal promise backed by real collateral (such as mortgages, whose payments are not tied to a commodity price index).
D52|No-trade and Refined Equilibria for Secured Loans in Infinite Horizon|When loans are secured but subject to utility penalties on default, notrade equilibria induced by unduly low repayment beliefs can be trivially found for nite horizon economies but not for in nite horizon ones. We illustrate this fact and propose also a re nement of equilibrium that gets rid of spurious no-trade outcomes when they do occur. Known existence results pass this re nement criterion.
D52|Designing Robust Monetary Policy Using Prediction Pools|How should a forward-looking policy maker conduct monetary policy when she has a finite set of models at her disposal, none of which are believed to be the true data generating process? In our approach, the policy makerfirst assigns weights to models based on relative forecasting performance rather than in-sample fit, consistent with her forward-looking objective. These weights are then used to solve a policy design prob-lem that selects the optimized Taylor-type interest-rate rule that is robust to model uncertainty across a set of well-established DSGE models with and without financial frictions. We find that the choice of weights has a significant impact on the robust optimized rule which is more inertial and aggressive than either the non-robust single model counterparts or the optimal robust rule based on backward-looking weights asin the common alternative Bayesian Model Averaging. Importantly, we show that a price-level rule has excellent welfare and robustness properties, and therefore should be viewed as a key instrument for policy makers facing uncertainty over the nature offinancial frictions.
D52|Competitive Equilibria in Matching Models with Financial Constraints|We consider the one-to-one two-sided matching with contracts model in which buyers face financial constraints. In this model there is a stable outcome, but not necessarily a competitive equilibrium as defined in the standard way. We propose a new equilibrium notion, quantity-constrained competitive equilibrium (QCCE) that allows buyers to form rational expectations on the lack of supply when their financial constraints are binding. We show the existence of QCCEs and establish the equivalence among QCCE outcomes, stable outcomes, and core outcomes. We also analyze the existence of QCCEs with uniform prices, the lattice property of QCCEs, and the rural hospital theorem of QCCEs. We finally examine the relation between models with financial constraints and models with price controls.
D52|Global Collateral and Capital Flows|Cross-border financial flows arise when (otherwise identical) countries differ in their abilities to use assets as collateral to back financial contracts. Financially integrated countries have access to the same set of financial instruments, and yet there is no price convergence of assets with identical payoffs, due to a gap in collateral values. Home (financially advanced) runs a current account deficit. Financial flows amplify asset price volatility in both countries, and gross flows driven by collateral differences collapse following bad news about fundamentals. Our results can explain financial flows among rich, similarly-developed countries, and why these flows increase volatility.

Regelungen zur Steuerung der Vermietungstätigkeit wie Zweckentfremdungsverbote sollen dem entgegenwirken. In Nordrhein-Westfalen lässt sich jedoch kein empirischer Beleg für umfangreichen Wohnraumentzug durch Airbnb feststellen.
D52|Optimists and pessimists in (in)complete markets|We study the effects of market incompleteness on speculation, investor survival, and asset pricing moments, when investors disagree about the likelihood of jumps and have recursive preferences. We consider two models. In a model with jumps in aggregate consumption, incompleteness barely matters, since the consumption claim resembles an insurance product against jump risk and effectively reproduces approximate spanning. In a long-run risk model with jumps in the long-run growth rate, market incompleteness affects speculation, and investor survival. Jump and diffusive risks are more balanced regarding their importance and, therefore, the consumption claim cannot reproduce approximate spanning.
D52|Efficiency Units of Labor: Life-Cycle Profiles Estimates from the CPS 1987-2017|This note provides a set of estimates of the efficiency units profiles that workers supply over the life-cycle in the U.S. labor market. These are helpful for the calibration of OLG models. I rely on data from the March CPS in the 1987-2017 period, and use both non-parametric and parametric estimation methods. Irrespective of the methodology used to obtain the profiles, I find that they differ in essential features from the ones that are typically used in applied work. In terms of the quantitative answers obtained from a life-cycle OLG model with idiosyncratic income shocks and incomplete markets, the discrepancies in the efficiency units profiles are found to be sizable. In terms of consumption equivalent variation, households' welfare decreases by up to 5 percentage points when moving from the standard profiles to the ones estimated here. Quantitatively, the specific profile used have also a substantial impact on the variables that are typically analyzed with this class of models, such as the saving behavior over the life-cycle and the concentration of wealth.

D52|Optimal Progressive Income Taxation in a Bewley-Grossman Framework|We study optimal income tax progressivity in an environment where individuals are exposed to idiosyncratic income and health risks over the lifecycle. Our results, based on a calibration for the US economy, indicate that the presence of health risk combined with incomplete insurance markets amplies the social insurance role of progressive income taxes. The government is required to set higher optimal levels of tax progressivity in order to provide more social insurance for unhealthy low income individuals who have limited access to health insurance. The optimal progressive income tax system includes a tax break for income below $36,400 and high marginal tax rates of over 50 percent for income above $200,000: The tax progressivity (Suits) index-a Gini coeffcient for income tax contributions by income-of the optimal tax system is around 0.53, compared to 0.17 in the benchmark tax system. Yet, the optimal tax system in our model is more progressive than the optimal tax systems in models abstracting from health risk (e.g., Conesa and Krueger (2006) and Heathcote, Storesletten and Violante (2017)). Importantly, the optimal level of tax progressivity is strongly affected by the design of the health insurance system. When health expenditure risk is reduced or removed from the model, the optimal tax system becomes less progressive and thus more similar to the optimal progressivity levels reported in the previous literature.
D52|Prices and Inflation when Government Bonds are Net Wealth|In this paper I show that models in which government bonds are net wealth - that is, their value exceeds that of tax liabilities (Barro, 1974) - offer a new perspective on several issues in monetary economics. First and foremost, prices and inflation are jointly and uniquely determined by fiscal and monetary policy. In contrast to the conventional view, the long-run inflation rate here is, in the absence of output growth, and even when monetary policy operates an interest rate rule with a different inflation target, equal to the growth rate of nominal fiscal variables, which are controlled by fiscal policy. This novel theory also offers a different perspective on the fiscal and monetary transmission mechanism, policies at the zero-lower bound, U.S. inflation history, recent attempts to stimulate inflation in the Euro area and several puzzles which arise in New Keyensian models during a liquidity trap. To derive my findings, I first use a reduced form approach in which households derive utility from holding bonds. I prove how and for which policy rules the price level is globally determinate, then showing that the reduced form results carry over to a Bewley-Imrohoroglu-Huggett-Aiyagari heterogenous agent incomplete market model.
D52|Quantitative Easing, Collateral Constraints, and Financial Spillovers|The steady application of Quantitative Easing (QE) has been followed by big and non-monotonic effects on international asset prices and international capital flows. These are difficult to explain in conventional models, but arise naturally in a model with collateral. This paper develops a general-equilibrium framework to explore QE’s international transmission involving an advanced economy (AE) and an emerging market economy (EM) whose assets have less collateral capacity. Capital flows arise as a result of international sharing of scarce collateral. The crucial insight is that private AE agents adjust their portfolios in different ways in response to QE, conditional on whether they are (i) fully leveraged, (ii) partially leveraged or (iii) unleveraged. These portfolio shifts of international assets can diminish or even reverse the effectiveness of ever-larger QE interventions on asset prices. The model provides a simultaneous interpretation of several important stylized facts associated with QE.
D52|Recursive Equilibrium in Krusell and Smith (1998)|This paper combines the tools developed in two important and independent literatures - one on large economies started with Aumann (1964) and the other on dynamically incomplete markets, notably Duffie et al (1994)- to study Krusell and Smith’s incomplete markets economy with both idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks. It establishes the existence of sequential competitive equilibrium, generalized recursive equilibrium, recursive equilibrium with an extended-state space, and characterizes several important properties of the equilibrium variables. The equilibrium process admits an ergodic measure, which enables the application of the ergodic theorem for the simulation and calibration of the model. Without aggregate shocks, the existence and some characterization results carry over to economies with only idiosyncratic shocks such as Huggett (1997)’s economy. However, the existence of recursive equilibrium with the natural minimal state space in Krusell and Smith's economy remains elusive, as in finite-agent incomplete markets economies.
D52|International risk sharing in overlapping generations models|We propose a way to address the Backus–Smith puzzle that, instead of relying on extreme parameter values or complex modeling assumptions, simply switches the framework from infinitely lived agents to overlapping generations. Young agents face nondiversifiable wage risk that leads to a low degree of risk sharing within each country. Subsequently, international price movements are not sufficient to achieve the high consumption-real exchange rate correlation produced in standard infinitely lived agent DSGE models.
D52|Reducing Medical Spending of the Publicly Insured: The Case for a Cash-Out Option|Individuals' medical spending has both necessary and discretionary components which are not, however, separately observable. This paper studies ways to improve upon existing public health insurance policies by using a framework where both the discretionary and necessary components of medical spending are explicitly modeled. First, using a simple theoretical framework the paper shows that the key to reducing discretionary medical spending is to introduce a trade-off between non-medical and medical consumption. Next, using a rich quantitative life-cycle model the paper shows that this trade-off can be successfully implemented by introducing an option to substitute public health insurance with cash transfers.
D52|Equilibrium Prices of the Market Portfolio in the CAPM with Incomplete Financial Markets|In the Capital Asset Pricing Model, we consider how introducing new assets will affect the prices of the existing ones. We prove that introducing new assets into financial markets increases the relative price of the market portfolio with respect to the risk-free bond if the elasticity of the marginal rates of substitution of the mean for standard deviation with respect to the latter is greater than one for every consumer; the relative price of the market portfolio decreases if the elasticity is less than one; and the relative price is left unchanged if the elasticity is equal to one.
D52|Public insurance of married versus single households in the US: trends and welfare consequences|Using the March Current Population Survey, I show that over the last two decades, married households in the United States received increasingly more public insurance against labor income risk, whereas the opposite was true for single households. To evaluate the welfare consequences of this trend, I perform a quantitative analysis. As a novel contribution, I expand the standard incomplete markets model à la Aiyagari (1994) to include two groups of households: married and single. The model allows for changes in the marital status of households and accounts for transition dynamics between steady states. I show that the divergent trends in public insurance have a significant detrimental effect on the welfare of both married and single households.
D52|How Much Do Households Really Know About Their Future Income?|We develop a consumption-savings model that distinguishes households’ perceived income uncertainty from income uncertainty as measured by an econometrician. Households receive signals on their future disposable income that can drive a gap between the two uncertainties. With an uncertainty gap that is consistent with direct estimates stemming from subjective income expectations, the model jointly explains three consumption inequality and insurance measures in US micro data that are not captured without the difference: (i) the cross-sectional variance of households’ consumption, (ii) the covariance of current consumption and income growth and (iii) the income-conditional mean of household consumption.
D52|Extending the Cass Trick|"In a celebrated 1984 paper, David Cass provided an existence theorem for financial equilibria in incomplete markets with exogenous yields. The theorem showed that, when agents had symmetric information and ordered preferences, equilibria existed on purely financial markets and could be supported by any collection of state prices. This theorem built on the so-called ""Cass trick"", along which one agent in the economy had an Arrow-Debreu budget set, with one single budget constraint, while all other agents were constrained à la Radner (1972), that is, in every state of nature, given the financial transfers that the asset market permitted. The current paper extends Cass' theorem and the Cass trick to asymmetric information and non-ordered preferences. It shows that any collection of individual state prices under asymmetric information supports an equilibrium, provided one agent had full information. If the latter condition fails, the Cass trick cannot apply. A weaker result holds, namely equilibrium exists under the no-arbitrage condition"
D52|Dropping Rational Expectations|"We consider a pure exchange economy, where agents, typically asymmetrically informed, exchange securities, on financial markets and commodities, on spot markets. Consumers have private characteristics, anticipations and beliefs, and no model to forecast prices. Rational expectation and bounded rationality assumptions are dropped. We show that agents face an incompressible uncertainty, represented by a so-called ""minimum uncertainty set"". This uncertainty typically adds to the exogenous one, on the state of nature, and 'endogenous uncertainty' over future spot prices. At equilibrium, all agents expect the 'true' price on every spot market as a possible outcome, and elect optimal strategies, ex ante, which clear on all markets, ex post. We show this sequential equilibrium exists whenever agents' prior anticipations embed the minimum uncertainty set. This outcome differs from the standard generic existence results of Hart (1975), Radner (1979), or Duffie-Shaffer (1985), among others, based on the rational expectations of prices"
D52|Circumventing the Hart Puzzle|The paper demonstrates the existence of sequential equilibria in a pure exchange economy, where asymmetrically informed agents exchange consumption goods and securities of all kinds, on incomplete markets. Standard models rely on Radner's (1972, 1979) rational expectation assumptions, along which agents know the maps between the information signals, the states of nature and the equilibrium prices. As shown by Hart (1975), equilibrium may then fail to exist, even when agents have symmetric information and smooth preferences. In that setting, Duffie-Shafer (1985) shows from differential topology arguments, that interior equilibria exist generically. The current paper proceeds differently. It drops rational expectations to allow for an infinitesimal uncertainty over future spot prices. This device permits to circumvent Hart's 1975 problem, without using differential topology. Then, the paper shows that a generic condition on payoffs and forecasts guarantees the exostence of equilibria. It is consistent with non-transitive preferences, non-interior consumptions, asymmetric information and normalized spot prices at equilibrim. It also serves to prove existence in a more general model, which drops Radner's rational expectations
D52|Inequality and Aggregate Demand|We explore the quantitative effects of transitory and persistent increases in income inequality on equilibrium interest rates and output. Our starting point is a Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari model featuring rich heterogeneity and earnings dynamics as well as downward nominal wage rigidities. A temporary rise in inequality, if not accommodated by monetary policy, has an immediate effect on output that can be quantified using the empirical covariance between income and marginal propensities to consume. A permanent rise in inequality can lead to a permanent Keynesian recession, which is not fully offset by monetary policy due to a lower bound on interest rates. We show that the magnitude of the real interest rate fall and the severity of the steady-state slump can be approximated by simple formulas involving quantifiable elasticities and shares, together with two parameters that summarize the effect of idiosyncratic uncertainty and real interest rates on aggregate savings. For plausible parametrizations the rise in inequality can push the economy into a liquidity trap and create a deep recession. Capital investment and deficit-financed fiscal policy mitigate the fall in real interest rates and the severity of the slump.
D52|Asymmetric Business-Cycle Risk and Social Insurance|This paper studies the business-cycle variation in higher-order (labor) income risk-that is, risks that are captured by moments higher than the variance of income changes. We examine the extent to which such risks can be smoothed within households or with government social insurance and tax policies. We use panel data from three countries that differ in many aspects relevant for our analysis: the United States, Germany, and Sweden. Our analysis has three main results. First, analyzing individual gross labor income, we document that skewness is procyclical and dispersion (variance) is flat and acyclical in Germany and Sweden, as was previously documented for the United States. The same patterns hold true for groups defined by education, gender, occupation, and public- versus private-sector jobs. Second, within-household smoothing appears to be not effective at mitigating business cycle fluctuations in skewness, and household- level income displays cyclical patterns that are very similar to individual income. Third, government tax and transfer programs blunt some of the largest declines in incomes, reducing procyclical fluctuations in skewness. The resulting welfare gain-through the lens of a structural model-amounts to 1.3% in consumption- equivalent terms for Sweden (for which we are able to perform this calculation). However, the remaining risk (in household disposable income) is still substantial: households are willing to pay 4.6% of their consumption to completely eliminate procyclical fluctuations in skewness.
D52|Credit and Bankruptcy in a Temporary Equilibrium Model|A temporary general equilibrium in bankruptcy model with finite periods was analyzed in this paper, which (i) every consumer only issues one type of bond to financial market in each period; (ii) the bank has right to circulate currency, and never face bankruptcy. The model was an extesion of the Bankruptcy model in Eichberger(1989), based on the assumptions that the occurrence of moral hazard is prevented by the credit scheme law, which depends on the current information and forecast function. The main result of this paper enables as to develop the liquidation rule without penalties. This rule can also be used to interpret liquidating distribution in Bankruptcy Act. In addition, the bankruptcy mechanism plays an effective role even if the chain-reaction bankruptcy occurred. Moreover, we can prove that the economy will never collapse in an overlapping model which has some newborn in every period.
D52|Intertemporal equilibrium with heterogeneous agents, endogenous dividends and collateral constraints|We build a dynamic general equilibrium model with heterogeneous producers and financial frictions (collateral constraints and incompleteness). First, we provide a characterization to check whether a sequence is an equilibrium or not. Second, we study the effects of financial imperfections on output and land prices. Third, we develop a theory of valuation of land by introducing the notion of endogenous land dividends (or yields) and different concepts of land-price bubbles. Some examples of bubbles are provided in economies with and without short-sales.
D52|Inequality and asset fire sales|It is widely acknowledged that fire sales were a critical factor in inducing and exacerbating the financial crises of 2007--2008. The leverage of financial intermediaries, which is defined as the ratio of total assets to capital, is a key factor in causing fire sales. Why do financial intermediaries expand their balance sheets despite subsequently having to sell their assets at discounted prices? To examine this question, we incorporate financial intermediaries into a three-period incomplete market economy model, in which households face countercyclical and uninsured idiosyncratic income shocks. We demonstrate that countercyclical income inequality and market incompleteness result in leveraged investment and subsequent asset fire sales by financial intermediaries in equilibrium. The first contribution of this paper is that we demonstrate that the mechanism between asset prices and leverages could successfully solve the famed asset-pricing puzzles. The second contribution is that we analyze the impact of financial regulation on the welfare of ex ante homogeneous households.
D52|Optimal Taxation with Private Insurance|We derive a fully nonlinear optimal income tax schedule in the presence of private insurance. As in the standard taxation literature without private insurance (e.g., Saez (2001)), the optimal tax formula can still be expressed in terms of sufficient statistics. With private insurance, however, the formula involves additional terms that reflect how the private market interacts with public insurance. For example, in our benchmark model-Huggett (1993)-the optimal tax formula should also consider pecuniary externalities as well as changes in the asset holdings of households. According to our analysis, the difference in optimal tax rates (with and without a private insurance market) can be as large as 11 percentage points.
D52|Equilibrium with Differential Information and Exogenous Beliefs: A Basic Model of Full Existence|"We consider a pure exchange economy, where agents, typically asymmetrically informed, exchange securities, on financial markets, and commodities, on spot markets. Consumers have private characteristics, anticipations and beliefs, and no model to forecast prices. They are dispensed with rational expectation and bounded rationality assumptions, such as Radner's (1972, 1979), Kurz' (1994) or Koutsougeras-Yannelis' (1999). We show that they face an incompressible uncertainty, represented by a so-called ""minimum uncertainty set"". This uncertainty typically adds to the exogenous one, on the state of nature, an 'endogenous uncertainty' over future spot prices. At equilibrium, all agents expect the 'true' price on every spot market as a possible outcome, and elect optimal strategies, ex ante, which clear on all markets, ex post. We show this sequential equilibrium exists whenever agents' prior anticipations embed the minimum uncertainty set. This outcome differs from the standard generic existence results of Hart (1975), Radner (1979), and Duffie-Shaffer (1985), among others, based on the rational expectations of prices."
D52|Implications for Aggregate Inflation of Sectoral Asymmetries: An Empirical Implication|Following the theoretical identification scheme that relies on the two-sector DSGE macro model derived in a study by Koskinen and Vilmunen (2017), the focus of this study is to empirically estimate and identify the possibly divergent sector specific parameters within an economy. We analyse and compare two different sectors of the Finnish economy, manufacturing industry and building industry,each in turn to the rest of the economy during 2000:Q1- 2015Q2. It is hence assumed, that the parameters of interest within a sector reflect the divergent preferences of economic agents to the goods produced at different sectors. The relative price movements and adjustment asymmetries stemming from these kind of divergences has a central role in allocational efficiency and welfare of the economy. Then this diversity has important implications to any economic policy practised as these divergent preferences could give rise to asymmetric reaction to any shock that hits the economy. As a result, there is evidence that the economy could be characterised to be compounded of divergent groups of goods. These groups, then, has group specific parameters reflecting different behaviour of the agents and their preferences to the goods produced.
D52|Annuity Markets and Capital Accumulation|We examine how the absence of annuities in financial markets affects capital accumulation in a two-period overlapping generations model. Our findings indicate that the effect on capital is ambiguous in general equilibrium, because there are two competing mechanisms at work. On the one hand, the absence of annuities increases the price of old-age consumption relative to the price of early-life consumption. This induces a substitution effect that reduces saving and capital, and an income effect that has the opposite effect as households want to consume less when young, causing them to save more. On the other hand, accidental bequests originate from the assets of the deceased under missing annuity markets. The bequest received in early life always has a positive income effect on saving, but the bequest received in old age, conditional on survival, is effectively a partial annuity with both substitution and income effects. We find that when the desire to smooth consumption is high, the income effects dominate, so the capital stock always increases when annuity markets are missing. However, when the desire to smooth consumption is low, the substitution effects dominate, and the capital stock decreases with missing annuity markets.
D52|Optimal Exclusion|In a canonical model of borrowing and lending, an exclusion technology that features full exclusion for a deterministic number of periods following default maximizes stationary equilibrium welfare. This exclusion policy maximizes the stationary volume of mutually beneficial lending transactions. It also maximizes the average welfare of the excluded. The optimal length of exclusion depends on fundamentals such as borrower patience and the direct cost of default. It also depends on incentives to default for strategic rather than exogenous reasons.
D52|The Lifetime Costs of Bad Health|How costly is bad health and what makes good health valuable over the life cycle? Answering these questions requires carefully modeling health dynamics, including in the longer run, and a rich model of how health can affect households. We estimate a health shock process that allows for both history-dependence and ex-ante heterogeneity, and we introduce it in a rich life-cycle model that we estimate and that matches three sets of important facts: (i) The dynamics of health; (ii) The quantitative impact of bad health on labor earnings, medical spending, and life expectancy; (iii) The large disparity in accumulated wealth between the healthy and the unhealthy at retirement. We find that the costs of bad health among the working age population are steeply increasing in the number of years spent unhealthy and that the largest component of these costs is the loss in labor earnings. In contrast, the effect of out-of-pocket medical spending is relatively small. To also evaluate the non-pecuniary effects of health, we evaluate the willingness to pay to be healthy and we find that the most valuable aspect of being healthy is a longer life expectancy
D52|The role of initial shares in multi-period production economies with incomplete markets|This paper focuses on a single firm with constant returns to scale in a multi-period setting with incomplete markets and a single good per state. Profits vanish whenever the firm maximizes profits with respect to a given price system. The paper addresses the following question: Shall the firm always act as a price taker? In the case of a partnership, there are no initial shares and no profits accrue from production. A corporation, however, has initial shareholders and can sell its output at any price. An example shows that this additional freedom can improve efficiency and welfare. This results from the fact that a wedge between price and cost can mitigate the inefficiency caused by the consumers who disregard the impact of their initial portfolio decisions on subsequent markets.
D52|Labor Market Institutions and the Cost of Recessions|This paper studies the effect of two labor market institutions, unemployment insurance (UI) and job search assistance (JSA), on the output cost and welfare cost of recessions. The paper develops a tractable incomplete-market model with search unemployment, skill depreciation during unemployment, and idiosyncratic as well as aggregate labor market risk. The theoretical analysis shows that an increase in JSA and a reduction in UI reduce the output cost of recessions by making the labor market more fluid along the job finding margin and thus making the economy more resilient to macroeconomic shocks. In contrast, the effect of JSA and UI on the welfare cost of recessions is in general ambiguous. The paper also provides a quantitative application to the German labor market reforms of 2003-2005, the so-called Hartz reforms, which improved JSA (Hartz III reform) and reduced UI (Hartz IV reform). According to the baseline calibration, the two labor market reforms led to a substantial reduction in the output cost of recessions and a more moderate reduction in the welfare cost of recessions in Germany.
D52|A model of scholarly publishing with hybrid academic journals|Abstract In April 2013, all of the major academic publishing houses moved thousands of journal titles to an original hybrid model, under which authors of accepted papers can choose between an expensive open access (OA) track and the traditional track available only to subscribers. This paper argues that authors might now use a publication strategy as a quality signaling device. The imperfect information game between authors and readers presents several types of Perfect Bayesian Equilibria, including a separating equilibrium in which only authors of high-quality papers are driven toward the open access track. The publishing house should choose an open-access publication fee that supports the emergence of the highest return equilibrium. Journal structures will evolve over time according to the journals’ accessibility and quality profiles.
D52|Sequential equilibrium without rational expectations of prices: A theorem of full existence|We consider a pure exchange economy, where agents, typically asymmetrically informed, exchange commodities, on spot markets, and securities of all kinds, on incomplete financial markets with no model of how future prices are determined. They have private characteristics, anticipations and beliefs. We show they face an incompressible uncertainty, represented by a so-called “minimum uncertainty set”, typically adding to the ‘exogenous uncertainty’, on tomorrow's state of nature, an ‘endogenous uncertainty’ on future spot prices, which may depend on every agent's private anticipations today. At equilibrium, all agents expect the ‘true’ price, in each realizable state, as a possible outcome, and elect optimal strategies, ex ante, which clear on all markets, ex post. Our main Theorem states that equilibrium exists as long as agents' prior anticipations, which may be refined from observing markets, embed that minimum uncertainty set. This result is stronger than the classical ones of generic existence, along Radner (1979), or Hart (1975), based on the rational expectations of prices

D52|Financial equilibrium with differential information:An existence theorem|"We propose a proof of existence of equilibrium in a pure exchange economy where agents are asymmetrically informed, exchange commodities, on spot markets and securities of all kinds, on incomplete financial markets. The proof does not use Grasmanians, nor differential topology. We show first that the set of payoff matrixes, whose spans never collapse is open and everywhere dense. Then, we show by standard fixed-point-like arguments that an economy where the span of asset's payoffs cannot fall always admits an equilibrium. The resulting existence property is said to be ""weakly generic"". As a corollary, we prove the full existence of financial equilibrium for numeraire assets, extending Geanakoplos-Polemarchakis (1986) to the asymmetric information setting. The paper, which still retains Radner's (1972) standard perfect foresight assumption, also serves to prove in a companion article, the existence of sequential equilibrium when both Radner's (1972 & 1979) classical rational expectation assumptions are dropped, that is, when agents have private characteristics and beliefs and no model to forecast prices"
D52|Financial equilibrium with differential information in a production economy: A basic model of 'generic' existence|We study the existence of equilibria in two-period production economies, where asymmetrically informed agents exchange securities, on incomplete financial markets, and commodities, on spot markets with a perfect foresight of future prices. Extending our pure-exchange existence theorems, we show that equilibria exist for an open dense set of economies, parametrized by the assets' payoffs, and for all economies, whose assets are nominal or numeraire. The model covers all types of private ownership - sole proprietorship, partnership or corporations - and all sectors consistent with competition, i.e., with non-increasing returns to scale. It is a step towards proving existence in stochastic production economies, and the full existence of sequential equilibria with production, when perfect price foresight fails to prevail
D52|Monetary Policy and the Redistribution Channel|This paper evaluates the role of redistribution in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to consumption. Three channels affect aggregate spending when winners and losers have different marginal propensities to consume: an earnings heterogeneity channel from unequal income gains, a Fisher channel from unexpected inflation, and an interest rate exposure channel from real interest rate changes. Sufficient statistics from Italian and US data suggest that all three channels are likely to amplify the effects of monetary policy.
D52|Huggett economies with multiple stationary equilibria|I obtain a closed-form solution to a Huggett economy with constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) utility when the vector of individual state variables follows a VAR(1) process with an arbitrary shock distribution. The stationary equilibrium is unique if the income process is AR(1), but not necessarily so otherwise. With Gaussian shocks, I provide general sufficient conditions for the existence of at least three equilibria when the income process is either ARMA(1,1), AR(2), or has a persistent-transitory (PT) representation with negatively correlated shocks. The possibility of multiple equilibria calls for caution in comparative statics exercises and policy analyses using heterogeneous-agent models. As an illustration I provide an example in which the welfare implication of changing the income risk goes in opposite directions depending on the choice of equilibrium.
D52|Under-Insurance in Human Capital Models with Limited Enforcement|This paper uses a macroeconomic model calibrated to U.S data to show that limited contract enforcement leads to substantial under-insurance against human capital risk. The model economy is populated by a large number of risk-averse households who can invest in risk-free physical capital and risky human capital. Expected human capital returns are age-dependent and calibrated to match the observed life-cycle profile of median labor income. Households have access to a complete set of credit and insurance contracts, but their ability to use the available financial instruments is limited by the possibility of default (limited contract enforcement). According to the baseline calibration, young households are severely under-insured against human capital (labor income) risk and the welfare losses due to the lack of insurance are substantial. These results are robust to realistic variations in parameter values. (Copyright: Elsevier)
D52|The Lifetime Costs of Bad Health|What are the cumulative effects of health shocks over the life-cycle? The answer depends on the nature of persistence of bad health and the extent to which it changes individuals' economic circumstances. We measure the lifetime costs of bad health using a rich structural model that can reproduce the short- and long-run dynamics of health and health-related inequality in economic outcomes. We explicitly take into account the fact that this inequality can be partly traced back to factors predetermined early in life. Our model has several implications concerning the pecuniary and non-pecuniary effects of health shocks. The life- time costs of bad health are influenced by ex-ante predetermined factors, and the largest component of pecuniary costs is the loss in labor earnings. Because bad health lowers ones' life expectancy, its non-pecuniary effects are large. In particular, through this channel they are very important for individuals' welfare and non-trivially contribute toward lifetime inequality.
D52|Contracts and domination in incomplete markets: what is a true core?|Abstract The goal of the paper is to propose and study a concept of domination by coalitions for incomplete markets. Previously elaborated in the context of contractual approach, now it is presented in more or less standard terms and style. This concept is described as a set of allocations implemented by the net trades (webs of contracts) that are characterized by a special kind of stability in future markets: (i) for every state of the world inducted allocation has to be Pareto optimal and individually rational and (ii) there is no coalition which is able to dominate the allocation via financially feasible trades in future spot markets using real assets and relative to prices specified by (i) (partial Pareto prices). This core converts into a classical one when the market turns complete. Under perfect competition conditions core allocations are GEI-equilibria. These properties prove the validity of suggested core.
D52|Optimal consumption and investment with Epstein–Zin recursive utility|Abstract We study continuous-time optimal consumption and investment with Epstein–Zin recursive preferences in incomplete markets. We develop a novel approach that rigorously constructs the solution of the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation by a fixed point argument and makes it possible to compute both the indirect utility and, more importantly, optimal strategies. Based on these results, we also establish a fast and accurate method for numerical computations. Our setting is not restricted to affine asset price dynamics; we only require boundedness of the underlying model coefficients.
D52|Endogenous differential information|Abstract We include endogenous differential information in a model with sequential trade and incomplete financial participation. Agents update information through market signals given by commodity prices and asset deliveries. Information acts over admissible strategies and consumption tastes, allowing discontinuities in preferences and choice sets. Therefore, equilibrium may cease to exist. However, internalizing the compatibility between information and consumption through preferences, and without requiring either financial survival assumptions or fully revealing prices, equilibrium existence can be ensured.
D52|Eliminating useless portfolios in constrained financial economies|Abstract When financial investors’ portfolio holdings are unconstrained, financial economies are assumed, w.l.o.g., to have no redundant assets. Indeed, eliminating redundant assets allows to replace the initial financial structure by an equivalent one, i.e., one that has the same consumption equilibria. Moreover, at the end of the process, absence of redundant assets guarantees that the set of admissible portfolio allocations is bounded, a fundamental property for the existence of equilibria. In the presence of institutional (exogenous) portfolio constraints, eliminating redundant assets is not innocuous anymore since bounded arbitrage may persist at equilibrium, the law of one price does not hold, and some zero-income portfolios may not be free. The goal of the paper is to replace the elimination of redundant assets by the elimination of useless portfolios, a process that eliminates in particular Werner useless portfolios, but needs to go beyond to obtain the boundedness of the set of admissible portfolio allocations at the end of the purification process. Moreover, the elimination process is carried out without affecting the set of consumption equilibria, hence replacing at each step the financial structure by an equivalent one.
D52|General economic equilibrium with financial markets and retainability|Abstract A theory of economic equilibrium for incomplete financial markets in general real assets is developed in a new formulation with currency-denominated prices. The “goods” are not only commodities, and they can influence utility through retention as an alternative to consumption. Perfect foresight is relinquished in a rolling horizon approach to markets which lets agents pursue long-term interests without being sure of future prices. The framework is that of an economy operating in a fiat currency that agents find attractive to retain, in balance with other needs. The attractiveness comes from Keynesian considerations about uncertainty which until now have not been brought in. The existence of equilibrium is established directly—not just generically—and moreover under weaker assumptions on endowments than before, except that utility functions are taken to be concave. Agents do not need to start out with, or end up with, positive amounts of everything. With a single currency denominating the units of account in all states, price indeterminacy is avoided and all contracts issued in the financial markets can be interpreted as “real contracts.” Derivative instruments and collateralized contracts based on money prices are thereby encompassed for the first time. Transaction costs on sales of contracts, generated endogenously, lead to bid–ask spreads and in particular to a gap between interest rates for lending and borrowing money.
D52|Collateralized borrowing and increasing risk|Abstract This paper uses a general equilibrium model with collateralized borrowing to show that increases in risk can have ambiguous effects on leverage, loan margins, loan amounts, and asset prices. Increasing risk about future payoffs and endowments can lead to riskier loans with larger balances and lower spreads even when lenders are risk averse and borrowers can default. As well, increasing the covariance of either agents’ endowments with the asset payoff can have ambiguous consequences for equilibrium. Though the effects are ambiguous, key determinants of how increased risk translates into changes in prices and allocations are the covariance of agents’ endowments with the asset payoff, agents’ risk aversion, and the location of increased risk in the distribution of future states. Some restricted changes in the borrower’s or lender’s endowments can have unambiguous but asymmetric effects on equilibrium.
D52|Indeterminacy in stochastic overlapping generations models: real effects in the long run|Abstract Indeterminate equilibria are known to exist for overlapping generations models, though recent research has been limited to deterministic settings in which all equilibria converge to a steady state in the long run. This paper analyzes stochastic overlapping generations models with three-period-lived representative consumers and adopts a novel computational algorithm to numerically approximate the entire set of competitive equilibria. In a stochastic setting with incomplete markets, indeterminacy has real effects in the long run. Our numerical simulations reveal that indeterminacy is an order of magnitude more important than endowment shocks in explaining long-run consumption and asset price volatility.
D52|Financial Equilibrium with differential Information: a Theorem of generic Existence|We propose a proof of generic existence of equilibrium in a pure exchange economy, where agents are typically asymmetrically informed, exchange commodities, on spot markets, and securities of all kinds, on incomplete financial markets. The proof does not use Grasmanians, nor differential topology (except Sard's theorem), but good algebraic properties of assets' payoffs, whose spans, generically, never collapse. Then, we show that an economy, where the payoff span cannot fall, admits an equilibrium. As a corollary, we prove the full existence of financial equilibrium for numeraire assets, extending Geanakoplos-Polemarchakis (1986) to the asymmetric information setting. The paper, which still retains Radner's (1972) standard perfect foresight assumption, is also a milestone to prove, in a companion article, the existence of sequential equilibrium when the classical rational expectation assumptions, along Radner (1972, 1979), are dropped jointly, that is, when agents have private characteristics and beliefs and no model to forecast prices.

D52|Implications for Aggregate Inflation of Sectoral Asymmetries : Generalizing Woodford|This paper develops and simulates a simple two sector DSGE model for studying aggregate inflation and output dynamics under sectoral adjustment asymmetries. The CES aggregate consumption bundle consists of two different groups of goods with imperfect substitutability between as well as within the groups. Allowing for different within group CES aggregators implies that the degree of substitutability between goods in a group is group-specific. To generate sector-specific price rigidities the model assumes sector-specific Calvo pricing. The paper focuses on potential post-shock divergences across sectors as well as on the implications for aggregate inflation and output of the sectoral asymmetries and identifies an important role for the sectoral relative price for aggregate dynamics. More specifically, the paper generalizes Woodford (2003), which only allows for the price rigidity to differ across sectors. Incorporating sector-specific price elasticities is important and well in line with the micro-level evidence on individual as well as sectoral prices. From the point of view of allocational efficiency and welfare, relative price movements occupy a central role in models incorporating Calvo pricing. This particular feature underscores the perceived macroeconomic benefits of low and stable inflation. This paper takes this logic a step further by incorporating movements both in individual and sectoral relative prices.
D52|Health Risk, Insurance and Optimal Progressive Income Taxation|We study the optimal progressivity of personal income taxes in an environment where individuals are exposed to idiosyncratic shocks to health and labor productivity over the lifecycle. Our analysis is based on a large-scale overlapping generations general equilibrium model that is calibrated to the US economy. Our results indicate that the presence of health risk and health insurance has a strong effect on the amount of redistribution and social insurance provided by progressive income taxes. In an environment with a non-universal health insurance system, such as the US system, the optimal income tax system is highly progressive in order to provide a sufficient level of redistribution to unhealthy low income individuals. The total welfare gain from optimizing the progressivity level is 5.6 percent in compensating lifetime consumption. More inclusive health insurance systems, such as Medicare for all, lead to large decreases in the optimal level of tax progressivity. When health expenditure risk is eliminated, the optimal income tax code becomes more similar to the findings of previous studies that used models without health risk. Our findings highlight the quantitative importance of accounting for the interdependence of health insurance and income taxes when designing optimal income tax policies.
D52|Disputes, debt and equity|We show how the prospect of disputes over firms' revenue reports promotes debt financing over equity. This is demonstrated in a costly state verification model with a risk averse entrepreneur. The prospect of disputes encourages incentive contracts that limit penalties and avoid stochastic monitoring, even when the lender can commit to stochastic monitoring. Consequently, optimal contracts shift from equity toward standard debt. In short: When audit signals are weakly correlated with true incomes, standard debt contracts emerge as optimal; if audit signals are highly correlated with true incomes, optimal contracts resemble equity. When audit costs are sufficiently high, stochastic monitoring may be optimal. Optimal standard debt contracts under imperfect audits are shown to reproduce key empirical facts of US firm borrowing.
D52|Securitized Markets, International Capital Flows, and Global Welfare|We study the effect of collateralized lending and securitization on the global supply of securitized assets, welfare, and international net and gross capital flows in a two country general equilibrium model with idiosyncratic investment risk. The financial sectors in the two countries, Home and Foreign, differ by the collateral requirement for investment loans, with Home requiring lower margins. In autarky, Home endogenously supplies more assets and enables more risk sharing. Upon financial integration, capital flows from Foreign to Home, leading to lower interest rates and an increase in the global supply of assets. Foreign enjoys substantial welfare gains through better risk sharing and portfolio reallocation, while the welfare experience for Home is ambiguous. Gross capital flows arise when agents face aggregate shocks to the expected payoff to investment projects, but can collapse when shocks concern the variance of returns.
D52|Transparency aversion and insurance market equilibria|Telemonitoring devices can be used to screen consumers' characteristics and mitigate information asymmetries that lead to adverse selection in insurance markets. However, some consumers value their privacy and dislike sharing private information with insurers. In the second-best efficient Wilson-Miyazaki-Spence framework, we allow for consumers to reveal their risk type for an individual subjective cost and show analytically how this affects insurance market equilibria as well as utilitarian social welfare. Our analysis shows that the choice of information disclosure with respect to revelation of their risk type can substitute deductibles for consumers whose transparency aversion is sufficiently low. This can lead to a Pareto improvement of social welfare and a Pareto efficient market allocation. However, if all consumers are offered cross-subsidizing contracts, the introduction of a transparency contract decreases or even eliminates cross-subsidies. Given the prior existence of a WMS equilibrium, utility is shifted from individuals who do not reveal their private information to those who choose to reveal. Our analysis provides a theoretical foundation for the discussion on consumer protection in the context of digitalization. It shows that new technologies bring new ways to challenge crosssubsidization in insurance markets and stresses the negative externalities that digitalization has on consumers who are not willing to take part in this development.
D52|International capital markets with time-varying preferences|We propose a 2-country asset-pricing model where agents' preferences change endogenously as a function of the popularity of internationally traded goods. We determine the effect of the time-variation of preferences on equity markets, consumption and portfolio choices. When agents are more sensitive to the popularity of domestic consumption goods, the local stock market reacts more strongly to the preferences of local agents than to the preferences of foreign agents. Therefore, home bias arises because home-country stock represents a better investment opportunity for hedging against future fluctuations in preferences. We test our model and find that preference evolution is a plausible driver of key macroeconomic variables and stock returns.

D52|Fat tails and spurious estimation of consumption‐based asset pricing models|The standard generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation of Euler equations in heterogeneous-agent consumption-based asset pricing models is inconsistent under fat tails because the GMM criterion is asymptotically random. To illustrate this, we generate asset returns and consumption data from an incomplete-market dynamic general equilibrium model that is analytically solvable and exhibits power laws in consumption. Monte Carlo experiments suggest that the standard GMM estimation is inconsistent and susceptible to Type II errors (incorrect non-rejection of false models). Estimating an overidentified model by dividing agents into age cohorts appears to mitigate Type I and II errors.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D52|Subprime assets and financial crisis: theory, policy and the law|In this paper, we explore three specific aspects of the US subprime crisis, using both theoretical models and the outcome of subsequent legal proceedings. First, the role of pecuniary externalities in amplifying shocks to the quality of MBS held by Investment Banks. Second, the role of adverse selection in the marketing of such assets by Investment Banks; and third the role of financial panic in making shadow banking disaster prone. The relevance of these differing perspectives is attested by the nature of state support and, more especially, the findings of law courts. Janet Yellen has recently argued that the vulnerabilities within the US financial system in the mid-2000s were “numerous and familiar from past financial panics”. That the aforementioned threats to stability should be complements and not substitutes is of more than technical interest. It helps to show why the US financial system was so exposed to radical failure.Keywords: Financial Instability, Pecuniary Externalities, Asymmetric Information, Bank run JEL Classification: D52, D53, G01, G12, G13
D52|Recovery is Never Easy - Dynamics and Multiple Equilibria with Financial Arbitrage, Production and Collateral Constraints|We develop a simple general equilibrium model to study the interactions between financial arbitrage and the real economy under collateral constraints. In good times, arbitrage activities help boost the production sectors by providing external funds to capital investment. However, when exposed to adverse shocks and panic market reactions, arbitrage also amplifies the financial distress and makes it easier for the economy to fall into self-fulfilling crises. Moreover, the possibility of regime switches triggered by exogenous shocks also complicates the path to recovery. The combination of financial distress and pessimistic market anticipation not only slows down the recovery process, but also can trap the economy in a less healthy steady state.
D52|Nash Equilibrium Strategies and Survival Portfolio Rules in Evolutionary Models of Asset Markets|"We consider a stochastic model of a financial market with one-period assets and endogenous asset prices. The model was initially developed and analyzed in the context of Evolutionary Finance with the main focus on questions of ""survival and extinction"" of investment strategies (portfolio rules). In this paper we view the model from a different, game-theoretic, perspective and analyze Nash equilibrium properties of survival portfolio rules."
D52|Evolutionary Finance Models with Short Selling and Endogenous Asset Supply|"Evolutionary Finance focuses on questions of ""survival and extinction"" of investment strategies (portfolio rules) in the market selection process. It analyzes stochastic dynamics of financial markets in which asset prices are determined endogenously by a short-run equilibrium between supply and demand. Equilibrium is formed in each time period in the course of interaction of portfolio rules of competing market participants. A comprehensive theory of evolutionary dynamics of this kind has been developed for models in which short selling is not allowed and asset supply is exogenous. The present paper extends the theory to a class of models with short selling and endogenous asset supply."
D52|An Evolutionary Finance Model with a Risk-Free Asset|"The purpose of this work is to develop an evolutionary finance model with a risk-free asset playing the role of a numeraire. The model describes a market where one risk-free and several ""short-lived"" risky assets (securities) are traded in discrete time. The risky securities live one period, yield random payoffs at the end of it, and then are identically re-born at the beginning of the next period. The main goal of the study is to identify investment strategies that make it possible for an investor to ""survive"" in the market selection process. It is shown that a strategy of this kind exists, is in a sense asymptotically unique and can be described by a simple explicit formula amenable for quantitative investment analysis."
D52|Arbitrage Crashes, Financial Accelerator, and Sudden Market Freezes|We develop an infinite horizon model that links the intermediation in both the financial and real sectors. Intermediaries provide market liquidity and exploit the arbitrage profits in segmented financial markets. To do so, they use their productive capital as collateral. We show that the weakened intermediation and arbitrage losses are mutually reinforcing during an economic downturn. This forces intermediaries to de-lever and leads to liquidity spirals in both financial and real sectors. Also, the distress might further open up the possibility of sudden run-like market freezes, where intermediaries are denied access to renewed funding through arbitrage. We evaluate the effect of three intervention policies: direct purchase of distressed assets, interest rate cuts, and capital injection. We find that capital injection is most effective as it loosens the margin requirement. The interest cut is least effective because it exacerbates the capital misallocation.
D52|Unemployment, Borrowing Constraints and Stabilization Policies|In this paper, we develop a tractable incomplete-market model with unemployment and borrowing constraints. We analyze the effects of ?scal and unemployment insurance policies in reaction to a large economic downturn. Policy instruments are government spending and the unemployment replacement rate. First, our incomplete-market model magnifies ?uctuations in the unemployment rate after various shocks, compared to a standard complete-market model. Second, in response to a large shock that replicates the effects of a crisis, we find that government spending should increase substantially and that the replacement rate should drop. The sign and size of government interventions are quite different in a model with complete markets. Unemployment and borrowing constraints happen to matter quite a lot in determining the aggregate effects of large shocks, the design of optimized policies in response to these shocks and the corresponding welfare gains/losses.
D52|Global Collateral: How Financial Innovation Drives Capital Flows and Increases Financial Instability|We show that cross-border financial flows arise when levels of financial innovation differ across countries. Financial integration is a way of sharing scarce collateral. The ability of one country to leverage and tranche assets provides attractive financial contracts to investors in the other country, and general equilibrium effects on prices create opportunities for investors in the sophisticated country to invest abroad. Foreign demand for collateral and for collateral-backed financial promises increases the collateral value of domestic assets, and cheap foreign assets provide attractive returns to investors who do not demand collateral to issue promises. Gross global flows respond dynamically to fundamentals, exporting and amplifying financial volatility.
D52|Merit and rent in a growing economy|In the framework of Romer’s (1990) growth model, we endogenize human capital accumulation as the risky outcome of an effort choice. Policies favouring the accumulation of physical capital may reduce the incentives to effort, leading the economy on a balanced path with a high capital intensity and a low growth rate.
D52|Discrete-time option pricing with stochastic liquidity|Classical option pricing theories are usually built on the law of one price, neglecting the impact of market liquidity that may contribute to significant bid-ask spreads. Within the framework of conic finance, we develop a stochastic liquidity model, extending the discrete-time constant liquidity model of Madan (2010). With this extension, we can replicate the term and skew structures of bid-ask spreads typically observed in option markets. We show how to implement such a stochastic liquidity model within our framework using multidimensional binomial trees and we calibrate it to call and put options on the S&P 500.
D52|Designing an electricity wholesale market to accommodate significant renewables penetration: Lessons from Britain|The wholesale market has to address two major market failures - inadequate carbon prices in the EU ETS, and the learning externalities and missing futures markets for energy and ancillary services needed to guide flexible dispatchable plant. The paper discusses the importance of locational price signals to guide investment, the need to reform transmission pricing and renewables support. The case for capacity auctions for renewables and quantifies the justifiable level of renewables support. These proposals are consistent with the EU Clean Energy Package, but the nature of the renewables target and its financing should change.
D52|Optimal time-consistent taxation with default|We study optimal time-consistent distortionary taxation when the repayment of government debt is not enforceable. The government taxes labor income or issues non-contingent debt in order to finance an exogenous stream of stochastic government expenditures. The government can repudiate its debt subject to some default costs. Our setup blends elements of time-consistent fiscal policy and the sovereign default literature.
D52|Neoclassical inequality|In a model with a worker-capitalist dichotomy, we show that the relationship between inequality (measured as a ratio of incomes for the two types) and growth is complicated; zero growth generally lowers inequality, except under extreme parameterizations. In particular, the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor in production needs to be substantially greater than one in order for income inequality be higher with zero growth, in fact higher than nearly all estimates. If this condition is not met, factor prices adjust strongly causing the fall in the return to capital (the rise in wages) to reduce income inequality. Our results extend to models with endogenous growth.
D52|The Politics of Flat Taxes|We study the determination of flat tax systems using a workhorse macroeconomic model of inequality. Our first result is that, despite the multidimensional policy space, equilibrium policies are typically unique (up to a fine grid numerical approximation). The majority voting outcome features (i) zero labor income taxation, (ii) simultaneous use of capital income and consumption taxation, and (iii) generally low transfers. We discuss the role of three factors—the initial heterogeneity in sources of income, the mobility of income and wealth, and the forward-looking aspect of voting—in determining the equilibrium mix of taxes.
D52|Appendix for Financial Frictions and Fluctuations in Volatility|This appendix contains five sections. Section 1 provides details for the comparative statics exercise performed in the simple example. Section 2 discusses extending the model to allow firms to default on the wages for managers. Section 3 describes the firm-level and aggregate data. Section 4 contains the details of the computational algorithm. Finally, Section 5 reports the results for our model with a lower labor elasticity.
D52|Disputes, Debt and Equity| We show how the prospect of disputes over firms revenue reports promotes debt financing over equity. These findings are presented within a costly state verification model with a risk averse entrepreneur. The prospect of disputes encourages incentive regimes which limit penalties and avoid stochastic monitoring, even when the lender can commit to stochastic enforcement strategies. Consequently, optimal contracts shift away from equity and toward standard debt. For a useful special case of the model, closed form solutions are presented for leverage and consumption allocations under efficient debt contracts.
D52|On the Optimal Inflation Rate|In our incomplete markets economy households choose portfolios consisting of risky (uninsurable) capital and money. Money is a bubble, it has positive value even though it yields no payoff. The market outcome is constrained Pareto inefficient due to a pecuniary externality. Each individual agent takes the real interest rate as given, while in the aggregate it is driven by the economic growth rate, which in turn depends on individual portfolio decisions. Higher inflation due to higher money growth lowers the real interest rate on money and tilts the portfolio choice towards physical capital investment. Modest inflation boosts growth rate and welfare.
D52|Financial Innovation, Collateral, and Investment|Financial innovations that change how promises are collateralized affect prices and investment, even in the absence of any change in fundamentals. In C-models, the ability to leverage an asset always generates overinvestment compared to Arrow-Debreu. Credit Default Swaps always leads to underinvestment with respect to Arrow-Debreu, and in some cases even robustly destroy competitive equilibrium. The need for collateral would seem to cause underinvestment. Our analysis illustrates a countervailing force: goods that serve as collateral yield additional services and can therefore be over-valued and over-produced. In models without cash flow problems there is never marginal underinvestment on collateral. (JEL D52, D86, D92, E44, G01, G12, R31)
D52|Desarrollo de la Banca Islámica. El Caso de Indonesia. Contexto y evolución|En las últimas décadas ha tenido lugar un importante desarrollo de la banca islámica y de las finanzas islámicas en general. En países como Malasia, Arabia Saudí o Bangladesh ésta ha experimentado una expansión significativa frente a la banca convencional. En Indonesia, el país con la mayor población musulmana del mundo, el desarrollo de la banca islámica está siendo más tardío. El análisis de su nacimiento e impulso pone de manifiesto las ventajas y desafíos del sector. Su peso es aún relativamente reducido pero el avance del sector financiero islámico, con un mayor impulso del mercado de capitales islámico siguiendo el ejemplo de Malasia, podría ser un factor positivo para una mejor canalización del ahorro hacia la inversión productiva en el país. En cualquier caso es conveniente que se produzcan mejoras en términos de eficiencia en el sector bancario en general y en la banca islámica en particular.
D52|Constrained Inefficiency and Optimal Taxation with Uninsurable Risks|When individuals' labor and capital income are subject to uninsurable idiosyncratic risks, should capital and labor be taxed, and if so, how? In a two-period general equilibrium model with production, we derive a decomposition formula of the welfare effects of these taxes into insurance and distribution effects. This method allows us to determine how the sign of the optimal taxes on capital and labor depends on the nature of the shocks, the degree of heterogeneity among consumers' income, and the way in which the tax revenue is used to provide lump sum transfers to consumers. When shocks affect primarily labor income and heterogeneity is small, the optimal tax on capital is positive. However, in other cases, a negative tax on capital improves welfare.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D52|On the concavity of the consumption function with liquidity constraints|Carroll and Kimball (1996) prove that the consumption function is concave if infinitely-lived risk-averse households have a utility function which exhibits Hyperbolic Absolute Risk Aversion (HARA), face income uncertainty, and are prudent. However, the empirical evidence is inconclusive about the importance of income uncertainty for households. On the other hand, empirical results suggest that liquidity and liquidity constraints are important determinants of household behavior. In this paper, I prove that the consumption function is strictly concave in wealth for infinitelylived risk-averse households with a utility function of the HARA class if there exists a liquidity constraint which binds for some level of wealth. This result is independent of prudence. Furthermore, the introduction of a liquidity constraint always reduces consumption and increases the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth.
D52|Securitization and Aggregate Investment Efficiency|This paper studies the efficiency of competitive equilibria in economies where the expansion of investment is facilitated by securitization. We show that the use of securitization is generally associated with constrained inefficient aggregate investment, thereby justifying regulatory intervention in markets for securitized assets. We examine the effectiveness of three policy instruments to address this inefficiency: ex-ante capital / leverage requirements, skin-in-the game (retention) requirements and initiatives to improve transparency in the securitization process. We find that leverage/capital restrictions and improved transparency can increase welfare in our environment, but that forcing originators to hold additional skin-in-the game can never increase welfare.
D52|Insurance in Human Capital Models with Limited Enforcement|This paper develops a tractable human capital model with limited enforceability of contracts. The model economy is populated by a large number of long-lived, risk-averse households with homothetic preferences who can invest in risk-free physical capital and risky human capital. Households have access to a complete set of credit and insurance contracts, but their ability to use the available financial instruments is limited by the possibility of default (limited contract enforcement). We provide a convenient equilibrium characterization that facilitates the computation of recursive equilibria substantially. We use a calibrated version of the model with stochastically aging households divided into 9 age groups. Younger households have higher expected human capital returns than older households. According to the baseline calibration, for young households less than half of human capital risk is insured and the welfare losses due to the lack of insurance range from 3 percent of lifetime consumption (age 40) to 7 percent of lifetime consumption (age 23). Realistic variations in the model parameters have non-negligible effects on equilibrium insurance and welfare, but the result that young households are severely underinsured is robust to such variations.
D52|Labor Market Institutions and the Cost of Recessions|This paper studies the effect of two labor market institutions, unemployment insurance (UI) and job search assistance (JSA), on the output cost and welfare cost of recessions. The paper develops a tractable incomplete-market model with search unemployment, skill depreciation during unemployment, and idiosyncratic as well as aggregate labor market risk. The theoretical analysis shows that an increase in JSA and a reduction in UI reduce the output cost of recessions by making the labor market more fluid along the job finding margin and thus making the economy more resilient to macroeconomic shocks. In contrast, the effect of JSA and UI on the welfare cost of recessions is in general ambiguous. The paper also provides a quantitative application to the German labor market reforms of 2003- 2005, the so-called Hartz reforms, which improved JSA (Hartz III reform) and reduced UI (Hartz IV reform). According to the baseline calibration, the two labor market reforms led to a substantial reduction in the output cost of recessions and a more moderate reduction in the welfare cost of recessions in Germany.
D52|Job displacement risk and severance pay|This paper is a quantitative, equilibrium study of the insurance role of severance pay when workers face displacement risk and markets are incomplete. A key feature of our model is that, in line with an established empirical literature, job displacement entails a persistent fall in earnings upon re-employment due to the loss of tenure. The model is solved numerically and calibrated to the US economy. In contrast to previous studies that have analyzed severance payments in the absence of persistent earning losses, we find that the welfare gains from the insurance against job displacement afforded by severance pay are sizable.
D52|Discrete-Time Option Pricing with Stochastic Liquidity|Classical option pricing theories are usually built on the law of one price, neglecting the impact of market liquidity that may contribute to signi ficant bid-ask spreads. Within the framework of conic finance, we develop a stochastic liquidity model, extending the discrete-time constant liquidity model of Madan (2010). With this extension, we can replicate the term and skew structures of bid-ask spreads typically observed in option markets. We show how to implement such a stochastic liquidity model within our framework using multidimensional binomial trees and we calibrate it to call and put options on the S&P 500.
D52|Existence and multiplicity of temporary equilibria under nominal price rigidities|Abstract This paper proves existence of a multiplicity of equilibria in a two-period TGE model with money and nominal rigidities. Households have incomplete preferences and firms reach decisions through the “control principle”. The multiple equilibria belong to an inflation–unemployment locus allowing for a Phillips curve or stagflation.
D52|Risk-Sharing in Village Economies Revisited|The limited enforcement model is popular for the analysis of village risk-sharing as it captures both the observed degree of insurance and the presumption that incomes are well observed but formal contracts absent in rural communities. Enforcement constraints in insurance contracts, however, typically bind only in case of positive income shocks, when the outside option of leaving the village is attractive. We show how this results in strongly counterfactual asymmetries in the consumption process at usual village sizes. When households can renege on informal contracts together with other villagers, however, the size of insurance groups becomes endogenous, and is usually much smaller than typical villages. This brings the predicted consumption process, which is more symmetric in small groups, in line with observed data. We thus argue that village risk-sharing should be replaced by neighbourhood, or kinship, risk-sharing.
D52|A Demand Theory of the Price Level|In this paper I show that the price level is globally unique in incomplete markets models. I base my argument on the simple idea that the price equates demand with supply in the goods market. Monetary policy works through setting nominal interest rates, e.g. an interest rate peg, while fiscal policy is committed to satisfying the present value budget constraint at all times (in contrast to the FTPL). Together, these determine the unique price level, as well as consumption and employment, jointly. In particular, the model predicts a unique equilibrium in response to a fiscal stimulus if the nominal interest is pegged, whereas there is a continuum of equilibria in the standard New Keynesian model. In contrast to the conventional view the long-run inflation rate is, in the absence of output growth, equal to the growth rate of nominal government spending, which is controlled by fiscal policy. This new theory where nominal government spending anchors aggregate demand, and therefore current and future prices, offers a different perspective on a range of important issues including the fiscal and monetary transmission mechanism, policy coordination, policies at the zero-lower bound, U.S. inflation history and recent attempts to stimulate inflation in the Euro area.
D52|A comedy of errors: misguided policy, mis-sold mortgages, and more|"In Phishing for Phools, Akerlof and Shiller characterise the US subprime crisis as the insolvency that follows when highly-leveraged investment banks mis-sell derivative-style products to low-income US households. That rating agencies qualified many of the Mortgage Backed Securities as triple A was no proof of top quality; just further evidence of distorted incentives. Other observers, however, see it as a direct consequence of financial innovation; or as a liquidity crisis driven by the lack of transparency of Mortgage Backed Securities. To help weigh these views in the balance, three aspects of the situation are explored, using both theoretical models and the outcome of recent legal proceedings. First, we examine the role of pecuniary externalities using a partial equilibrium model of investment banking due to Adrian and Shin, where bank equity induces amplified responses to news on fundamentals. We find that the system may be ""catastrophic"" in that the simple reversal of a ""good news"" shock (which has been promptly ""marked to market"") can lead to insolvency. To interpret these news shocks, we turn to a general equilibrium model of risky asset pricing with heterogeneous beliefs recently developed by Fostel and Geanakoplos. In their framework, a rise in optimism acts as a ""good news"" shock which raises the price of risky assets; while ""bad news"" may be attributed to financial innovation that allows for the shorting of risky assets. Finally, to help resolve the contentious issue of whether the striking collapse in the value of MBSs net of insurance costs was due to irrational panic or had its basis in poor fundamentals, we consider the nature of state support and, more especially, the findings of law courts. The need for unprecedented capital injections by the Treasury in 2008 and the substantial fines for mis-selling of MBSs subsequently imposed on the banks suggest that the collapse of confidence in subprime securities had its roots in reality, not unreasoning panic."
D52|Unemployment insurance with limited commitment wage contracts and savings|I present a model of optimal contracts between firms and workers, under limited commitment and with worker savings. In the model, firms provide insurance against unemployment through targeting a frontloaded path of wages which encourages wealth accumulation. I provide analytical results characterising the wage and savings schedules and the path of consumption during employment and unemployment. I then consider how unemployment benefits affect risk sharing through private markets. I find that benefits should be frontloaded; the government has the incentive to drive the allocation to the point where the firm’s participation constraint binds. At this point wages are equal to productivity in every period, wealth exceeds the buffer stock level, and consumption and savings drop over time. The drop in the level of consumption during unemployment is mitigated. Finally, I compare the optimal contract model to the standard heterogeneous agent model whereby wealth is utilized for self-insurance purposes. I show that the two models are equivalent under the optimal UI policy.
D52|Discerning information from trade data|How best to discern trading intentions from market data? We examine the accuracy of three methods for classifying trade data: bulk volume classification (BVC), tick rule and aggregated tick rule. We develop a Bayesian model of inferring information from trade executions and show the conditions under which tick rules or bulk volume classification predominates. Empirically, we find that tick rule approaches and BVC are relatively good classifiers of the aggressor side of trading, but bulk volume classifications are better linked to proxies of information-based trading. Thus, BVC would appear to be a useful tool for discerning trading intentions from market data.
D52|Credit segmentation in general equilibrium|We build a general equilibrium model with endogenous borrowing constraints compatible with credit segmentation. There are personalized trading restrictions connecting prices with both portfolio constraints and consumption possibilities, a setting which has not thoroughly been addressed by the literature. Our approach is general enough to be compatible with incomplete market economies where there exist wealth-dependent and/or investment-dependent credit access, borrowing constraints precluding bankruptcy, or assets backed by physical collateral.
D52|Endowment redistribution and Pareto improvements in GEI economies|With incomplete markets and numeraire assets, there are open sets of economies such that their equilibrium allocations can be improved upon by a reallocation of period zero endowments. This strengthens the classical results on constrained Pareto inefficiency of equilibria in GEI.
D52|Mobility|This paper studies short-run wealth mobility in a heterogeneous agents, incomplete-markets model. Wealth mobility has a “hump-shaped” relationship with the persistence of the stochastic process governing labor income: low when shocks are close to i.i.d. or close to a random walk, and higher in between. The standard incomplete markets framework features less wealth mobility than found in the PSID wealth supplements. We include features commonly used in the literature to capture wealth inequality and find that they do little to improve the model’s performance for wealth mobility. Finally, we introduce state-contingent assets, which allow households to partially span the space of labor productivity. Moving toward a more “complete” market lowers wealth mobility unless the labor income process is very persistent.
D52|Credit Default Swaps in General Equilibrium: Spillovers, Credit Spreads, and Endogenous Default|This paper highlights two new effects of credit default swap markets (CDS) in a general equilibrium setting. First, when firms' cash flows are correlated, CDSs impact the cost of capital{credit spreads{and investment for all firms, even those that are not CDS reference entities. Second, when firms internalize the credit spread changes, the incentive to issue safe rather than risky bonds is fundamentally altered. Issuing safe debt requires a transfer of profits from good states to bad states to ensure full repayment. Alternatively, issuing risky bonds maximizes profits in good states at the expense of default in bad states. Profits fall when credit spreads increase, which raises the opportunity cost of issuing risky debt compared to issuing safe debt. Symmetrically, lower credit spreads reduce the opportunity cost of issuing risky debt relative to safe debt. CDSs affect the credit spread at which firms issue risky debt, and ultimately the opportunity cost of issuing defaultable bonds even when underlying firm fundamentals remain unchanged. Hedging (Speculating on) credit risk lowers (raises) credit spreads and enlarges (reduces) the parameter region over which firms choose to issue risky debt.
D52|Private information and business cycle risk sharing|When individuals have private information about their own luck and in- come, the sharing of idiosyncratic risks is hampered by moral hazard. This friction also affects the optimal sharing of business cycle risks. Optimal allocations restrict the exposure of low wealth agents’ consumption to business cycle risk. This encourages truth-telling by high wealth agents who have a high tolerance for business cycle risk, thereby increasing the extent to which idiosyncratic risks can be shared. Implementation of these optimal allocations requires restrictions in the trade of securities contingent on business cycle outcomes.
D52|General Equilibrium with Endogenous Trading Constraints|We build a general equilibrium model where agents are subject to endogenous trading constraints, making the access to financial trade dependent on prices and consumption decisions. Besides, our framework is compatible with the existence of endogenous financial segmentation and credit markets' exclusion. Two results of equilibrium existence are shown. In the first one, we assume individuals can super-replicate financial payments buying durable commodities and investing in assets that give liquidity to all agents. In the second result, under strict monotonicity of preferences, we suppose there are agents that may compensate with increments in present demand the losses of well-being generated by reductions of future consumption.
D52|Impact of pension system structure on international financial capital allocation|Recent findings indicate that pension system structure affects private savings and through them the aggregate foreign asset position of a country. We present a two-country overlapping-generations model that explores the relationship between the magnitude of pension guarantees and the resulting portfolio choices of workers. The existence of a pay-as-you-go pension system lowers the wealth of the young workers, who consequently borrow from abroad to supplement their current consumption, and lowers the overall riskiness of their lifetime wealth, prompting them to invest in risky equity financed by the selling of safe bonds. In particular, we are able to replicate and explain the ”venture capitalist” (positive net equity accompanied by negative net debt) portfolio profile of the United States. More broadly, we find empirical support for our results in a cross-country analysis using data from 110 economies: greater amounts of pension spending are associated with international indebtedness, long equity positions, and short debt positions.
D52|When financial imperfections are not the problem, but the solution|The BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010 has focused considerable attention on the potential liability and the operating conduct of big oil companies. This paper shows that, limiting the ability of a company to insure and diversify its risks, creates incentives to internalize the welfare effects of catastrophic events, leading to a welfare improvement. We model an economy with complete financial markets where one agent’s actions impose an externality on other agents by altering the probability distribution of their risks. Then, a Pareto improved allocation can be reached via an asset reallocation, essentially restricting this agent’s choice of portfolio of assets. Hence, in the presence of externalities, disturbing the functioning of perfect financial markets can be socially beneficial.
D52|Work Incentives Of Medicaid Beneficiaries And The Role Of Asset Testing|Should asset testing be used in meansâ€ tested programs? Focusing on Medicaid, we show that in the asymmetric information environment, there is a positive role for asset testing. Our tool is a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents. We find that 23% of Medicaid enrollees do not work in order to be eligible. These distortions are costly: If Medicaid eligibility could be linked to (unobservable) productivity, this results in substantial welfare gains. We show that asset testing can achieve a similar outcome when asset limits are allowed to be different for workers and nonworkers.
D52|A re-examination of constrained Pareto inefficiency in economies with incomplete markets|We establish that, when the number of agents is sufficiently large, but finite, there are open sets of economies with constrained Pareto inefficient equilibria and provide a simple sufficient condition for constrained inefficiency. We also show that there are open sets of economies with constrained efficient equilibria. Hence, for these economies, neither constrained efficiency, nor its lack, are generic properties. However, constrained inefficiency is a pervasive feature: for each economy with preferences satisfying a mild restriction, there are open sets of endowments such that their equilibrium allocations are constrained inefficient.
D52|Equilibrium Pricing in Incomplete Markets Under Translation Invariant Preferences|We propose a general discrete-time framework for deriving equilibrium prices of financial securities. It allows for heterogeneous agents, unspanned random endowments, and convex trading constraints. We give a dual characterization of equilibria and provide general results on their existence and uniqueness. In the special case where all agents have preferences of the same type and in equilibrium, all random endowments are replicable by trading in the financial market, we show that a one-fund theorem holds and give an explicit expression for the equilibrium pricing kernel.
D52|Labor Market Risk in Germany|This paper uses annual data drawn from the GSOEP to estimate individual earnings risk (labor market risk) in Germany for the period 1983-2012. The econometric specification of the earnings process allows for transitory shocks and permanent shocks to individual earnings. We find that both the transitory component and the permanent component of earnings risk have been rising in West Germany in the 1990s and have remained at elevated levels in the 2000s. In contrast, labor market risk in East Germany did not rise. These findings are robust to different sample selection criteria and changes in the specification of the earnings process. We provide a simple welfare calculation that suggests that the negative welfare consequences of the observed rise in the permanent component of earnings risk in West Germany are substantial. We argue that the time series evidence is not consistent with the view that international trade integration has been a main driver of the observed rise in labor market risk in West Germany.
D52|Insurance in human capital models with limited enforcement|This paper develops a tractable human capital model with limited enforceability of contracts. The model economy is populated by a large number of long-lived, risk-averse households with homothetic preferences who can invest in risk-free physical capital and risky human capital. Households have access to a complete set of credit and insurance contracts, but their ability to use the available financial instruments is limited by the possibility of default (limited contract enforcement). We provide a convenient equilibrium characterization that facilitates the computation of recursive equilibria substantially. We use a calibrated version of the model with stochastically aging households divided into 9 age groups. Younger households have higher expected human capital returns than older households. According to the baseline calibration, for young households less than half of human capital risk is insured and the welfare losses due to the lack of insurance range from 3 percent of lifetime consumption (age 40) to 7 percent of lifetime consumption (age 23). Realistic variations in the model parameters have non-negligible effects on equilibrium insurance and welfare, but the result that young households are severely underinsured is robust to such variations.
D52|Solving the Incomplete Markets Model in Parallel Using GPU Computing and the Krusell–Smith Algorithm|Abstract This paper demonstrates the potential of graphics processing units in solving the incomplete markets model in parallel using the Krusell–Smith algorithm. We illustrate the power of this approach using the same exercise as in Den Haan et al. (J Econ Dyn Control 34:1–3, 2010). We document a speed gain which increases sharply with the number of agents. To reduce entry barriers, we explain our methodology and provide some example algorithms.
D52|The genesis of Health Economics in Kenneth Arrow (1963)|Kenneth J. Arrow is one of the most prominent economists of the twentieth century. His concerns about competitive equilibrium and optimality under uncertainty conditions led him to publish what would be recognized as the seminal article on Health Economics, “Uncertainty and the welfare economics of medical care”. This essay pays tribute to Arrow’s work and discusses the intellectual foundations of the analysis of medical benefits in a welfare economics context, the validity of Arrow’s original approach and its main implications. Here, the validity of Arrow’s central hypothesis on the impossibility of reaching an efficient resource allocation through the market is defended, mainly because of the uncertainty associated to disease incidence. Also, implications of asymmetric information, moral hazard and social norms are discussed from Arrow’s perspective, as well as the roles of state and market.

In connection with the cumulative dividend stream criterion of fundamental and noise movement, the conception of sequentially stable Markov process is grounded on the theory of bubbles. This paper firstly embodies the origin of speculative bubble burst with overconfidence. Then, unique equilibrium with inertia is re-illuminated by the overconfidence
D52|Existence of financial equilibrium with differential information: the no-arbitrage characterization|"In the classical approach to asymmetric information, agents are all endowed with a price model à la Radner (Econometrica 47: 655-678, 1979). That is, they are assumed to know exactly how equilibrium prices are determined and would only infer information from markets with reference to that price model. Radner (1979) showed that, under asymmetric information, equilibrium only existed generically in this setting. We now drop that so-called ""rational expectation"" assumption and study the existence of financial equilibrium when assets are numeraire. We show the existence of equilibrium is, then, characterized by the no-arbitrage condition on financial markets, as in De Boisdeffre (Econ Theory 31: 255-269, 2007), where assets are nominal. This result extends Geanakoplos-Polemarchakis' (Essays in Honor of K.J. Arrow, Starr & Starrett ed., Cambridge UP Vol. 3, 65-96, 1986) to the case of asymmetric information. Contrasting with Radner's, it shows that asymmetric and asymmetric information economies can be treated as two applications of a same model, where they share similar properties"
D52|Characterizing revealing and arbitrage-free financial markets|"Radner (1979) introduces a general equilibrium model of asymmetric information, where agents have a model ""of how equilibrum prices are determined"", without which they could not update their beliefs. Diferently, De Boisdeffre (2016, [3]) shows that agents, having private anticipations and no price model, can still update their beliefs from observing trade on financial markets, until all arbitrage is precluded. Then, inferences consist in successively eliminating anticipations, which would grant an unlimited arbitrage, if realizable. Thus, in our model, agents learn from arbitrage opportunities on portfolios, as they would do on actual markets. this model is consistent with all kinds of assets and uncountably many forecasts. We now characterize arbitrage-free markets, and show that the information markets may reveal depends on the span of asset payoffs in agents' commonly expected states. We provide conditions, under which markets are non-informative or typically revealing"
D52|A Market Based Solution for Fire Sales and Other Pecuniary Externalities|We show how bundling, exclusivity and additional markets internalize fire sale and other pecuniary externalities. Ex ante competition can achieve a constrained efficient allocation. The solution can be put rather simply: create segregated market exchanges which specify prices in advance and price the right to trade in these markets so that participant types pay, or are compensated, consistent with the market exchange they choose and that type's excess demand contribution to the price in that exchange. We do not need to identify and quantify some policy intervention. With the appropriate ex ante design we can let markets solve the problem.
D52|Temporary Migration and Endogenous Risk Sharing in Village India|When people can self-insure via migration, they may have less need for informal risk sharing. At the same time, informal insurance may reduce the need to migrate. To understand the joint determination of migration and risk sharing I study a dynamic model of risk sharing with limited commitment frictions and endogenous temporary migration. First, I characterize the model. I demonstrate theoretically how migration may decrease risk sharing. I decompose the welfare effect of migration into the change in income and the change in the endogenous structure of insurance. I then show how risk sharing alters the returns to migration. Second, I structurally estimate the model using the new (2001-2004) ICRISAT panel from rural India. The estimation yields: (1) improving access to risk sharing reduces migration by 21 percentage points; (2) reducing the cost of migration reduces risk sharing by 8 percentage points; (3) contrasting endogenous to exogenous risk sharing, the consumption-equivalent gain from reducing migration costs is 18.9 percentage points lower. Third, I introduce a rural employment scheme. The policy reduces migration and decreases risk sharing. The welfare gain of the policy is 55-70% lower after household risk sharing and migration responses are considered
D52|Public Debt as Private Liquidity: Optimal Policy|We study the Ramsey policy problem in an economy in which public debt contributes to the supply of assets that private agents can use as buffer stock and collateral, or as a vehicle of liquidity. Issuing more debt eases the underlying financial friction. This raises welfare by improving the allocation of resources; but it also tightens the government budget by raising the interest rate on public debt. In contrast to the literature on the Friedman rule, the government’s supply of liquidity becomes intertwined with its debt policy. In contrast to the standard Ramsey paradigm, a departure from tax smoothing becomes desirable. Novel insights emerge about the optimal long-run quantity of public debt; the optimal policy response to shocks; and the sense in which a financial crisis presents the government with an opportunity for cheap borrowing.
D52|Cross-Subsidization in Employer-Based Health Insurance and the Effects of Tax Subsidy Reform|Every individual buying employer-based health insurance receives a tax subsidy because premiums are excluded from taxable income. Since these premiums are independent of individual risk, high-risk individuals also receive implicit crosssubsidies from low-risk individuals. In this paper, we explore ways to reform the tax subsidy by taking this implicit cross-subsidization into account. Using a general equilibrium model, we find that targeting the tax subsidy can result in substantial savings. Specifically, the same level of risk-sharing can be achieved at one-third of current costs if the tax subsidy is targeted only toward low-risk individuals and premiums are age-adjusted.
D52|Boosting productivity through greater small business dynamism in Canada|Small business dynamism is a feature of an SME sector that contributes to overall productivity growth, not an end in itself. Such dynamism increases productivity growth by reallocating resources towards more productive firms and strengthening the diffusion of new technologies. Small business dynamism in Canada has declined in recent decades, as in other OECD countries, but overall it remains in the middle of the range, with some indicators above average and others below. Framework economic policies are generally supportive of small business dynamism, especially labour regulation, but there is scope to reduce regulatory barriers to product market competition. Canada has many programmes to support small businesses. Some of the largest programmes are not well focused on reducing market failures. Focusing support more on reducing clear market failures would increase the contribution of these programmes to productivity growth and living standards. This would likely entail redirecting support from small businesses in general to start-ups and young firms with innovative projects, which would boost small business dynamism. This Working Paper relates to the 2016 OECD Economic Survey of Canada (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-canada.htm) Augmenter la productivité en favorisant le dynamisme des petites entreprises au Canada Le dynamisme des petites entreprises n’est pas une fin en soi, mais un élément du secteur des PME qui concourt à la progression globale de la productivité. Il favorise les gains de productivité en redistribuant les ressources vers les entreprises les plus efficientes et en renforçant la diffusion des nouvelles technologies. Au Canada comme dans les autres pays de l’OCDE, le dynamisme des petites entreprises a été moindre ces dernières décennies, mais il reste dans une position médiane, certains indicateurs étant supérieurs à la moyenne de l’OCDE et d’autres inférieurs. Si le cadre de politique économique lui est en général propice, en particulier la réglementation du travail, il existe une marge de réduction des obstacles réglementaires à la concurrence sur les marchés de produits. Alors que de nombreux programmes ont vocation à aider les petites entreprises, certains des plus importants ne ciblent pas bien les défaillances du marché. En les axant davantage sur l’atténuation des dysfonctionnements manifestes, on ferait davantage contribuer ces programmes à la progression de la productivité et du niveau de vie. Il faudrait probablement pour cela réorienter l’aide des petites entreprises en général vers les start-ups et les entreprises de création récente dotées de projets innovants, ce qui donnerait une impulsion à ce segment de l'économie.

D52|Speculative Bubble Burst|Central to market fundamentals are three ideas: (1) Nominal money (2) Dividend (3) Existing stock. In connection with the cumulative dividend stream criterion of fundamental and noise movement, the conception of sequentially stable Markov process is grounded on the theory of bubbles.

D52|Zipf's Law: A Microfoundation|Existing explanations of Zipf's law (Pareto exponent approximately equal to 1) in size distributions require strong assumptions on growth rates or the minimum size. I show that Zipf's law naturally arises in general equilibrium when individual units solve a homogeneous problem (e.g., homothetic preferences, constant-returns-to-scale technology), the units enter/exit the economy at a small constant rate, and at least one production factor is in limited supply. My model explains why Zipf's law is empirically observed in the size distributions of cities and firms, which consist of people, but not in other quantities such as wealth, income, or consumption, which all have Pareto exponents well above 1.
D52|Like Father, Like Daughter (Unless There Is a Son): Sibling Sex Composition and Women's STEM Major Choice in College|We investigate the potential role of fathers in females' decision to choose a science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) major in college. The main innovation of our paper is to analyze how sibling sex composition affects the probability of being a STEM major in college for females whose fathers are in a STEM occupation. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), we find that, for females, having brother(s) significantly decreases the likelihood of choosing a STEM major in college when their fathers are also in a STEM occupation. The inclusion of variables pertaining to respondents' attitudes toward traditional gender roles, birth order, and the presence of an older brother as well as frequently used cognitive skill measures does not change the results. Thus, the observed effect appears to be driven by change in the college major preferences of females. We replicate the analysis using a more recent data set from the U.S. and data from Australia, and find similar results. Our findings suggest that fathers are much more likely to transmit occupation-specific tastes and preferences to their daughters in the absence of a son potentially, contributing to the persistence of the gender gap in STEM majors in college.
D52|Intergenerational Risk Trading and the Innovative Role of Equity- Wage Swaps|From a life cycle theory perspective, both young and old individuals may gain from a reallocation of equity and wage risk exposure between each other. However, current financial markets do not offer wage growth-linked securities and borrowing against labor income without collateral is difficult. To improve intergenerational risk reallocation, we propose a market-based voluntary risk trading arrangement between coexisting generations via an innovative swap market where participants trade equity-related returns for wage-linked returns, and vice versa. The maturity of the swap contract is restricted to one year to address the collateral issue. We find there is always a market for equity–wage swaps and the market-clearing premium will vary depending on multiple state variables (economy, demographics, and human and financial capital). This innovative swap market is effective at improving the welfare of all generations because the trading of wagelinked returns leads to a more complete market, enabling individuals to realize a more preferred risk exposure over their life cycles.
D52|Optimal Fiscal Policy in a Model with Uninsurable Idiosyncratic Shocks|This paper studies optimal taxation in an environment where heterogeneous households face uninsurable idiosyncratic risk. To do this, we formulate a Ramsey problem in a standard infinite horizon incomplete markets model. We solve numerically for the optimal path of proportional capital and labor income taxes, (possibly negative) lump-sum transfers, and government debt. The solution maximizes welfare along the transition between an initial steady state, calibrated to replicate key features of the US economy, and an endogenously determined final steady state. We find that in the optimal (utilitarian) policy: (i) capital income taxes are front-loaded hitting the imposed upper bound of 100 percent for 33 years before decreasing to 45 percent in the long-run; (ii) labor income taxes are reduced to less than half of their initial level, from 28 percent to about 13 percent in the long-run; and (iii) the government accumulates assets over time reducing the debt-to-output ratio from 63 percent to -17 percent in the long-run. Relative to keeping fiscal instruments at their initial levels, this leads to an average welfare gain equivalent to a permanent 4.9 percent increase in consumption. Even though non-distortive lump-sum taxes are available, the optimal plan has positive capital and labor taxes. Such taxes reduce the proportions of uncertain and unequal labor and capital incomes in total income, increasing welfare by providing insurance and redistribution. We quantify these welfare effects. We also show that calculating the entire transition path (as opposed to considering steady states only) is quantitatively important. Implementing the policy that maximizes welfare in steady state leads to a welfare loss of 6.4 percent once transitory effects are accounted for.
D52|Securitized Markets and International Capital Flows|"We study the effect of collateralized lending and securitization on international net and gross capital flows, growth, welfare, and inequality in a two country general equilibrium model with idiosyncratic investment risk. The financial sectors in the two countries, Home and Foreign, differ by the collateral requirement for investment loans, with Home requiring lower margins. In autarky, Home has higher interest rates, which enables more risk sharing through increased state contingency of collateralized loan contracts. Upon financial integration, capital flows from Foreign to Home, leading to lower interest rates, less risk sharing (more inequality), higher investment levels, and economic growth in Home. Despite low growth, Foreign enjoys substantial welfare gains through better risk sharing opportunities. The capital flows are driven by the greater endogenous supply of ""safe-enough"" assets by Home and the demand for those assets by Foreign."
D52|Incomplete Markets and Aggregate Demand|I study aggregate consumption dynamics under incomplete markets, focusing on the relationship between consumption and the path for interest rates. I first provide a general aggregation result under extreme illiquidity (no borrowing and no outside assets), deriving a generalized Euler relation involving the real interest rate, current and future aggregate consumption. This provides a tractable way of incorporating incomplete markets in macroeconomic models, dealing only with aggregates. Although this relation does not necessarily coincide with the standard representative-agent Euler equation, I show that it does for an important benchmark specification. When this is the case, idiosyncratic uncertainty and incomplete markets leave their imprint by affecting the discount factor in this representation, but the sensitivity of consumption to current and future interest rates is unaffected. An immediate corollary is that “forward guidance” (lower future interest rates) is as powerful as in representative agent models. I show that the same representation holds with positive liquidity (borrowing and outside assets) when utility is logarithmic. I show that away from these benchmark cases, consumption is likely to become more sensitive to interest rate, and especially future interest rates. Finally, I apply my approach to a real business cycle economy, providing an exact analytical aggregation result that complements existing numerical results.
D52|Hard or Soft? The Politics of Brexit|The British people voted for Brexit for a variety of reasons. A literature is emerging that seeks to explain the outcome using the increasing amount of aggregate and individual data being generated. Less often considered is the impact those factors that shaped the referendum outcome might continue to exert on the debate about the UK's future relationship with the EU. We argue that they will continue to weigh on political debates. The continued resonance of the Leave message militates against anything but what has come to be known as a â€˜hard Brexitâ€™.
D52|Counterparty risk and funding: immersion and beyond|Abstract In Crépey (Math. Finance 25:23–50, 2015), a basic reduced-form counterparty risk modelling approach was introduced under a standard immersion hypothesis between a reference filtration and the filtration progressively enlarged by the default times of the two parties. This basic setup, with a related continuity assumption on some of the data at the first default time of the two parties, is too restrictive for wrong-way and gap risk applications, such as counterparty risk on credit derivatives. This paper introduces an extension of the basic approach, implements it through marked default times and applies it to counterparty risk on credit derivatives.
D52|Market structure, outer versus inner competition: the case of Italy’s credit coop banks|Abstract Studying banking networks designed to achieve scale economies for their members, we argue that “inner” competition—competition inside network members—may be inefficient vis-à-vis “outer” competition—competition with outsiders. Testing our hypothesis on branch-level loan productivity per employee at the Banche di Credito Cooperativo (BCCs), Italy’s network of mutual cooperative banks, we find that BCC monopoly always dominates BCC duopoly. Moreover, productivity is generally higher in situations of either BCC monopoly or BCC facing only outer competition vis-à-vis situations exhibiting (also) inner competition. The policy implication is that limits to inner rivalry seem efficiency improving in cooperative banking networks.
D52|Incomplete financial markets and jumps in asset prices|Abstract For incomplete financial markets, jumps in both prices and consumption can be unavoidable. We consider pure-exchange economies with infinite horizon, discrete time, uncertainty with a continuum of possible shocks at every date. The evolution of shocks follows a Markov process, and fundamentals depend continuously on shocks. It is shown that: (1) equilibria exist; (2) for effectively complete financial markets, asset prices depend continuously on shocks; and (3) for incomplete financial markets, there is an open set of economies $${\fancyscript{U}}$$ U such that for every equilibrium of every economy in $${\fancyscript{U}}$$ U , asset prices at every date depend discontinuously on the shock at that date.
D52|Partially revealing rational expectations equilibrium with real assets and binding constraints|Abstract This paper studies partially revealing rational expectations equilibria. In a setting with a finite state space and a competitive market for real assets, there exists an open set of economies with such equilibria. They arise when informed agents have corner solutions. When partially revealing and fully revealing equilibria coexist, all Pareto constellations are possible: The partially revealing may Pareto dominate the fully revealing, the fully revealing may Pareto dominate the partially revealing, or the two cannot be Pareto ranked.
D52|The Lindahl equilibrium in Schumpeterian growth models|The main motivation of the paper is to determine the social value of innovations in a standard scale-invariant Schumpeterian growth model, which explicitly introduces knowledge diffusion over a Salop (Bell J Econ 10(1):141–156 1979 ) circle. The social value of an innovation is defined as the optimal value of the knowledge inherent in this innovation. We thus have to price optimally knowledge. For that purpose, contrary to what is done in standard growth theory, we complete the markets using Lindahl prices for knowledge. The Lindahl equilibrium, which provides the system of prices that sustains the first-best social optimum in an economy with non rival goods, appears as a benchmark. First, its comparison with the standard Schumpeterian equilibrium à la Aghion and Howitt (Econometrica (60)2:323–351 1992 ) enables us to shed a new light on the issue of non-optimality of the latter. Second, the Lindahl equilibrium also allows us to revisit the issue of R&D incentives in presence of cumulative innovations. Finally, this benchmark may be a first step to understand how knowledge is exchanged in new technology sectors. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016
D52|Using elasticities to derive optimal bankruptcy exemptions|This paper studies the optimal determination of bankruptcy exemptions for risk averse borrowers who use unsecured contracts but have the possibility of defaulting. I show that, in a large class of economies, knowledge of four variables is sufficient to determine whether a bankruptcy exemption level is optimal, or should be increased or decreased. These variables are: the sensitivity to the exemption level of the interest rate schedule offered by lenders to borrowers, the borrowers’ leverage, the borrowers’ bankruptcy probability, and the change in bankrupt borrowers’ consumption. An application of the framework to US data suggests that the optimal bankruptcy exemption is higher than the current average bankruptcy exemption, but of the same order of magnitude.

D52|Characterizing Revealing and Arbitrage-Free Financial Markets|"Radner (Econometrica 47: 655-678, 1979) introduces a general equilibrium model of asymmetric information where ""agents have a 'model' or 'expectations' of how equilibrium prices are determined"". They would only infer private information of other agents from comparing actual prices and price forecasts with their theoretical values at a price revealing equilibrium. De Boisde¤re (Economic Theory Bulletin 4(1), 2016) shows that agents having private anticipations and no price model may still update their beliefs from observing trade on financial markets, until all arbitrage is precluded. The informational refinement consists in successively eliminating anticipations, which would grant an unlimited arbitrage, if realizable. Thus, agents simply observe, respond and learn from arbitrage opportunities on portfolios, as they would do on actual markets. This model is consistent with all kinds of assets and uncountably many forecasts. We now study markets, which preclude arbitrage, and show the information markets may convey depends on the span of asset payoffs in agents' commonly expected states. We provide conditions, under which markets are non informative, or, typically, partially or fully revealing."
D52|Social Health Insurance: A Quantitative Exploration|We quantify the welfare implications of three alternative approaches to providing social health insurance: (i) a mix of private and public health insurance (US-style), (ii) compulsory universal public health insurance (UPHI), and (iii) private health insurance for workers combined with government subsidies and price regulation. We use a Bewley-Grossman lifecycle model calibrated to match the lifecycle structure of earnings and health risks in the US. For all three systems we find that welfare gains triggered by a combination of improvements in risk sharing and wealth redistribution dominate welfare losses caused by tax distortions and ex-post moral hazard effects. Overall, the UPHI system outperforms the other two systems in terms of welfare gains if the coinsurance rate is properly designed. A switch from the US system to a well-designed UPHI system results in large welfare gains. However, such a radical reform faces political impediments due to opposing welfare effects across different income groups.
D52|Production and Endogenous Bankruptcy under Collateral Constraints|"We propose an extension of the incomplete markets general equilibrium model with production to situations in which firms default. In the model, firms are assumed to be owned by a single individual whose roles as entrepreneur and consumer are anonymous. Assets are exogenously collateralised and are seized together with future output in case of defaulting. Default is thus endogenous as output determines the deliveries from the assets issued. In turn, the receipts from each asset purchased are assumed to depend on a fraction of the firm's output. This fraction is assumed to be anonymous and is treated as given by individuals who will anticipate it, in equilibrium, as a fraction of the whole output of the economy, generating counter-cyclical default. We show that, under usual assumptions on utilities and technologies, an equilibrium always exists. We then discuss the implications of this setting for Fisher's ""separation theorem"" and the irrelevance of the financial policies of the firm."
D52|Debt Collateralization, Structured Finance, and the CDS Basis|We study how the ability to use risky debt as collateral in funding markets affects the CDS basis. We use a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents, collateralized financial promises, and multiple states of uncertainty. We show that a positive basis emerges when risky assets and their derivative risky debt contracts can be used as collateral for additional financial promises. Additionally, because a risky asset can always serve as collateral for more promises than its derivative debt contracts can, the basis for a risky asset will always differ from the basis for its derivative risky debt.

D52|Debt Collateralization, Capital Structure, and Maximal Leverage|We study how allowing agents to use debt as collateral affects asset prices, leverage, and interest rates in a general equilibrium, heterogeneous-agent model with collateralized financial contracts and multiple states of uncertainty. In the absence of debt collateralization, multiple contracts are traded in equilibrium, with some agents borrowing using risky debt and others borrowing with risk-free debt. When agents can use debt contracts as collateral to borrow from other agents, margin requirements decrease, asset prices increase, and the interest rate on risky debt decreases. We characterize equilibrium for N states and L levels of debt collateralization and prove that enough levels of debt collateralization creates an equilibrium featuring maximal leverage on all debt contracts. In the dynamic model, debt collateralization creates larger asset price volatility.
D52|Securitized markets, international capital flows, and global welfare|We study the effect of collateralized lending and securitization on international capital flows and welfare in a two-country general equilibrium model with idiosyncratic investment risk. The low-margin country (Home) endogenously supplies more safe assets and enables more risk sharing. Upon financial integration, capital flows from Foreign (high-margin country) to Home, leading to lower interest rates and a larger global supply of safe assets. Unlike in standard models with partial equity issuance, in our model, Home can lose from financial integration due to the endogenous reduction in risk sharing and aggregate shocks can generate large gross capital flows.
D52|Prolonged Reserves Accumulation, Credit Booms, Asset Prices and Monetary Policy in Asia| This article examines past evidence of prolonged periods of foreign exchange reserves accumulation in the Asia-Pacific region. Several proxies for this unobserved variable are considered, including a newly proposed one based on a factor model. We focus on identifying periods of prolonged interventions and identify its key macro-financial determinants. Two broad conclusions emerge from the stylized facts and the econometric evidence. First, the best protection against costly reserves accumulation is a more flexible exchange rate. Second, the necessity to accumulate reserves as a bulwark against goods price inflation is misplaced. Instead, there is a strong link between asset price movements and the likelihood of accumulating foreign exchange reserves that are costly. Policy implications are also drawn.
D52|Monetary Policy and Welfare in a Currency Union|What are the welfare gains from being in a currency union? I explore this question in the context of a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with monetary barriers to trade, local currency pricing and incomplete markets. The model generates a trade off between monetary independence and monetary union. On one hand, distinct national monetary authorities with separate currencies can address business cycles in a countryspecific way, which is not possible for a single central bank. On the other hand, short-run violations of the law of one price and long-run losses of international trade occur if different currencies are adopted, due to the inertia of prices in local currencies and to the presence of trade frictions. I quantify the welfare gap between these two international monetary arrangements in consumption equivalents over the lifetime of households, and decompose it into the contributions of di.erent frictions. I show that the welfare ordering of alternative currency systems depends crucially on the international correlation of macroeconomic shocks and on the strength of the monetary barriers affecting trade with separate currencies. I estimate the model on data from Italy, France, Germany and Spain using standard Bayesian tools, and I find that the trade off is resolved in favour of a currency union among these countries.
D52|Short Sales, Destruction of Resources, Welfare|A reduction in the output of productive assets (trees) in some states of the world can expand the span of payoffs of assets and, improved risk sharing may compensate for the loss of output and support a Pareto superior allocation. Surprisingly, if short sales of assets are not allowed, improved risk sharing that results from the destruction of output does not suffice to induce a Pareto superior allocation.

D52|Access to Credit and Investment Decisions of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in China: Size Matters|Financial constraints are common in developing countries where financial systems are underdeveloped. In China, firms report that access to finance is the most important obstacle in the business environment. This is related to firms that fail to gain access to the credit market. We examine the likelihood of gaining access to credit by firms, and find that size and exporting appear to be the key characteristics. Credit constraints are significant for investment decisions. Together with size, access to credit is among the firm characteristics with the greatest impact on the likelihood to invest.
D52|Idiosyncratic Risk, Borrowing Constraints and Financial Integration - A Discussion of Ambiguous Results|This paper examines the effects of financial market imperfections in the context of financial integration. We employ a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous entrepreneurs and address the question of cross-border capital flows from poor to rich as well as focus on aggregate capital accumulation, output and welfare. The motivation is based on the mixed results from the existing literature. We add to this debate by discussing the effects from a general perspective in an environment where entrepreneurs face capital risk, earn risky profits and receive riskless wage income. Moreover, borrowing constraints hinder consumption smoothing as well as restrict the access to external funds for scaling up individual production. In order to separate the distinct effects, we consider several scenarios. In the first scenario without binding borrowing constraints and no persistent effects of shocks, we overcome the restriction that no analytical solution is available by deriving two rules of thumb, predicting the outcome of the model with high accuracy. These rules explain under which condition the less financially developed country features lower levels of capital and output in the autarchic steady state, implying capital flows from poor to rich, as well as under which condition an increase in the interest rate implied by financial integration unambiguously leads to larger levels of capital and output in the integrated steady state. For plausible parametrizations, we find that both conditions are likely to hold. In the next steps, we add tight borrowing constraints and increase the persistence of shocks. Both changes strongly affect the results derived in the first scenario.
D52|On the optimal quantity of liquid bonds|We develop a dynamic general equilibrium model to analyze the optimal quantity of liquid bonds by investigating the following three questions: under what conditions is it socially desirable to contract the bond supply, what incentive problems are mitigated by doing this, and how large are the effects? We show that reducing the bond supply induces agents to increase their demand for money, which can enhance welfare by improving the allocation of the medium of exchange. However, this effect fails for high inflation rates, because agents hold so little money in the first place that manipulating the bond supply is not enough to correct the misallocation.
D52|The role of trading frictions in financial markets|We develop a dynamic general equilibrium model to analyze the role of trading frictions in over-the-counter markets. In our model, agents face idiosyncratic preference shocks and a financial market allows them to rebalance their portfolio composed of money and bonds in response to these shocks. We disentangle the effects of search and bargaining on welfare and study each one of them. We show that bargaining is generally welfare-improving, while search frictions are not. This is because search frictions do not only affect the demand for the respective assets, but also their allocation.
D52|Optimal Taxation and Debt with Uninsurable Risks to Human Capital Accumulation|We consider an economy where individuals face uninsurable risks to their human capital accumulation and analyze the optimal level of linear taxes on capital and labor income together with the optimal path of government debt. We show that in the presence of such risks, it is beneficial to tax both labor and capital and to issue public debt. We also assess the quantitative importance of these findings, and show that the benefits of government debt and capital taxes both increase with the magnitude of idiosyncratic risks and the degree of relative risk aversion.

D52|Happiness and the Persistence of Income Shocks|We reassess the empirical effects of income and employment on self-reported well-being. Our analysis makes use of a two-step estimation procedure that allows us to apply instrumental variable regressions with ordinal observable data. As suggested by the theory of incomplete markets, we differentiate between the effects of persistent and transitory income shocks. In line with this theory, we find that persistent shocks have a significant impact on happiness while transitory shocks do not. This also has consequences for inference about the happiness effect of employment. We find that employment per se is associated with a nonsignificant decline in happiness. (JEL D12, D52, I31, J22)
D52|Risk Sharing With Limited Commitment And Preference Heterogeneity: Structural Estimation And Testing| In order to analyze the role of limited commitment and preference heterogeneity in explaining the consumption allocation, I propose a theoretical and empirical framework to estimate and evaluate a risk-sharing model where insurance transfers have to be self-enforcing and the coefficient of relative risk aversion may depend on observable household characteristics. I compare this model to benchmark models with full commitment and/or without preference heterogeneity using data from three Indian villages. I find that the limited commitment model with heterogeneous preferences outperforms the benchmark models in a statistical sense and in terms of (i) explaining the dynamic response of consumption to idiosyncratic income shocks, (ii) accounting for the variation of consumption unexplained by household and time effects, and (iii) capturing the variation of inequality across time and villages and predicting changes in inequality. I also use the estimated models to predict the effects of a counterfactual tax and transfer policy on the consumption allocation. The limited commitment model with preference heterogeneity predicts larger benefits to the poor than its homogeneous counterpart. (JEL: C52, D10, D52)
D52|Approximating Equilibria with Ex-Post Heterogeneity and Aggregate Risk|Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models with ex-post heterogeneity due to idiosyncratic risk have to be solved numerically. This is a nontrivial task as the cross-sectional distribution of endogenous variables becomes an element of the state space due to aggregate risk. Existing global solution methods have assumed bounded rationality in terms of a parametric law of motion of aggregate variables in order to reduce dimensionality. In this paper, we remove that assumption and compute a fully rational equilibrium dependent on the whole cross-sectional distribution. Dimensionality is tackled by polynomial chaos expansions, a projection technique for square-integrable random variables, resulting in a nonparametric law of motion. We establish conditions under which our method converges and approximation error bounds. Economically, we find that the bounded rationality assumption leads to significantly more inequality than in a fully rational equilibrium. Furthermore, more risk sharing in form of redistribution can lead to higher systemic risk.

D52|La génesis de la Economía de la Salud en Kenneth Arrow (1963)|Resumen: Kenneth J. Arrow es uno de los economistas más destacados del siglo XX. Sus preocupaciones sobre el equilibrio competitivo y la optimalidad bajo condiciones de incertidumbre lo llevaron a publicar en 1963 el artículo “Uncertainty and the welfare economics of medical care”, reconocido como la génesis de la Economía de la Salud. En este ensayo se rinde un homenaje a esta obra, develando el plan intelectual para el análisis de bienestar de las prestaciones médicas, discutiendo la vigencia de los planteamientos originales y destacando sus principales implicaciones en cuanto a los temas objeto de análisis y discusión. La tesis central de Arrow sobre la imposibilidad del mercado para alcanzar una asignación eficiente sigue vigente debido, especialmente, a la incertidumbre respecto a la incidencia de enfermedades. Además del debate sobre Estado-mercado, a partir de Arrow se discuten las implicaciones de asuntos como la información asimétrica, el riesgo moral y las normas sociales.
D52|The Dynamics of Financially Constrained Arbitrage|We develop a model in which financially constrained arbitrageurs exploit price discrepancies across segmented markets. We show that the dynamics of arbitrage capital are self‐correcting: following a shock that depletes capital, returns increase, which allows capital to be gradually replenished. Spreads increase more for trades with volatile fundamentals or more time to convergence. Arbitrageurs cut their positions more in those trades, except when volatility concerns the hedgeable component. Financial constraints yield a positive cross‐sectional relationship between spreads/returns and betas with respect to arbitrage capital. Diversification of arbitrageurs across markets induces contagion, but generally lowers arbitrageurs' risk and price volatility.
D52|Capital Taxes, Labor Taxes and the Household|We study the impact of capital and labor taxation in an economy where couples bargain over the intrahousehold allocation under limited commitment. In this framework more wealth improves commitment and gives rise to insurance gains within the household. Our theory motivates these gains by the empirical observation that wealth, in contrast to labor income, is a commonly held resource within households. Based on this observation we study whether eliminating capital taxes from the economy, and raising labor taxes to balance the government’s budget, may generate welfare gains to married households. We illustrate that the quantitative effects from this reform are rather small. We attribute the small effects to the life cycle pattern of wealth accumulation and to the impact of labor income taxes on household risk sharing: In particular, we show that higher labor taxes may make the limited commitment friction more severe, even though they may make the distribution of labor income more equitable within the household.

D52|Public versus private provision of liquidity: Is there a trade-off?|To what extent is public debt private liquidity? Much policy advice given in the aftermath of the financial crisis rests on the assumption that increasing public debt relaxes borrowing constraints of private households. This is the case for ad-hoc debt limits, which are exogenous to public policy. Instead, if debt limits are fully endogenous, as e.g. in the case of the natural borrowing limit, public debt has no impact. We assume that borrowing limits arise because of limited contract enforceability and are therefore determined as equilibrium outcomes. Using an incomplete markets economy in which households are subject to uninsurable earnings shocks, we show that public debt provides some liquidity, but less so than it would if constraints were imposed ad-hoc. We show that generating borrowing constraints as an equilibrium outcome substantially alters the answers to other important questions, such as for the welfare effects of government debt or its impact on real economic activity.
D52|Approximate dynamic programming with post-decision states as a solution method for dynamic economic models|I introduce and evaluate a new stochastic simulation method for dynamic economic models. It is based on recent work in the operations research and engineering literatures (Van Roy et al., 1997; Powell, 2007; Bertsekas, 2011), but also had an early application in economics (Wright and Williams, 1982, 1984). The baseline method involves rewriting the household׳s dynamic program in terms of post-decision states. This makes it possible to choose controls optimally without computing an expectation. I add a subroutine to the original algorithm that updates the values of states not visited frequently on the simulation path; and adopt a stochastic stepsize that efficiently weights information. Finally, I modify the algorithm to exploit GPU computing.

D52|Equilibrium option pricing: A Monte Carlo approach|This paper presents a novel Monte Carlo method for option pricing that is based on a general equilibrium model. The advantage of the method compared to the standard risk-neutral pricing approach is that it does not require the specification of a market price of risk, making the method particularly suitable for pricing in incomplete markets. The method produces a strongly consistent estimator for the option price which exhibits the same error convergence rate as the standard risk-neutral pricing Monte Carlo approach. For illustration, the procedure is applied to the pricing of options under stochastic volatility.
D52|Analytical pricing of vulnerable options under a generalized jump–diffusion model|In this paper we propose a model to price European vulnerable options. We formulate their credit risk in a reduced form model and the dynamics of the spot price in a completely random generalized jump–diffusion model, which nests a number of important models in finance. We obtain a closed-form price for the vulnerable option by (1) determining an equivalent martingale measure, using the Esscher transform and (2) manipulating the pay-off structure of the option four further times, by using the Esscher–Girsanov transform.
D52|Asset pricing with arbitrage activity|We study an economy populated by three groups of myopic agents: constrained agents subject to a portfolio constraint that limits their risk taking, unconstrained agents subject to a standard nonnegative wealth constraint, and arbitrageurs with access to a credit facility. Such credit is valuable as it allows arbitrageurs to exploit the limited arbitrage opportunities that emerge endogenously in reaction to the demand imbalance generated by the portfolio constraint. The model is solved in closed-form, and we show that, in contrast to existing models with frictions and logarithmic agents, arbitrage activity has an impact on the price level and generates both excess volatility and the leverage effect. We show that these results are due to the fact that arbitrageurs amplify fundamental shocks by levering up in good times and deleveraging in bad times.
D52|Welfare costs of reclassification risk in the health insurance market|We assess the quantitative importance of reclassification risk in the US health insurance market. Reclassification risk arises because the health conditions of individuals evolve over time, while a typical health insurance contract only lasts for one year. Thus, a change in the health status can lead to a significant change in the health insurance premium. We measure welfare gains from introducing explicit insurance against this risk in the form of guaranteed renewable health insurance contracts. We find that in the current institutional environment individuals are well-sheltered against reclassification risk and they only moderately gain from having access to these contracts. More specifically, we show that employer-sponsored health insurance and public means-tested transfers play an important role in providing implicit insurance against reclassification risk. If these institutions are removed, the average welfare gains from having access to guaranteed renewable contracts exceed 4% of the annual consumption.
D52|Real wages and monetary policy: a DSGE approach|Purpose - – Studies of the cyclical behavior of real wages have identified monetary shocks and examined the response of real wages and output or employment. A finding that real wages are procyclical in response to a positive monetary policy shock is taken as evidence that prices are stickier than wages. The purpose of this paper is to show that factors other than wage and price stickiness affect the response of real wages to a monetary policy shock. Design/methodology/approach - – The authors simulate two prominent dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models under a variety of parameter values and examine the cyclicality of the real wage. Findings - – The authors offer robust evidence that the real wage response to monetary policy is affected in important ways by properties of the economy other than stickiness of wages and prices, such as the importance of intermediate goods in the production process and the size of key elasticities. Consequently, the authors cannot appropriately infer the relative stickiness of wages and prices from examining only the response of real wages to a monetary policy shock. Originality/value - – The authors show in this study that examining the response of real wages is not enough to sort out the relative stickiness of prices and wages.
D52|Majority Voting: A Quantitative Investigation|We study the tax systems that arise in a once-and-for-all majority voting equilibrium embedded within a macroeconomic model of inequality. We find that majority voting delivers (i) a small set of outcomes, (ii) zero labor income taxation, and (iii) nearly zero transfers. We find that majority voting, contrary to the literature developed in models without idiosyncratic risk, is quite powerful at restricting outcomes; however, it also delivers predictions inconsistent with observed tax systems.
D52|Optimal Food Price Stabilization in a Small Open Developing Country|This paper analyzes the use of storage and trade policies to achieve food price stabilization in a small open developing country. Optimal stabilization policies are identified using a rational expectations storage model with risk-averse consumers and incomplete markets. Without public intervention, price dynamics are driven by domestic productive shocks and international prices. On its own, an optimal storage policy is found to be detrimental to consumers because its stabilizing benefits leak to the world market. In contrast, an optimal combination of storage and trade policies results in a powerful stabilization of domestic food prices. However, such an optimal combination is shown to entail two serious drawbacks: its distributive impacts are large compared to its efficiency benefits, and by distorting excess supply curves, it may aggravate high world price episodes.
D52|Human Capital Risk, Contract Enforcement, and the Macroeconomy|We use microdata to show that young households with children are underinsured against the risk that an adult member of the household dies. This empirical finding can be explained by a macroeconomic model with human capital risk, age-dependent returns to human capital investment, and endogenous borrowing constraints due to limited contract enforcement. When calibrated, the model quantitatively accounts for the observed life-cycle variation in life insurance holdings, financial wealth, earnings, and consumption inequality. The model also predicts that reforms making consumer bankruptcy more costly will substantially increase the volume of both credit and insurance. (JEL D14, D91, G22, J13, J24)
D52|A case for incomplete markets|If two rational agents want to trade and there are no externalities, then trade is Pareto improving. Economists generally oppose restrictions on such trade. Complete markets allocations are Pareto optimal and thus complete markets are generally viewed as good. But when individuals want to trade because of heterogeneous beliefs, this standard argument is less compelling. We illustrate this in a standard general equilibrium setting and explore potential social benefits from restrictions on trade that make markets incomplete.
D52|Price revelation and existence of financial equilibrium with incomplete markets and private beliefs|We consider a pure exchange financial economy, where rational agents, possibly asymmetrically informed, forecast prices privately with no model of how they are determined. Therefore, agents face both ‘exogenous uncertainty’ on the future state of nature, and ‘endogenous uncertainty’ on the future price. At a sequential equilibrium, all consumers expect the ‘true’ price as a possible outcome and elect optimal strategies at the first period, which clear on all markets ex post. The paper's purpose is twofold. First, it defines no-arbitrage prices, which comprise all equilibrium prices, and displays their revealing properties. Second, it shows under mild conditions, that a sequential equilibrium always exists in this model, whatever agents' prior beliefs or the financial structure. This outcome suggests that standard existence problems, which followed Hart [1975] and Radner [1979], stem from the national expectation and perfect foresight assumptions of the classical model
D52|Dropping rational expectations|We had proposed earlier a general equilibrium model with incomplete financial markets and asymmetric information, where agents forecasted prices privately without rational expectations. Consistently, they anticipated idiosyncratic sets of future prices and elected probability laws on these sets, that we called beliefs. Under mild conditions and differently from Hart [1975] and Radner [1979] equilibrium always existed in this model, as long as agents' anticipations precluded arbitrage. The joint determination of equilibrium prices and beliefs is traditionally seen as a rational expectation problem. Hereafter, we suggest it may be otherwise. We propose to show that agents, whose prior anticipation sets yield an arbitrage, may update their expectations from observing trade opportunities on financial markets. With no price to be observed, they eventually infer smaller arbitrage-free anticipation sets, which can not be narrowed down any further. Once these sets are attained, equilibrium prices may change if agents change their beliefs, but they will convey the same information
D52|Surrogate Investment System|"The article addresses the crucial patterns of redistribution of earnings from effective businesses to ineffective ones, first of all to those closely affiliated with the federal government. The authors concentrate on analysing of what they call a ""surrogate (Ersatz) investment system"" build up in between the federal budget and big corporations and composed of financial institutions, specialized agencies, free economic zones, and some other elements. They argue that a deep understanding of surrogate investment system’s essence and features is one of the main prerequisites for advancement of the overall effectiveness of Russia’s national economy."
D52|Feast or Famine: The Welfare Impact of Food Price Controls in Nazi Germany|How good was the standard of living in pre-war Nazi Germany? Some historians have argued that household food consumption in the 1930s was at least as high as in the Weimar Republic, in spite of militarisation. This article provides new evidence against this view by demonstrating that food price controls significantly distorted consumption patterns. We estimate that involuntary substitution effects cost average working-class households 7% of their disposable income. Consumer welfare in Nazi Germany was thus meaningfully lower than observed consumption levels and prices suggest. Our finding is based on microeconometric welfare analysis of detailed budget data for 4,376 individual German households surveyed in 1927 and 1937.
