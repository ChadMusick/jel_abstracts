J42|The urban wage premium in imperfect labour markets|Using administrative data for West Germany, we investigate whether part of the urban wage premium stems from fierce competition in thick labour markets. We first document fewer search frictions in denser labour markets. We further show that controlling for search frictions lowers the wage premium from a one standard deviation rise in log population density by 1.3 1.4pp in specifications including worker fixed effects. We lastly find less monopsony power in denser markets. Regional differences in monopsony power predict a wage premium of 1.4 1.9%, thereby accounting for the observed drop in the premium when controlling for labour market frictions.
J42|Employment Protection and Firm-provided Training: Quasi-experimental Evidence from a Labour Market Reform|In 2012 a labour market reform, known as Fornero Law, substantially reduced firing restrictions for firms with more than 15 employees in Italy. The results from a difference in regression discontinuities design that compares firms below versus those above the cut-off before and after the reform demonstrate that, after the Fornero Law, the number of trained workers increased in firms just above the threshold, with an order of magnitude of approximately 1.5 additional workers in our preferred empirical specification. We show that this effect might be partly explained by the reduction in worker turnover and a lower use of temporary contracts at the threshold after the reform. Our study highlights the counter-intuitive and potentially adverse effects of employment protection legislation (EPL) on training in dual labour markets due to larger firms seeking to avoid the higher costs of EPL by means of temporary contracts.
J42|Les pratiques d’activité réduite et leurs impacts sur les trajectoires professionnelles : une revue de la littérature|The reduced-activity system aims to diminish the disincentive effects of unemployment benefits by allowing jobseekers to combine paid activity and job search, and at the same time to gain at least partial unemployment benefits as well as the wage for this activity. Our review of the theoretical and empirical literature seeks to determine whether this system (which only concerns temporary or part-time jobs) allows a sustainable integration into the labour market. It shows that the expected theoretical effects on the career trajectories of job seekers and on the quality of new jobs are ambiguous and require empirical investigations. National and international empirical studies then highlight the need to distinguish between short-term and long-term effects and that there is a strong heterogeneity of impacts between job seekers. Nevertheless, in France, reduced activities seem to boost access to long-term jobs, but with mild effects. However, they do not seem to improve or to damage the quality of the subsequent job.

J42|Labor Market Power|As U.S. Senator Corey A. Booker wrote in an open letter to the acting Attorney General and Acting Chairman of the FTC, ``A growing body of evidence suggests that the rise of concentration across U.S. industries has helped create a labor market in which fewer workers are able to fairly bargain with their employers to set their wages on competitive terms.''\footnote{See the article and link to Senator Booker's letter here: \citet{booker2017market}, \url{https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/1/16571992/booker-antitrust-letter}} Similarly, \citet{furman2016beyond} calls for additional research on the affects of labor market concentration on wages and job flows. \textbf{Objective:} The aim of our project is to measure the impact of labor market power amongst employers on employment, wages, investment, and labor market flows. \textbf{Contribution:} Recent studies have focused almost exclusively on the role of product market power as measured by national sales concentration (e.g. \citet{gutierrez2016investment}, \citet{autor2017fall} and \citet{de2017rise}). Studies that have thought about input market power---a more local phenomenon when inputs are non-traded, such as labor---have focused on relatively narrow industries (for a summary of the recent theory see \citet{manning2003monopsony} and for a summary of recent empirics see Section 4.2 in \citet{alan2011imperfect}). Our contribution is to develop an identification strategy which isolates the affects of labor market power (e.g. \textit{monopsony} and \textit{oligopsony}) on employment, wages, investment, and labor market flows for a broad range of industries. We measure the impact of labor market power on wages using a novel identification strategy. The insight is to isolate firms that are in tradable sectors (e.g. textiles, manufacturing etc.) and then use within-firm variation in market power across regions after a merger. For measurement and identification of mergers, wages, and job flows, we plan to use the LEHD and LBD Census micro-data (we currently have active RDC projects with access to both datasets). By focusing on tradable sectors, we remove the role of product market power. Prices are set outside of the local labor market, and so a merger will not alter prices or product market power. However, the merger will change the number of employers who are hiring within a given region, thus altering labor market power. This allows us to pinpoint the impact of monopsony and oligopsony on the real economy. We develop a model of oligopsony in the labor market, adapting the \citet{atkeson2008pricing} model of imperfect product market competition to a general equilibrium labor market. We model a finite number of firms that hire within a given industry in a given region. The model yields several testable implications: \begin{enumerate} \item The wage bill and employment decline as labor markets become more concentrated. \item Pass-through to wages from idiosyncratic shocks to the firm decrease as labor markets become more concentrated. \end{enumerate}
J42|Labor-Market Concentration and Labor Compensation|This paper estimates the effect of labor-market concentration on labor compensation across the U.S. private sector since 2000. We distinguish between concentration in local labor markets versus local product markets, guarding against bias from confounded product-market concentration. Analysis extends beyond wages to rates of employment-based health insurance coverage. Estimates suggest negative effects of labor-market concentration on labor compensation. This comes through both reducing the human-capital level of those in the market and reducing pay conditional on human-capital level. Higher product-market concentration exacerbates and higher unionization rates mitigates these effects.
J42|Monopsony Power and Guest Worker Programs|Guest workers on visas in the United States may be unable to quit bad employers due to barriers to mobility and a lack of labor market competition. Using H-1B, H-2A, and H-2B program data, we calculate the concentration of employers in geographically defined labor markets within occupations. We find that many guest workers face moderately or highly concentrated labor markets, based on federal merger scrutiny guidelines, and that concentration generally decreases wages. For example, moving from a market with an HHI of zero to a market comprised of two employers lowers H-1B worker wages approximately 10 percent, and a pure monopsony (one employer) reduces wages by 13 percent. A simulation shows that wages under pure monopsony could be 47 percent lower, suggesting that employers do not use the extent of their monopsony power. Enforcing wage regulations and decreasing barriers to mobility may better address issues of exploitation than antitrust scrutiny.
J42|How Stable Is Labour Market Dualism? Reforms of Employment Protection in Nine European Countries|Labour market segmentation currently is at the forefront of national and European policy debates. While the European Commission and the OECD try to promote what they see as more inclusive policies, academic observers remain skeptical. Particularly the dualisation literature points to stable political economy equilibria that stack the cards against overcoming divisions between labour market insiders and outsiders. Other contributions point to a more dynamic political setting, in which negative feedback effects tend to challenge any 'dualisation consensus'. Against this background, this paper traces recent reform trajectories in a diverse group of European countries that are characterised by a high share of temporary employment: France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden. Our case studies show that recent reforms of employment regulation are characterised by much more dynamism than one would expect based on the experiences of the two preceding decades - or based on dualisation or insider-outsider theory. The reform trajectories are characterised by rather contradictory approaches, sometimes in close succession. This even includes, in several cases, substantive deregulation of dismissal protection for open-ended contracts.
J42|Workers in the Crowd: The Labour Market Impact of the Online Platform Economy|In this paper, we compare wages and labor market conditions of individuals engaged in online platform work and in traditional occupations by exploiting individual-level survey data on crowdworkers belonging to the largest micro-task marketplaces, focusing on evidence from the United States and Europe. To match similar individuals, survey responses of crowdworkers from the US and EU have been harmonised with the American Working Conditions Survey (AWCS) and the European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS). Our findings indicate that traditional workers retain a significant premium in their earnings with respect to online platform workers, and that those differences are not affected by the observed and unobserved ability of individuals. This holds true also taking into account similar levels of routine intensity and abstractness in their jobs, as well as the time spent working. Moreover, labour force in crowdworking arrangements appears to suffer from high levels of under-utilisation, with crowdworkers being more likely to be left wanting for more work than comparable individuals.
J42|Granular Search, Market Structure, and Wages|We build a model where firm size is a source of labor market power. The key mechanism is that a granular employer can eliminate its own vacancies from a worker's outside option in the wage bargain. Hence, a granular employer does not compete with itself. We show how wages depend on employment concentration and then use the model to quantify the effects of granular market power. In Austrian micro-data, we find that granular market power depresses wages by about ten percent and can explain 40 percent of the observed decline in the labor share from 1997 to 2015. Mergers decrease competition for workers and reduce wages even at non-merging firms.
J42|Exploitation of Labor? Classical Monopsony Power and Labor's Share|How important is the exercise of classical monopsony power against labor for the level of wages and labor's share? We examine this in the context of China and India – two large, rapidly-growing developing economies. Using theory, we develop a novel screen to quantify how wages are affected by market power exerted in labor markets, either by a single firm or a group of cooperating firms. The theory guides the measurement of labor “markdowns”, i.e., the gap between wage and the value of the marginal product of labor, and the screen examines how they comove with local labor market share and the share of cooperating firms. Applying this test, we find that markdowns substantially lower the labor share: by up to 10 percentage points in China and 15 percentage points in India. This impact has fallen over time in both countries as firm concentration in these labor markets has decreased.
J42|Imperfect Competition, Compensating Differentials and Rent Sharing in the U.S. Labor Market|The goal of this paper is to quantify the importance of imperfect competition in the U.S. labor market by estimating the size of rents earned by American employers and workers from ongoing employment relationships. To this end, we construct matched employer-employee data by combining the universe of U.S. business and worker tax records for the period 2001-2015. Using this panel data, we provide two empirical findings on the role that firms play in the wage determination in the U.S. The first finding is that idiosyncratic productivity shocks to a firm transmit significantly to the earnings of its workers. Controlling for time-invariant firm and worker heterogeneity through a difference-in-differences strategy, we estimate that a 10 percent increase in the value added of a firm leads to a 1.4 percent increase in the earnings of incumbent workers. The second finding is that little of the variation in earnings is due to workers being employed in different firms. Estimating a two-way (worker and firm) fixed effect model, we find that firm effects explain no more than 3 percent of the variation in workers’ earnings. To interpret these two findings, we develop a model of the labor market where multiple employers compete with one another for workers who have heterogeneous preferences over non-wage job characteristics or amenities. These heterogeneous preferences give rise to imperfect competition and rents. The model suggests a significant amount of rents and imperfect competition in the U.S. labor market. Workers are, on average, willing to pay 14 percent of their wage to stay in the current jobs. Comparing these worker rents to those earned by employers suggests that total rents are divided relatively equally between firms and workers. The model also reveals that the finding of small firm effects do not imply that labor markets are competitive or that rents are negligible. Instead, firm effects are small because productive firms tend to have good amenities, which pushes down the wages that these firms have to pay. As a result, firms contribute much less to earnings inequality than what is predicted by the variance of firm productivity only.
J42|Monopsony Power in Higher Education: A Tale of Two Tracks|This paper tests for and measures monopsony power in the U.S. higher education labor market. It does so by directly estimating the residual labor supply curves facing individual four-year colleges and universities using school-specific labor demand instruments. The results indicate that schools have significant monopsony power over their tenure track faculty. Its magnitude is monotonic in rank, being greatest over full professors and smaller for associate and assistant professors. For non-tenure track faculty, however, universities do not seem to have any monopsony power and instead face perfectly elastic residual labor supply curves. Universities’ market power over tenure track faculty does not differ between public and private schools nor between female and male faculty. Monopsony power is greater for larger universities, and the geographic market for faculty seems to be national rather than local. Monopsony power is also larger at higher-status institutions as measured by Carnegie classifications, average test scores of the undergraduate student body, or initial salary rankings. The results also suggest that monopsony power has contributed to the trend toward non-tenure track faculty in U.S.
J42|Minimum Wage Employment Effects and Labor Market Concentration|Why is the employment effect of the minimum wage frequently found to be close to zero? Theory tells us that when wages are below marginal productivity, as with monopsony, employers are able to increase wages without laying off workers, but systematic evidence directly supporting this explanation is lacking. In this paper, we provide empirical support for the monopsony explanation by studying a key low-wage retail sector and using data on labor market concentration that covers the entirety of the United States with fine spatial variation at the occupation-level. We find that more concentrated labor markets – where wages are more likely to be below marginal productivity – experience significantly more positive employment effects from the minimum wage. While increases in the minimum wage are found to significantly decrease employment of workers in low concentration markets, minimum wage-induced employment changes become less negative as labor concentration increases, and are even estimated to be positive in the most highly concentrated markets. Our findings provide direct empirical evidence supporting the monopsony model as an explanation for the near-zero minimum wage employment effect documented in prior work. They suggest the aggregate minimum wage employment effects estimated thus far in the literature may mask heterogeneity across different levels of labor market concentration.
J42|Diversity in Segmention. Patterns of Immigrant Competition in US Labor Markets|Competition between immigrant and native workers takes place in labor markets that are segmented along various, often unobservable dimensions. It is desirable to measure the extent to which native workers are effectively shielded from competition by immigrant workers by virtue of such patterns of segmentation. This paper proposes measures of group differences in labor market segmentation on the basis of incomplete data, such as can be obtained from the US Census. These measures are derived from a general class of models of labor competition in the Smithian tradition. The observed wage distributions of native and foreign-born workers in the United States (at the national and metropolitan level) can be approximated remarkably well with this class of model, suggesting that a parsimonious account of wage inequality is feasible.
J42|The Precariat Class Structure and Income Inequality Among US Workers: 1980-2018|I apply the precariat class schema developed by Standing to the US workforce from 1980-2018. I use a decomposition of inequality to show that this schema explains a substantial and growing portion of income inequality. I find that that the precariat, typified by unstable and benefit-free jobs, make up a large and growing share of the US work force, that the “old” working class shrank precipitously, and that the demographics of these two classes differ substantially. Finally, I illustrate that insight into these difficult to measure phenomena can be gained with an easily replicable class schema using plausible class definitions.
J42|Imperfect Competition, Compensating Differentials and Rent Sharing in the U.S. Labor Market|The primary goal of our paper is to quantify the importance of imperfect competition in the U.S. labor market by estimating the size of rents earned by American firms and workers from ongoing employment relationships. To this end, we construct a matched employer-employee panel data set by combining the universe of U.S. business and worker tax records for the period 2001-2015. We describe several important features of the U.S. labor market, including the size of firm-specific wage premiums, the sorting of workers to firms, the production complementarities between high ability workers and productive firms, and the pass-through of firm and market shocks to workers' wages. Guided by these empirical results, we develop, identify and estimate an equilibrium model of the labor market with two-sided heterogeneity where workers view firms as imperfect substitutes because of heterogeneous preferences over non-wage job characteristics. The model allows us to draw inference about imperfect competition, compensating differentials and rent sharing. We also use the model to quantify the relevance of non-wage job characteristics and imperfect competition for inequality and tax policy, to assess the economic determinants of worker sorting, and to offer a unifying explanation of key empirical features of the U.S. labor market.
J42|Is India’s Employment Guarantee Program Successfully Challenging Her Historical Inequalities?|By providing 100 days of guaranteed employment to every rural household, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) can challenge the hegemony of the landed elite as major employers in the Indian countryside and raise market wages which have long been depressed. This paper shows that the impact of NREGA is conditioned and complicated by historical inequalities in agricultural landownership which have persisted since the colonial period. I find that in the lean season of agriculture, the program is highly successful in raising wages and generating more public employment in districts that were not characterized by historically high levels of socio-economic inequality. In these districts, the increase in public employment crowds-out labor primarily from domestic work, reflected in increased women’s participation in the program. However, high inequality in landownership adversely impacts the bargaining power of workers and the enforcement of their entitlements under NREGA. This is most evident when I examine the impact of NREGA on rural wages. I find that in districts where land is concentrated in the hands of relatively few large landowners, private agricultural wages declined despite NREGA, whereas they remain largely unchanged in districts that have more equitable land distribution. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that NREGA has not become a credible alternative to private employment in regions with high land inequality.

J42|Employment Protection and Firm-provided Training: Quasi-experimental Evidence from a Labour Market Reform|In 2012 a labour market reform, known as Fornero Law, substantially reduced firing restrictions for firms with more than 15 employees in Italy. The results from a difference in regression discontinuities design that compares firms below versus those above the cut-off before and after the reform demonstrate that, after the Fornero Law, the number of trained workers increased in firms just above the threshold, with an order of magnitude of approximately 1.5 additional workers in our preferred empirical specification. We show that this effect might be partly explained by the reduction in worker turnover and a lower use of temporary contracts at the threshold after the reform. Our study highlights the counter-intuitive and potentially adverse effects of employment protection legislation (EPL) on training in dual labour markets due to larger firms seeking to avoid the higher costs of EPL by means of temporary contracts.
J42|Employment Adjustment over the Business Cycle: The Impact of Competition in the Labor Market|Using linked employer-employee data which covers the majority of U.S. employment, I examine how frictions in the labor market have evolved over time. I estimate that the labor supply elasticity to the firm declined by approximately 0.19 log points (1.20 to 1.01) since the late 1990's, with the steepest declines occurring during the financial crisis. I find that this decline in labor market competition cost workers about 4 percent in lost earnings. I also find evidence that relatively monopsonistic firms smooth their employment behavior, growing at a rate lower than relatively competitive firms in good economic climates and slightly higher during poor economic climates. This conforms with the predictions of recent macroeconomic search models which suggest that frictions in the economy may actually reduce employment fluctuations.
J42|Measuring Labor Market Segmentation from Incomplete Data|This paper proposes a measure of the intensity of competition in labor markets on the basis of limited data. Large-scale socioeconomic surveys often lack detailed information on competitive behavior. It is particularly difficult to determine whether a worker moves between the different segments of the labor market. Here, the Maximum Entropy principle is used to make inferences about the unobserved mobility decisions of workers in US household data. A class of models is proposed that reflects a parsimonious conception of competition in the Smithian tradition, as well as being consistent with a range of detailed behavioral models. The Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium (QRSE) class of models can be seen to give robust microfoundations to the persistent patterns of wage inequality among equivalent workers. Furthermore, the QRSE effectively endogenizes the definition of labor market segments, allowing us to interpret the estimated competition intensities as partial measures of labor market segmentation. Models of this class generate predictions that capture between 97.5 and 99.5 percent of the informational content of the sample wage distributions. In addition to providing a very good fit to the wage data, the predictions are also consistent with bounded rationality of workers.
J42|"Labour policy and multinational firms: the ""race to the bottom"" revisited"|"This paper revisits the ""race to the bottom"" phenomenon in a simple game theoretic framework. We consider two countries and one multinational firm, which requires two inputs that are imperfect substitutes. In the benchmark model the labour of each country specializes in a distinct input. Seeking to maximize their labour incomes, countries simultaneously announce wages following which the firm chooses its labour employment in each country. We show that ""race to the bottom"" (countries setting minimum possible wages) is never an equilibrium. Moreover there are equilibria with ``race to the top"", that is, countries set maximum possible wages. This result is robust in an extended model where prior to competing in wages, each country can make input-specific investments to make its labour available for one or both inputs. Provided the production function of the firm is not asymmetrically intensive in either one of the two inputs, there are equilibria of the extended game with specialization (that is, countries invest in distinct inputs) as well as ""race to the top""."
J42|Labour Market Participation and Atypical Employment over the Life Cycle: A Cohort Analysis for Germany|We use data from the adult cohort of the National Education Panel Study to analyse the changes in the employment histories of cohorts born after World War II and the role of atypical employment in this context. Younger cohorts are characterised by acquiring more education, by entering into employment at a higher age, and by experiencing atypical employment more often. The latter is associated with much higher employment of women for younger cohorts. A sequence analysis of employment trajectories illustrates the opportunities and risks of atypical employment: The proportion of individuals whose entry into the labour market is almost exclusively characterised by atypical employment rises significantly across the cohorts. Moreover, a substantial part of the increase in atypical employment is due to the increased participation of women, with part-time jobs or mini-jobs playing an important role in re-entering the labour market after career breaks.
J42|Quality of Politicians and Electoral System. Evidence from a Quasi-experimental Design for Italian Cities|We study the effect of the electoral system on the quality of politicians, measured by the average educational attainment, at the local level in Italy over the period 1994-2017. Since 1993, municipalities below 15,000 inhabitants vote with a single-ballot system, whereas cities above 15,000 inhabitants threshold are subject to a double ballot.Exploiting the discontinuous policy change nearby the population cut-off we have implemented a RDD and found that runoff elections lead to a decrease in the educational attainment of local politicians by about 2% compared to years of schooling of politicians in municipalities voting with a single-ballot scheme.We speculate that the negative effect is driven by the different selection process of candidates adopted by political parties between runoff and single-ballot system. Findings are similar when we use alternative measures of quality of politicians related both to the previous occupation and to previous political experience, and when we control for different measures of political closeness.
J42|Working in the gig economy. Evidence from the Italian food delivery industry|The use of online platforms as intermediaries between the demand for and supply of labour has grown in recent years, both in Italy and abroad. We analyse this phenomenon by providing, in particular: i) an overview of the current debate on how to regulate this sector, specifically with respect to the contractual arrangements and the set of protections to be guaranteed to the workers; ii) a review of the existing empirical evidence concerning the extent of the phenomenon and its main characteristics, both in Italy and abroad; and iii) a case study on the food delivery industry in Italy, with an analysis of the individual characteristics and careers of the delivery operators involved.
J42|Using online job vacancies to understand the UK labour market from the bottom-up|What type of disaggregation should be used to analyse heterogeneous labour markets? How granular should that disaggregation be? Economic theory does not currently tell us; perhaps data can. Analyses typically split labour markets according to top-down classification schema such as sector or occupation. But these may be slow-moving or inaccurate relative to the structure of the labour market as perceived by firms and workers. Using a dataset of 15 million job adverts posted online between 2008 and 2016, we create an empirically driven, ‘bottom-up’ segmentation of the labour market which cuts across wage, sector, and occupation. Our segmentation is based upon applying machine learning techniques to the demand expressed in the text of job descriptions. This segmentation automatically identifies traditional job roles but also surfaces sub-markets not apparent in current classifications. We show that the segmentation has explanatory power for offered wages. The methodology developed could be deployed to create data-driven taxonomies in conditions of rapidly changing labour markets and demonstrates the potential of unsupervised machine learning in economics.
J42|Labor Market Duality in Korea and Policy Responses (in Korean)|This paper reviews the previous literature regarding the state and causes of labor market duality in Korea, provides brief empirical evidence on the existence of labor market duality, and suggests possible remedies for resolving the duality based on the experiences from four European countries which differ in the severity of the labor market duality. We confirm the existence of the duality based on the wage gap and immobility in two dimensions: large-small firms and permanent-temporary positions. Lastly, we suggest some countermeasures to mitigate the duality problem. First, the government need to supervise the contracts between large and small firms to enhance fairness in the contracts. Second, employers and unions may consider a new wage negotiation system in which wages can be determined collectively within an industry. Third, it is necessary to remove blind areas in social insurance system and provide universal income support programs for low-income employees to guarantee the economic security.
J42|Strong Employers and Weak Employees: How Does Employer Concentration Affect Wages?|We analyze the effect of local-level labor market concentration on wages. Using Census data over the period 1977–2009, we find that: (1) local-level employer concentration exhibits substantial cross-sectional and time-series variation and increases over time; (2) consistent with labor market monopsony power, there is a negative relation between local-level employer concentration and wages that is more pronounced at high levels of concentration and increases over time; (3) the negative relation between labor market concentration and wages is stronger when unionization rates are low; (4) the link between productivity growth and wage growth is stronger when labor markets are less concentrated; and (5) exposure to greater import competition from China (the “China Shock”) is associated with more concentrated labor markets. These five results emphasize the role of local-level labor market monopsonies in influencing firm wage-setting behavior and can potentially explain some of the stagnation of wages in the United States over the past several decades.
J42|Labor Specialization as a Source of Market Frictions|"This paper investigates why labor specialization brings additional frictions to the labor market. The intuition is that labor specialized firms rely on complementarity and firm-specific human capital, assigning high value to the worker-employer match. Consistent with employees' importance, the findings show that specialized firms preserve their workforce: these firms labor hoard and increase wages during slow-downs. Additionally, when specialized firms unexpectedly face a labor supply shock | albeit managing to decrease the wages of the remaining co-workers, they become less productive. Overall, the empirical evidence suggests that frictions introduce bilateral monopoly rents."
J42|Making their own weather? Estimating employer labour-market power and its wage effects|The subdued wage growth observed over the last years in many countries has spurred renewed interest in monopsony views of the labour market. This paper is the first to measure the extent and robustness of employer labour-market power and its wage implications exploiting comprehensive matched employer-employee data. We find average (employment-weighted) Herfindhal indices of 800 to 1,100; and that less than 9% of workers are exposed to concentration levels thought to raise market power concerns. However, these figures can increase significantly with different methodological choices. Finally, when holding worker composition constant and instrumenting concentration, wages are found to be negatively affected by employer concentration, with elasticities of between -1.5% and -3%.
J42|Employment Protection, Temporary Contracts and Firm-Provided Training: Evidence from Italy|In this study, we leverage on Italy's size-contingent firing restrictions to identify the causal effect of employment protection legislation (EPL) on firm-provided training using a regression discontinuity design. Our analysis demonstrates that higher levels of EPL reduce incentives for firms to invest in workers' training. The number of trained workers falls by about 1.5-1.9 units at the threshold: this is not a negligible effect, corresponding to a 16-20% reduction in the number of trained workers. The results are robust to several sensitivity checks and controls for potential confounding factors (e.g. work councils). The effect of EPL on training is not mediated by different levels of investment in physical capital or propensities to innovate, while it is mostly accounted for by higher worker turnover and more use of temporary contracts, which entail less training, in firms with higher firing costs. Our study highlights the potential adverse effects of EPL on worker training in dual labour markets, owing to larger firms seeking to avoid the higher costs of EPL by means of temporary contracts.
J42|Informalidad laboral en el sector rural colombiano|El presente documento tiene por objetivo realizar un análisis sobre la informalidad laboral en el sector rural colombiano y encontrar la mejor definición para lograr una acertada medición. Con el fin de tener niveles de comparación con la informalidad rural, se investiga la informalidad en otras regiones del mundo, así como la total nacional. Los resultados muestran que, aunque los niveles de informalidad total y rural han bajado principalmente por la reforma tributaria de 2012, el 85% de la población ocupada rural es informal, un nivel muy alto comparado con el de regiones de ingresos bajos como África central o Asia meridional. La investigación presenta las causas estructurales e institucionales que han generado estos niveles tan bajos.
J42|Employer Power, Labor Saving Technical Change, and Inequality|How does employer power mediate the impact of labor saving technical change on inequality? This question has largely been neglected in the recent literature on the wage and distributional consequences of automation, where the labor market is assumed to be competitive. In a simple task-based model, with search frictions which generate an equilibrium wage distribution even with identical firms and workers, we explore the implications of labor saving technical change for equilibrium outcomes. We show that employer power is a crucial determinant of the nuanced comparative statics of technical change. Among a range of results, we show the possibility of Kuznetsian inverse-U relationships between employer power and inequality, and labor saving technical change and inequality. We further show that when employer power is sufficiently low, labor saving technical change can both increase total output and increase wage inequality. With free entry of firms, labor saving technical change leads to both a first order dominating shift in the age distribution and an increase in the Gini coefficient of wage inequality.
J42|Hysteresis via Endogenous Rigidity in Wages and Participation|"We document that the past three “jobless” recoveries also featured asymmetries in labor force participation and labor compensation, with each falling to new lows during each cycle. We model these asymmetries as resulting from a strategic complementarity in firms' wage setting and workers' job search strategies. Strategic complementarity results in a continuum of possible equilibria with higher-wage equilibria welfare dominating lower-wage equilibria. Assuming that no economic agent deviates from an existing strategy unless deviation is a unilateral best response, the model exhibits (1) periods of endogenous rigidity in wages and participation, (2) persistent changes in wages, participation, and output in response to transitory movements in labor productivity, (3) sluggish recoveries including both a “jobless"" phase, in which productivity recovers while unemployment remains elevated, and a “wageless"" phase, in which employment recovers but wages remain depressed Calibrating the model suggests that the U.S. unemployment rate may need to fall to around 3 percent before labor compensation recovers to pre-Financial Crisis levels."
J42|Concentration and Other Wage Determinants|This research presents evidence on how the impact of industry concentration and unionism affect the Portuguese wage levels. The influence of employer association is also considered. We use sector information - two-digit level disaggregation of “Classificação das Actividades Económicas” -, and control for other wage determinants, as usually done in earnings functions regressions. Dependent variables are logarithms of the mean sector wages considered for each case. Some statistical distribution indicators are also used to provide possible insights on the impact of skill composition and dispersion - eventually reflecting good assignment of people to jobs and/or tasks - on productivity and, thus, production.

Additionally, when specialized firms unexpectedly face a labor supply shock | albeit managing to decrease the wages of the remaining co-workers, they become less productive. Overall, the empirical evidence suggests that frictions introduce bilateral monopoly rents."
J42|Employment and the minimum wage: A pluralist approach|When discussing the employment effects of minimum wages, mainstream economic discussion as well as mainstream economics textbooks mainly center around two variations of the neoclassical model: the model of the competitive and the monopsonistic labor market. The current paper offers a different perspective: it provides an assessment of the broader variety of existing theories and develops a new theoretical account which integrates these different views. For the comparison as well as for the later integration of these theories, it draws on an evolutionary economic concept: a micro-meso-macro framework. Here it shows that due to its simple structure and conceptual flexibility, the micro-meso-macro framework is very well suited to the task of integrating these different theoretical visions as well as assessing their evolutionary features. It follows from the analysis that from a theoretical viewpoint, the effect of the minimum wage on employment is indeed ambiguous, which is perfectly in line with the existing empirical evidence.
J42|Employment Protection, Temporary Contracts and Firm-provided Training: Evidence from Italy|In this study, we leverage on Italy's size-contingent firing restrictions to identify the causal effect of employment protection legislation (EPL) on firm-provided training using a regression discontinuity design. Our analysis demonstrates that higher levels of EPL reduce incentives for firms to invest in workers' training. The number of trained workers falls by about 1.5-1.9 units at the threshold - this is not a negligible effect, corresponding to a 16-20% reduction in the number of trained workers. The results are robust to several sensitivity checks and controls for potential confounding factors (e.g. work councils). The effect of EPL on training is not mediated by different levels of investment in physical capital or propensities to innovate, while it is mostly accounted for by higher worker turnover and more use of temporary contracts, which entail less training, in firms with higher firing costs. Our study highlights the potential adverse effects of EPL on worker training in dual labour markets, owing to larger firms seeking to avoid the higher costs of EPL by means of temporary contracts.
J42|Concentration in US Labor Markets: Evidence From Online Vacancy Data|Using data on the near-universe of online US job vacancies collected by Burning Glass Technologies in 2016, we calculate labor market concentration using the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) for each commuting zone by 6-digit SOC occupation. The average market has an HHI of 4,378, or the equivalent of 2.3 recruiting employers. 60% of labor markets are highly concentrated (above 2,500 HHI) according to the DOJ/FTC guidelines. Highly concentrated markets account for 20% of employment. For manufacturing industries, we show that labor market concentration is distinct from product market concentration, and is negatively correlated with wages in each industry’s top occupation.
J42|Employer power, labor saving technical change, and inequality|How does employer power mediate the impact of labor saving technical change on inequality? This question has largely been neglected in the recent literature on the wage and distributional consequences of automation, where the labor market is assumed to be competitive. In a simple task-based model, with search frictions which generate an equilibrium wage distribution even with identical firms and workers, we explore the implications of labor saving technical change for equilibrium outcomes. We show that employer power is a crucial determinant of the nuanced comparative statics of technical change. Among a range of results, we show the possibility of Kuznetsian inverse-U relationships between employer power and inequality, and labor saving technical change and inequality. We further show that when employer power is sufficiently low, labor saving technical change can both increase total output and increase wage inequality. With free entry of firms, labor saving technical change leads to both a first order dominating shift in the age distribution and an increase in the Gini coefficient of wage inequality.
J42|Estimating the effect of an increase in the minimum wage on hours worked and employment in Ireland|On the 1st of January 2016 the Irish National Minimum Wage increased from Ã¢â€šÂ¬8.65 to Ã¢â€šÂ¬9.15 per hour, an increase of approximately six percent. We use a difference-in-differences estimator to evaluate whether the change in the minimum wage affected the hours worked and likelihood of job loss of minimum wage workers. The results indicate that the increase in the minimum wage had a negative and statistically significant effect on the hours worked of minimum wage workers, with an average reduction of approximately 0.5 hours per week. The effect on minimum wage workers on temporary contracts was higher at 3 hours per week. We found a corresponding increase in part-time employment of 2 percentage points for all minimum wage workers and 10 percentage points for those on temporary contracts. We find no clear evidence that the increase in the minimum wage led to an in-creased probability of becoming unemployed or inactive in the six-month period following the rate change.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J42|Theory and Evidence on Employer Collusion in the Franchise Sector|"In this paper we study the role of covenants in franchise contracts that restrict the recruitment and hiring of employees from other units within the same franchise chain in suppressing and hiring of employees from other units within the same franchise chain in suppressing find that ""no-poaching of workers agreements"" are included in a surprising 58 percent of major franchisors' contracts, including McDonald's, Burger King, Jiffy Lube and H&R Block. Theoretical models of oligopsony and dynamic monopsony, as well as incentives for investment in job training, are discussed in the context of these no-poaching agreements. Although the occurrence of no-poaching agreements is difficult to predict from franchise or industry characteristics, no-poaching agreements are more common for franchises in low-wage and high-turnover industries."
J42|Minimum Wages and Retirement|We study the effect of the minimum wage on the employment outcomes and Social Security claiming of older US workers from 1983 to 2016. The probability of work at or near the minimum wage increases substantially near retirement, and previous researchers and policies suggest that older workers may be particularly vulnerable to any disemployment effects of the minimum wage. We find no evidence that the minimum wage causes earlier retirements. Instead, our estimates suggest that higher minimum wages increase earnings and may have small positive effects on the labor supply of workers in the key ages of 62 to 70. Consistent with increased earnings and delayed retirement, higher minimum wages decrease the number of Social Security beneficiaries and amount of benefits disbursed. The minimum wage appears to increase financial resources for workers near retirement.
J42|Employment Adjustment Over the Business Cycle: The Impact of Competition in the Labor Market|Using linked employer-employee data which covers the majority of U.S. employment, I examine how frictions in the labor market have evolved over time. I estimate that the labor supply elasticity to the firm declined by approximately 0.19 log points (1.20 to 1.01) since the late 1990's, with the steepest declines occurring during the financial crisis. I find that this decline in labor market competition cost workers about 4 percent in lost earnings. I also find evidence that relatively monopsonistic firms smooth their employment behavior, growing at a rate lower than relatively competitive firms in good economic climates and slightly higher during poor economic climates. This conforms with the predictions of recent macroeconomic search models which suggest that frictions in the economy may actually reduce employment fluctuations.
J42|Monopsony in Labor Markets: A Meta-Analysis|When jobs offered by different employers are not perfect substitutes in the minds of workers, employers gain wage-setting power; the extent of this power can be captured by the elasticity of labor supply that each employer faces. Estimates of this parameter reported by the literature vary broadly. We collect 801 estimates from published studies, record 20 aspects of each study’s design and perform Bayesian Model Averaging to show that this observed variation is systematic and can be attributed to four groups of factors. First, estimates depend on methodologies used by the researchers: different specifications pro- duce systematically different results that are also affected by whether the study employs an identification strategy; the choice between linear and non-linear estimation techniques also matters. Second, estimates vary with the underlying data: labor markets seem to be more competitive in Europe, and less competitive in developing countries - compared to the US, Canada and Australia. The market for medical workers appears to be more monopsonistic compared to others. Third, there is evidence of publication bias in parts of the literature, which results in negative estimates of supply elasticities receiving lower probability of being reported, and a (slightly) exaggerated mean. Fourth, estimates seem to vary with study quality, with top journals publishing higher estimates and studies using larger data sets producing more evidence of competitive behavior.
J42|Labour market participation and atypical employment over the life cycle: A cohort analysis for Germany|We use data from the adult cohort of the National Education Panel Study to analyse the changes in the employment histories of cohorts born after World War II and the role of atypical employment in this context. Younger cohorts are characterised by acquiring more education, by entering into employment at a higher age, and by experiencing atypical employment more often. The latter is associated with much higher employment of women for younger cohorts. A sequence analysis of employment trajectories illustrates the opportunities and risks of atypical employment: The proportion of individuals whose entry into the labour market is almost exclusively characterised by atypical employment rises significantly across the cohorts. Moreover, a substantial part of the increase in atypical employment is due to the increased participation of women, with part-time jobs or mini-jobs playing an important role in re-entering the labour market after career breaks.
J42|Strong Employers and Weak Employees: How Does Employer Concentration Affect Wages?|We analyze the effect of local-level labor market concentration on wages. Using plant-level U.S. Census data over the period 1977–2009, we find that: (1) local-level employer concentration exhibits substantial cross-sectional and time-series variation and increases over time; (2) consistent with labor market monopsony power, there is a negative relation between local-level employer concentration and wages that is more pronounced at high levels of concentration and increases over time; (3) the negative relation between labor market concentration and wages is stronger when unionization rates are low; (4) the link between productivity growth and wage growth is stronger when labor markets are less concentrated; and (5) exposure to greater import competition from China (the “China Shock”) is associated with more concentrated labor markets. These five results emphasize the role of local-level labor market monopsonies in influencing firm wage-setting.
J42|Concentration in US Labor Markets: Evidence from Online Vacancy Data|Using data on the near-universe of online US job vacancies collected by Burning Glass Technologies in 2016, we calculate labor market concentration using the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) for each commuting zone by 6-digit SOC occupation. The average market has an HHI of 3,953, or the equivalent of 2.5 recruiting employers. 54% of labor markets are highly concentrated (above 2,500 HHI) according to the DOJ/FTC guidelines. Highly concentrated markets account for 17% of employment. All plausible alternative market definitions show that more than 33% of markets are highly concentrated, suggesting that employers have market power in many US labor markets.
J42|Monopsony in Online Labor Markets|On-demand labor platforms make up a large part of the “gig economy.” We quantify the extent of monopsony power in one of the largest on-demand labor platforms, Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), by measuring the elasticity of labor supply facing the requester (employer) using both observational and experimental variation in wages. We isolate plausibly exogenous variation in rewards using a double-machine-learning estimator applied to a large dataset of scraped MTurk tasks. We also re-analyze data from 5 MTurk experiments that randomized payments to obtain corresponding experimental estimates. Both approaches yield uniformly low labor supply elasticities, around 0.1, with little heterogeneity.
J42|Fairness and Frictions: The Impact of Unequal Raises on Quit Behavior|We analyze how separations responded to arbitrary differences in own and peer wages at a large US retailer. Regression-discontinuity estimates imply large causal effects of own-wages on separations, and on quits in particular. However, this own-wage response could reflect comparisons either to market wages or to peer wages. Estimates using peer-wage discontinuities show large peer-wage effects and imply the own-wage separation response mostly reflects peer comparisons. The peer effect is driven by comparisons with higher-paid peers—suggesting concerns about fairness. Separations appear fairly insensitive when raises are similar across peers—suggesting search frictions and monopsony are relevant in this low-wage sector.
J42|Monopsony and Employer Mis-optimization Explain Why Wages Bunch at Round Numbers|We show that wages in administrative data and in online markets exhibit considerable bunching at round numbers that cannot all be explained by rounding of responses in survey data. We consider two hypotheses—worker left-digit bias and employer optimization frictions—and derive tests to distinguish between the two. Symmetry of the missing mass distribution around the round number suggests that optimization frictions are more important. We show that a more monopsonistic market requires less optimization frictions to rationalize the bunching in the data, and use this to derive bounds on employer market power. We provide experimental validation of these results from an online labor market, where rewards are also highly bunched at round numbers. By randomizing wages for an identical task, our online experiment provides an independent estimate of the extent of employer market power, and fails to find evidence of any discontinuity in the labor supply function as predicted by workers’ left-digit bias. Overall, the extent and form of round-number bunching suggests both employer mis-optimization and wage setting power are important features of the labor market.
J42|Analyzing the Aftermath of a Compensation Reduction|Firms rarely cut compensation, so little is known about the after-effects when compensation reductions do occur. We use commission reductions at a sales firm to estimate how work effort and turnover change. In response to an 18% decline in sales commissions, corresponding to a 7% decline in median take-home pay, we find turnover increases for the most productive workers. We detect limited effort responses. Turnover and effort responses do not differ based on workers' survey replies regarding expectations of firm fairness or future promotion. The findings indicate that adverse selection concerns on the extensive margin of retaining workers drive the empirical regularity that firms rarely reduce compensation.
J42|Wages and the Value of Nonemployment|Nonemployment is often posited as a worker's outside option in wage setting models such as bargaining and wage posting. The value of this state is therefore a fundamental determinant of wages and, in turn, labor supply and job creation. We measure the effect of changes in the value of nonemployment on wages in existing jobs and among job switchers. Our quasi-experimental variation in nonemployment values arises from four large reforms of unemployment insurance (UI) benefit levels in Austria. We document that wages are insensitive to UI benefit levels: point estimates imply a wage response of less than $0.01 per $1.00 UI benefit increase, and we can reject sensitivities larger than 0.03. In contrast, a calibrated Nash bargaining model predicts a sensitivity of 0.39 – more than ten times larger. The empirical insensitivity holds even among workers with a priori low bargaining power, with low labor force attachment, with high predicted unemployment duration, among job switchers and recently unemployed workers, in areas of high unemployment, in firms with flexible pay policies, and when considering firm-level bargaining. The insensitivity of wages to the nonemployment value we document presents a puzzle to widely used wage setting protocols, and implies that nonemployment may not constitute workers' relevant threat point. Our evidence supports wage-setting mechanisms that insulate wages from the value of nonemployment.
J42|Dynamic Analysis of a Disequilibrium Macroeconomic Model with Dual Labor Markets|We extend the general disequilibrium model of Malinvaud(1980) by using dual labor market theory. By considering two tiers of workers, we find that while the duality of the labor market expands an equilibrium regime in the short term, it does not always keep an equilibrium in the medium term. In the medium term, the business cycle converges toward a disequilibrium regime unless the goods market is potentially in equilibrium. Employment and wages at the steady state are affected by the size of the government, and the stability of wage bargaining is only a sufficient condition of the local stability of our dynamic system. Therefore, involuntary unemployment can be remedied only when goods demand is sufficiently large.
J42|"Labour policy and multinational firms: the ""race to the bottom"" revisited"|"This paper revisits the ""race to the bottom"" phenomenon in a simple game theoretic framework. We consider two countries and one multinational firm, which requires two inputs that are imperfect substitutes. In the benchmark model the labour of each country specializes in a distinct input. Seeking to maximize their labour incomes, countries simultaneously announce wages following which the firm chooses its labour employment in each country. We show that ""race to the bottom"" (countries setting minimum possible wages) is never an equilibrium. Moreover there are equilibria with ""race to the top"", that is, countries set maximum possible wages. This result is robust in an extended model where prior to competing in wages, each country can make input-specific investments to make its labour available for one or both inputs. Provided the production function of the firm is not asymmetrically intensive in either one of the two inputs, there are equilibria of the extended game with specialization (that is, countries invest in distinct inputs) as well as ""race to the top""."
J42|Quality of Politicians and Electoral System. Evidence from a Quasi-experimental Design for Italian Cities|We study the effect of the electoral system on the quality of politicians, measured by the average educational attainment, at the local level in Italy over the period 1994-2017. Since 1993, municipalities below 15,000 inhabitants vote with a single-ballot system, whereas cities above 15,000 inhabitants threshold are subject to a double ballot. Exploiting the discontinuous policy change nearby the population cut-off we have implemented a RDD and found that runoff elections lead to a decrease in the educational attainment of local politicians by about 2% compared to years of schooling of politicians in municipalities voting with a single-ballot scheme. We speculate that the negative effect is driven by the different selection process of candidates adopted by political parties between runoff and single-ballot system. Findings are similar when we use alternative measures of quality of politicians related both to the previous occupation and to previous political experience, and when we control for different measures of political closeness.
J42|Do High-Wage Jobs Attract More Applicants? Directed Search Evidence from the Online Labor Market|Labor markets become more efficient in theory if job seekers direct their search. Using online job board data, we show that high-wage ads attract more applicants as in directed search models. Due to distinctive data features, we also estimate significant but milder directed search for hidden (or implicit) wages, suggesting that ad texts and requirements tacitly convey wage information. Since explicit-wage ads often target unskilled workers, other estimates in the literature ignoring hidden-wage ads may suffer from selection bias. Moreover, job ad requirements are aligned with their applicants’ traits, as predicted in directed search models with heterogeneity.
J42|Earnings Inequality and the Minimum Wage: Evidence from Brazil|We assess the extent to which a rise in the minimum wage can account for three facts characterizing a large decline in earnings inequality in Brazil from 1996â€“2012: (i) the decline is more pronounced towards the bottom of the distribution; (ii) one quarter of the decline stems from an increase in relative pay at less productive firms; and (iii) another quarter is attributable to falling pay differences due to worker heterogeneity. To this end, we build an equilibrium search model with heterogeneity in worker ability and firm productivity. The central feature of the model is the presence of spillover effects of the minimum wage on higher earnings ranks due to monopsonistic competition among firms for workers. We estimate the model using indirect inference and find that the rise in the minimum wage explains 70 percent of the decline in the variance of log earnings. Spillover effects of the minimum wage account for more than half of this decline and quantitatively match the three empirical facts. Our results suggest that labor market dynamics can lead to large effects of policy on earnings inequality.
J42|Economic Feasibility Study and its Impact on the Financing Decision: An Applied Study to Islamic Banks in Jordan Ph.D. Thesis prepared by Esmat Abdelhalim Namer Almustafa Reviewed by: Abdulrazzaq Belabes مراجعة علمية لأطروحة الدكتوراه دراسة الجدوى الاقتصادية وأثرها في اتخاذ القرار التمويلي: دراسة تطبيقية على المصارف الإسلامية في الأردن من إعداد عصمت عبدالحليم المصطفى مراجعة: عبدالرزاق سعيد بلعباس|The paper deals with a Ph.D. thesis on economic feasibility study and its impact on the decision of financing in the banking sector, based on a sample composed of four Islamic banks operating in Jordan. After presenting the thesis plan along with the most important findings and recommendations, the paper proposes some methodological guidance for a foundation of the concept of feasibility study, which has been widely circulated in recent times, especially in the field of Awqaf, characterized primarily by the social impact. تتناول الورقة أطروحة دكتوراه عن دراسة الجدوى الاقتصادية وأثرها في اتخاذ قرار التمويل في القطاع المصرفي بناء على عينة مكونة من أربع مصارف إسلامية تعمل في الأردن. بعد عرض خطة الأطروحة وأهم النتائج والتوصيات التي توصلت إليها، تقترح الورقة بعض المعالم المنهجية لتأصيل مفهوم دراسة الجدوى الذي كثر تداوله في الآونة الأخيرة، لا سيما في مجال الأوقاف التي تتميّز بالدرجة الأولى بالأثر الاجتماعي.
J42|Optimal Taxation to Correct Job Mismatching|This paper presents a new efficiency argument for an accommodating taxation policy on high incomes. Job seekers, applying to different segments of a frictional labor market, do not internalize the consequences of mismatch on the entry decision of firms. Workers are not selective enough, resulting in a lower average job productivity and suboptimal job creation. The output-maximizing policy is anti-redistributive to improve the quality of the jobs prospected. As an income tax affects the sharing of the match surplus, a tax on production (or profits) is required to redress the slope of the wage curve. Neither a minimum wage nor unemployment benefits can fully decentralize optimal search behaviors.
J42|Consumers’ costly responses to product-harm crises|Using an ideal setting from a major food safety crisis, we estimate a full demand model for the unsafe product and its substitutes and recover consumers' preference parameters. Counterfactual exercises quantify the relevance of di erent mechanisms -changes in safety perceptions, idiosyncratic tastes, nutritional characteristics, and prices-driving consumers' response. We find that consumers' reaction is limited by their taste for the product and its nutritional characteristics. Due to the costs associated with switching away from the a ected product, the decline in demand following a product-harm crisis tends to understate the true weight of such events in consumers' utility. Indeed, we nd that a large fraction of consumers are unresponsive to the crisis even when they significantly downgrade their product safety perception. For an accurate assessment of the crisis, managerial strategies should therefore account for how di erent demand drivers bind consumers' substitution patterns.
J42|Firms and Labor Market Inequality: Evidence and Some Theory|We synthesize two related literatures on firm-level drivers of wage inequality. Studies of rent sharing that use matched worker-firm data find elasticities of wages with respect to value added per worker in the range of 0.05–0.15. Studies of wage determination with worker and firm fixed effects typically find that firm-specific premiums explain 20% of overall wage variation. To interpret these findings, we develop a model of wage setting in which workers have idiosyncratic tastes for different workplaces. Simple versions of this model can rationalize standard fixed effects specifications and also match the typical rent-sharing elasticities in the literature.
J42|Firms and Labor Market Inequality: Evidence and Some Theory|We review the literature on firm-level drivers of labor market inequality. There is strong evidence from a variety of fields that standard measures of productivity — like output per worker or total factor productivity — vary substantially across firms, even within narrowly defined industries. Several recent studies not that rising trends in the dispersion of productivity across firms mirror the trends in the wage inequality across workers. Two distinct literatures have searched for a more direct link between these two phenomena. The first examines how wages are affected by differences in employer productivity. Studies that focus on firm-specific productivity shocks an control for the non-random sorting of workers to more and less productive firms typically find that a 10% increase in value=added per worker leads to somewhere between a 0.5% and 1.5% increase in wages. A second literature focuses on firm-specific wage premiums, using the wage outcomes of job changers. This literature also concludes that firm pay setting is important for wage inequality, with many studies finding that firm wage effects contribute approximately 20% of the overall variance of wages. To interpret these findings, we develop a model where workplace environments are viewed as imperfect substitutes by workers and firms set wages with some degree of market power. We shoe that simple versions of this model can readily match the stylized empirical finding s in the literature regarding rent-sharing elasticities and the structure of rim=specific pay premiums<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J42|Risk-Averse Managers, Labour Market Structures, Public Policies and Discrimination|This article presents a model to analyze the effects of first and second-moment statistical discrimination on the labour market. Second-moment statistical discrimination occurs when risk-averse managers make decisions regarding wage and hiring based on productivity variances. We provide a framework exploring managers’ discrimination based on differences in average productivity and in variance of productivity. Furthermore, since discrimination is composed of two types (wage and hiring discrimination), our model allows for the interdependence between hiring practices and wages. Using our model, we examine the effects of various anti-discrimination policies along with changes to the labour market structure. We show that managers’ behaviour may be driven by anti-discrimination policies and labour market structures. A firm reduces hiring when required to implement anti-discrimination policies to address wage inequality. A firm applying policies to promote employment equity must stimulate minority participation. A change in labour market structure does not alter the efficiency of policies promoting employment equity, but it does alter the efficiency of policies aimed at reducing wage differences.
J42|Ranking Firms Using Revealed Preference|This article estimates workers’ preferences for firms by studying the structure of employer-to-employer transitions in U.S. administrative data. The article uses a tool from numerical linear algebra to measure the central tendency of worker flows, which is closely related to the ranking of firms revealed by workers’ choices. There is evidence for compensating differentials when workers systematically move to lower-paying firms in a way that cannot be accounted for by layoffs or differences in recruiting intensity. The estimates suggest that compensating differentials account for over half of the firm component of the variance of earnings.
J42|Social comparisons in oligopsony|A large body of evidence suggests that social comparisons matter for workers’ valuation of the wage they receive. The consequences of social comparisons in imperfectly competitive labor markets are less well understood. We analyze an oligopsonistic model of the labor market where workers derive (dis-)utility from comparing their own wage with wages paid at other firms. As social comparisons become more prevalent all workers are paid higher wages, the wage distribution becomes more equal, and employment shifts to high productivity firms. Moreover, the total wage bill and output increase, while aggregate profits decline. Overall welfare rises. Our theoretical results have implications for estimating the elasticity of the labor supply curve facing a firm.
J42|The Self-Selection of Workers to the Formal and Informal in Transition Economies: Evidence from Tajikistan|This paper analyzes the selection of workers to informal and formal sector employment in Tajikistan. It estimates multinomial selection bias correction model to assess the impact of observable and unobservable characteristics on the self-selection of workers into the formal and informal sector and on sector specific wages using individual level data from the Tajikistan Standards of Living Survey of 2007. The results suggest that selection of workers on both observable and unobservable characteristics to these sectors is broadly consistent with self-selection on comparative advantages, that the self-selection of workers on unobservable characteristics is the main reason for higher wages in the informal than the formal sector in Tajikistan and that relative wages in the two sectors have a rather strong impact on the decision of workers to work in the formal or informal sector.
J42|Discrimination and favouritism among workers: union membership and ethnic identity|This paper analyses how labour institutions and ethnic identity shape favouritism and discrimination among workers. We conduct an experiment with union and non-union South African mineworkers from various ethnicities. We examine in-group and out-group behaviour, emphasizing the relative ranking of these groups and their interaction. We find that unions create both in-group and out-group favouritism towards co-ethnic members and members of ethnic majorities. This favouritism is however undermined by unionised subcontract workers who experience precarious conditions. Furthermore, union members discriminate against non-unionised ethnic minorities. Finally, non-union members (primarily subcontract workers) discriminate against union members, particularly after negative shocks.

More- over, the total wage bill and output increase, while aggregate profits decline. Overall welfare rises. Our theoretical results have implications for estimating the elasticity of the labor supply curve facing a firm.
J42|Segregation of women into low-paying occupations in the US|We present an approach to measure the stratification of occupations by sex. For that, we extend the conventional framework for measuring gender segregation to take into account the quality of jobs (e.g. average earnings) predominantly held by each sex. We complement segregation curves and measures derived from them, with their associated concentration curves and indices, to determine whether women are segregated into low-paying jobs. We investigate with this approach the long-term trends of gender segregation and stratification of occupations by sex in the US using census data. Our results show that de-stratification of occupations by sex was more intense than their desegregation, and lasted longer, even after segregation had stagnated. Neither segregation nor stratification levels can be explained by the different characteristics of male and female workforces, although the profound changes in the composition of workers over time (e.g. education, marital status) did help to substantially explain their trends. Changes in the earnings structure favoring occupations held by women since 1980 additionally contributed to reduce stratification over time. Finally, changes in the conditional occupational distribution by sex only reduced segregation and stratification before 1990.
J42|Labor Market Concentration|A product market is concentrated when a few firms dominate the market. Similarly, a labor market is concentrated when a few firms dominate hiring in the market. Using data from the leading employment website CareerBuilder.com, we calculate labor market concentration for over 8,000 geographic-occupational labor markets in the US. Based on the DOJ-FTC horizontal merger guidelines, the average market is highly concentrated. Using a panel IV regression, we show that going from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile in concentration is associated with a 17% decline in posted wages, suggesting that concentration increases labor market power.
J42|Polarization and Persistence in the Japanese Labor Market|This study analyzes the persistence of regular and non-regular employment status in Japan for workers that change jobs. In particular, we investigate two hypotheses behind this persistence. The first is the dependence of the employment status in the current job on that in the previous job. The second is the dependence of the employment status in the current job on that in the initial job, which is called first job effects. While both types of dependence are empirically verified, the former is shown to be quantitatively more substantial. Therefore, the serially dependent structure of employment status matters critically to the segmentation of the labor market in Japan.
J42|Wage Profiles in the Japanese Dual Labor Market|This study examines the dual structure of wage formation in regular and non-regular employment sectors in Japan. By using data from a series of surveys conducted in the Tokyo metropolitan area during 2002--2014, two sectoral wage functions and an employment status determination function are estimated simultaneously. The estimated results reveal several facts regarding the new era of the Japanese dual labor market. While the wages of regular workers rise with years of tenure and external experience, those of non-regular workers increase only with the latter. The wage increases owing to experience are of a similar magnitude between employment statuses (except for female regular workers), and the firm-size and educational-background premiums exist only in the regular employees' wages. The study also shows that the slopes of regular workers' wage-tenure profiles have been rather stable for more than 10 years since the early 2000s.
J42|Labour Market Policies and the Informal Sector: A Segmented Labour Markets Analysis|In this paper we develop a dynamic model of a multi-sector economy with an informal sector and segmented labour markets first to demonstrate how informal production and employment decline in transition towards the steady state, and second to analyse the impact of various labour market policies at the steady state. Our results primarily indicate that informal employment share increases with minimum wage, and decreases with reductions in the payroll taxes, moreover, reducing the tax imposed on employer is more effective in reducing the informal employment share, while reducing the tax imposed on employee is more effective in increasing consumer felicity.
J42|Complex Asset Markets|We develop a dynamic equilibrium model of complex asset markets with endogenous entry and exit in which the investment technology of investors with more expertise is subject to less asset-specific risk. The joint equilibrium distribution of financial expertise and wealth then determines risk bearing capacity. Higher expert demand lowers equilibrium required returns, reducing overall participation. In equilibrium, investor participation in more complex asset markets with more asset-specific risk is lower, despite higher market- level Sharpe ratios, provided that asset complexity and expertise are complementary. We analyze how asset complexity affects the stationary wealth distribution of complex asset investors. Because of selection, increased asset complexity reduces wealth concentration, even though the wealth distribution for more expert investors has fatter tails.
J42|Too Much of a Good Thing? Labor Market Imperfections as a Source of Exceptional Exporter Performance|Ex-post firm heterogeneity can result from different strategies to overcome labor market imperfections by ex-ante identical firms—with far-reaching consequences for the welfare effects of trade. With asymmetric information about workers’ abilities and costly screening, in equilibrium some firms screen and pay wages based on the true productivity of their workers, and some firms do not screen and pay wages based on the average productivity of their workforce. Screening firms are larger, attract better workers and pay lower effective wages. This results in excessive consumption of resources by large firms relative to the social optimum. Trade liberalization then has an ambiguous effect on aggregate welfare: lower trade costs improve access to foreign goods but also exacerbate the labor market distortion as more resources are transferred to large firms. The model highlights the need to know why firms “excel” before drawing welfare conclusions regarding cross firm reallocations of resources.
J42|The Use of Multivariate Techniques for Youth Unemployment Analysis in Poland|The labour market situation is considered to be the most widely discussed part of economic development. However, it should be noted that the unemployment situation of young people (aged 15 -24 years) in Poland in general terms seems to be problematic. Overall, the unemployment rate among young people in Poland is significantly higher than the overall unemployment rate in the EU. Moreover, the situation varies greatly across the regions. Using multivariate techniques as a theoretical framework, the main goal of the paper is to identify groups of Polish regions that share similar patterns regarding unemployment among young people. The initial calculation is based on the concept of the taxonomic measure developed by Hellwig. The final method used to create clusters of objects (across 16 voivodeships of Poland) is cluster analysis. A segmentation of the voivodeships is observed for the years 2005 and 2014, based on selected indicators to determine the labour market situation. Through the exploration of the advantages of multivariate methods, the nature of youth unemployment is revealed in more precise detail. Indeed, dendrogram analysis divided the voivodeships into five groups, which are characterized by similar features associated with the labour market. It was found that the groups which emerged in 2005 have a different composition of regions than in 2014; this difference seems to be connected to the economic crisis.
J42|Using your ties to get a worse job? The differential effects of social networks on quality of employment: Evidence from Colombia|This article examines the effect of social networks through the use of family, friends or relatives ties on quality of employment (QoE). Drawing from the socioeconomic literature on social networks and labor market, we propose an original and multidimensional measure of QoE, and a fruitful estimation approach of the effect of social networks on QoE that allows to deal with complex inter-groups heterogeneity. Using the Great Integrated Houshold Survey (GIHS) and a sample on Bogota's workers in 2013, we find evidence proving that the use of ties has high negative effects on QoE index for those who are in the lower quality of employment range. Likewise, the use of social networks has very low negative effects on QoE index for individuals who are in the better quality of employment range. Complemented by focus groups interviews, these empirical results raise questions about the difference prevailing in relational practices between necessity networks for precarious workers and opportunity networks for protected workers.
J42|Labor Market Imperfections and the Firm's Wage Setting Policy|We use matched employer-employee data and firm balance sheet data to investigate the importance of firm productivity and firm labor market power in explaining firm heterogeneity in wage formation. We use a linear regression model with one interacted high dimensional fixed effect to estimate 5-digit sector-specific elasticity of output with respect to input factors directly from the production function. This allows to derive firm specific price-cost mark-up and elasticity of labor supply. The results show that firms possess a considerable degree of product and labor market power. Furthermore, we find evidence that firm's monopsony power affects negatively the earnings of its workers and firm's total factor productivity is considerably associated with higher earnings, ceteris paribus. We also find that firms use monopsony power for wage differentiation between male and female workers.
J42|Non-Contributory Health Insurance and Household Labor Supply: Evidence from Mexico|A central topic in the global health agenda is universal health coverage (UHC). The primary goal of social health insurance schemes is to protect beneficiaries from the health and financial consequences of adverse health events. While in this sense there is scope for government intervention in providing insurance, the impacts of UHC on labor markets in developing countries are less clear. We study this issue using the case of Mexico, which introduced in 2002 a non-contributory health insurance scheme directed to the half of the country’s population uncovered by Social Security protection (the Seguro Popular, SP). Since before SP uninsured individuals could only access affordable health care through their employer, the introduction of a non-contributory public health insurance scheme could have resulted in large effects on the labor market. In practice, SP is a transfer(tax) to the informal(formal) sector workers and to the nonemployed. On the one hand, if the value placed on SP benefits is high, the introduction of fully subsidized health insurance can lead to negative impacts on employment and/or formality. On the other hand, wages in equilibrium might compensate the increase in benefits in the informal sector, in which case the impact on formality and employment is ambiguous. We start analyzing the effects of SP on labor market outcomes by exploiting its staggered introduction across municipalities using a difference-in-differences strategy on the Mexican Labor Force Survey data. We show that the implementation of SP in a municipality is associated with an increase in informality by 4% for low-education families with children. Then, to study why the policy change had limited impacts on the labor market, we develop and estimate a novel household search model which incorporates the value of SP as well as the pre-reform valuation assigned to the amenities in the formal sector relative to the alternatives (i.e., informal sector and non-employment), in order to understand whether access to free health services is valued by household members when they make their labor market decisions. Our structural model is able to replicate both the stocks of household types by Social Security coverage and the transitions in and out of employment and between formal and informal jobs in the pre-reform period. The results show that the steady-state marginal willingness to pay for the health insurance coverage provided by SP is very low, amounting to only 1.3%-4.2% of the mean wage in the informal sector. Lastly, using the model to simulate counterfactual scenarios of employment and labor formality under different valuations of the new health system implemented in Mexico, we find that the willingness to pay for SP would have had to be significantly greater than it was to have substantial impacts on the economy.
J42|Inter-firm mobility and return migration patterns of skilled guest workers|Abstract Two concerns central to the debate over skilled guest worker programs in the USA are that (1) guest workers are restricted from inter-firm mobility and are “effectively tied” to their firms, and (2) guest workers provide cheap and immobile labor that crowds out natives, especially during times of heightened unemployment. We address these concerns by using a unique dataset of employee records from six large Indian IT firms operating in the USA. We find that the guest workers in our sample exhibit a significant amount of inter-firm mobility that varies over both the earnings distribution and the business cycle. We also find that these workers exit the USA during periods of heightened unemployment. These findings provide new evidence on the implications of the institutional features and debate surrounding guest worker programs.
J42|Political participation and party capture in a dualized economy: A game theory approach|This paper examines the link of political participation and employment status in a dualized labor market. Both insiders and outsiders can actively take part in political decision-making, e.g. by voting for a certain party. Insiders only have the resources to also provide financial donations to policy-makers. Future policy outcomes are determined in a dynamic two-stage game. First, individuals choose their optimal quantity of support depending on policy strategies. Second, parties determine their optimal policy platform anticipating the individual behavior. In order to collect donations, parties are incentivized to occupy an insider-friendly position. Thereby, insiders are encouraged to participate in politics while outsiders are discouraged. Labor market dualization opens up a gap in political involvement which induces a reinforcement of economic segmentation. However, party capture by insiders is weaker, the more strongly a party is originally tied to outsiders. With two parties competing for support and donations, political inequality becomes firmly established since both parties fully adopt the insiders' preferences.
J42|How much does others’ protection matter? Employment protection and well-being|Workers’ well-being depends crucially on the legal framework and its statutes regulating the level of protection. While it seems obvious that a worker’s level of satisfaction is directly affected by the level of protection she receives, this paper argues that the level of protection other workers receive constitutes in integral part as well.
J42|Wage Inequality: A Structural Decomposition|The objective of this paper is to study why some workers are paid more than others. To do so we construct and quantitatively assess an equilibrium search model with on-the-job search, general human capital accumulation and two sided heterogeneity. In the model workers differ in abilities and firms differ in their productivities. The model generates a simple (log) wage variance decomposition that is used to measure the importance of firm and worker productivity differentials, frictional wage dispersion and workers' sorting dynamics. We calibrate the model using a sample of young workers from the UK. We show that heterogeneity among firms generates great deal of wage inequality. Among low skilled workers job ladder effects are small, most of the impact of experience on wages is due to learning-by-doing. High skilled workers are much more mobile. Job ladder effects have sizeable impact. (Copyright: Elsevier)
J42|Urbanization, Inequality, and Poverty in the People’s Republic of China|Relying on the present literature, official statistics, and household survey data in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), this paper summarizes research findings on the relationship between urbanization, urban–rural inequality, and poverty, and provides further empirical evidence on the role of urbanization and government policies in urban poverty. Several conclusions can be drawn from this paper. First, urbanization has a significant effect on reducing both poverty of rural residents and poverty of migrating peasants, and, consequently, has a positive effect on narrowing the rural–urban income/consumption gap. Urban labor markets play an important role in this effect. Second, urbanization is positively correlated to urban poverty. This can be explained by the competition between migrating peasants and urban workers in the labor market, and the failure of the government’s anti-poverty policies in urban areas. Third, the existence of an informal sector has a negative effect on the poverty of urban citizens. Being employed by the informal sector significantly increases the probability of falling into poverty for urban citizens. Fourth, the minimum wage has a positive effect on reducing urban poverty, while the effect of other policies, such as Di Bao and Minimum Living Standard, is limited.
J42|Local labor markets and taste-based discrimination|Abstract This article appeals to heterogeneity in workers’ non-wage preferences to model taste-based discrimination. Firms hire both types of workers and pay lower wages to minority workers, whatever their taste for discrimination. A single prejudiced firm in the market produces a substantial wage gap in all firms. Consequently, discrimination allows unprejudiced firms to make non-zero profits, so that they have little incentive to drive out prejudiced firms. As the market does not eliminate discrimination, state intervention is required. Indirect policies do not affect the absolute wage gap between the two groups, but may be more likely to be used than direct policies.
J42|Workforce segmentation in Germany: from the founding era to the present time<BR>[Die Segmentierung der Belegschaft in Deutschland: von der Gründerzeit bis heute]|Abstract Despite a more recent debate about ever deeper segmentation, the authors argue that since industrialization, Germany has continually experienced a dual labor market. One segment contains the primary segment of better paid and more attractive jobs, while the secondary segment encompasses rather low paid, less stable and less attractive jobs. Dualization is the result of firms which are likely to hire full-time and long-term workforce for its core activities while relying on more flexible forms of employment for other activities. Based on an in-depth examination of the structure of the workforce since 1871, the article investigates the factors which account for the origin, evolution and the peculiarities of the country’s core workforce. The authors show that a non-negligible part of the working population has always been subjected to marginalization, but that the dividing line between the two segments has changed over time as has the character of the respective groups.
J42|Local employer competition and training of workers| The new training literature suggests that in a monopsonistic market employers will not only pay for firm-specific training but also pay for general training if the risk of poaching is limited. This implies that training should decrease with more competition for employees among firms. Using worker-level data for Germany on training participation and on training duration, the authors find empirical support for this hypothesis. Specifically, the authors find that employees are significantly less likely to participate in training if the local density of firms in a sector is high and they have shorter training durations when the local sector concentration is low.
J42|Minimum Wage Effects on Labor Market Outcomes in Turkey|"This paper estimates the impact of minimum wages on the labor market outcomes in Turkey using the sizable minimum wage increase in 2004. Utilizing a quasi-experimental approach we provide new evidence from a developing country where the minimum wage is binding to a great extent. The increase took place in a period of strong economic growth and cost to the employer was partially subsidized by the government. Our results suggest that minimum wage increase of 2004 compressed the wage distribution from below. Using degree of impact measures we estimate that a 1 percent surge in the minimum wage increased wages by an extra 0.22-0.35 percent. Wage response was lower for informally working, low educated and young employees. Higher minimum wage was accompanied by an increase in the likelihood of informal employment. The minimum wage increase did raise working hours, suggesting that firms may have tried to offset part of the increase in the labor cost by increasing employment at the intensive margin. Estimations do not point out to an adverse impact for the overall employment. But due to data limitations results on employment are less robust. Furthermore, looking at the impact of minimum wages on the formal and informal divide, our results do not support the predictions of the dual market hypothesis on wages. We observe wage increase not only for the formal but also for the informal employees pointing out to the presence of a ""lighthouse"" effect previously documented for some other developing countries."
J42|Equilibrium Labor Turnover, Firm Growth, and Unemployment| This paper considers equilibrium quit turnover in a frictional labor market with costly hiring by firms, where large firms employ many workers and face both aggregate and firm specific productivity shocks. There is exogenous firm turnover as new (small) startups enter the market over time, while some existing firms fail and exit. Individual firm growth rates are disperse and evolve stochastically. The paper highlights how dynamic monopsony, where firms trade off lower wages against higher (endogenous) employee quit rates, yields excessive job‐to‐job quits. Such quits directly crowd out the reemployment prospects of the unemployed. With finite firm productivity states, stochastic equilibrium is fully tractable and can be computed using standard numerical techniques.
J42|Entrepreneurship versus joblessness: Explaining the rise in self-employment|A large share of the workforce throughout the developing world is self-employed, and this proportion has increased in recent decades. Assessments of this development vary, with pull factors such as high returns to capital contrasted with push factors such as barriers to more desirable salaried jobs. Using a long panel dataset from Ghana, we empirically investigate the changing structure of earnings in self-employment relative to salaried work. Our analysis allows workers to sort into self-employment for different reasons, including expected earnings differentials and endogenous capital accumulation whilst highlighting constraints that workers may face. We estimate a correlated random coefficient model using IV-GMM, taking into account the endogeneity of sector choice and capital accumulation. We find that returns to productive characteristics in self-employment have increased significantly between 2004 and 2011 whilst self-employment has attracted increasingly skilled workers. This points against the negative view of self-employment as an occupation of last resort.

J42|Monopsony and industrial development in nineteenth century Quebec: The impact of seigneurial tenure|We argue that the system of seigneurial tenure used in the province of Quebec until the mid-nineteenth centurya system which allowed significant market power in the establishment of plants, factories and mills, combined with restrictions on the mobility of the labor force within each seigneurial estateis best understood as a system of regionalized monopsonies in the non-farm sector. Seigneurs had incentives to reduce their employment in those sectors to reduce wage rates. We use the fact that later, with the Constitutional Act of 1791, all new settled lands had to be settled under a different system (British land laws). This natural experiment allows us to test our hypothesis that seigneurial tenure was a monopsony, using data from the 1831 and 1851 Lower Canada censuses. We find strong evidence that this difference in tenure partially explains the gap in industrial development between Quebec and the neighboring colony of Ontario.
J42|Wage Gaps, Earnings Gaps, and the Market Power of Employers|Women are less mobile between firms than men which gives employers more market power over women and explains parts of the gender wage gap. I rationalize this observation as a consequence of different gender roles in the household. The higher a spouse's earnings, the more likely relative wage differences outweigh utility differences between jobs. About 87\% of estimated differences in inter-firm mobility are attributed to this effect and are, thus, endogenous. This implies mutually enforcing cycles between wage gaps, earnings gaps, and employers' market power and has implications for the effects of labor-market policies.
J42|“Do anti-discrimination laws alleviate labor market duality? Quasi-experimental evidence from Korea”|Labor market segmentation is a growing phenomenon in many countries across different continents. In 2007, the Korean government undertook a labor reform prohibiting undue discriminatory treatment against fixed-term, part-time, and dispatched workers in an attempt to address income inequality arising from labor market duality. By exploiting a gradual introduction of the anti-discrimination law by firm size, I identify the treatment effects of the antidiscrimination law on gaps in wage and non-wage benefits between regular and non-regular workers, taking a difference-in-differences approach, a quasi-experimental design. My findings suggest that the imposition of the anti-discrimination law has significantly narrowed gaps in labor conditions between regular and non-regular workers. Labor conditions of targeted nonregular workers did not improve at the expense of those of non-targeted non-regular workers. Nevertheless, non-targeted non-regular workers being treated in a less favorable way raises another concern about the possibility of overusing non-targeted non-regular workers.
J42|The Structure of the Permanent Job Wage Premium: Evidence from Europe|" type=""main"" xml:id=""irel12129-abs-0001""> Using individual longitudinal European Community Household Panel data for thirteen countries during 1995–2001 and fixed-effects models, I find for men, the permanent job wage premium is higher for younger workers and those who were noncitizens or foreign born; for women, the premium is higher for young workers, short-tenure workers, and those who were noncitizens or foreign born. Thus, the gain to permanent employment is higher for those with less experience in the domestic labor market."
J42|Firm-Level Monopsony and the Gender Pay Gap|Using a dynamic labor supply model and linked employer-employee data, I find evidence of substantial search frictions, with females facing a higher level of frictions than males. However, the majority of the gender gap in labor supply elasticities is driven by across firm sorting rather than within firm differences, a feature predicted in the search theory literature, but which has not been previously documented. The gender differential in supply elasticities leads to 3.3% lower earnings for women. Roughly 60% of the elasticity differential can be explained by marriage and children penalties faced by women but not men.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J42|The unintended consequences of childcare regulation: Evidence from a regression discontinuity design|In several countries governments fund childcare provision but in many others it is privately funded as labor regulation mandates that firms have to provide childcare services. For this later case, there is no empirical evidence on the effects generated by the financial burden of childcare provision. In particular, there is no evidence on who effectively pays (firms or employees) and how (e.g., via wages and/or employment). Our hypothesis is that in imperfect labor markets, firms will transfer childcare cost on to their workers. To analyze this, we exploit a discontinuity in childcare provision mandated by Chilean labor regulation.
J42|Una aproximación a los efectos del “derrame” del salario mínimo en la estructura de remuneraciones de Argentina|En este artículo se examina si las modificaciones practicadas al salario mínimo en la Argentina durante los últimos años generaron efectos “derrame” en la estructura salarial. Se recurre para ello al análisis de las variaciones en las remuneraciones para distintos intervalos salariales que no estarían alcanzados por esta normativa. El enfoque metodológico se basa en la estimación de diferencias en diferencias, a través de mínimos cuadrados ordinarios, aplicada a datos de panel provenientes de la Encuesta Permanente de Hogares (EPH-Indec). Los resultados hallados confirman la existencia de estos efectos en aquellos segmentos de trabajadores con remuneraciones moderadamente superiores al mínimo legal. ***** This paper examines whether changes in the Argentinean minimum wage in recent years generated spillover effects on wages above the minimum. The analysis looks at the individual wage changes of those initially in a specified interval above the new legal minimum wage. The methodological approach is based on a differencein-differences estimator through ordinary least squares applied to panel data from the Permanent Household Survey (PHS-Indec). Our results confirm the existence of these effects in those segments of workers with wages moderately above the legal minimum.
J42|Informalidad laboral en los departamentos de Norte de Santander, Nariño, La Guajira y Cesar|El artículo tiene como objetivo analizar la informalidad laboral desde un contexto regional, que abarca los departamentos de las zonas de frontera, mediante una metodología de tipo no paramétrico y otra de corte paramétrico. Dentro de la metodología no paramétrica se usa la elasticidad arco y en la paramétrica se utiliza el método de datos de panel. Los resultados muestran una relación positiva entre la participación del PIB industrial, el coeficiente de Gini, la pobreza monetaria y la informalidad laboral para los departamentos objeto de análisis.
J42|Un análisis de los determinantes de la calidad del empleo en las medianas y grandes empresas y en el sector público de Argentina|Este documento tiene por objetivo analizar, durante 1995-2014, la interrelación entre la calidad del empleo en el mercado de trabajo de las medianas y grandes empresas y del sector público (MGEySP) y las variables macroeconómicas, laborales e institucionales que la literatura considera como sus principales factores determinantes. Para ello se utiliza la Encuesta Permanente de Hogares que permite seguir a 50 cohortes de individuos y se implementa el método de VAR. Los resultados obtenidos son consistentes con la hipótesis de segmentación. La tasa de informalidad laboral se mueve en forma contraria al ciclo económico mientras que la tasa de empleos de calidad es procíclica. También se aprecia una relación positiva entre el índice de apertura comercial y la tasa de empleos de calidad y negativa con la tasa de informalidad laboral. Pero los costes de contratación y las instituciones laborales incrementan los empleos informales y reducen las ocupaciones de mayor calidad.
J42|Endogenous labour market imperfection, foreign direct investment and external terms-of-trade shocks in a developing economy|This theoretical paper shows that developing countries possess an inherent shock-absorbing mechanism that stems from their peculiar institutional characteristics and can lessen the gravity of detrimental welfare consequence of international terms-of-trade disturbances in terms of a static two-sector, full-employment general equilibrium model with endogenous labour market distortion. The supply of foreign capital in the economy is a positive function of the return to capital. Subsequently, it has been verbally explained why the main result of the full-employment model would remain valid even in a two-sector specific-factor Harris-Todaro type model with urban unemployment. The analysis leads to a couple of important policies that should be adhered to preserve this in-built system. Finally, it offers three important statistically testable hypotheses which would pave the way for future empirical research in this area.
J42|Labour Markets in China: A Study of the Structure and Evolution of Wages|This paper examines the development of labour markets and the evolution of a structure of wages in China, using household surveys for 1988, 1995, 2002 and 2007. It finds evidence of both provincial and sectoral segmentation in labour markets, with eastern regions and the state-controlled sector enjoying high wage premiums in the early reform period. During the reform, China has progressed slowly towards an integrated labour market with convergence in incomes between the rural non-agriculture sector and the urban market-based sector by 1995, when industry flourished in the rural areas. The wage gap between the rural non-agriculture sector and other sectors increased and the urban state-controlled sector remained segmented with respect to all other sectors up to 2002. However, the data from 2007 show there has been increasing sectoral and spatial integration.
J42|Do Firms Pay Bonuses to Protect Jobs?|A large share of workers receives bonus payments besides their base wage. The benefits of flexible wage components in remuneration are twofold: they can incentivize workers and make it easier to adjust wages downward in response to negative shocks. Using data on bonus payments of Hungarian workers from linked employer-employee data, I disentangle the importance of these two factors to assess their respective importance. First, I show that bonus payments flexibly adjust to the revenue shocks of firms. At the same time, the separation rate of workers without bonuses do not react more to revenue changes than the separation rate of workers with bonuses. Bonus paying firms are shown to be financially more stable, larger and more productive, and they have less volatile revenue than firms not paying bonuses. These facts are consistent with a wage posting model with incentive contracting, but they are hard to reconcile with models emphasizing the role of bonus payments in alleviating wage rigidity. These results indicate that wage flexibility regulations may not affect the employment responses of firms to negative shocks.
J42|Industrial Segregation and Wage Gaps between Migrants and Local Urban Residents in China:2002-2013|This paper explores industrial segregation and its impact on the wage gaps between rural-to-urban migrants and local urban residents in China. Using the Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP) 2002 and 2013 surveys, we analyzed the probabilities of entry to various industries for both migrant and local urban resident groups; using the model of Brown et al. (1980), we then undertook a decomposition analysis of the wage gaps. Several major conclusions emerge. First, although inter-industry differentials and intra-industry differentials both affect the wage gap between migrants and local urban residents, the effect of intra-industrial differentials is greater in both 2002 and 2013. Second, in considering the effect of intra-industry differentials, while the influence of explained differentials is greater than that of unexplained differentials in both 2002 and 2013, the influence of the unexplained component of the intra-industrial differentials rises steeply from 19.4% (2002) to 68.0% (2013). The results show that when other factors are held constant, the problem of discrimination against migrants in a given industry is becoming more serious. In addition, the influence of the explained component of the intra-industry differentials rises from 61.2% (2002) to 77.7% (2013).

J42|Labour market segmentation and the financial situation of the pension system in Poland|Since 2014 Poland is the country with the highest share of temporary workers in the EU. Civil law contracts, a type of temporary contracts, allow payment of lower retirement pension contributions than implied by employment contracts. We use a cohort pension model to quantify the impact of civil law contract use on revenue from contributions and spending on pensions in Poland. Between 2005 and 2015, the rising incidence of civil law contracts reduced the revenue from contributions in the general pension system by PLN 2.4 billion per year on average. This widened the pension fund deficit by approx. 5%. In the future (2016-2050), the impact of civil law contracts on the revenue from contributions will wane because of demographic changes and rising educational attainment of the workforce. However, its impact on pension spending will increase with time, although it will be weaker than the effect on revenue from contributions. Hence, labour market segmentation will deteriorate the pension system balance. The obligation to pay contributions on all contracts of mandate from at least the minimum wage level, introduced in 2016, is not sufficient to balance out the impact of segmentation on the pension system balance.

J42|Islamism and Gender Relations in the Muslim World as Reflected in Recent World Values Survey Data|"Ever since Goldin (1995) proposed the idea that there is a U-shaped female labor force participation rate function in economic development, empirical research is stunned by the question why the countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) are characterized by such low rates of female labor force participation. This gap in labor economics research is all the more perplexing since gender equality, particularly in education and employment, significantly contributes to economic growth. The research strategy of the present paper is within a relatively new tradition in labor market research, initiated by the recent article by Besamusca, Tijdens, Keune and Steinmetz (2015), which does not exclude anymore the ""religious factor"" and what these authors call ""gender ideology"". Our analysis of the ""gender ideology"" of Islamism and gender values is based on an empirical analysis of World Values Survey data. In recent economic theory, Carvalho (2013) maintained that Muslim veiling is a strategy for integration, enabling women to take up outside economic opportunities while preserving their reputation within the community. The empirical data clearly support a pessimistic view. We show that Muslim Feminism, which implies according to our data analysis the rejection of the twin brothers - Islamism and the veil - and the democracy movement in the Muslim world are closely interrelated. Thus, it is imperative that Western Feminism develops solidarity with Muslim Feminism, and that labor economics does not exclude anymore ""the religious factor"" from the analytical frameworks explaining low female labor force participation rates."
J42|Labor market reforms in Europe: towards more flexicure labor markets?|Abstract Labor market segmentation refers to a salient divide between secure and insecure jobs and is related to problems in important areas, including macro-economic efficiency, workers’ well-being and repercussions for social cohesion. EU-28 countries have started a new wave of labor market reforms in the aftermath of the 2008/2009 crisis to tackle a number of issues, including labor market segmentation. This particularly concerns reforms in: (1) employment protection, i.e. dismissal protection and restrictions on fixed-term contracts; (2) unemployment benefit generosity and coverage; and (3) the intensity of active labor market policies. The paper provides an overview of reform patterns and tries to assess whether and to what extent these reforms have led to less dualized, more ‘flexicure’ labor markets in terms of dismissal protection, the provision of unemployment benefits and access to ALMPs. In particular, we will provide some evidence on potential changes in hirings on temporary contracts.
J42|Permanent Jobs, Employment Protection, and Job Content|Using Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) data for twentyâ€ one countries, I study the impact of employment protection laws (EPL) on job content. I find that workersâ€™ use of influence, reading, writing, planning, numeracy and information and computer technology skills, and their task discretion, were higher in permanent than in temporary jobs. Moreover, stricter EPL on permanent jobs raised the gap in job content for influence, reading, writing, and planning skills used in permanent jobs versus temporary jobs.
J42|Monopsonistic competition, low-wage labour markets, and minimum wages – An empirical analysis| This article investigates the degree of monopsony power of employers in different industries against the background of a statutory minimum wage introduction in Germany in January 2015. A semi-structural estimation approach is employed based on a dynamic model of monopsonistic competition. The empirical analysis relies on a linked employer–employee data set which allows to control for observed heterogeneity both on the worker and on the firm side. The results show important differences in monopsonistic competition among low-wage industries: While retailing, the hotel and restaurant industry as well as agriculture can be described as monopsonistic labour markets, this is not true for other services and manufacturing of food products. From a policy point of view, the introduction of a uniform minimum wage may therefore lead to different employment reactions in industries with a similar minimum wage bite.
J42|How do social networks affect labor markets?|Social networks, or “job-referral” networks, can help make labor markets become more efficient. Outside the firm, they help workers obtain employment after displacement and secure higher-paying jobs. They can also match highly-skilled workers to more productive employment. Inside the firm, referrals facilitate employment relationships that are more stable, productive, and profitable. In aggregate, referral networks help “grease the wheels” of a labor market that can be beset by a range of information problems. However, such networks can also be segmented along racial, ethnic, and socio-economic lines, which brings into question the effect they may have on inequality between and within different groups of workers.
J42|Gender wage discrimination|There are pronounced and persistent wage differences between men and women in all parts of the world. A significant element of these wage disparities can be attributed to differences in worker and workplace characteristics, which are likely to mirror differences in worker productivity. However, a large part of these differences remains unexplained, and it is common to attribute them to discrimination by the employer that is rooted in prejudice against female workers. Yet recent empirical evidence suggests that, to a large extent, the gaps reflect “monopsonistic” wage discrimination—that is, employers exploiting their wage-setting power over women—rather than any sort of prejudice.
J42|Unions and Wage Determination: Can Monopsonist Unions Reduce Unemployment?|"This paper extends the standard closed shop union model of wage determination by introducing endogeneity of union membership. The labor market outcome with endogenous membership may differ when unions behave monopsonisticaly relative to the case where they are ""membership-takers"", resulting in higher or lower wages (more or less favorable contract curve in efficient bargaining) according to the form union´s utility function and/or implicit decision process value union size. Some notes are added highlighting the role of membership fees in the membership function determination of a union that works as a nonprofit organization."
J42|Minimum wage through the looking glass|We investigate impacts of two major increases in minimum wage of Thailand in 2012, and 2013. In spite of the large increase in average wage induces by the hike, the effect on employment is positive. Given that roughly 40% of daily wage samples are less than the minimum wage, we build and estimate a model that incorporate (minimum wage) compliance decision. We use switching regressions to estimate the gap in wages between above and below minimum wage. This gap is sizable and statistically significant for daily wage, but small and statistically insignificant for monthly wage. When the employer's probability for compliance is included in the employment probability of individuals, we find that the higher compliance rate positively in- fluence the employment probability. These finding strongly suggest that the minimum wage hike in 2012~13 induced north-eastward shift of the equilibrium along the labor supply schedule. In the last part of the analysis, we offer a va- riety of circumstantial evidence in support of tacit collusion among large scale employers in setting daily wages.
J42|Holdup and hiring discrimination with search friction|A holdup problem on workers' skill investment can arise when employers adopt discriminatory hiring norm to extract higher than socially optimal profit. When hiring priority is determined by both productivity-dependent (skill level) and -independent characteristics (discrimination), skill investment decision becomes strategic between the discriminated and favored group. We consider frictional markets with either posted or bargained wage (fixed sharing rule). With posted wage, depending on market tightness there may be equilibrium or multiple equilibria on skill investment. With discriminatory hiring, if in equilibrium both groups stay high skilled, both are worse off and firms better off; In any equilibrium where one group underinvest, the other group remain high skilled and are better off, while firms are worse off with discrimination. With bargained wage, similar equilibrium where the favored group underinvest exists, and firms incur cost for an intermediate range of bargaining power when they discriminate
J42|Disruptive Change in the Taxi Business: The Case of Uber|In most cities, the taxi industry is highly regulated and has restricted entry. Ride sharing services, such as Uber and Lyft, which use mobile internet technology to connect passengers and drivers, have begun to compete with traditional taxis. This paper examines the efficiency of ride sharing services vis-a-vis taxis. In most cities with data available, UberX drivers spend a significantly higher fraction of their time, and drive a substantially higher share of miles, with a passenger in their car than do taxi drivers. Reasons for this efficiency advantage are explored.
J42|Hiring costs for skilled workers and the supply of firm-provided training|This article analyses how the costs of hiring skilled workers from the external labour market affect a firm’s supply of training. Using administrative survey data with detailed information on hiring and training costs for Swiss firms, we find evidence for substantial and increasing marginal hiring costs. However, firms can invest in internal training of unskilled workers and thereby avoid costs for external hiring. Controlling for a firm’s training investment, we find that a 1 standard deviation increase in average external hiring costs increases the number of internal training positions by more than half of a standard deviation.
J42|Spinning the Industrial Revolution|Abstract: The prevailing explanation for why the Industrial Revolution occurred first in Britain is Robert Allenâ€™s (2009) â€˜highâ€ wage economyâ€™ view, which claims that the high cost of labour relative to capital and fuel incentivized innovation and the adoption of new techniques. This paper presents new empirical evidence on hand spinning before the Industrial Revolution and demonstrates that there was no such â€˜highâ€ wage economyâ€™ in spinning, a leading sector of industrialization. We quantify the working lives of frequently ignored female and child spinners who were crucial to the British textile industry in the Early Modern period with evidence of productivity and wages from the late sixteenth to the early nineteenth century. Our results show that spinning was a widespread, lowâ€ wage, lowâ€ productivity employment, in line with the Humphries (2013) view of the motivations for the factory system.
J42|Multiproduct Cournot oligopoly|We present a general Cournot model in which each firm may sell multiple quality-differentiated products. We use an upgrades approach, working not with the actual products, but instead with upgrades from one quality to the next. The properties of single-product Cournot models carry over to the supply of upgrades, but not necessarily to the supply of complete products. A firm`s product line is determined by the properties of demand, its costs, and competitor characteristics. For symmetric firms, these determinants reduce to returns to quality and changes in demand elasticity as quality increases. For asymmetric firms whose (potentially endogenous) technological capabilities are defined by their maximum feasible qualities, gaps in product lines are determined precisely by the capabilities of lesser rivals. Strategic commitment to product lines prior to quantity competition is considered. Incentives to so commit are markedly different from those under price-setting models.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J42|The Effects of Economic Growth on Earnings in Bolivia|This paper analyzes the effects of economic growth on labor earnings in Bolivia during 1999-2012. More precisely, we develop a labor market model to capture both cycle and trend effects of prices, and production on earnings, which is estimated econometrically using pseudo-panel data methods. The results show that labor earnings have had a pro-cyclical behavior. In particular, we find that, in the short run, an increase of 1% in prices or production explains an earnings rise of around 0.5%, while, in the long run, a production increase of 1% is associated with an earnings variation of 0.4%. Furthermore, we find that labor earnings growth by sector follows, to some extent, the economic performance of its corresponding sector, which responds to the sector segmentation characteristics in the Bolivian labor market.
J42|Labor Market Heterogeneity and the Aggregate Matching Function|We estimate an aggregate matching function and find that the regression residual, which captures movements in matching efficiency, displays procyclical fluctuations and a dramatic decline after 2007. Using a matching function framework that explicitly takes into account worker heterogeneity as well as market segmentation, we show that matching efficiency movements can be the result of variations in the degree of heterogeneity in the labor market. Matching efficiency declines substantially when, as in the Great Recession, the average characteristics of the unemployed deteriorate substantially, or when dispersion in labor market conditions—the extent to which some labor markets fare worse than others—increases markedly. (JEL E24, E32, J41, J42)
J42|Wage Inequality|The objective of this paper is to study why are some workers paid more than others. To do so we construct and quantitatively assess an equilibrium search model with on-the-job search, general human capital accumulation and two sided heterogeneity. In the model workers differ in abilities and firms differ in their productivities. The model generates a simple (log) wage variance decomposition that is used to measure the importance of firm and worker productivity differentials, frictional wage dispersion and workers' sorting dynamics. We calibrate the model using a sample of young workers for the UK. We show that heterogeneity among firms generates a lot of wage inequality. Among low skilled workers job ladder effects are small, most of the impact of experience on wages is due to learning-by-doing. High skilled workers are much more mobile. Job ladder effects have sizeable impact.
J42|Landmarks Of Youth Labor Market Developments In The Knowledge-Based Society|In recent decades, a continuous process of transition of the world economy from the development based on traditional factors to the one based on knowledge occurred. Development of the knowledge economy leads to changes in the labour market demand: new skills and abilities are required. With the introduction of new technologies the demand for highly skilled workers for low-skilled workers decreased.Although the young people have knowledge regarding new media tools and virtual environments, indispensable tools to the labour market in a knowledgebased economy, their unemployment rate is still double than the adult unemployment rate in some EU countries.n This paper presents a brief analysis of the problems faced by young people in the labour market, of the measures adopted in various countries in order to increase the role of education and training, both basic and continuing so as to increase the labour market insertion of young people in Romania and the EU-28 countries.
J42|Informality and Segmentation in the Mexican Labor Market|In developing countries, some workers have formal jobs while others are occupied in informal positions. One view regarding this duality suggests that sectors are segmented, which means that a worker in the informal sector identical to another in the formal sector cannot get a formal position due to entry barriers. A second view states that workers self-select into informal jobs. Previous research suggests that these two situations may coexist in the same labor market. In this paper we identify the proportion of informal workers who are in each situation for the case of Mexico. Using a simple model of self-selection with entry barriers into the formal sector, we estimate that between 10 and 20 percent of informal workers would prefer to have a formal job. While this result provides evidence of the presence of some segmentation in the Mexican labor market, it suggests that an important proportion of workers in the informal sector self-select into it.
J42|Financial incentives and labour market duality|The French labour market is divided between workers in permanent jobs and those who alternate fixed-term contracts with unemployment spells. Among other public policies aiming at reducing this duality, financial incentives could induce employers to lengthen contract duration or favour permanent contracts. This article develops a matching model fitted to the French labour market characteristics and calibrated on French data. A gradual decrease in unemployment contributions or a firing tax reduces the share of short-term contract in total employment but increases market rigidity and lowers labour productivity. However, decreasing unemployment contributions gradually is less favourable for new entrants than a firing tax and lengthens unemployment spells. An additional contribution levied on short-term contracts to finance a bonus for permanent-contract hirings also decreases labour market duality and increases activity by 0.13% but without negative impacts on labour market flexibility and productivity.

J42|Offshoring and the Geography of Jobs in Great Britain|This paper investigates the impact of the offshoring of production activities on domestic jobs in Great Britain. The paper considers both the spatial heterogeneity across local labour markets and variations in the intensity of outward flows of investments abroad (OFDI) across industries in order to shed new light on the job creation/destruction implications of offshoring. The results suggest that offshoring may generate significant job losses in routine occupations in areas that have been more exposed to the relocation of production abroad, regardless of whether the relocation has been to developed or developing/emerging countries. Offshoring to developing/emerging countries has, by contrast, a positive effect on the generation of non-routine jobs. Efficiency gains accruing from the international reorganization of production increase in the long-run, with compensation mechanisms operating through growth of employment in higher value added activities at home. Overall, our results uncover important spatial and interpersonal inequalities in job creation, which provide new challenges for public policy.

J42|Informalidad y segmentación del mercado laboral: el caso de la Argentina|En este documento se evalúa la presencia de segmentación en el mercado laboral argentino. El análisis se centra en la comparación de los ingresos de los trabajadores formales e informales, mediante dos enfoques distintos sobre la definición de informalidad. Se comprueba la existencia de una prima formal por medio de la utilización de datos dinámicos y técnicas semiparamétricas. Se analizó el período comprendido entre 1996 y 2006 de todas las zonas urbanas encuestadas. Los resultados obtenidos respaldan la hipótesis de la segmentación del mercado laboral urbano de la Argentina, esto es, que trabajadores que cuentan con probabilidades similares para transitar de un sector a otro perciben ingresos diferentes.
J42|Informality and labour market segmentation: the case of Argentina|The document evaluates the presence of segmentation in the Argentinean labour market. The analysis is centred on the comparison of the earnings of formal and informal workers. Two different approaches to the definition of informality are used. The existence of a formal premium is tested using dynamic data and semiparametric techniques. The period analysed is 1996-2006 for all urban surveyed areas. Our results support the segmentation hypothesis for the Argentine urban labour market: workers with similar probabilities of entering/exiting across sectors obtain different earnings.
J42|Firm market power and the earnings distribution|Using the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) data from the United States Census Bureau, I compute firm-level measures of labor market (monopsony) power. To generate these measures, I extend the empirical strategy of Manning (2003) and estimate the labor supply elasticity facing each private non-farm firm in the U.S. While a link between monopsony power and earnings has traditionally been assumed, I provide the first direct evidence of the positive relationship between a firm's labor supply elasticity and the earnings of its workers. I also contrast the dynamic model strategy with the more traditional use of concentration ratios to measure a firm's labor market power. In addition, I provide several alternative measures of labor market power which account for potential threats to identification such as endogenous mobility. Finally, I construct a counterfactual earnings distribution which allows the effects of firm market power to vary across the earnings distribution.

J42|Development and the labor share|We highlight a U-shaped relationship between development and the labor share of income. We exploit the “within dimension” of a panel dataset for the labor share in the manufacturing sectors of developing countries. Data is also available at the disaggregated level for 28 manufacturing subsectors. We show that the U-shaped pattern of the labor share is also observed at the subsector level suggesting that it does not correspond to reallocation forces across sectors during the development process. We show that standard theories of develop- ment economics that feature duality on the labor market generate such a pattern. At earlier stages of development, productivity gains are not compensated by wage increases as most of the workforce’s outside opportunities remain in the traditional sector where firms’ productivity is low. At later stages, the labor share increases as the result of wage competition in the modern, high productivity sector.
J42|Precarious and less well-paid? Wage differences between permanent and fixed-term contracts across the EU countries|This paper analyses the main features of the wage differences between permanent and fixed-term workers and what sources are driving these differences, including the role of labour market institutions. We analyse wage differences between permanent and fixed-term contracts across EU countries using data from the European Structure of Earnings Survey. We find that after controlling for individual and job characteristics, workers on permanent contracts earn on average about 15% more than workers on fixed-term contracts with similar observable characteristics. The permanent contract wage premium is higher for men, workers at middle age and with middle education, and performing non-elementary occupations. We also find that permanent workers enjoy a higher education and age wage premium. We explore cross-country differences in the wage premium for permanent workers and correlate them with indicators of labour market institutions. Results indicate that a high wage premium for workers with permanent contracts is associated with high levels of employment protection for workers on permanent contracts, a high share of temporary employment in the economy, lengthy periods of unemployment benefit entitlement, and low minimum wages.
J42|Cinsiyete Dayalı Bölünmüş İşgücü Piyasası Analizi: Türkiye AB Karşılaştırması|İşgücü piyasalarının yapısını inceleyen yaklaşımlar içinde, Bölünmüş İşgücü Piyasası Teorisi (Labour Market Segmentation Theory) piyasada sektör, meslek ve cinsiyet gibi farklı temellere dayanan bölümlenmeler olduğunu belirtmektedir. Teoride iyi iş /kötü iş veya kadın işi/erkek işi gibi ayrışmalarla vurgulanan cinsiyet eşitsizliğine dayalı bölümlenme, sektörel ve mesleki temelde kadının tabi olduğu farklı katmanlara ve belirgin sektör ve meslek gruplarında kadınların yoğun biçimde istihdam edildiğine işaret etmektedir. Cinsiyet eşitsizliğine dayalı işgücü piyasası bölünmesi pek çok ülkede olduğu gibi, Avrupa işgücü piyasalarının da belirgin bir özelliğidir. Bu nedenle Avrupa İstihdam Stratejisi’nde Fırsat Eşitliği başlığı altında bu bölümlenme ele alınmakta ve söz konusu eşitsizliğin giderilmesi temel hedef olarak sunulmaktadır. Avrupa Birliği (AB) ile müzakere süreci devam eden Türkiye için de benzer hedefler söz konusu olmakta ve bu açıdan Türkiye’nin AB’ye göre karşılaştırmalı analizinin yapılması önem arz etmektedir. Bu çalışmada, Türkiye ve AB üye ülkeleri için işgücü piyasasındaki sektörel ve mesleki temeldeki bölünme/yoğunlaşma “cinsiyet oranı” aracılığıyla karşılaştırmalı bir biçimde ortaya konulmaya çalışılacaktır. Türkiye’nin durumun bu şekilde analiz edilmesi, işgücü piyasasında katmanlar arasında geçişliliği engelleyen kurumsal ya da kurumsal olmayan cinsiyete dayalı faktörlerin anlaşılmasına yardımcı olmaktadır. Böylelikle, AB ile uyumu gözeten istihdam politikalarında yalnızca kadının işgücüne katılımını arttırmanın yeterli olmadığı, söz konusu engelleyici faktörlerin ortadan kaldırılmasının da gerekli olduğu vurgulanmış olacaktır.

J42|Workforce Mobility Against The Background Of Labour Market Duality Theory – The Example Of Selected Oecd Countries|The paper aims to present an empirical study of labour market segmentation (LMS) hypothesis. According to the dual labour market theory jobs can be divided into two groups: primary and secondary jobs, with enter barriers into the first one. The primary jobs are usually described with relative high wages, whereas secondary jobs provide lower level of wages. In this paper we first examine the main sectors (according to the ISIC rev. 3) in selected OECD countries, which are divided into two segments, regarding the level of average sectoral wages. Then, the intersectoral labour mobility within the secondary segment and the labour mobility from the secondary segment to the primary segment in every analysed country is measured for the years 1994-2008. A Markov chain analysis based on aggregate data is used to identify the differences in the workforce mobility and confirmed the existence of barriers on the segmented labour market. According to the main purpose of this paper the divided nature of labour market is verified. Our research show that in case of Finland, Greece, Spain, Canada, Portugal and United Kingdom, the divisions in labour market are substantial. On account of the significant differences in workforce mobility within and outside the secondary segment, we can indicate a typical duality in labour market in these countries.
J42|Dimensions of Precarity: A Contradictory Case of Non-Standard Employment|This paper discusses the concept of ‘precarious employment’ in relation to the Swedish shipbuilding industry in the 1960s and 1970s. In this setting, characterized by shortage of labour, a dual labour market structure emerged, where some workers were directly employed by the shipyards and others indirectly employed through intermediaries. The case differs from classical accounts of dual labour markets and it is not obvious to use the term precarious employment to describe the situation of the external workers. On the one hand, the external workers had insecure jobs and were involved in triangular employment relationships, where the true identity and responsibility of the employer was unclear. They were also excluded from the social security systems. On the other hand, the external workers appear to have had higher incomes, opportunities to work long hours, less responsibility for unrewarding maintenance tasks and perhaps even the advantage of working under more flexible supervision. The case demonstrates the diversity that can be found in historical work arrangements and suggests that the term precarious employment should be applied with some caution, both past and present.
J42|The Minimum Wage and a Non-Competitive Market for Qualifications|In this paper we consider an equilibrium model of demand and supply for several qualifications first in a competitive setting and then in a non-competitive setting. We propose a tractable analytical framework, i.e. when workers choose between qualifications according to a multinomial logit model of choice and when a CES production function describes the substitutions possibilities between the different types of labour. While in the competitive case the effects of the minimum wage are those we expect, in the imperfectly competitive case we find that a minimum wage can create unemployment and we find that the welfare of the population as a function of the minimum wage is not unimodal. We show furthermore that allowing one qualification to be exempted from the minimum wage does not mean that its relative demand is unaffected by changes to the minimum wage.
J42|Not so standard anymore? : employment duality in Germany (Vom Normalarbeitsverhältnis zu atypischen Verträgen? : die Dualisierung des deutschen Arbeitsmarktes)|"""This paper gives an overview of the transformation of the German labour market since the mid-1990s with a special focus on the changing patterns of labour market segmentation or 'dualisation' of employment in Germany. While labour market duality in Germany can partially be attributed to labour market reforms promoting, in particular, non-standard forms of employment and allowing for an expansion of low pay, structural changes in the economy as well as strategic choices by employers and social partners also play a prominent role. Our main argument is that the liberalization of non-standard contracts has contributed to the expansion of overall labour market inclusion and job growth in Germany and that at least some forms of non-standard work provide stepping stones into permanent regular jobs. Atypical contracts do not necessarily undermine the dominance of standard employment relationships and job quality in this primary segment but rather form a supplementary part of employment in sectors and occupations that depend on more flexible and maybe cheaper forms of labour.""

J42|The impact of temporary agency work on trade union wage setting: A theoretical analysis|Focusing on the cost-reducing motive behind the use of temporary agency employment, this paper aims at providing a better theoretical understanding of the effects of temporary agency work on the wage-setting process, trade unions' rents, firms' profits and employment. It is shown that trade unions may find it optimal to accept lower wages to prevent firms from using temporary agency workers. Hence, the firms' option to use agency workers may affect wage setting also in those firms that only employ regular workers. However, if firms decide to employ agency workers, trade union wage claims will increase for the (remaining) regular workers. An intensive use of temporary agency workers in high-wage firms may therefore be the cause and not the consequence of the high wage level in those firms. Even though we assume monopoly unions that ascribe the highest possible wagesetting power to the unions, the economic rents of trade unions decline because of the firms' option to use temporary agency work, whereas firms' profits may increase.
J42|Information Frictions and Labor Market Outcomes|We analyze the impact of information frictions on workers' wages, contributing to the literature that tested search theory, which has so far focused on labor market frictions in general and not specifically on information asymmetries. Using data for 16 countries from the European Social Survey 2008, we find a sizeable gap between workers' perceptions of the unemployment rate and the actual unemployment rate in the country, which is a meaningful indicator of their misperception of labor market tightness. To handle the interval nature of our outcome of interest, the earnings variable, we estimate interval regressions, as well as ordered probit models. We follow a threefold strategy to tackle potential endogeneity problems, as the model includes: controls for the worker's ability; country-specific fixed effects; the unemployment rate in the region of residence, which might be the benchmark respondents have in mind when reporting their perception of the national unemployment rate and which is known to influence regional wages. Results show that when subjective perceptions overstate the unemployment rate in the country, a one percentage point gap between the perceived and the actual unemployment rate reduces individual wages by 0.4 to 0.7 percent. We discuss a potential mechanism generating this result. A pessimistic view of the labor market leads to concern over own future employment prospects and is thus likely to lower reservation wages; a too optimistic view, in turn, could raise reservation wages, but it would render job finding more difficult.
J42|Bound to lose, bound to win? The financial crisis and the informal-formal sector earnings gap in Serbia|While the informal sector has received widespread attention in academic and policy arenas in recent decades, knowledge gaps and controversies remain. By examining the incidence and determinants of the formal-informal sector earnings gap for adult male dependent employees using two identical, nationally representative labor force surveys for Serbia—one just prior to the impact of the recent international financial crisis and one about a year into the crisis—for three alternative measures of informality, this paper adds to our understanding in several dimensions. Among the main results is the finding of a substantively large formal-informal sector earnings gap (favoring the formal sector)—across three alternative informality measures—which appears to have decreased substantially overall following the crisis. Additional results suggest that formal sector workers are concentrated in better paying industries and occupations and have more education and other favorable characteristics than informal sector workers, and at the same time also have higher returns to their (already favorable) characteristics overall, with education and part-time status consistently among the main drivers of the observed gap.

J42|Precarious and Less Well Paid? Wage Differences between Permanent and Fixed-term Contracts across the EU|We analyse wage differences between permanent and fixed-term contracts across the EU using data from the European Structure of Earnings Survey. We find that, after controlling for individual and job characteristics, workers on permanent contracts earn on average about 15% more than workers on fixed-term contracts with similar observable characteristics. The permanent contract wage premium is higher for men, workers at middle age and with middle education, and performing non-elementary occupations. We also find that permanent workers enjoy a higher wage premium for education and age. We explore cross-country differences in the wage premium for permanent workers and correlate them with indicators of labour market institutions. In particular, results indicate that the wage premium is higher the stricter is employment protection for permanent contracts and the higher the share of temporary employment, which supports the view that workers with fixed-term contracts suffer from a negative wage gap due to lower bargaining power.
J42|Évolution des salaires dans la crise : quels sont les liens avec l'externalisation de la production et la financiarisation du capital ?|Our analysis related to the transformation of the relationship between wages and qualification in the context of the financialization of business and employment development in services. Our inquiry is focused on the transformation of labor management forms by firms in France. Segmentation theory of the labor market renders this goal by differentiating workforce management forms. Our main objective here is to look for the very structural causes of the segmentation shift for specific jobs, especially causes related to business environment change (international competition, financialization and emerging needs, in particular)
J42|Can Fixed-Term Contracts Put Low Skilled Youth on a Better Career Path? Evidence from Spain|Fixed-term contracts have low firing costs and can thus help low skilled youth find a first job faster. But do these workers get a more rewarding career? Using Spanish social security data, we compare the careers of native male high-school dropouts who entered the labor market just before and just after a large liberalization in the use of fixed-term contracts in 1984. Using a cohort regression discontinuity design we find that the reform raised the likelihood of working before age 20. However, by substantially increasing the number of employment spells it reduced workers' accumulated employment up to 2006 by almost 200 days and accumulated wages by 22%. These effects are concentrated during the first 5-10 years of these young workers' career. We conclude that widespread fixed-term contracts have harmed the careers of low-skilled workers.
J42|Endogenous Labour Market Imperfections, FDI and External Terms-of-Trade Shocks in a Developing Economy|This paper shows that developing countries possess an inherent shock-absorbing mechanism that stems from their peculiar institutional characteristics and can lessen the gravity of detrimental welfare consequence of exogenous terms-of-trade disturbances in terms of a two-sector, full-employment general equilibrium model with endogenous labour market distortion. The supply of foreign capital in the economy is a positive function of the return to capital and a decreasing function of the degree of prevailing restrictions in the economy in the process of free inflow of foreign capital. The analysis leads to a couple of important policies that should be adhered to preserve this in-built system. Finally, it offers three important statistically testable hypotheses, empirical validation of which might have an important bearing on formulation of developmental policies in these countries.
J42|Land competition and monopsonistic monopoly: the role of the narco-insurgency in the colombian cocaine market|The main purpose of this paper is to model the role of the narco-insurgency in the structure and functioning of the colombian cocaine market. The narco-insurgency gets important profits from this market by controlling the land for producing coca-leaf, and the production of inputs for trading cocaine. These inputs could be paste or base of cocaine, or even cocaine before trading it to the final consumers. Those profits allow the narco-insurgency to configure and sustain such a market structure that guarantees it to obtain them permanently. We proceed by four steps. First, we model the land conflict between the narco-insurgency and the government. The output of this process is a valuation of the land for producing coca-leaf. The second stage concerns the farmers. By using violence, the narco-insurgency obligates the farmers to participate in the cocaine market as producers of coca-leaf. It charges them a tax for the coca-leaf production, and also it fixes them the coca-leaf price through its monopsonistic power. In the third stage, the narco-insurgency produces those inputs for trading cocaine and sell them monopolistically to cocaine traffickers, which compete each one in an oligopolistic market. The gap between the coca-leaf price and the price of inputs for trading cocaine explains the profits that narco-insurgency obtains from this illegal market.
J42|Land control or interdiction? Searching for a clue in the colombian cocaine market|The purpose of this note is to estimate the relative impact of interdiction and land control on the colombian cocaine market. The government interdicts part of the cocaine traffic and controls part of the arable land with the aim of weakening this illegal market. Our estimation depends on the price elasticity of the coca-leaf supply, in particular, the importance of the land with respect to other factors in the production of coca-leaf.
J42|Holdup and hiring discrimination with search friction|A holdup problem on workers’ skill investment arises when employers can adopt discriminatory hiring norm to extract higher than socially optimal profit. In such an economy, productivity (skills) and non-productivity oriented characteristics (discrimination) both matter when determining which worker has priority. The resulting firms’ preference is an intertwined ranking order, by virtue of which the strategic interdependence in skill choices between discriminated and favored groups endogenously arises. We consider frictional markets with either posted or bargained wage. With posted wage, discrimination makes all workers worse off, firms gain. Through that payoff interdependence, we identify two effects along which one group’s underinvestment may benefit all groups. With bargained wage, the discriminated (favored) group is always worse (better) off, and firms incur cost for an intermediated range of bargaining power when they discriminate. This suggests that the holdup-discrimination problem can be mitigated when search is random and wages bargained, a result in the opposite direction of Acemoglu and Shimer (1999b).
J42|Zum Zusammenhang von prekaeren Beschaeftigungsbedingungen und Interessenvertretung im Dienstleistungssektor (The interrelation of precarious employment conditions and institutions of collective interest representation in the service sector)|Eine Ausweitung der Dienstleistungsbeschaeftigung in Kombination mit zunehmender Frauenerwerbstaetigkeit gehen in der Bundesrepublik seit den 1990er Jahren mit einer Erosion der Institutionen kollektiver Interessenvertretung, der Zunahme atypischer Beschaeftigung und einer Expansion des Niedriglohnsektors einher. Der vorliegende Artikel analysiert daher den Strukturzusammenhang zwischen Interessenvertretung und entsprechend prekaeren Beschaeftigungsbedingungen sowie die korrespondierenden Akteurstrategien in frauendominierten, beschaeftigungsexpansiven Berufsfeldern des Dienstleistungsbereichs. Fuer alle drei hier untersuchten Berufsfelder (Gebaeudereinigung, Medizinische Fachangestellten und Sozialarbeit/Erzieher) ist als Ergebnis festzuhalten, dass das Vorhandensein von Interessenvertretung mit geringeren Anteilen von Niedriglohnbeschaeftigung einhergeht. Im Falle atypischer Beschaeftigung hingegen zeigen sich aufgrund differenzierter Schliessungs- und oeffnungsstrategien in den einzelnen Berufsfeldern jeweils unterschiedliche Zusammenhaenge. (Since the 1990s the growing service sector and increasing female labor market integration in Germany are linked to the expansion of atypical and the low-wage employment as well as the erosion of institutions of collective interest representation. This article analyses the structural interrelations of these forms of precarious employment and the institutions of interest representation as well as actors’ strategies in female-dominated professional fields in the German service sector. A general result of the in-depth studies of three professional fields (cleaners, doctors’ assistants and social workers/child minders) indicates that the existence of institutions of interest representation minimises the extent of low-wage employment. Due to different actors’ strategies concerning ‘opening’ and ‘closing’ in the professional fields, the interrelation with respect to the extent of atypical employment varies.)
J42|Organisierte Ungleichheit in der Leiharbeit? (Organised inequality in temporary work?)|In diesem Beitrag stellen wir die Frage ins Zentrum, wie Kollektivakteure arbeitsbezogene Ungleichheiten in einer sozialen Umwelt mit institutionalisierten Arbeitsbeziehungen sozial konstruieren. Empirisch untersuchen wir qualitativ-explorativ, wie sich die Kategorisierung von Leiharbeit durch Praktiken der Signifikation, Legitimation und Domination auf der Meso-Ebene der Regulation von Arbeit vollzieht. Ein Befund ist, dass die Signifikation der Leiharbeit als benachteiligte Form der Arbeitskraftnutzung weithin geteilt wird, die arbeitspolitischen Akteure jedoch erheblich in der Bewertung darueber abweichen, ob diese Benachteiligung gerechtfertigt ist. Aus dieser Diskrepanz resultieren unterschiedliche Strategien der Akteure: Waehrend die Arbeitgeberseite eine symbolische Aufwertung der Leiharbeit als legitime Beschaeftigungskategorie anstrebt, versuchen die Arbeitnehmervertreter eine Gleichbehandlung der Leiharbeiter in materieller Hinsicht zu erreichen. Im Ergebnis befoerdert dieser Konflikt um die Deutungshoheit paradoxerweise die Rekategorisierung der Leiharbeit als eine Beschaeftigungsform mit hoeherer Legitimitaet, und zwar trotz fortbestehender Ungleichbehandlung der Leiharbeiter. (In this article we examine how collective actors construct work-related inequalities in a social environment characterised by institutionalised labour-management-relations. Empirically, we select a qualitative-explorative approach for illuminating how the categorisation of temporary work is shaped through the practices of signification, legitimation and domination in regulating work at the meso-level. We find that collective actors share the signification of temporary work as a disadvantaged form of employment, whereas they diverge in their evaluation of the legitimacy of this disadvantage. Actors derive conflicting strategies from these divergent evaluations: the employer side aims at a symbolic upgrading of temporary agency work as a legitimate category of employment, whereas labour representatives try to establish equal treatment of agency workers on material grounds. The paradoxical result of this evaluation contest is that temporary agency work is re-categorised as a type of employment with higher legitimacy, despite continued unequal treatment of agency workers.)
J42|Employment Pattern, Skills and Training Issues among Informal Sector Workers in Mumbai Metropolitan Region|An informal sector in any economy provides different kinds of employment opportunities to people. In Mumbai Metropolitan Region, the female are more involved in regular jobs as compare to the causal and self-employed workers. The secondary and college studied male and female are found more in regular jobs. The high school studied male and illiterate female are working on causal jobs. The causal jobs do not require more education and skills. In self-employed category, the secondary school studied male and high school studied female are found more. The monthly income of workers involved in regular jobs is much higher than the causal and self-employed workers. The moderate malnourished females are found more as compare to the male in causal and self-employed category. The multi nominal logit regression model shows that the causal workers have positive correlation with illiterate male but it is negatively co-related with high school studied male, illiterate and secondary studied female. The monthly income, source of water, refrigerator and condom use is negatively co-related with causal workers as compare to regular workers. The self-employed workers have negative co-relation with monthly wage, source of water and watch cinema regularly as compare to the regular workers. Therefore government must provide infrastructural facilities in all slums of region. The infrastructural facilities such as water supply, electricity, sewage and solid waste collection must be provided in all slums of region. Causal workers must be provided the vocational training to start their own business. Commercial and co-operative banks must provide loans to poor people of slums. Females must be encouraged to take loan and start small business. Government must provide low cost housing to causal and self-employed workers in region. Such policies will certainly improve standard of living of informal sector workers in region.
J42|Minimum wage violations in Honduras|This article studies minimum wage non-compliance in Honduras, a dual labor market with high wage floors that are weakly enforced. However, rather than just counting how many workers earn sub-minimum wages, it also estimates violation indices that measure compliance at the intensive margin. I first explore cross-sectional heterogeneity in violations using household survey data. Then, I quantify compliance adjustments to minimum wage hikes by comparing indices before and after a large unexpected increase. Results show substantial differences in non-compliance across industries, location, and coverage status. Violations worsen with rising minima, but less in in more compliant sectors.

J42|Low-Wage Labor Markets and the Power of Suggestion| The paper argues that a non-binding minimum wage may serve as a focal point which facilities tacit collusion by low-wage employers, effectively pulling down wages of the lowest-paid workers. This can explain the puzzle as to why the minimum wage does not reduce employment, as predicted by the traditional economic theory. A simple game-theoretic argument explains when collusion emerges. The hypothesis is tested using the 1990-2002 CPS data on service occupation workers. The results suggest that during this period, on average 19.3%, and as much as 31% of service occupation workers, who earned minimum wage or less, could had been affected by collusive wage-setting.
J42|On-the-Job Search and City Structure|We investigate an equilibrium search model in which the search frictions are increasing with the distance to the central business district allowing for on-the-job search and endogenous (monopsony) wage formation and land allocation. We find that there are many different possible outcomes with respect to the location of unemployed workers within a metropolitan area. The city structure of the decentralized market is only efficient when commuting costs of the employed workers are large. Policies reducing the rental costs of unemployed workers for locations close to the central business district can potentially increase welfare.
J42|Monopsony Exploitation in Professional Sport: Evidence from Major League Baseball Position Players, 2000–2011| Some professional athletes still face monopsony power in labor markets, underscoring the importance of estimating players' marginal revenue product to assess its effects. We introduce two new empirical approaches, spline revenue functions and fixed‐effects stochastic production functions, into the standard Scully (1974) approach to marginal revenue product estimation and calculate Monopsony Exploitation Ratios (MERs) for position players in Major League Baseball over the 2001–2011 seasons. Estimates indicate that MERs are about 0.89 for rookie players, 0.75 for arbitration eligible players, and 0.21 for free agents. Recent collective bargaining agreements have reduced MERs for free agents, but had no effect on MERs for other players. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
J42|The Impact of Temporary Agency Work on Trade Union Wage Setting: A Theoretical Analysis|Focusing on the cost-reducing motive behind the use of temporary agency employment, this paper aims at providing a better theoretical understanding of the effects of temporary agency work on the wage-setting process, trade unions' rents, firms' profits and employment. It is shown that trade unions may find it optimal to accept lower wages to prevent firms from using temporary agency workers. Hence, the firms' option to use agency workers may affect wage setting also in those firms that only employ regular workers. However, if firms decide to employ agency workers, trade union wage claims will increase for the (remaining) regular workers. An intensive use of temporary agency workers in high-wage firms may therefore be the cause and not the consequence of the high wage level in those firms. Even though we assume monopoly unions that ascribe the highest possible wage-setting power to the unions, the economic rents of trade unions decline because of the firms' option to use temporary agency work, whereas firms' profits may increase.
J42|The effect of minimum wages on labour market flows: Evidence from Germany|Using a linked employer-employee data set on the German construction industry, we analyse the effects of the introduction of minimum wages in this sector on labour market dynamics at the establishment level, i.e. turnover and churning flows, as well as accessions and separations and their underlying worker flows. The fact that minimum wages in Germany are sector-specific enables us to apply a between approach using other industries as control groups in a difference-in-differences framework. Furthermore, we use a within approach with high-wage workers as control group. While the within approach shows that the minimum wage reduced worker flows in East Germany, the between approach yields positive effect on labour market dynamics in West Germany. Our results can be explained by differences between East and West Germany with respect to the bite of the minimum wage, as well as the much higher prevalence of posted workers in West Germany. Furthermore, spillover effects to highwage workers are likely to have played a role in East Germany.
J42|Atypische Beschaeftigungsverhaeltnisse – Einleitung zum Schwerpunktheft (Atypical employment - Introduction)|Zu den atypischen Beschaeftigungsverhaeltnissen zaehlen wir im Folgenden (im Sinne einer Nominaldefinition) Teilzeit, geringfuegige Beschaeftigung/Mini- und Midijobs, befristete Beschaeftigung, Leiharbeit, Werkvertraege sowie Solo-Selbststaendigkeit. Die dieses Schwerpunktheftes spiegeln sowohl die inhaltliche als auch die methodische Heterogenitaet der aktuellen Diskussion wider. Sie differenzieren und erweitern den Informationsstand ueber einzelne Formen und deren Folgen (vor allem von Minijobs und Leiharbeit) sowie ueber die sowohl kurz- als auch langfristigen Probleme, welche mehreren Formen gemeinsam sind (z. B. Qualifikationsrisiken, geringe Chancen der Aufwaertsmobilitaet).

Damit stellt sich die Frage nach den Bestimmungsgruenden fuer die Ausuebung dieser so genannten Neben-Minijobs. In diesem Beitrag wird auf der Basis eines hybriden Panelmodells mit Daten des sozio-oekonomischen Panels untersucht, inwiefern arbeitsmarkt- und geschlechtsdifferenzielle Einflussfaktoren die Ausuebung von Neben-Minijobs erklaeren koennen. Die Analysen zeigen, dass die Branche und die Arbeitszeit der Haupttaetigkeit einen starken Einfluss darauf haben, ob ein Neben-Minijob ausgeuebt wird. Auch der Haushaltskontext, modelliert durch den Familienstand, das individuelle und das Haushaltseinkommen erklaert die Ausuebung Neben-Minijobs. Insgesamt wird deutlich, dass sich das Muster der Beweggruende fuer die Aufnahme eines Neben-Minijobs zwischen Frauen und Maennern deutlich unterscheidet. Daher liefern die Analysen weiteren Aufschluss ueber die geschlechtsspezifische Strukturierung des Arbeitsmarktgeschehens in Deutschland. (With the increase in marginal employment, questions remain as to the determinants of these so-called mini-jobs. Using a hybrid panel model, labour market factors as well as gender and household-related factors were examined for men and women using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel. The analysis shows that the rise in marginal secondary jobs is firstly driven by the sector and working time of the first job. Marital status and individual and household income also appear to be crucial factors for performing a marginal secondary job. Overall, the data shows that the rationale for performing a marginal secondary job for women and men differs significantly. Our analysis therefore provides further information on gender segregation patterns in the German labour market.)
J42|Empleo, calidad del empleo y segmentación laboral en Argentina|Este artículo examina para el caso de Argentina el fenómeno de la calidad del empleo y de la segmentación laboral durante las últimas dos décadas. Para ello se definen categorías laborales al interior del empleo asalariado formal, informal y del empleo independiente en función de diversos atributos que definen la calidad del empleo. Los resultados dan cuenta que la evolución del empleo de calidad no es ajena a los cambios en la política de protección del empleo, pero que responde en mayor medida a la política macroeconómica y laboral en su conjunto. Las estimaciones de brechas salariales no confirman la hipótesis de segmentación del empleo al interior del empleo asalariado informal y del informal, pero si entre estos dos grandes grupos.
J42|Il mercato del lavoro nel Nord Est: la trasformazione in atto|The economic crisis has caused a deep discontinuity in the labour market of North-Eastern Italy. After a long period of employment growth, which has improved the integration of immigrants and families’ welfare, an intense decrease of employment opportunities has been recorded since 2008. The considerable downsizing has mainly affected the traditional manufacturing and construction industries, while new employment opportunities have been created in different fields. These include the service sector, tourism as well as industries dedicated to the development of new internationalized and innovative manufacturing, such as food and wine-growing and producing.
J42|On Input Market Frictions and Estimation of Factors' Demand|In this article, we explore the impact of imperfectly competitive input markets on production function estimation. First-order profit-maximizing conditions are altered when frictions in input markets cause the elasticity of input supply to the firm to be finite. A consequence of this is that the standard econometric model used for production function estimation will be misspecified. We prove that, in all nontrivial cases, finite elasticities of supply to the firm will lead to inconsistent estimates of production function parameters. Monte Carlo simulations show that the resulting bias can be economically significant.

J42|The effect of the state sector on wage inequality in urban China: 1988--2007| This paper examines the effect of the public sector and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) on wage inequality in urban China using China Household Income Project data. It applies quantile regression analysis, the Machado and Mata decomposition to investigate how urban wage inequality was affected by the changes in wage structure and employment shares of the public sector and SOEs. We find that since the radical state sector reforms designed to reduce overstaffing and improve efficiency in the late 1990s, urban wage gaps were narrowed due to the reduction in the employment share of the state sector; the wage premium of the state sector in comparison with the non-state sector increased significantly; and changes in the wage structure of the labour market caused the rise in urban wage inequality.
J42|Monopsony in the Low-Wage Labor Market? Evidence from Minimum Nurse Staffing Regulations| This paper provides direct evidence on the extent of monopsony power in the low-wage labor market by estimating the firm-level elasticity of labor supply for nurse aides in the long-term care (nursing home) industry. Using exogenous variation in hiring induced by the passage of a state minimum nurse staffing law, I find that facilities initially out of compliance with the new law did not have to raise their wage offers relative to their competitors in order to hire more nurses. While this is consistent with perfect competition in simple monopsony models of the labor market, I discuss how the results may be more ambiguous in more complicated models. © 2014 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
J42|Labor Share and development|We highlight a U-shaped relationship between development and the labor share of in- come. We exploit the within dimension of a panel dataset for the wage bill and value added in the manufacturing sector for developing countries. Data is available at the aggregate man- ufacturing level and also at the disaggregate level for 28 manufacturing subsectors. We show that the U-shaped pattern of the labor share that we observe at the aggregate level is also observed at the subsector level suggesting it does not correspond to reallocation forces across sectors that occur during the development process. Our theory emphasizes the role of firms’ monopsony power when labor market has frictions in a dual labor market in which modern, high productivity firms coexist with traditional, low productivity firms. At earlier stages of development, productivity gains are not compensated by wage increases, as most of workers’ outside opportunities depend on the low productivity traditional sector. At later stages, the labor share increases as a result of wage competition in the modern sector.
J42|Separation incentives and minimum wages in a job-posting search framework|We present a job posting model of a labour market where jobs differ in characteristics other than wages and workers differ in their marginal willingness to pay for such characteristics. This creates incentives for firms to separate workers by posting multiple jobs. The interaction between these separation incentives and the standard search frictions is the key contribution of the paper. The paper examines the implications for policies such as a minimum wage or ones which set minimum standards on these non-wage job characteristics. We show that policies that set standards on wages and the other job characteristics can increase the utility of the worst-off workers and may reduce inefficient forms of unemployment. Policies that only intervene in one aspect on the other hand may increase these forms of unemployment.
J42|Investigating Exploitation and Productivity in Explaining the Disability Wage Penalty|"The paper explains the low wages of the disabled in a monopsonistic framework. In the disabled m arket firms face different costs of adjustment (""disabled-friendly"" firm vs. ""disabled-unfriendly"" firm), high or low, and offer wages according to these costs. Hence, there will be high- and low-paid disabled. Also, employers can exploit the disabled to increase profits knowing that they face high search costs. This mechanism describes the pre-reform period. In the post-reform period, the adjustment costs are fully covered by programmes designed to help the disabled find and stay in work (e.g. Access to Work, 1996). In addition, legislation (Disability Discrimination Act, 1995) prohibits discrimination hence firms are not allowed to treat the disabled and nondisabled differently. These mechanisms are modelled using an extension of the simple Burdett-Mortensen model (1998). Using data from the BHPS, we find that in the post-reform period wages increase for the disabled and non-disabled but more for the disabled. Also, disabled at the bottom of the wage offer distribution (i.e. mainly disabled in low productivity firms) in the pre-reform period, move more to the right of the distribution in the post-reform period."

J42|Anmerkungen zum Monopson am Arbeitsmarkt II|Der vorliegende Beitrag untersucht für den Fall eines sowie für den Fall zweier variabler Produktionsfaktoren, wie sich Mindestlöhne im nicht diskriminierenden Monopson auf Beschäftigung bzw. Kapitalintensität auswirken. Dabei kann der Mindestlohn in Höhe des hypothetischen Konkurrenzlohns oder in Höhe der Grenzkosten der Arbeit oder schließlich noch darüber liegen. Von besonderem Interesse ist die Situation mit zwei variablen Produktionsfaktoren: Es stellt sich eine nicht-lineare Budgetrestriktion ein und es können - neben der 'reinen Monopsonlösung' - drei weitere mögliche Betriebsoptima bestimmt werden. Alle vier Lösungen werden unter Verwendung einer Cobb-Douglas-Produktionsfunktion numerisch exakt bestimmt. Anschließend wird die theoretische Analyse noch verfeinert, indem eine CES-Produktionsfunktion unterstellt wird. Auch hier existiert eine exakte Lösung für das Monopson. In der Regel lassen sich aber die Lösungsbedingungen nur implizit und über geeignete Näherungsverfahren bestimmen. Es wird gezeigt, wie hoch ein Mindestlohn ausfallen muss, damit die vom Monopsonisten gewählte Kapitalintensität höher ausfällt als diejenige, die er im unreglementierten Monopson wählt. Schließlich wird in einer Sensitivitätsanalyse gezeigt, wie stark sich die Variation des Parameters μ aus der CES-Funktion auf die Optimallösung beim Monopson auswirkt. Für die wirtschaftspolitische Diskussion um das Für und Wider von Mindestlöhnen zeigt sich, dass Mindestlöhne tendenziell existierende Monopsone auf dem Arbeitsmarkt stabilisieren, dass für die Abschätzung der Beschäftigungseffekte von Mindestlöhnen keine Aussagen ohne Kenntnis der Substitutionselastizitäten möglich sind, und dass es von der Höhe des gewählten Mindestlohns letztlich abhängt, ob ein Monopsonist am Arbeitsmarkt seine bisherige Kapitalintensität beibehält, senkt oder sogar erhöht. Darüber hinaus wäre zu prüfen, ob die ins Feld geführten Beschäftigungsvorteile des Mindestlohns bei Vorliegen eines Monopsons sich nicht besser mit marktgerechten Instrumenten (Besteuerung des Monopsonisten und/oder Subventionierung des Arbeitsangebots) erreichen lassen.
J42|Monopsony competition and the minimum wage: Evidence from Germany|This paper investigates the degree of monoposony power of German employers in different industries, using a semi-structural approach based on a dynamic model of monopsonistic competition. The empirical analysis is based on a linked employer-employee data set which allows us to control for heterogeneity both on the worker and on the firm side, and to perform separate analyses for East and West Germany. Our results show important differences in monopsonistic power between industries, and between East and West Germany, which gives an indication of the role of monopsonistic power for inter-industry wage differentials. From a policy point of view, this has important implications for the expected effects of the introduction of a statutory minimum in Germany on 1st Januar 2015.
J42|The cyclical behaviour of employers' monopsony power and workers' wages|This paper investigates the behaviour of employers' monopsony power and workers' wages over the business cycle. Using German administrative linked employer employee data for the years 1985-2010 and an estimation framework based on duration models, we construct a time series of the firm-level labour supply elasticity and estimate its relationship to the aggregate unemployment rate. In line with theory, we find that firms possess more monopsony power during economic downturns, which shows to be robust to controlling for time-invariant unobserved worker heterogeneity. We also document that cyclical changes in workers' entry wages are of similar magnitude as those predicted under monopsonistic wage setting, suggesting that monopsony power should not be neglected when analysing wage cyclicality.
J42|Is the labor market in Bulgaria segmented?|The present study of the segmentation of the labor market in the country aims to enrich the existing body of knowledge relating to this issue. A methodological framework was elaborated to study the labor market segmentation by income and employment profiles, based on data from monitoring specific labor and specific income pursuant to individual observations of the National Statistics Institute. There is a link between a specific type of labor and a specific income in compliance with specific criteria to define available or non-available segmentation on the labor market. For the implementation of the specific assignments a survey methodology is proposed in conformity with the European Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey. Bulgaria is involved therein since 2006.
J42|Optimal Taxation and Monopsonistic Labor Market: Does Monopsony Justify the Minimum Wage?| Does monopsony on the labor market in itself justify the implementation of a minimum wage when it would not be used in a competitive economy? This issue is studied in a model of optimal taxation. We find that there is no room for the minimum wage when there are a continuum of skills with no isolated mass point at the bottom of the wage distribution. Accordingly, in the empirically relevant situation, where there is a continuum of wages at the bottom of the distribution, the minimum wage is not helpful.
J42|Total Rewards Model In Romanian Companies|Total Rewards Management is a subject of major importance for companies, because, by using models for this, firms can achieve their objectives of high performance. In order to analyse a validated total rewards model in Romanian Accounting and Consulting Companies, it is used The WorldatWork Total Rewards Model, which depict what contributes to applicant attraction and employee motivation and retention. Thus, the methodology of the previous survey is adjusted to the local context. The conclusions for the methodological aspects illustrate that the present research involves three strategic steps in order to achieve the objectives presented: the analysis of organizational environment of the companies from the sample, checking if Total Rewards Model proposed in the previous research is applicable for the same romanian companies from the previous survey, the analysing of the differences between results, and, if necessary, the adaptation of the model for Romania.
J42|Labor Informality: Choice or Sign of Segmentation? A Quantile Regression Approach at the Regional Level for Colombia|The labor market in developing countries is remarkably heterogeneous with a small productive formal sector, enjoying high wages and attractive employment conditions and another large informal sector with low productivity and volatile wages. The informal sector is particularly diverse. In this paper we examine the heterogeneity of the informal sector at regional level in Colombia. In general, our ndings suggest that, both voluntary and involuntary informal employment co-exist by choice and as a result of labor market segmentation. We also nd that there are striking di erences in labor market characteristics between cities, in particular in the traditional informal segment.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J42|Diferencias en los ingresos laborales en Colombia, 2001?2006: un análisis de descomposición de Oaxaca para los sectores formal e informal|Resumen El objetivo de esta investigación es analizar el “efecto puesto de trabajo” en las desigualdades de los ingresos laborales de los trabajadores, a partir de la descomposición de las diferencias de los ingresos laborales de los sectores formales e informales con la metodología Oaxaca-Blinder, en la economía colombiana del 2001 al 2006. Se utiliza alternativamente la estimación corregida de sesgo de selectividad a través del modelo multinomial de Bourguignon, Fournier y Gurgand (2004). El análisis del componente no explicado –de la descomposición– arrojó evidencia a favor de la existencia de diferencias de ingresos en el mercado laboral colombiano.
J42|Segregación Laboral Por Género En España: Efectos Sobre Los Salarios Y La Movilidad Salarial|Este trabajo presenta evidencia empírica sobre la segregación laboral de los asalariados por sexo en España, medida mediante su concentración en distintas ocupaciones y sectores de actividad. El principal objetivo es comprobar si la segregación de las mujeres hacia ciertos empleos provoca presión a la baja sobre los salarios de todos los trabajadores con empleos similares (hipótesis de concentración), tanto hombres como mujeres. A partir de datos del Panel de Hogares de la Unión Europea (INE, 1994-2000) se realiza en primer lugar un análisis descriptivo del grado de segregación y su efecto sobre los salarios promedio en cada categoría. La estimación de modelos de ganancias, tanto por MCO como por efectos fijos para datos de panel, permite verificar que una mayor proporción de mujeres en cada ocupación y sector de actividad se asocia con salarios más reducidos, tanto para hombres como para mujeres. Se comprueba, además, mediante las correspondientes descomposiciones de Oaxaca, que éste es un factor importante para explicar las diferencias salariales de género. Finalmente, se analiza la evolución interanual de los salarios de hombres y mujeres, a fin de evaluar la evolución de las diferencias según nivel ocupacional y comprobar así si éstas se mantendrán en el tiempo o por el contrario se prevé una mejora o empeoramiento de la situación actual.
J42|Returns to dialect|Though Mandarin is China's common language, each region/city has its own dialect. Using a unique self-collected dataset, this paper estimates returns to dialect familiarity in China's largest and most developed city, Shanghai. We evaluate migrant workers' comprehension and fluency of the Shanghai dialect, and instrument their dialect fluency by determining whether the workers' hometowns were located in the Wu dialect region and the distance between those hometowns and Shanghai. We determined that in OLS regressions, the returns to dialect are a consequence of endogeneity bias. After using IV (instrumental variable), dialect fluency was shown to significantly impact one's income in the service industry, in particular affecting sales jobs. In manufacturing and construction jobs, migrants with higher dialect fluency tended to be self-employed in order to earn more income. By distinguishing between listening and speaking abilities, we found that auditory comprehension does not significantly increase one's earning, while oral fluency does. Since local residents in Shanghai can understand Mandarin, migrants who can understand Shanghainese won't have difficulty in the information exchange. Therefore, our results confirm that dialect is a channel through which people expose their identity. Speaking the local dialect is a way for migrant workers to integrate into the local society and also to reduce transaction costs in the labor market.
J42|An empirical approach on labour segmentation. Applications with individual duration data|This article proposes empirical tools to account for the role of heterogeneities in the labour matching process, and shows an application to the Andalusian labour market which relies on individual data. The central idea of the paper is that the labour market is segmented, and this segmentation can be treated empirically by grouping workers, jobs and matches into labour groups according to their characteristics. In a segmented labour market the probability that a match occurs in a particular job group affects the probability that a match occurs in a particular worker group or vice versa. We propose two empirical measures related to this idea: propensity to match, and segmentation in worker and job groups. The usefulness of this empirical framework is shown by its application to different labour market analyses. Firstly, we use a clustering methodology, based on a similarity measure, to obtain a better overview of the structure of the labour market. Secondly, we propose a measure of mobility based on our similarity measure, and estimate a regression model that relates mobility to worker and job characteristics and to the economic cycle. Finally, these tools are included in an unemployment duration model. The proposed methodology may be useful in labour intermediation by helping seekers to follow a ‘roadmap’ of successful paths.
J42|Latifundia revisited: Market power, land inequality and agricultural efficiency. Evidence from interwar Italian agriculture|This paper proposes a new interpretation of the historically controversial role of Italian latifundia. Relying on standard economic theory, the paper explores a simple though neglected mechanism linking land inequality and inefficiency: market power. In underdeveloped economies with serious constraints on labor mobility, high ownership concentration will endow landowners with market power in local labor markets. The resulting equilibrium explains many of the often criticized features of latifundia, without the need to factor in irrational behavior (the preferred explanation of Italian traditional historians) or social institutions and capital market imperfections (explanations advanced by economists in different contexts). According to the model here explored the main effects of inequality are of a distributive rather than of a productive nature. The market power hypothesis is strongly supported by the available quantitative evidence provided by an unexploited dataset on all local labor markets of Italy at the end of the 1930s.
J42|Understanding Urban Wage Inequality in China 1988–2008: Evidence from Quantile Analysis|This paper examines change in wage gaps in urban China from 1988 to 2008 by estimating quantile regressions on CHIPS data. It applies the Machado and Mata (2005) decomposition, finding sharp increases in inequality largely due to changes in the wage structure. During 2002–08, changes in the returns to education and experience have been equalizing. However, changes in other categories of wage differential—by sex, occupation, ownership, industrial sector, and province—widened inequality. The gender gap continued to rise, as did the gap between white collar and blue collar workers, and between manufacturing and other sectors.
J42|Labour markets for irrigated agriculture in central Ethiopia: Wage premiums and segmentation|Labour market segmentation in developing countries has been considered in a growing literature, some of which suggests an informal sector wage premium. However, such studies have mainly focused on urban labour markets and have not discriminated between the informally self-employed and wage workers. This paper examines segmentation in rural markets for agricultural wage workers in Ethiopia, controlling for location, farming systems and observed worker characteristics. Applying an endogenous switching model with simultaneous estimation of wage equations it establishes an informal sector wage premium, self-selection into the informal sector and sectorally-distinct wage determination mechanisms.
J42|Employment Effects of the EU Temporary and Agency Workers Directive in Sweden|This paper analyses possible effects on total employment, and the distribution between agency work and regular contracts as a consequence of the Swedish implementation of the EU Temporary and Agency Workers Directive in a dual labour market Mortensen-Pissarides search model. The directive states that the basic working and employment conditions for agency workers should be equal to those for a comparable employee at the client firm, and that all parties should actively facilitate the transition from agency employment to employment directly at the client firm. Even though the results suggest a negative net effect on total employment, the implementation is shown to have a positive impact on overall welfare, and that an increased transition probability from the agency sector into regular employment would contribute even more.
J42|Young Adults in the Swedish Temporary Agency Sector: Implications of Family Experience|A person’s first experience of working life is not the individual’s actual first job, but rather the perception conveyed by their family and other reference groups. Using Swedish register data on young adults (aged 18-34), and controlling for personal characteristics, we find that individuals with family members or partners with work experience from the temporary agency sector are highly over-represented in the sector. The peer groups’ previous experience is also found to be among the most influential variables determining the relative probability that an individual will work in the temporary agency sector.
J42|Essays on Temporary Work Agencies and the Economic Analysis of Law|Paper [I] adds to the theoretical literature on the incentives of Temporary Work Agencies (TWAs). Using a principal-agent model with hidden action to model two main types of contracts between a TWA and a Client Firm (CF), the TWA is shown to potentially act against the best interest of the CF when helping to fill a vacant position. The results also suggest that the adverse effect of the incentive misalignment is larger when the worker is going to be leased instead of hired by the CF. However, this effect could potentially be offset by introducing a sufficient level of competition among the TWAs. Paper [II] uses individual-level data on young adults to estimate how the probability of being employed in the Swedish temporary agency sector is affected by whether a partner or other family member has experience of temporary agency work. The results show a significant effect from all peer groups of a magnitude that correspond to the other most influential control variables. We also find that this cohort of the agency sector has a relatively high education level compared to the regular sector, and that there are predominately men working in this sector. Paper [III] analyses possible effects on total employment, and the distribution between agency work and regular contracts as a consequence of the implementation of the EU Temporary and Agency Workers Directive in Sweden. The analysis is based on changes in the compensation to agency workers in a calibrated extension of a Mortensen-Pissarides search model. Even though the results suggest a negative net effect on total employment, the implementation is shown to increase (utilitarian) welfare, and an increased transition probability from the agency sector into regular employment will increase welfare even further. Paper [IV] focuses on settlement probabilities for different types of representation within the Swedish Labour Court. Empirical estimates on a set of unjust dismissal cases show that private representatives are generally less likely to reach a settlement than their union counterparts. The settlement probabilities converge following court-mandated information disclosure, which suggests that information asymmetry is an important factor in explaining differences in settlement behaviour. Privately instigated negotiations are therefore in general insufficient for making cases with non-union representation reach the same settlement rate as cases with union representation.
J42|From the Substance to the Shadow: The Court Embedded into Japanese Labor Markets|Modern contract law generally does not allow property rights or similar claims to be made against employees. This undermines a claim on the return on the employer fs investments in recruiting and training a worker, making them vulnerable to possible infringement from a bystander. Accordingly, employers investment in recruiting and training might become deficient. Therefore, protecting an employer fs investment, balanced against the mobility of the labor market for better employer-employee matches, has emerged as an issue in the transitory phase towards a market-based economy. We explore how the Japanese state court in its early period addressed this issue in the tight labor market of the silk-reeling industry, the leading industry then. The court first directly protected interests of employers whose employees were poached, at the expense of workers mobility. Then, it seemed to indirectly govern transactions between employers as a shadow off-the-equilibrium path. Thus, an employer whose employee was poached and an employer who dud the poaching would privately negotiate to settle the dispute, using a possible suit as a threat against the poacher. Examining suits that were actually filed leads to this hypothesis. This indirect governance facilitated labor market mobility with some protection of the original employer fs claim.
J42|Not So Standard Anymore? Employment Duality in Germany|This paper gives an overview of the transformation of the German labour market since the mid-1990s with a special focus on the changing patterns of labour market segmentation or 'dualization' of employment in Germany. While labour market duality in Germany can partially be attributed to labour market reforms promoting, in particular, non-standard forms of employment and allowing for an expansion of low pay, structural changes in the economy as well as strategic choices by employers and social partners also play a prominent role. Our main argument is that the liberalization of non-standard contracts has contributed to the expansion of overall labour market inclusion and job growth in Germany and that at least some forms of non-standard work provide stepping stones into permanent regular jobs. Atypical contracts do not necessarily undermine the dominance of standard employment relationships and job quality in this primary segment but rather form a supplementary part of employment in sectors that depend on more flexible and maybe cheaper forms of labour.
J42|Why Minimum Wage Increases Are a Poor Way to Help the Working Poor|Minimum wage increases are not a very effective mechanism for reducing poverty. They are not related to decreases in poverty rates. They can cost some low-income workers their jobs. And most minimum wage earners who gain from a higher minimum wage do not live in poor (or near-poor) families. A better tool for reducing poverty, and at lower cost, is the earned income tax credit. It is a much more targeted way to provide income to workers in poor families. It raises the wages of only workers in low-income families and rises with the number of dependent children in a family.
J42|Sexual orientation and labor market outcomes|Studies from countries with laws against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation suggest that gay and lesbian employees report more incidents of harassment and are more likely to report experiencing unfair treatment in the labor market than are heterosexual employees. Both gay men and lesbians tend to be less satisfied with their jobs than their heterosexual counterparts. Gay men are found to earn less than comparably skilled and experienced heterosexual men. For lesbians, the patterns are ambiguous: in some countries they have been found to earn less than their heterosexual counterparts, while in others they earn the same or more.

J42|Determinants of Using Fixed-term Contracts in the Egyptian Labor Market: Empirical Evidence from Manufacturing Firms Using World Bank Firm-Level Data for Egypt|Based on dual labor market theory, fixed-term contracts (FTCs) as an important feature of labor market flexibility were analyzed to test the following hypothesis: Firms in the manufacturing sector in Egypt use FTCs to adjust the level of employment to the profit maximizing level in case of demand changes. The hypothesis was not supported by the results of econometric analyses with a firm-level data set from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys. Probit and Tobit models were used to estimate the probability and intensity of different kinds of numerical labor market flexibility (FTCs utilization, hiring and firing) in Egypt. Empirical results revealed that demand changes had no effects on using FTCs in the manufacturing firms in Egypt. In addition, the results indicated that there was no effect on using hiring and firing instruments.
J42|Formal and Informal Sector Wage Differences in Transition Economies: Evidence from Tajikistan|Analyzing the self-selection of workers into formal and informal sector employment in Tajikistan, a poor transition economy, with higher informal sector than formal sector wages and an informal sector employment share exceeding 50 percent, we find that the selection of formal and informal sector workers is based on comparative advantages rather that labor market segmentation. Furthermore, labor supply to the two sectors reacts rather elastically to relative wages. Policies increasing relative wages in the formal sector could thus be effective in reducing the high informal sector employment share in this country.
