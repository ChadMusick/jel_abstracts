R15|Tariffs, Domestic Import Substitution and Trade Diversion in Input-Output Production Networks: how to deal with Brexit|This paper challenges and complements existing studies on the economic impact of Brexit providing a discussion of the UK's decision to leave the EU and how it will affect international trade networks and value-added. Using the World Input-Output Database, we develop a multi-sector inter-country model that allows us to identify the channels through which the economic effects of Brexit would propagate. The inclusion of global value chains and indirect Brexit effects in the model leads to estimates that diverge with the results of the main literature. Indeed our findings, suggest that Brexit could be risky and costly not only for the UK but also for many EU countries. Furthermore, building on the Dietzenbacher and Lahr (2013) method of hypothetical expansion, we develop a second model and present the first empirical analysis on the consequences of domestic import substitution and trade diversion policies in Input-Output schemes. We found that allowing sectors and countries to partly substitute foreign products, leads to significantly lower losses for both macro-regions. In the second model, the UK and EU27 would lose, at worst, the 0.05 and 0.5 percent of value-added, respectively.
R15|“Technological cooperation and R&D outsourcing at the rm level: The role of the regional context”|Much has been said about the role that technological networking activities play on the innovative performance of rms, but little is known about the relevance of the context where the rm is locate shaping the eciency of such networking activities. In this article we hypothesize that the transformation of rms' networking activities into innovation may vary depending on the regional environment in which the rm is located. For Spanish manufactures in the period 2000-12 and through the use of a multilevel framework, we obtain that after controlling for the rm's characteristics, the regional context has not only a direct eect on rms' innovation performance, but it also conditions the returns to rms' networking activities, although dierently in the case of cooperation and outsourcing. Cooperating in innovation activities is more benecial for those rms located in a knowledge intensive region, whereas R&D outsourcing seems to be more protable for rms in regions with a low knowledge pool.
R15|Estimation and inference in spatial models with dominant units|Estimation and inference in the spatial econometrics literature are carried out assuming that the matrix of spatial or network connections has uniformly bounded absolute column sums in the number of cross-section units, n. In this paper, we consider spatial models where this restriction is relaxed. The linear-quadratic central limit theorem of Kelejian and Prucha (2001) is generalized and then used to establish the asymptotic properties of the GMM estimator due to Lee (2007) in the presence of dominant units. A new Bias-Corrected Method of Moments estimator is also proposed that avoids the problem of weak instruments by self-instrumenting the spatially lagged dependent variable. Both estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal, depending on the rate at which the maximum column sum of the weights matrix rises with n. The small sample properties of the estimators are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments and shown to be satisfactory. An empirical application to sectoral price changes in the US over the pre- and post-2008 financial crisis is also provided. It is shown that the share of capital can be estimated reasonably well from the degree of sectoral interdependence using the input-output tables, despite the evidence of dominant sectors being present in the US economy.
R15|Agglomeration Economies and the Firm TFP: Different Effects across Industries|This paper analyzes the effect of agglomeration economies on firms’ total factor productivity. We propose the use of a control function approach to overcome the econometric issue inherent to the two-stage approach commonly used in the literature. Estimations are conducted separately for four industry groups, defined by technological intensity, to allow for non-uniform effects of agglomeration economies on firms given their technological level. In addition, R&D is included to account for the firms’ own efforts to foster productivity through creating and absorbing knowledge. Finally, radii as well as administrative boundaries are used for defining regions. The results confirm differences in the strength and even in the direction of agglomeration economies: While urban economies have the largest effect on TFP for firms in high-tech industries, they have no effect on TFP in low-tech industries. For firms in the latter industries, however, the variety of the local economic structure has an impact, while this is irrelevant for the TFP of firms in high-tech industries. Only localization economies have a positive and significant effect on TFP throughout, but the effect increases with technological intensity of industries. Throughout, R&D is also found to have a positive effect that increases with technological intensity.
R15|Estimation of Industry-level Productivity with Cross-sectional Dependence by Using Spatial Analysis|We examine aggregate productivity in the presence of inter-sectoral linkages. Cross-sectional dependence is inevitable among industries, in which each sector serves as a supplier to the other sectors. However, the chains of such interconnections cause indirect relationship among industries. Spatial analysis is one of the approaches to address cross-sectional dependence by using a priori a specified spatial weights matrix. We exploit the linkage patterns from the input-output tables and use them to assign spatial weights to describe the economic interdependencies. By using the spatial weights matrix, we can estimate the industry-level production functions and productivity of the U.S. from 1947 to 2010. Cross-sectional dependencies are the consequences of indirect effects, and they reflect the interactions among industries linked via their supply chain networks result in larger output elasticities as well as scale effects for the networked production processes. However, productivity growth estimates are reportedly comparable across various spatial and non-spatial model specications.
R15|The Evolution of Tradable and Non Tradable Employment: Evidence from France|The objective of this paper is to investigate the evolution of employment in the tradable and non-tradable sectors in France over 1999-2015. We find that tradable employment makes up the minority of French employment and has decreased over this period, dropping from 27.5% to 23.6% of total employment. There has been significant restructuring within the sector: tradable services jobs now make up the majority of tradable jobs and have grown sharply, while employment has declined in the rest of the tradable sector (manufacturing, agricultural and mining industries). We also identify a large wage and labor productivity gap between tradable and non-tradable sectors. Finally, we examine the distribution of tradable jobs across French local labor markets, and how their development affects non-tradable employment locally. Using the empirical approach developed by Moretti (2010), we find that for every 100 tradable jobs created in a French employment area between 2008 and 2016, 80 additional non-tradable jobs were created within the same area.

R15|The regional significance of university locations in Lower Saxony|Universities are important economic actors in having a considerable impact on the demand and supply side of their local economy. The aim of this paper is to quantify, compare and classify the different economic demand- and supply-side contributions of the university locations within Lower-Saxony using a combination of multiplier analysis and spatial econometrics on a NUTS-3 level. In comparison to numerous other studies this paper does not focus on the economic impact of single cases or a selected university location but gives a complete picture of the importance and significance of all university locations within Lower-Saxony. The income induced direct and indirect demand effects are estimated with a rich data set from higher education statistics in combination with an income and employment multiplier derived from a regional input-output table while the supply-side effects, i.e. the impact of the education and research outcomes, are calculated by estimating with spatial panel regressions a model derived from human capital theory and knowledge spillover theory. The estimation results give a complete and reproducible impression of the importance and significance of the different university locations offering the opportunity for comparisons and classifications.
R15|European NUTS 2 regions: construction of interregional trade-linked Supply and Use tables with consistent transport flows|Economic development is interregional in nature, with economic growth being determined by physical and technological proximity identified by interregional and national cross-border interactions in trade, investments, and knowledge. This report explains the construction of a system of multiregional input-output tables for the EU28 interlinked with trade in goods and services within the same country as well as with regions in other Member States. Taking transhipment locations into account, trade in goods and services is derived from freight transport data, airline data on flights, and business travel data. The methodology is centred on the probability of trade flows and was developed to fit the information available without pre-imposing any geographical structure on the data.
R15|“Technological cooperation and R&D outsourcing at the firm level: The role of the regional context ”|Much has been said about the role that technological networking activities play on the innovative performance of firms, but little is known about the relevance of the context where the firm is locate shaping the efficiency of such networking activities. In this article we hypothesize that the transformation of firms' networking activities into innovation may vary depending on the regional environment in which the firm is located. For Spanish manufactures in the period 2000-12 and through the use of a multilevel framework, we obtain that after controlling for the firm's characteristics, the regional context has not only a direct effect on firms' innovation performance, but it also conditions the returns to firms' networking activities, although differently in the case of cooperation and outsourcing. Cooperating in innovation activities is more beneficial for those firms located in a knowledge intensive region, whereas R&D outsourcing seems to be more profitable for firms in regions with a low knowledge pool.
R15|Searching for the optimal territorial structure: The case of Spanish provincial councils|Modern states are organized in multi-level governance structures with economic and political authorities dispersed across them. However, although there is relatively widespread consensus that this form of organization is preferable to a centralized authority, the same cannot be said about its jurisdictional design, that is, how to transfer authority from central states to both supranational and subnational levels. This lack of consensus also exists in contexts with explicit initiatives to strengthen political ties such as the European Union (EU), and even within EU member countries, a situation that is aggravated by the relative scarcity of contributions that measure the advantages and disadvantages of different territorial organizations. We explore these issues through a study of one EU country, Spain, whose provincial councils (diputaciones) are often the subject of debate and controversy due to their contribution to increasing public spending and their purported inefficiencies, corruption, and lack of transparency. Specifically, we combine a variety of activity analysis techniques to evaluate how they impact on local government performance. Results suggest that, in general, the presence of a provincial council has a positive impact on local government performance, but when their activity levels are too high the effect can become pernicious.
R15|Development of U.S.-East Asia financial input-output table|Flow of Funds Accounts (FFAs) are the official statistics describing how funds are transferred and where assets/liabilities exist, both inside and outside a country. At the international level, global FFAs depict the cross-border transfer of funds and the consequent claim/obligation relations among countries. The main purpose of this paper is to comprehend and organize the FFAs of various countries of the world from a financial point of view. We construct a global financial input–output table that shows both international and domestic transactions by each domestic institutional sector for the U.S., Japan, Korea, and China.
R15|The economic importance of the Belgian ports : Flemish maritime ports, Liège port complex and the port of Brussels – Report 2017|This Working Paper analyses the economic importance of the Belgian ports largely based on annual accounts data for the year 2017. As the years prior to 2017 have been described in earlier papers in the same series, the emphasis lies on the ﬁgures for 2017 and the developments between 2016 and 2017 . After the stagnation in 2016, direct value added at the Belgian ports rose by 7.3% from € 18 052 million to € 19 368 million (current prices) or roughly 4.4% of Belgium’s GDP. All ports, with the exception of the Liège port complex, contributed to value added growth at the Belgian ports. The ports of Antwerp and Ghent were the most important players. The biggest contributing sectors to value added growth were the chemical industry and, to a lesser extent, cargo handling and the metalworking industry. In 2017, indirect value added was around 82% of direct value added. Direct value added increased significantly at the ports of Ghent, Brussels and Antwerp, by 13.4%, 16.0% and 6.1% respectively. The increase by more than 3% of direct value added at the ports of Zeebrugge and Ostend was also substantial. Direct value added fell by 2.4% at the Liège port complex. After the decline between 2012 and 2015, direct employment at the Belgian ports was up for the second year in a row. Between 2016 and 2017, the number of direct full-time equivalent jobs rose by 0.8%, from 115 401 to 116 311 or approximately 2.8% of Belgium’s total domestic employment. All ports, with the exception of Ostend and Brussels, contributed to employment growth at the Belgian ports. The ports of Antwerp and Ghent were the most important players. The biggest contributing sectors to employment growth were cargo handling and, to a lesser extent, the chemical industry. In 2017, indirect employment was around 120% of direct employment. Direct employment increased by around 1% at the ports of Antwerp, Ghent and Zeebrugge. Growth at the Liège port complex was more modest at 0.4%. The number of direct full-time equivalent jobs fell at the ports of Ostend and Brussels, by 1.2% and 4.2% respectively. The pattern of investment is closely linked to projects and is therefore highly volatile. After the decline between 2012 and 2014, direct investment at the Belgian ports was up for the third year in a row. Between 2016 and 2017, investment was up by 2.4%, from € 4 711 million to € 4 825 million. The port of Ghent and, to a lesser extent, the Liège port complex contributed to investment growth at the Belgian ports. The biggest contributing sectors to investment growth were the ‘port construction and dredging’ sector and, to a lesser extent, cargo handling, and the energy and chemical industries. Based on the figures of the traffic, the Flemish ports can be considered as real bridgeheads for trade with the UK. Developments regarding the modalities and consequences of the Brexit therefor should be followed with the greatest attention. Given the existing import and export volumes in terms of tonnage, it seems it will mostly be a challenge in Zeebrugge and to some extent for Antwerp. As a supplier to both China and the United States, Belgium is indirectly involved in trade between the two countries. If protectionism would close the United States off to exports from abroad, Belgian economy might get impacted one of the most in Europe.
R15|Exploring changes in world production and trade: Insights from the 2018 update of OECD’s ICIO/TIVA database|Drawing on the 2018 update of OECD’s Inter-Country Input-Output (ICIO) database, this paper explores the evolution of trade in value added (TiVA) between 2005 and 2015. Changes in international production systems are examined with particular attention given to four key sectors heavily integrated into global value chains (GVCs): Textiles and Apparel; Chemicals; ICT and Electronics; and, Motor Vehicles. Some insights into the roles played by services sectors and non-residents’ expenditure and, the employment and environmental impacts of GVCs, are also provided.Considerable heterogeneity across countries and regions is revealed, particularly for East and Southeast Asian where China plays a key role. Services are increasingly important for manufactured exporting activities as well as for countries wishing to “upgrade” their activities to higher value added stages of production. Taking a consumption perspective suggests that national efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could be affected by international outsourcing of production.
R15|Local content requirements and their economic effect on shipbuilding: A quantitative assessment|This study quantifies the significant economic gains that are expected to be revealed through the abolition or relaxation of local content based policies. The work analyses two specific local content policies affecting directly or indirectly the shipbuilding industry in two countries: Brazil’s local content requirement as part of national concession contracts in the oil and gas sector, and the long-standing US Jones Act obliging intra-US seaborne trade to be conducted on US built and US flagged vessels. The paper’s static simulation exploits OECD’s latest Trade-in-Value-Added (TiVA) data – a rich database on Inter-Country Input-Output relationships. The database has been disaggregated to the level of the shipbuilding industry, enabling an assessment of the effect of the two selected policies on inter-industry trade. The simulation results suggest large economic benefits for both countries in the long-term despite initial losses in the target industry.
R15|Pakistan Input-Output Table 2010-11|This paper develops Pakistan’s first Input-Output table (IOT) that follows the 2008 System of National Accounts. An IOT examines the structural changes in an economy. The present paper provides Pakistan’s IOT 2010-11 in an industry-by-industry format (42*42). The analysis of backward and forward linkages reveals that manufacturing of food products, beverages, textiles, electricity, gas, steam, air-conditioning and accommodation sectors have strong backward linkages while mining and quarrying, wood products, chemicals and chemical products, electricity, gas, steam, air-conditioning, warehousing and support activities for transportation sectors have strong forward linkages. For national economic growth to be sustainable, the government should facilitate economic activities in these sectors.

R15|A Panel Analysis of Polish Regional Cities Residential Price Convergence in the Primary Market|We employ two methodologies in order to identify groupings of cities and to analyse the factors which drive convergence in residential prices across Polish prime markets over the period 2007-2018. The Phillips and Sul (2007) methodology is used to identify convergence in primary residential prices in the major Polish cities. The results indicate that residential prices do not converge to a single common trend. However, we find the existence of three distinct sub-groups of cities (‘clubs’) where residential prices converge to their own steady-state paths. Using an ordered logit model, we investigate supply and demand factors determining club membership, which subsequently allocates 13 out of the 15 cities as belonging to the clubs identified by the Phillips and Sul procedure.
R15|Robust Tests for Convergence Clubs|In many applications common in testing for convergence the number of cross-sectional units is large and the number of time periods are few. In these situations asymptotic tests based on an omnibus null hypothesis are characterised by a number of problems. In this paper we propose a multiple pairwise comparisons method based on an a recursive bootstrap to test for convergence with no prior information on the composition of convergence clubs. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that our bootstrap-based test performs well to correctly identify convergence clubs when compared with other similar tests that rely on asymptotic arguments. Across a potentially large number of regions, using both cross-country and regional data for the European Union we find that the size distortion which afflicts standard tests and results in a bias towards finnding less convergence, is ameliorated when we utilise our bootstrap test.
R15|El Trienio Bolchevique de Díaz del Moral: conflictividad y reformismo agrario|Social conflictivity and the chance to sustain collective actions confronting antagonic interests grew at the end of the First World War. After briefly presenting the international context of “fin d’ époque” to place the frame of conflictivity, a reading of the most famous work of Juan Diaz del Moral is put forward. This reading differs slightly from the one used more commonly to interpret the social conflictivity between 1918 and 1920. In the first place, this conflictivity is contextualized within the frame of inequality created by the First World War. Even though the number of casualties is not the only argument for the violence of a collective action, an estimate recount is offered. Diaz del Moral often boasted himself of having been a direct witness of these events in order to disqualify other versions of them. The present work questions the impartiality of the person who believes himself to be close to the facts. Finally, the main ideas of his agrarist vision are presented. They are an exception in the Spanish agrarist thought, especially due to the panglossian vision of social conflicts. The following are debatable thesis: the general agricultural progress in the countryside, the spreading of small properties and the raising in the standard of living of salary earners.
R15|Climate change, chemical fertilisers, and sustainable development â€“ panel evidence from Tanzanian Maize farmers|We study the impact of rainfall risk on fertiliser use by Tanzanian maize farmers using newly available spatially disaggregated agronomic survey data on Tanzanian maize producers. We show that fertiliser use is highly sensitive to rainfall risks. Our discussion embeds these findings into the wider debate around environmental sustainability and mineral fertilisers, thus relating directly to the countryâ€™s government efforts of climate mainstreaming into their (agricultural) policies. We conclude that chemical fertilisers are useful for agricultural productivity growth but that they should be used to supplement more economically and environmentally sustainable practices.
R15|Regression tree analysis of soil fertility and agro-economic practices and the effects on yield in Tanzania|Food security and yield production have been extensively studied in regard to fertiliser response in the context of Sub-Saharan Africa. Soil fertility gradients within farms interact with other complex factors such as plot management, alongside bio-physical as well as socio-economic constraints, to create extensive heterogeneity in yield production. Hence, blanket recommendations regarding increasing inputs may not just lead to limited or no change in productivity but may affect long term sustainability. To try and explore the relationships between these factors, Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis was used to simplify the effect of plot management decisions. Data was from the focal plots of the 2016 and 2017 Tanzanian Agronomy Panel Survey (TAPS 2017; n = 580) with a range of yields and socio-economic contexts (2.10tha-1 â€“ 3.68tha-1). Results suggested that in low resource fields, management factors are subservient to extreme soil degradation while in high resource fields good management such as optimal planting are needed for maximum predicted yield (4.48tha-1; n = 51). Boundary line analysis was conducted, and maximum yield-nutrient response values calculated. The yield gap obtained suggested only up to 60% of locally obtainable yield is reached, highlighting the necessary balance between intensity of resource use and good management for sustainable and sufficient crop production, especially in the case of extreme soil degradation.
R15|Regional resilience in China: The response of the provinces to the growth slowdown|Since 2007 China’s real GDP growth rate has slowed from a level of over 10% per annum to below 7%. Given China’s regional diversity, an important aspect of the slowdown is the possible spatial variation in its experience. This is the issue we consider in this paper and we analyse this question in the context of the regional economic resilience framework. We proceed in two stages. In the first we analyse a measure of provincial slowdown (a sensitivity index) based just on growth rates and use cross-section regressions to investigate the determinants of this index, using a range of provincial characteristics common in the resilience literature. We find that economic structure, demographic factors and education all play a role, although with signs that are often at odds with the existing literature. In the second stage we decompose regional growth rates into national and province-specific components using a VAR model and argue that since resilience concerns the response of provinces to a national shock, it is properly analysed using just the national component of the growth rate rather than the growth rate as such. We therefore analyse a sensitivity index based just on the national component of growth and find many differences between the two sets of results. Using the second index matters for the determinants which are significant as well as for the magnitude of their coefficients. It appears that some of the influences found to be significant in the first stage are there only because of their influence on growth via the province-specific component of the growth rate and in this sense are spurious.
R15|Topology and formation of production input interlinkages: Evidence from Japanese microdata|Recent studies emphasize the role of the network structure of production input interlinkages for a wide range of economic outcomes including shock propagation and the emergence of aggregate fluctuations. In most of these studies the input-output architecture is fixed and exogenously given and relatively little work has considered its evolution and the underlying mechanism of network formation. Here we provide evidence on the evolution of production input interlinkages on the most granular level of economic activity, building on a diverse set of more than 80,000 companies sampled across nearly all industries of the Japanese economy. We review the main empirical properties of the Japanese production network level and find that these features are remarkably stable over time. To estimate the mechanism of supplier selection inducing this stability, we employ a stochastic actor-oriented model that sidesteps the econometric problem of mutual dependencies inherent to networked environments. Building on this approach, we find that topological features of the network such as the geodesic distance between the firms and their current number of relationships are a main driver of network dynamics in subsequent periods, and are quantitatively more important than selection based on productivity.
R15|Potential international employment effects of a hard Brexit|We use the World Input Output Database (WIOD) to estimate the potential employment effects of a hard Brexit in 43 countries. In line with other studies we assume that imports from the European Union (EU) to the UK will decline by 25% after a hard Brexit. The absolute effects are largest in big EU countries which have close trade relationships with the UK like Germany and France. However, there are also large countries outside the EU which are heavily affected via global value chains like China, for example. The relative effects (in percent of total employment) are largest in Malta and Ireland. UK employment will also be affected via intermediate input production. Within Germany, the motor vehicle industry and in particular the 'Autostadt' Wolfsburg are most affected.
R15|EUREGIO: The construction of a global IO DATABASE with regional detail for Europe for 2000-2010|This paper introduces the EUREGIO database: the first time-series (annual, 2000-2010) of global IO tables with regional detail for the entire large trading bloc of the European Union. The construction of this database, which allows for regional analysis at the level of so-called NUTS2 regions, is presented in detail for its methodology and applications. The tables merge data from WIOD (the 2013 release) with, regional economic accounts, and interregional trade estimates developed by PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, complemented with survey-based regional input-output data for a limited number of countries. All used data are survey data and only non-behavioral assumptions have been made to estimate the EUREGIO dataset. These two general rules of data construction allow empirical analyses focused on impacts of changes in behavior (of economies, firms, policies) without endogenously having this behavior embedded already by construction. The tables are publicly available to the research community, from the Dutch government open data website. In this project, both a regional trade database, and production and consumption data of different actors in different regions, were used. The focus is thus intentionally on the regionalization of both trade and the regional use and supply of products by different economic actors. The paper is organized around the successive steps of the data construction: (1) adjustment of WIOD, (2) regional information, (3) Construction of tables, (4) conclusions on the usefulness of this type of regional IO tables with an overview of current applications of the EUREGIO database.
R15|RIOTs in Germany – Constructing an interregional input-output table for Germany|Despite their importance, little is known about the spatial structure of trade and production networks within Germany and their connection to the international markets. The lack of data is problematic for regional analysis of aggregate shocks such as trade agreements and to analyze network effects of regional policies. This paper takes an in-depth look at this German production structure and trade network at the county level based on a unique data set of county level trade. I find a surprisingly vast heterogeneity with respect to specialization, agglomeration and trade partners. The paper subsequently shows how to adapt recent advances in regionalization of input-output tables to derive an interregional input output table for 402 German counties and 26 foreign partners for 17 sectors that is cell-by-cell compatible with the WIOD tables for national aggregates and can be used for impact analysis and CGE model calibration.

R15|The Evolution of Zipf's Law for U.S. Cities|Exploiting the cascade structure of cities and based on a dataset for U.S. cities between 1840 and 2016, the aim of this short paper is to answer three important questions: First, do we observe that the U.S. city size distribution exhibits a smooth transition to Zipf's law from the beginning or are there periods showing a pronounced departure from Zipf's law? Second, if we observe periods of departure, which alternative laws instead should be used to accurately describe the city size distribution? Third, employing information from the cascade structure of cities, do we always find evidence for primate cities for a specific period of time? Inter alia, we find that the exact Zipf's law has evolved over time from the more general, so-called three-parameter Zipf's law which can be traced back to Mandelbrot (1982).
R15|U.S. metropolitan house price dynamics|Using data for 70 U.S. metropolitan areas, this study explores spatial heterogeneity in house price dynamics. We use recent advances in panel econometrics that allow for spatial heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependence, and non-stationary but cointegrated data. We test for spatial differences and analyze the relationship between the price elasticity of housing supply and the income elasticity of prices, as well as bubble size and duration. The long-term elasticity of house prices with respect to aggregate personal income averages 0.81, but varies considerably across metropolitan areas. The long-term income elasticity generally is greater in the more supply-inelastic metropolitan areas, and we show that bubble size and duration are inversely related to supply elasticity. Also short-term momentum and reversion dynamics show substantial spatial heterogeneity.
R15|MegBec - Un modèle d’équilibre général calculable multirégional du Québec|This document presents the MegBec multiregional model of Quebec, a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with 16 “analytic” regions. The model is based on a social accounting matrix (SAM) with 44 industries and 63 products. The first part of the document describes how the SAM was constructed. First, a SAM for Quebec as a whole was elaborated, using the 2011 Statistics Canada supply and use tables. Regional SAMs were built from that one by distributing values across regions following several key indicators, particularly the regional GDP estimates of the Institut de la statistique du Québec. The resulting discrepancy in each region between salaries received and paid is attributed to worker commuting; origin-destination flows were estimated using cross-entropy minimization from Statistics Canada’s 2011 Census commuting data. Discrepancies between regional absorption and production are attributed to interregional trade; bi-lateral flows are generated by simulation using a gravity model. Attraction factors – key parameters in the gravity model – are obtained by aggregating attraction factors constructed at the finer Municipalité Régionale de Comté (MRC) spatial scale, according to network distances, in minutes, between population-weighted centroids. The second part of the document persents the model itself, whose specification is more or less standard for dynamic multiregional CGE models. In particular, trade between regions follows the Armington imperfect substituability hypothesis: supply is apportioned according to constant-elasticity-of-transformation (CET) functions, and demand according to constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) functions. Regional labor markets are characterized by the presence of unemployment, the rate of which depends on the level of wages, following a wage curve. Interregional worker commuting flows are logistic functions of regional wage rates. The document includes several appendices, one of which describes the reference scenario and the closure rules that are applied by default in the model. Ce document présente le modèle multirégional du Québec MegBec, un modèle d’équilibre général calculable (MEGC) dynamique séquentiel où l’on distingue 16 régions dites « régions analytiques ». Il s’appuie sur une matrice de comptabilité sociale (MCS) avec 44 industries et 63 produits. La première partie du document décrit le processus d’élaboration de la MCS. D’abord on a élaboré une MCS du Québec dans son ensemble, à partir des tableaux de ressources-emplois de 2011 de Statistique Canada. À partir de cette MCS, les matrices régionales ont été construites en répartissant les valeurs entre régions selon plusieurs clés, en particulier les estimations du PIB des régions de l’Institut de la statistique du Québec. L’écart qui en résulte dans chaque région entre salaires reçus et salaires payés est attribué au navettage des travailleurs; les flux origine-destination ont été estimés par la méthode de minimisation de l’entropie croisée à partir de données de navettage du recensement de 2011 de Statistique Canada. Les écarts entre l’absorption et la production régionales par produit sont attribués aux échanges interrégionaux, qui sont générés par simulation au moyen d’un modèle gravitaire. Les facteurs d’attractivité, paramètres critiques du modèle gravitaire, sont obtenus par agrégation de facteurs d’attractivité construits à l’échelle plus fine des MRC, selon les distances réticulaires en minutes entre centroïdes pondérés par la population. La deuxième partie du document présente le modèle lui-même, dont la spécification est grosso modo conforme à la structure classique des MEGC multirégionaux dynamiques. En particulier, le commerce entre les régions suit l’hypothèse de substituabilité imparfaite d’Armington : l’offre se distribue suivant des fonctions de distribution de l’offre à élasticité de transformation constante (CET) et la demande suivant des fonctions de répartition de la demande à élasticité de substitution constante (CES). Les marchés régionaux du travail sont caractérisés par la présence de chômage, dont le taux dépend du niveau des salaires, selon une courbe salaire-chômage (wage curve). Le navettage interrégional des travailleurs suit un modèle de fonction logistique des salaires régionaux. Le document compte plusieurs annexes, dont l’une décrit le scénario de référence et expose les règles de fermeture appliquées par défaut dans le modèle.
R15|The Impact of Microcredit on Farms and Rural Household: A Literature Review of Experimental Studies|In this article, we review the literature on the best ways to identify the causal effects of microcredit, present, and discuss some empirical results of the impact of microcredit on the adoption of innovations, investments, farm incomes, and profits. The results of empirical studies converge toward a positive impact of access to microcredit on the adoption of agricultural technology and investment. In terms of the effect on the technical efficiency of farms, agricultural income and profit, and consumption, the results do not all point in the same direction. The effects of microcredit are likely to vary depending on the context of the study.

Results suggest that there are important differences in the Colombian regions. We also highlight the importance of geographical proximity with respect to the effects of changes in final demand on the product generated in other regions. This highlights, as well, the role of space and distances in regional disparities. Keyword: CEER Model, Inter—regional input—output matrix, New Economic Geography, Colombia. JEL Codes: R15. 1. INTRODUCCIÓN Las disparidades regionales se han documentado para el caso colombiano en varios trabajos (Bonet y Meisel, 1999; Galvis y Meisel, 2013). Debido a la existencia de estas disparidades, el análisis del crecimiento económico y el de la composición sectorial del agregado nacional carecen de la diversidad observada en las regiones colombianas. Teniendo en cuenta lo anterior, este trabajo presenta los resultados del modelo CEER, un modelo de equilibrio general computable interregional, calibrado para la economía colombiana. Las tablas de input—output proporcionan una rica fuente de información sobre la estructura de las economías que no está disponible en otros marcos. Además de proporcionar información clave para analizar los vínculos entre actividades (y regiones), las tablas también proporcionan la base de datos subyacente utilizada en una variedad de modelos económicos. Utilizados de manera apropiada, estos modelos más sofisticados se pueden usar para evaluar significativamente el impacto del cambio económico, a nivel nacional y regional. También se pueden usar para evaluar los efectos distributivos del cambio en las industrias y regiones incluidas en la tabla de entrada—salida. Si se vinculan con el consumo de los hogares y los datos de ingresos, también se pueden evaluar los efectos distributivos del cambio de política económica en los hogares (Gretton, 2013). En la literatura nacional hay numerosas aplicaciones empíricas que han modelado la economía colombiana mediante el uso de CGE. Algunos de estos ejercicios son los de Velasco y Cárdenas (2015), González et al. (2011), Sánchez y Hernández (2004), Esguerra et al. (2002), Iregui (2005, 2001), Banguero et al. (2006), Bonet (2009), y Ramos et al. (2017). Estos últimos tienen un corte regional. El de Banguero et al. (2006) muestra un ejercicio de construcción de la matriz insumo—producto simétrica para el Valle del Cauca, con datos de 1994. Bonet (2006), por su parte, estudia las relaciones de encadenamientos de 25 sectores a partir de una matriz insumo—producto del Caribe colombiano, calibrada para el año 2000. El análisis de Ramos et al. (2017) se propone construir una matriz simétrica para el Caribe colombiano, que esta vez incluye 33 sectores y desagrega resultados por departamentos. La anterior versión del modelo CEER fue calibrada con datos de 2004. Con base en sus resultados, Haddad et al. (2009) estimaron los efectos que tendría una liberalización comercial generalizada (disminución de aranceles) sobre las economías regionales. Se encontró que Bogotá explota mejor que otras regiones los beneficios económicos generados por la disminución de las barreras al comercio, debido a la presencia de economías de escala en su actividad económica. Este modelo también se implementó en Perobelli et al. (2010), para estudiar la relación de dependencia económica entre las regiones del país. Al concentrar casi el 25% de la producción económica nacional, Bogotá es el departamento que mayores efectos interregionales genera hacia el resto de territorios, sobre todo por su elevada capacidad de compra. Este documento describe el proceso mediante el cual se construyó y actualizó la matriz insumo—producto interregional para Colombia. Se realizó bajo las condiciones de información limitada, que es una característica de gran parte de las estadísticas regionales en el país. En lo que sigue, se presenta un resumen de las principales tareas y las hipótesis de trabajo que se emplean en el tratamiento de la base de datos inicial utilizada durante el proceso de construcción del sistema. Por último, se conduce un análisis de los impactos regionales hacia adelante y hacia atrás, generados por los multiplicadores de producto resultantes de las estimaciones1. 2. TRATAMIENTO INICIAL DE LOS DATOS La matriz insumo—producto interregional para Colombia ofrece la oportunidad de entender mejor la estructura de las relaciones espaciales asociadas a la economía colombiana, desagregada en siete sectores productivos: la agricultura (AGR), la minería (MNE), la industria Una matriz insumo—producto contiene información sobre los flujos de bienes y servicios entre los sectores productivos de una economía, así como las demandas finales que enfrenta cada actividad. La matriz nacional es estimada por el Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística (DANE) en dos matrices, la de utilización y de oferta. Estos datos se elaboran con cierto rezago, debido a la complejidad del procedimiento. Sin embargo, no existe una matriz insumo—producto oficial para las regiones del país que pueda ser utilizada para estudiar las diferencias regionales en los sectores productivos, por lo que es necesario estimarla2. En esta sección se presentan las principales hipótesis y procedimientos aplicados para su estimación. Se emplearon los datos de las cuentas nacionales y regionales del DANE de 2012, que consisten principalmente en las matrices de oferta y utilización, y los datos sobre la producción bruta, el valor agregado, ingresos laborales y empleo por sectores a nivel regional. Estos últimos, calculados usando estimaciones de la Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares (GEIH), publicada por el DANE. El primer paso fue estimar una matriz de insumo—producto para todo el país desde las matrices de oferta y utilización. El objetivo principal de este procedimiento es transformar los flujos económicos valorados a precios de mercado en flujos valorados a precios básicos. Como se mencionó, las transacciones observadas en la economía se realizan a precios de mercado, donde se incluyen los costos derivados del comercio y transporte de las mercancías, así como los impuestos respectivos. Los flujos a precios básicos son aquellas valoraciones deducidas de estos costos. Para ello se adaptó la metodología desarrollada por Guilhoto y Sesso Filho (2005) para un ejercicio similar aplicado en Brasil. Hay por lo menos dos ventajas principales de este método: (i) se requiere solo los datos de ambas matrices; y (ii) los multiplicadores de producción no se ven afectados de manera significativa. El procedimiento utilizado en este trabajo se describe a continuación. 1. La asignación de márgenes e impuestos indirectos para todos los usuarios (consumo intermedio, demanda de inversión, consumo de los hogares, consumo del Gobierno y exportaciones), se estimó con base en las participaciones de los de demanda final en el sector. 2. De igual modo, la asignación de las importaciones de todos los usuarios (excepto de los exportadores) también se estima con base en las participaciones calculadas a partir de la estructura de ventas de la matriz de utilización. 3. Estos valores se deducen de la matriz de utilización originalmente evaluada a precios de mercado, para obtener un nueva matriz evaluada a precios básicos. 4. La estructura de la matriz de oferta se utiliza para transformar la nueva matriz de utilización del enfoque producto—sector al enfoque sector—sector. 5. Por último, la estructura nacional de 61 sectores se agrega en 7 con el fin de que coincida con la estructura departamental, debido a que las limitaciones de información por departamento no permiten llevar a cabo una desagregación muy amplia. Otra razón para mantener una agregación de 7 sectores son las limitaciones computacionales, teniendo en cuenta que hay 33 regiones y 7 sectores en el modelo. El cuadro 2 presenta esta información de acuerdo con las estimaciones realizadas para Colombia. De esta forma, el valor $386.312 representa el monto en miles de millones de pesos corrientes que utilizaron los sectores productivos del país para consumo intermedio doméstico. El segundo paso fue desagregar los datos nacionales en los 33 departamentos de Colombia. A continuación, se discuten algunas cifras generales de la matriz interregional insumo—producto para Colombia. Teniendo en cuenta la identidad macroeconómica regional, los componentes del producto regional bruto (PRB) son los componentes habituales del PIB (nacional), pero se le añade la balanza comercial interregional. En el caso de Colombia, la información regional suministrada por el DANE se compone solo de las exportaciones internacionales, la producción y el valor agregado bruto. Por ello, los otros componentes de la identidad macroeconómica regional tuvieron que ser estimados. Donde: C = Consumo de los hogares; I = Inversión; G = Consumo del gobierno; (X – M)RM = Balanza comercial internacional (región y resto del mundo); (X – M)DOM = Balanza comercial interregional (región y otras regiones). Para calcular el consumo, la inversión y el gasto del Gobierno de cada región, se utilizan participaciones calculadas a partir de variables específicas. Los valores de las exportaciones internacionales se obtuvieron directamente del sistema de datos del Banco de la República, y se consolidaron con los datos de producción bruta sectorial del DANE. Para cada componente, las variables utilizadas en el cálculo de las participaciones fueron: 1) Consumo de los hogares: Estimaciones de ingreso laboral obtenidas de la GEIH publicada por el DANE; 2) Demanda de inversión: Empleo del sector de la construcción estimado usando los resultados sectoriales de la GEIH, y 3) Consumo del Gobierno: Valor agregado del sector de administración pública obtenido de las cuentas departamentales publicado por el DANE. El cuadro 3 presenta estas participaciones, incluidas las exportaciones internacionales. Un resultado general es la concentración espacial de la demanda agregada, que muy probablemente se encuentra influenciada por la distribución de la actividad económica y de la población de los departamentos. Bogotá, junto con Antioquia y Valle, concentra casi la mitad del consumo de los hogares y del consumo del Gobierno, y cerca del 42% de la demanda de inversión. Por otra parte, departamentos como Meta, Casanare y Cesar presentan una participación importante en las exportaciones totales, esto en razón principalmente de sus ventas de petróleo crudo, petróleo refinado y carbón. Con el fin de regionalizar la matriz insumo—producto nacional, se sigue una versión adaptada del enfoque Chenery—Moses (Chenery, 1956; Moses, 1955). En este se asume que cada región utiliza la misma combinación de productos para los diferentes usuarios (sectores productivos, inversores, los hogares y el Gobierno) que se observa en las matrices nacionales de insumo—producto para Colombia. Respecto a las estructuras de costos sectoriales, la generación de valor agregado puede ser diferente en las distintas regiones. Se utilizan matrices de comercio por sector para desagregar el origen de cada producto, con el fin de capturar la estructura de la interacción espacial en la economía colombiana. La estrategia para estimar las matrices de comercio (una para cada sector del sistema) incluye los siguientes pasos: 1. Inicialmente se estimó la oferta (producción) de cada sector por región, excluyendo las exportaciones hacia otros países. Esto implica que, para cada región, se obtuvo información sobre el total de ventas de cada producto, c, para los mercados domésticos, s, tal que: Oferta (c, s) = oferta hacia mercados domésticos del producto c por región s. 2. A continuación se estimó la demanda total en cada región para cada sector. Para ello, se asume que la estructura de la demanda de cada usuario sigue el patrón nacional. Con los niveles regionales de producción sectorial, demanda de inversión, demanda de los hogares y demanda del Gobierno, se estiman los valores iniciales de la demanda total de cada producto en cada región, de la que se deducirá la demanda de productos importados. Las estimaciones resultantes, que representan la demanda total regional para los productos colombianos, se ajustaron de manera que para cada producto la demanda en todas las regiones es igual a la oferta en todas las regiones: Demanda (c, d) = demanda del producto c por la región d. 3. Con la información de Oferta(c, s) y Demanda(c, d), el siguiente paso fue estimar, para cada producto c, matrices de comercio, SHIN, de tamaño 33x33 que representan las transacciones de cada producto, c, entre el origen, o, y su destino, d, representadas por SHIN(c, o, d). Para esto se utilizó la metodología descrita en Dixon y Rimmer (2004), que consiste en implementar, para las celdas sobre la diagonal de la matriz, la ecuación (2): Para los elementos por fuera de la diagonal se utilizó la formulación presentada en (3): La variable Dist(o, d) representa la distancia entre dos regiones que comercian. El factor F(c) es el grado de comercio de cada sector. Para los bienes no transables (usualmente servicios) se usaron valores de F(c) cercanos a uno. Usualmente, según estudios previos, construcción y administración pública tienen 0,95, mientras que transporte y otros servicios tienen 0,80. Para los sectores transables (agricultura, minería y la industria manufacturera) se utilizó un F(c) de 0,5. Se puede mostrar que las sumas de las columnas en las matrices resultantes suman uno. Estas matrices muestran las participaciones de cada región en la demanda de un bien específico por región de destino. Con los coeficientes de participación se distribuye la demanda del bien c por región d (Demanda (c, d)) a través de las columnas correspondientes de las matrices SHIN. Como resultado de este procedimiento se obtienen unas matrices donde no necesariamente la oferta y la demanda regional son iguales. Para ajustarlas se utiliza el procedimiento RAS3. 3. ANÁLISIS ESTRUCTURAL En esta sección se estudian algunas de las principales características estructurales de las economías departamentales de Colombia, a través del uso de indicadores derivados de la matriz interregional insumo—producto. Se presenta un análisis de la composición del producto y las participaciones de las compras y ventas entre departamentos, teniendo en cuenta transacciones de demanda intermedia, demanda final y valor agregado. 3.1. Composición del producto El cuadro 4 presenta las participaciones regionales de la producción para los departamentos de Colombia. Bogotá, Antioquia y Valle del Cauca dominan la producción nacional, con porcentajes de 23,8%, 13,4% y 9,6%, respectivamente. Las participaciones de la producción regional por sectores en Colombia revelan cierta evidencia de concentración espacial en algunas actividades económicas específicas: agricultura en Antioquia, Cundinamarca, Valle, Boyacá y Santander (44,7% de la producción total); minería en Meta, Casanare y Cesar (58%); y la industria en Bogotá, Santander, Antioquia y Valle (62,4%). Servicios, en general, se encuentra concentrado en Bogotá, Antioquia y Valle (59,9%). El cuadro 5 muestra las participaciones sectoriales en la producción regional, donde se puede apreciar la importancia de algunas actividades en regiones que se encuentran relativamente especializadas: la trascendencia de la minería y de actividades asociadas a los hidrocarburos en Casanare (62,9% de su producto regional total), Meta (60,7%) y Arauca (55,4%); los servicios en San Andrés y Providencia (62,6%) y Bogotá (58,2%). Los indicadores presentados en esta sección se basan en razones de interdependencia de la matriz insumo—producto para Colombia, que solo tienen en cuenta encadenamientos directos entre los distintos agentes de la economía. En la siguiente sección se realiza un análisis comparativo de la estructura económica regional. Los eslabonamientos productivos entre sectores se evalúan mediante el análisis de las ventas intermedias de la matriz insumo—producto. En este caso, tanto los efectos directos como los indirectos se capturan utilizando una metodología que incorpora el uso de la matriz inversa de Leontief. 3.2. Encadenamientos interregionales El modelo convencional de insumo—producto está dado por el siguiente sistema de ecuaciones matriciales: Donde x y f son los vectores de producción total y demanda final, respectivamente; A es la matriz de coeficientes técnicos, aij , definidos como la cantidad de producto i requerido por unidad de producto j (en términos monetarios), para cada i, j = 1,…, n; y B se conoce como la matriz inversa de Leontief. Teniendo en cuenta los sistemas matriciales (4) y (5) en un contexto interregional, con R regiones diferentes, estos serían: Esto, a su vez, implica que: Se consideran diferentes componentes de f, que incluye demandas finales originadas en regiones específicas, vrs, s = 1,…, R, y en el extranjero, e. Se obtiene información por origen s de la matriz insumo—producto para Colombia, lo que permite construir v como una matriz con los valores monetarios del gasto en demandas finales realizado por regiones domésticas, v, y del extranjero en el país, e, como sigue. De esta manera, se puede reescribir (7) como: De (10) se puede calcular la contribución de la demanda final de diferentes orígenes a la producción regional. También se puede ver que la producción regional depende, entre otras cosas, de la demanda originada en la región propia y, de acuerdo al grado de integración interregional, de las demandas finales en otras regiones. En la siguiente sección se analizará la interdependencia entre sectores de diferentes regiones, mediante el estudio de las ventas intermedias que componen la matriz insumo—producto. Se usará la matriz inversa de Leontief basada en el sistema (7) y se presentarán algunas observaciones resumidas sobre las estructuras económicas regionales. Análisis de multiplicadores En este trabajo se calculan los multiplicadores por columnas derivados de la matriz B (Miller y Blair, 2009). El efecto del multiplicador se puede descomponer en intrarregional (multiplicador interno) e interregional (multiplicador externo). El primero representa el impacto en la producción de los sectores dentro de la región donde se originó el cambio en la demanda final, mientras que el segundo muestra el impacto en el resto de regiones del sistema (interregional spillover effects). El cuadro 6 muestra los resultados de este análisis. Antioquia, Valle, Amazonas, Bogotá y Bolívar son los departamentos que presentan el mayor multiplicador, de acuerdo con las participaciones intrarregionales e interregionales de los multiplicadores de producción promedio para cada uno de los 33 departamentos en Colombia (cuadro 6). En este cuadro también se presentan las participaciones de los efectos directos e indirectos de un cambio unitario en la demanda final para cada sector y región, netos de la inyección inicial; es decir, el multiplicador de producto neto del cambio inicial. Los valores se muestran en términos porcentuales y dan indicios del grado de dependencia de cada región hacia las otras regiones. Amazonas, Antioquia, Valle y Bogotá son las regiones más autosuficientes; el promedio del efecto interno al cambiar la demanda final en una unidad se encuentra por encima del 83%, mientras que el efecto interno neto por encima del 50%. Algunas regiones como Chocó, Caquetá, Quindío, La Guajira, Córdoba y Cundinamarca muestran un grado de autosuficiencia menor, y los efectos intrarregionales son, en promedio, mucho menores que los efectos interregionales. Descomposición del producto En esta sección se presenta un análisis complementario al enfoque de los multiplicadores. El producto regional se descompone teniendo en cuenta no solo la estructura de los multiplicadores, sino también la estructura de las demandas finales en las 33 regiones locales y el exterior (Sonis et al., 1996). El producto regional (para cada región) se desagregó de acuerdo con la ecuación (10) y se calculó la contribución de los componentes de demandas finales desde distintos orígenes. Los resultados se presentan en el cuadro 7. En términos generales, la participación de la producción generada por demandas finales internas es menor en los departamentos que presentan mayor dependencia del resto del mundo. La demanda por exportaciones es muy importante no solo para los departamentos exportadores de petróleo, sino también para otras economías basadas en recursos naturales como Cesar (departamento 9) o La Guajira (departamento 13). La contribución al producto regional de las exportaciones en las economías con recursos naturales suele situarse por encima del 40% (para el país esta participación es del 13,6%), como en el caso de Cesar (44,5%), La Guajira (55,8%), Meta (54,2%), Arauca (51,1%) y Casanare (57,3%). Hay también algunos casos de fuerte dependencia con regiones internas del país, como por ejemplo entre la economía de Cundinamarca frente a la demanda de Bogotá. Al analizar por columnas el cuadro 7 se tiene, para cada uno de los departamentos, las regiones cuya actividad económica se ve más afectada ante un cambio en la demanda. De esta forma, cuando cambia la demanda final en el Atlántico, los departamentos más afectados son el mismo Atlántico y, en menor medida, Magdalena y Bolívar. En cierto sentido, se puede pensar que estos son unos efectos “hacia adelante” o que impulsan otras regiones. También es posible estudiar los datos del cuadro 7 desde una perspectiva de fila y no de columna. Es decir, se puede observar la dependencia económica regional desde una perspectiva “hacia atrás”. Cada región depende en cierta medida de la demanda final originada en otras regiones. De esta manera se tiene, para cada uno de los departamentos, cuáles son las regiones que, al cambiar sus propias demandas, generan un mayor impacto sobre el departamento en cuestión. En este sentido, la producción del departamento de Bolívar se afecta por cambios en su demanda final propia, pero también en menor medida por cambios en los departamentos de Antioquia y Atlántico. 4. COMENTARIOS FINALES Este trabajo es parte de una iniciativa académica donde participaron investigadores del Laboratorio de Economía Regional y Urbana de la Universidad de São Paulo (NEREUS) y la Fundación Instituto de Investigaciones Económicas (FIPE), ambos en Brasil, en conjunto con el Centro de Estudios Económicos Regionales (CEER) del Banco de la República en Colombia. El análisis realizado hasta el momento sugiere que hay unas diferencias importantes en las estructuras internas de las economías regionales en Colombia, así como las interacciones externas entre los distintos agentes económicos. Algunos aspectos a resaltar de los ejercicios realizados son la importancia de la proximidad geográfica en los efectos de cambios en la demanda final sobre el producto de otras regiones. Los más afectados, por cambios en la demanda final de un departamento específico, son sus vecinos cercanos. Si el origen en los cambios en la demanda final es en el resto del mundo, los departamentos que reciben mayormente esos efectos son los del centro del país y aquellos cuya estructura económica depende de sectores como la minería o los hidrocarburos, tales como Casanare, Meta, Cesar y La Guajira. También se observa de los resultados que existen ciertas asimetrías en las relaciones de insumo—producto entre los departamentos. Por ejemplo, aumentos en la demanda final en Norte de Santander tienen efectos amplios sobre sí mismo y sobre Santander; pero aumentos originados en Santander no generan efectos significativos en Norte de Santander. Dado que la matriz de absorción utilizada durante el análisis estructural servirá como base para la re—calibración del modelo CEER, conocer de antemano las relaciones subyacentes entre las regiones y los agentes es fundamental para generar un mejor entendimiento de los resultados del modelo. El trabajo futuro implica estimar efectos de equilibrio general de algunas políticas o proyectos de amplia envergadura sobre las economías regionales y sobre el país en su conjunto. Notas 1 Un multiplicador de producto se define para cada sector en cada región como el valor total de la producción, en todos los sectores y todas las regiones de la economía, necesario para satisfacer una unidad monetaria adicional de demanda final en el sector .manufacturera (IND), la construcción (CNT), el transporte (TRN), la administración pública (ADP) y otros servicios (OTS). A continuación se presenta la estructura de la información organizada en el formato insumo producto. Esta contiene estimaciones de consumo a precios básicos, márgenes de comercio y transporte, impuestos y remuneraciones a capital, trabajo y otros factores para seis usuarios diferentes: productores, inversores, hogares, sector exportador, Gobierno regional y nacional. Los flujos a precios básicos consisten en la valoración de las transacciones que suceden en la economía deducidas de los costos por impuestos y por los márgenes del comercio e impuestos. La matriz de absorción, presentada en el cuadro 1, contiene la información para los seis usuarios mencionados. 2 Para una explicación más detallada sobre la teoría insumo—producto nacional y regional, véase Hahn (2015).partamentos de acuerdo a la estructura de ventas de la matriz de utilización. La hipótesis subyacente es que el coeficiente de los márgenes y las tasas de impuestos sobre los productos son los mismos para todos los usuarios. 3 Mayores detalles sobre el método se encuentran en Miller y Blair (2009).

R15|SinoTERM365, Bottom-up Representation of China at the Prefectural Level|The TERM methodology requires relatively modest data requirements to create a multi-regional, sub-national CGE database. SinoTERM365 is an extreme form of stretching available data, with the master database representing 162 sectors in 365 prefectural regions of the Chinese economy. A collaborative effort is envisaged among users to enable ongoing improvements to the database. The TERM approach facilitates rapid amendments to the database when improved data are available. The alternative, to wait until better data emerge before building a model, may result in less detail and a less versatile framework for analysis. In our example, we consider a downturn in use of coal and coal-generated electricity in China.

The paper tests if difference in prices (i.e. the distance from the frontier) can be explained by energy performance measured as a normalized categorical ascending kWh/m²/year grade (or Energy Performance Certificate -EPC). We show that there is significative evidence for energy performance's market value. The “Green Property Value” is estimated to range between 1% and 3% of the price for medium-high performance buildings. Our findings are robust to the specifications of the first (frontier estimation) and the second stage (residual analysis). We then propose a cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the return on retrofit investment a household would get from higher market value. We find that housing green property value accounts for a part, between 4.6% in houses and 6.6% in collective dwellings, of the real terms investment in energy retrofit. We interpret our findings with regard to spatial dependencies that affect the market and the heterogeneity between the private and the public social housing stocks.
R15|A scan test for spatial groupwise heteroscedasticity in cross-sectional models with an application on houses prices in Madrid|We propose a scan test for the presence of spatial groupwise heteroskedasticity in cross-sectional data. The scan approach has been used in different fields before, including spatial econometric models, to detect instability in mean values of variables or regression residuals. In this paper, we extend its use to second order moments. Using large Monte Carlo simulations, we check the reliability of the proposed scan procedure to detect instabilities in the variance, the size and power of the test and its accuracy to find spatial clusters of observations with similar variances. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of this test to improve the specification search in a spatial hedonic model, with an empirical application on housing prices in Madrid.
R15|The local impact and multiplier effect of universities in Lower Saxony on the labour market|This paper quantifies and compares the direct and indirect effects of labour demand generated by each university location in Lower Saxony. The results are classified in order to identify regional patterns. The applied method is based on three components: the importance, the dynamics and the interdependence of the university related labour market in relation to the other economic sectors. The importance of the university locations for their respective local economy and in comparison with each other is assessed by an indicator. The dynamic and change of the importance of the different university locations is shown using a shift-share analysis. Both measures can be applied for a classification and spatial clustering of different types of university locations. Additionally, input-output-based employment multipliers are estimated to display the interaction of the university locations with the local economy. The results can be summarised in the identification of three differing regions. The south-east of Lower Saxony is characterised by big, established, well integrated university locations with low dynamics. Adjacent, smaller university locations have difficulties to emerge of the shadows of the dominant locations. In the western part of Lower Saxony can be found small to big university locations with growing importance and continuous development potential. The university locations in the north east are small to medium sized and rather unimportant for the local as well as the total labour market.
R15|Real estate and land property automated valuations systems: a taxonomy and conceptual model|Purpose - Automated valuation models have been in use at least for the last fifty years in both academia and practice, while a proper definition was coined only in the last decade. Automated valuation models is a very mature topic that has recently reemerged as very important with the rise of digital infrastructure. Therefore, this paper provides needed analysis and synthesis of the accumulated body of knowledge, and proposes a conceptual framework adapted to reemerging trend.Design/methodology/approach - This imply two-sided contribution of this paper, a taxonomy and a conceptual framework. In order to address properly a broad notion of automated valuation models’ use, this paper introduces automated valuation system as a term and its taxonomy based on key facets, properties and measurements. Proposed taxonomy is non-hierarchical because all automated valuation systems have the same importance and each one has these facets. Furthermore, conceptual model represents the relationships between the facets. The conceptual model for automated valuation system is based on the visualized decision support system consisting of decision, end user, interface data and model. Both taxonomy and conceptual model came into being after literature review that included a bit more than one hundred references.Findings - The overview of facets, their properties and their dummy measurement is discussed only with examples that would be sufficient to illustrate their regularities. Examples are selected as the most cited articles for each of the newly introduced automated valuation approaches. As mentioned, all indicated facets are visualized in a conceptual model that is again an adapted version of the most visuals example of a decision support systems.Research limitations/implications – As mentioned, taxonomy and conceptual model are built upon although relatively broad but selective choice on more than one hundred references. Perhaps a systematic literature review process could additional validate the proposed taxonomy and conceptual model.Practical implications - Assuring the credibility of an automated valuation model that is based purely on comparing the predictive accuracy of method ‘a’ versus method ‘b’ has become a common practice. Therefore, discussion of the use of the proposed automated valuation has been push forward. In addition, as a domain of price estimates has been far surpassed any unique discipline, term that is more generic would be appropriate to accommodate future research coming from multitude of disciplines.Originality/value – By knowledge of the authors this is the first paper that develops taxonomy and conceptual model of automated valuation systems.
R15|Urban Transport Systems in Latin America and the Caribbean: Challenges and Lessons Learned|This paper discusses the transportation challenges that urban areas in Latin America and the Caribbean face and reviews the causal evidence on the impact brought by different urban transport system interventions implemented around the world. The objective is to highlight the main lessons learned and identify knowledge gaps to guide the design and evaluation of future transport investments. The review shows that causal studies have been concentrated in certain areas and that an important number have been carried out in developed countries. Empirical challenges due to the non-random placement of these interventions and their possible effects over the entire transport network might explain the reduced amount of causal evaluations. A large part of the literature has focused on the impact of transport systems on housing values, finding overall increases in prices and rents, but with results highly dependent on the quality and perceived permanency of the system. There are few studies that explore socioeconomic effects, and those available have emphasized employment access. There are almost no studies exploring displacement effects, which should be examined to better understand the social inclusion role of transport systems. New avenues of research are emerging that exploit non-traditional sources of data, such as big data. Moreover, studies looking at ways to improve the operational efficiency of systems and those seeking to promote behavioral changes in transport users.
R15|International financial input-output table for Asia-Pacific region|Flow of Funds Accounts (FFA) refer to the statistics describing how funds are transferred and where assets and liabilities exist in or outside a country. This paper tries to produce preliminary global FFA focusing on Asia-Pacific region, which is a type of global FFA, and to identify its uses. We discuss the method of converting countries’ FFA into Financial Input-output (FIO) and putting those FIOs, CPIS, CDIS and other international statistics into the framework of global FIO. Then, it discusses the use of global FIO table by applying the methods of input-output analysis.
R15|The Input-Output Analysis Of Blue Industries: Comparative Study Of Estonia And Finland|The paper focuses on examining the role of blue industries in the national economies of Estonia and Finland as two neighbouring countries that have a sea border. We exploit the Input-Output (I-O) methodology to analyse inter-industry linkages relying on the OECD I-O tables. The OECD database comprises information on 34 sectors of the national economy over the period 1995–2011. The results of the analysis show that despite rather weak overall backward and forward linkages of aggregated blue industries within the national economies, they play a remarkable role in the economic activities of maritime regions, and to a large extent drive the economic success of Estonian and Finnish regional and national economies in generating new growth and employment. The weak backward and forward linkages indicate that negative dynamics within the blue economy yield rather weak negative externalities for the overall economy, and by contrast, if the national economy as a whole is suffering under a crisis, the potential impact on industries is not particularly remarkable. These findings suggest that blue industries are relatively independent within national economies having a remarkable role in socio-economic development of maritime regions, and thereby, create good preconditions for the stable development of cross-border cooperation between the maritime regions of both countries.
R15|The economic importance of the Belgian ports : Flemish maritime ports, Liège port complex and the port of Brussels – Report 2016|This Working Paper analyses the economic importance of the Belgian ports based largely on the annual accounts data for the year 2016. As the years prior to 2016 have been described in earlier papers in the same series, we mainly focus on the figures for 2016 and developments between 2015 and 2016. On the back of strong growth, direct value added in the Belgian ports remained more or less stable in 2016 at around € 18 000 million (current prices) or roughly 4.3% of Belgium’s GDP. Direct value added declined in the Flemish seaports, mainly in the port of Antwerp. Ghent and Zeebrugge could only partly compensate for the fall in Antwerp’s value added, while Ostend showed a small decline itself. The inland ports as a whole grew over the period 2015-2016; the port of Brussels registered a decline and the Liège port complex an increase. Indirect value added is around 82% of the direct figure. After declining from 2012, direct employment in the Belgian ports was more or less stable in 2016 at around 115 000 FTE or approximately 2.8% of Belgium’s total domestic employment. Direct employment in the Flemish seaports increased, mainly in the ports of Zeebrugge, Ghent and Antwerp. Ostend showed a decline in employment. The inland ports recorded lower employment; the port of Brussels registered a decline, as did the Liège port complex. Indirect employment is around 1.2 times the direct figure. Delving deeper into the data and trying to explain the above trends in terms of the structural composition of the Belgian ports shows that all ports are concentrated on a few sectors, and within those sectors often on just a handful of companies. Based on the figures of the traffic, the Flemish ports can be considered as real bridgeheads for trade with the UK. Developments regarding the modalities and consequences of the Brexit therefor should be followed with the greatest attention. Given the existing import and export volumes in terms of tonnage, it seems it will mostly be a challenge in Zeebrugge and to some extent for Antwerp.
R15|Water Content in Trade: A Regional Analysis for Morocco|This paper reports the results of an application using an interregional input-output matrix for Morocco together with regional information on water consumption by sectors. We develop a trade-based index that reveals the relative water use intensities associated with specific interregional and international trade flows. We estimate, for each flow associated with each origin-destination pair, measures of trade in value added and trade in water that are further used to calculate our index. We add to the existing literature on virtual water flows by encompassing the subnational perspective in the case study of a country that shows a â€œclimate divideâ€ : while a great part of the southern territory is located in the Sahara Desert, with serious water constraints, the northern part is relatively more privileged with access to this natural resource. Furthermore, we compare that Trade-Based Index of Water Intensity to similar metrics related to the use of other natural resources.
R15|Market of the Novosibirsk Oblast in the System of Regional Markets|This paper studies integration of the Novosibirsk Oblast market for final goods with markets of all other Russian regions. It considers an aggregated market represented by a basket of basic foods (staples basket). The law of one price serves as the criterion of market integration. It is the base for constructing time series models of the regional costs of the staples basket over 2001–2015 relative to its cost in the Novosibirsk Oblast. Regional markets are divided into four groups: perfectly integrated with the Novosibirsk Oblast market, conditionally integrated with it, not integrated but tending towards integration, and neither integrated nor tending towards integration. Nonlinear time series models with asymptotically decaying trends describe the movement towards integration (price convergence).
R15|Пространственная Интеграция Региональных Рынков Сибири<BR>[Spatial Integration of Siberian Regional Markets]|This paper analyzes integration of 13 regions constituting Siberia with all country’s regions. The criterion of market integration is the law of one price. The data analyzed are time series of the cost of the staples basket over 2001–2015. Pairs of regional markets are divided into four groups: perfectly integrated, conditionally integrated, not integrated but tending towards integration (converging), and neither integrated nor converging.
R15|Оценка Пространственных Моделей С Переменными Коэффициентами Пространственной Чувствительности Методом Максимального Правдоподобия И Обобщенным Методом Наименьших Квадратов<BR>[Maximum likelihood and generalized least squares estimation of spatial lag models with endogenous spatial coefficients: a Monte Carlo simulation]|The traditional spatial lag model assumes that all regions in the sample exhibit the same degree of sensitivity to spatial external effects. This may not always be the case, however, especially with highly heterogeneous regions like those in Russia. Therefore, a model has been suggested that views spatial coefficients as being endogenously defined by regions’ intrinsic characteristics. We generalize this model, describe approaches to its estimation based on maximum likelihood and generalized least squares, and perform a Monte Carlo simulation of these two estimation methods in small samples. We find that the maximum likelihood estimator is preferable due to the lower biases and variances of the estimates it yields, although the generalized least squares estimator can also be useful in small samples for robustness checks and as a first approximation tool. In larger samples, results of the generalized least squares estimator are very close to those of the maximum likelihood estimator, so the former may be preferred because of its simplicity and less strict computational power requirements.
R15|Spatial Integration of Siberian Regional Markets|This paper studies market integration of 13 regions constituting Siberia with one another and all other Russian regions. The law of one price serves as a criterion of market integration. The data analyzed are time series of the regional costs of a basket of basic foods (staples basket) over 2001–2015. Pairs of regional markets are divided into four groups: perfectly integrated, conditionally integrated, not integrated but tending towards integration (converging), and neither integrated nor converging. Nonlinear time series models with asymptotically decaying trends describe price convergence. Integration of Siberian regional markets is found to be fairly strong; they are integrated and converging with about 70% of country’s regions (including Siberian regions themselves).
R15|ECIO Model Operators Guide|The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL)/ West Virginia University (WVU) Econometric Input-Output (ECIO) model is a time-series enabled hybrid econometric input-output (IO) model that combines the capabilities of econometric modeling with the strengths of IO modeling. The model was developed and designed specifically for estimating the income and employment impacts of the development and deployment of new energy technologies over a given forecast period. The ECIO model consists of a macroeconomic econometric model of the United States (U.S.) national economy and an inter-industry model that reflects the interdependence of all the industries in the economy. These two components have three modules and several sub-modules of interrelated equations for the U.S. economy, with employment and income detail for 32 industrial sectors. This document is designed to escort a user with little computing or programing experience through the processes of setting up the ECIO model application to run on a personal computer (PC). The document will guide user through the various stages of the ECIO model with screenshots and instructions. Using this guide and standardized input data files (in .csv format) that are generated by the NETL NEMS-ECIO Translation Tool, users should be able run the model to generate estimates of deployment scenario impacts.
R15|Regional Industry Cluster Analysis for the Potomac Highlands in West Virginia|This part of the project identifies existing industrial clusters for the Potomac Highlands region in West Virginia and seeks potential industries or clusters for economic development. We also evaluate strengths and gaps of existing industry clusters. Our cluster analysis comprises three parts, including (1) location quotient (LQ) analysis, (2) shift-share analysis, and (3) input-output (I-O) analysis. Results of both location quotient and shift-share analyses are used for industry targeting, whereas input-output analysis measures existing cluster strengths and bottlenecks for potential cluster diversification strategies based on Jackson’s(2015) cluster and diversification strategy (CADS).
R15|Environmental Costs of European Union Membership: A Structural Decomposition Analysis|The interest in this paper lies in the environmental costs of the European Union (EU). EU membership requires a series of economic and political changes that should impact the country’s production and consumption structures and its trade relationships. These, in turn, will affect CO2 emissions sources and levels. This is especially true for the former Soviet Union countries that recently joined the EU, given the difference in their levels of development and production structure.Using a structural decomposition analysis we are able to quantify the main drivers of changes in emissions differentiating six components, namely: emissions intensity, industrial structure and sourcing,consumer preferences, final demand sourcing and consumption level. Grouping the countries into five clubs, New European Union countries, Old European Union countries, the United States of America, China, and the Rest of the World, we measure trading pattern changes and their impact on CO2 emission levels.
R15|Generation of regional input-output tables: a spatial econometric approach with illustrative simulations for France,Germany and Poland|This paper investigates the construction of multisector-multiregion input-output tables by using spatial econometric methods. I demonstrate that, under reasonable assumptions, the problem of finding Leontief's technical coeffecients can be formulated as a modified multi-equation spatial Durbin model and the missing parameters can be estimated via maximum likelihood. The resulting coefficients are computed as a function of country-wide coeffiecients, as well as distance and regional-sectorial data on value added. The statistical performance of the model is scrutinized and the method is illustrated with simulations of regional (NUTS-3 level) economic impact assessment - for generic companies located in Southern France, Germany and Poland.
R15|Estimation of NUTS2 Interregional Input-Output Systems for Greece, 2010 and 2013|The aim of this paper is to describe in details the process of estimation of two interregional input-output systems for Greece, for the years 2010 and 2013. Further understanding of the changing structure of the Greek regional economies during the crisis, within an integrated interregional system, is one of the main goals of a broader project underway at the University of SÃ£o Paulo Regional and Urban Economics Lab (NEREUS). With this paper, we make available not only the details of the methodological procedures adopted to generate the interregional systems, but also the database itself to be used by other researchers and practitioners.

R15|Investing in Social Care Infrastructure and Employment Generation: A Distributional Analysis of the Care Economy in Turkey|This paper examines the aggregate and gender employment impact of expanding the early childhood care and preschool education (ECCPE) sector in Turkey and compares it to the expansion of the construction sector. The authors' methodology combines input-output analysis with a statistical microsimulation approach. Their findings suggest that the expansion of the ECCPE sector creates more jobs and does so in a more gender-equitable way than an expansion of the construction sector. In particular, it narrows the gender employment and earnings gaps, generates more decent jobs, and achieves greater short-run fiscal sustainability.
R15|Climate risk and food security in Guatemala|In this study, we used a Computable General Equilibrium model of the Guatemalan economy to conduct simulations for a) a reduction in productivity due to climate change; and b) the effects of drought in agriculture. The reduction in productivity due to climate change would mean an important drop in the value added of agriculture and animal production, as well as a slight drop in industrial food production and the service industry. Under this scenario we should expect a fall in real GDP of 1.2%. The reduction of productivity could mean a reduced fiscal space, and a reduction in government expenditure because of lower tax revenues. More importantly, due to higher prices and lower income of households, this scenario could mean that consumption of agricultural goods for each type of household would be reduced in a relevant manner with great impacts on the food security aspect of access. One of the findings in the effects of drought in agriculture is a decrease of the value added of 23%. As expected, this situation would negatively affect the wages paid to unskilled workers, but also urban non-poor households would see a reduction of their disposable income due to higher food prices. One of the most interesting results is that the demand for land would fall by 38%. This is because as water would become scarcer, there would be fewer incentives to engage in agricultural activities. However, due to the importance of agricultural production for ensuring food security, these results show that a proper water allocation system is needed.
R15|Towards an East German wage curve - NUTS boundaries, labour market regions and unemployment spillovers|The relevance of spatial effects in the wage curve can be rationalized by the model of monopsonistic competition in regional labour markets. However, distortions in extracting the regional unemployment effects arise for administrative boundaries at the district level as they fail to adequately capture spatial processes. In addition, the nonstationarity of wages and unemployment is often ignored. Both issues are particularly important in high unemployment regimes like East Germany where a wage curve is difficult to establish. In this paper, labour market regions defined by economic criteria are used to examine the existence of an East German wage curve. Due to the nonstationarity of spatial data, a global panel cointegration approach is adopted. By specifying a spatial error correction model (SpECM), equilibrium adjustments are investigated in time and space. The analysis gives evidence on a locally but not a spatially cointegrated wage curve for East Germany.
R15|Economic importance of the Belgian ports: Flemish maritime ports, Liège port complex and the port of Brussels - Report 2015|This paper is an annual publication issued by the Microeconomic Analysis service of the National Bank of Belgium. The Flemish maritime ports (Antwerp, Ghent, Ostend, Zeebrugge), the Autonomous Port of Liège and the port of Brussels play a major role in their respective regional economies and in the Belgian economy, not only in terms of industrial activity but also as intermodal centers facilitating the commodity flow. This update paper1 provides an extensive overview of the economic importance and development of the Flemish maritime ports, the Liège port complex and the port of Brussels for the period 2010 - 2015, with an emphasis on 2015. Focusing on the three major variables of value added, employment and investment, the report also provides some information based on the social balance sheet and an overview of the financial situation in these ports as a whole. These observations are linked to a more general context, along with a few cargo statistics. Annual accounts data from the Central Balance Sheet Office were used for the calculation of direct effects, the study of financial ratios and the analysis of the social balance sheet. The indirect effects of the activities concerned were estimated in terms of value added and employment, on the basis of data from the National Accounts Institute. As a result of the underlying calculation method the changes of indirect employment and indirect value added can differ from one another. The developments concerning economic activity in the six ports in 2014 - 2015 are summarized in the table on the next page. In 2015 the growth of maritime traffic in the Flemish maritime ports was due to developments in the port of Antwerp and the port of Ghent. Direct value added increased in all Flemish maritime ports in 2015. However, direct employment is continuing to decline. Investment was down everywhere except in the port of Zeebrugge. Cargo traffic in the Liège port complex declined in 2015, whereas it slightly slowed down in the port of Brussels. At the same time, direct value added in Liège shrank while it rose sharply in the port of Brussels. By contrast, direct employment was down in both ports. This report provides a comprehensive account of these issues, giving details for each economic sector, although the comments are confined to the main changes that occurred in 2015.
R15|Economic importance of air transport and airport activities in Belgium – Report 2015|This study assesses the economic importance of air transport and airport activities in Belgium in terms of value added, employment and investment over the 2013-2015 period 1 . The sector considered embraces not only the activities directly connected with air transport, but also all those that take place on site at the six Belgian airports (Antwerp, Brussels,Charleroi, Kortrijk, Liège and Ostend). The study reviews the direct and indirect effects of the sector on the basis of microeconomic data (mainly obtained from the Central Balance Sheet Office) and mesoeconomic data (from the National Accounts Institute). It also includes a social balance sheet analysis and an indication of credit risk using statistical models from the NBB’s In-house Credit Assessment System (ICAS). In 2015, air transport and airport activities generated € 6 billion in direct and indirect value added (i.e. 1.5 % of Belgian GDP) and employed around 62 500 people in full-time equivalents (FTEs)either directly or indirectly (1.5 % of domestic employment including the self-employed). Brussels and Liège Airport remain the country’s biggest airports, respectively in terms of passenger and cargo traffic. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in March 2016, the regional airports received part of Brussels’ passenger traffic. All in all, Brussels recovered fairly quickly, especially freight traffic, but also passenger traffic resumed gradually to tie in with growth again since November 2016. Brussels and Liège are the fastest growing airports during the 2013-2015 period, respectively in terms of value added and employment. At Ostend Airport, these economic variables slumped in line with the evolution of freight traffic volumes. Antwerp’s growth rates went into the red as well, mainly under the influence of the difficulties faced by VLM Airlines. At Charleroi and Liège, the trend of value added is downward, while that is not the case for employment. The smallest changes are recorded in Kortrijk.
R15|Social Efficiency of Sectoral Employment in Polish Regions|Research background: Regions that are able to use their resources in the most efficient way could be perceived as valuable benchmarks when shaping socio-economic policy. The efficiency, however, can be related not only to pure economic categories but to social goals as well. These two dimensions: economic and social overlap and often have some common stems, among which sectoral structure of employment seems to be an important one. Purpose of the article: The aim of the study was to compare thesocial efficiency of employment in three sectors in Polish voivodeships. Not only were we evaluating therelative performance of each region but we were also paying attention to theefficiency of engagement of human resources in agricultural, industrial and service sectors. Methodology/methods:We adopted DEA method to assess thesocial efficiency of Polish regions. We evaluated social cohesion concerning its two output dimensions: positive, that could be described by social activity and negative, that could be reflected in a form of social exclusion stemming from material sources. We took into account a level of employment in agricultural, industrial and service sectors as inputs in the model and thus focused our attention on thethreesectoral structure of regional economies. Our model assumed non-radial developmental paths and was input oriented (NR-CCR). Data were describing the 16 Polish voivodeships in the2015 year and were extracted from the Central Statistical Office of Poland’s databases. Findings& Value added:The conducted research indicate that Polish regions which were the most efficient in terms of social integration were simultaneously those with the best economic results in terms of GDP per capita. The highest social efficiency was characteristic for employment in theservice sector, while the lowest – for agriculture. Thus, structural development appears to be favourable for regional economies also in terms of social cohesion, which is often neglected in the literature.
R15|Spatial pattern of Russia’s market integration|This paper studies integration of regional goods markets in Russia over 2001–2015 with the use of time series analysis, based on the law of one price as the criterion of market integration. The cost of a staples basket is used as a price representative. The analysis involves all pairs of country’s regions, thus providing a comprehensive pattern of market integration. The region pairs are classified as belonging to one of four groups: integrated, conditionally integrated, not integrated but tending towards integration, and neither integrated nor tending towards integration. The results suggest that only less than a quarter of region pairs fall into the fourth category.
R15|Technical efficiency, productivity change and environmental degradation|This study deals with the nonparametric frontier analysis in the case of the EU 28 countries for a period spanning from 1993 to 2012. It provides statistical inference about the radial output based measure of technical efficiency under the assumption of Constant Returns to Scale (CRS) and it performs scale analysis that allows determining the nature of scale inefficiency of each data point. Furthermore, an order-α approach is developed for determining partial frontiers. Both traditional Malmquist-Luenberger and bootstrapped Malmquist productivity indexes between 1993 and 2012 are constructed. Analysis of productivity change by decomposing the Total Factor Productivity Index into Efficiency Change and Technical Change is performed showing respectively whether productivity gains derive mainly from improvements in efficiency or are mostly the result of technological progress.
R15|“Decentralization” of income per capita and its relationship to administrative decentralization in the context of European Union members|"In this research we tried to define, for the first time, the concept of ""decentralization"" of per capita income and its position among other constructions, similar to or associated with it. In this direction, we tried to give decentralization a definition as clear as possible, using existing concepts to identify it, but also to associate it with its most likely cause, administrative decentralization. Besides the theoretical documentation we, additionally, attempted to put this relationship under an econometric test, which indicates some trends but, because of the difficulties in measuring some variables, we were not able to extract absolutely reliable conclusions."
R15|Methodology of the Multiregional Health Account for Germany - An Iterative Algorithm-Based Multiregionalization Approach of Supply and Use Tables with Emphasis on Health|The Multiregional Health Account is a methodological enhancement of the National Health Account for Germany. The latter represents an established and annually updated satellite account quantifying the economic contribution of the health economy in terms of gross value added, employment and interna-tional trade. Its methodological enhancement to a multiregional framework for the 16 federal states of Germany is represented by multiregional supply and use tables. This setting allows to compile a multire-gional health input-output table and subsequently to carry out input-output analysis. Hence, we are able to quantify the direct and indirect economic impacts of the health economy to analyze interdependencies between industries and federal states. For the purpose of compiling the Multiregional Health Account, we elaborate a new approach based on the SUT-RAS algorithm (Temurshoev & Timmer, 2011), which we adapt for the multiregional framework. We call it the MR-SUT-RAS algorithm. The methodology and its application in the context of the health economy is the subject of this contribution.
R15|Basic Results of the Multiregional Health Account for Germany - Validation of Indirect Effects of the Health Economy|The Multiregional Health Account is a methodological enhancement of the National Health Account and adds a subnational regional dimension to the latter. Both satellite accounts aim to quantify the contribution of the German health economy in terms of gross value added, employment and trade. Moreover, since they are based on supply and use tables and thus input-output tables of the national accounting system, both models allow input-output analysis for a more thorough evaluation of the national and multiregional health economy. The challenge addressed in this paper consists in questioning the reliability of the results from multiregional input-output analysis based on the Multiregional Health Account. This is necessary due to the circumstance that no official multiregional input-output tables are available for German federal states and we elaborated a new methodology to derive multiregional tables on our own. Hence, we conduct input-output analysis to evaluate the performance of the multiregional input-output table in modelling intra- and interregional interdependencies. We find that the model succeeds in reproducing certain regional characteristics.
R15|Basic Results of the Multiregional Health Account for Germany - Validation of Direct Effects of the Health Economy|The Multiregional Health Account is a satellite account focusing on the economic impact of the health economy in German federal states. It was developed as an enhancement of the existing National Health Account for Germany. In contrast to the subject of matter over here, the calculations of the National Health Account are based on available national supply and use tables. Since there are no according tables available for the German federal states, we developed a methodology, which allows to calculate supply and use tables at the subnational multiregional level. The present paper focusses on the results of the MRHA for the reason of a thorough validation procedure of the developed approach. We evaluate regional direct effects of the health economy by comparing derived characteristics with company data and evaluate the performance of the algorithm in a time series. We find that the elaborated approach shows reasonable results in both dimensions evaluated.
R15|Application of the Multiregional Health Account for Germany - A financial equalization scheme to cope with lagging investments in German hospitals|Lagging investments in German hospitals have become a serious challenge in recent decades. The responsibility for investment financing lies with the German federal states, the “Bundeslaender”, due to the dualistic financing framework applying for German hospitals. Yet, hospital investments experience a field of tension between the availability of financial resources and necessary investments. A possible solution could be a financial equalization scheme for the health economy incorporating an earmarked fund for hospital investments. The rationale for such a system is that health economies of federal states do not represent single closed systems, but depend on interregional trade flows to supply patient treatment. The respective calculations in this paper are based on our recently compiled Multiregional Health Account for Germany. The model represents a satellite account of the health economy based on national accounts. Consequently, we are able to calculate spillover effects from patient treatment in federal states by conducting input-output analysis. Based on the results, we derive a sketch of a financial equalization scheme in order to ensure needs-based hospital infrastructure in German federal states.
R15|The Moscow market in the country’s economic space|This paper studies integration of the Moscow market for final goods with markets of all other Russian regions. It considers an aggregated market represented by a minimum food basket. The law of one price serves as a criterion of market integration. It is a base for constructing time series models of the regional costs of the staples basket over 2001–2015 relative to its cost in Moscow. Regional markets are divided into four groups: integrated with the Moscow market, conditionally integrated with it, not integrated but tending towards integration with the Moscow market, and neither integrated nor tending towards integration. Nonlinear time series models with asymptotically decaying trends capture a movement towards integration (price convergence).
R15|The People’s Republic of China’s Import Competition and Skill Demand in Japanese Manufacturing|We examine the hypothesis that manufacturing industries in Japan that have been exposed to import competition from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) experience greater skill upgrading (increased demand for skilled workers). Using an industry panel dataset over the period 1980–2010, we exploit variations of worker skill categories by occupation, paired with detailed information and communication technology investment data in the employment share regression. We find that while the PRC’s comparative advantages in exports have shifted from labor-intensive to more capital-intensive products, this has not resulted in substituting skilled workers in Japanese manufacturing. Rather, it has had the profound positive effect of raising overall demand for skilled workers. Most of the competition effects were felt among production workers, leaving middle-skilled workers largely unaffected.
R15|To the question about parameterization of national innovation system|The objective of the study is to obtain quantitative characteristics of the influence of science and business on the results of innovation activity of regions of the Russian Federation. Patents, international patent applications and new manufacturing technologies are considered as results of innovation activity. The dependence between the results of innovative activity in the region and the number of potential links between research organizations and business companies is found. The possibility of using the obtained parametric description of national and regional innovation systems for cross-country comparisons is justified.
R15|Geographic Concentration of the Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery|The concentration patterns in the Northeast U.S. sea scallop industry are examined from 1996-2014 using generalized indices of concentration and exploratory spatial data analysis. Absolute and relative Theil indices of concentration are computed to describe the regional pattern of concentration within ports over time. Moran's I provides a complementary measure of concentration of activity among neighboring ports. The Moran scatterplots and confidence plots provide insight into local patterns of concentration in this industry. The analysis reveals large changes from year to year in the geographic concentration of the scallop industry, which is likely to be related to natural variability of the environment and regulations enacted by fisheries managers in response to the variability of the environment.
R15|Peer Effects and Political Participation: What is the Role of Coursework Clusters?|This study addresses the role of peer civic engagement during adolescence on political participation in adulthood. We focus on novel specification based on an alternative peer group: the coursework cluster, which is constructed using an algorithm based on course taking habits. This paper explores how peers within course-taking clusters affect future political participation. The civic identities and politically oriented norms developed may be passed on through these classmates. Our results show that the influence of the peer group is from peers who perform better (have a higher grade point average) in social studies courses and from peers who participate in extracurricular activities.
R15|Woody Biomass Processing and Rural Regional Development|This paper reports on economic and environmental impacts of introducing woody biomass processing in an economically distressed area in central Appalachia, one of the more heavily forested areas in the U.S. Woody biomass is a readily available unconventional energy source that has the potential to boost the rural region’s economy. We use a static regional computable general equilibrium model to assess regional economic impacts of two different WBP production pathways, biomass to ethanol and biomass to biofuel via fast pyrolysis. In an economy with a workforce approaching 160,000, we find that introducing woody biomass ethanol or fast pyrolysis processing would increase regional output by 0.45% and 0.78%, boost jobs by 0.13% and 0.20%, and increase income by 0.16% to 0.26%, respectively. The results from the environmental assessment show that the ethanol pathway is substantially more environmentally friendly than the fast pyrolysis pathway.
R15|Regional Economic Competitiveness. The Case of Romania|The paper approaches the issue of regional competitiveness in Romania, focusing on simple tools for analysis, namely the shift-share analysis (introduced by Dunn in 1960) and specific competitiveness indicators: RCA, RCA1 and RCA2. As documented in the literature, the level of such indicators and the changes that occur in their levels are key factors for an analysis of economic and social performance at regional and sub-regional levels (Dâ€™Elia, 2005; Chilian, 2012; Iordan et al., 2014; Pelinescu et.al.., 2015). The classical form of shift-share analysis chosen by the authors envisages to â€œdivideâ€ the dynamics of a certain growth factor in a certain region into three components: national, sectoral and regional. Given such issues, by using the sectoral shift-share analysis of exports completed by the indices-based competitiveness analysis in the paper will be identified the regions of Romania which reveal dynamics of their economic structures conducing to high levels of external competitiveness (and, thus, to a higher degree of integration into the European Single Market), and to sustainable specializations, adequate to the requirements of building a modern economy, with high flexibility and high technological level.
R15|Interstate Input-Output Matrix for Brazil: An Application of the IIOAS Method|This paper presents the process of estimation of an interregional input-output system for the 26 Brazilian states and the Federal District, in conditions of limited information, using the IIOAS method. IIOAS is consistent with the national input-output matrix and can be built for any country that publishes its SUTs, and has a regionalized sectoral information system. Subsequently, the commercial relations and productive structures of each state were analyzed. SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro were the most self-sufficient states. Roraima and Tocantins were the ones that presented the lowest levels of self-sufficiency. Regarding regional interdependence, Roraima and Acre were the states whose production showed less dependence on the final demand of other states, whereas Amazonas, EspÃ­rito Santo and Mato Grosso were the states in which the final demand of other states and exports exert most influence in the local production.
R15|Spatial Convergence and Growth in Indian Agriculture: 1967–2010|Abstract Inter-state disparity has been a perennial feature of Indian agriculture. The study probes if per capita income from agriculture has converged across states and finds evidence in favour of beta convergence. Spatial econometric techniques used indicate significant spatial dependence in agricultural growth. Infrastructure like roads, irrigation, and electricity, diversification in cropping pattern and quality of human capital are found to aid in growth. However, excessive rainfall tends to decrease growth rate in India. The spill-over across states are found to be primarily driven by roads, irrigation and rural literacy and we also find significant impact of spatial income growth providing evidence in favour of agglomeration effects. Hence, investments in human capital, physical infrastructure specially water management and incentives towards growing crops which yield higher returns will aid agriculture growth in India.
R15|Is the production function Translog or CES? An empirical illustration using UK data|Computable general equilibrium (CGE) studies are increasingly in-terested in informing keys parameters of their models using empirical data. Energy and environmental CGE ndings have been found to be particularly sensible to changes in the values of the elasticities of substitution between inputs of production. Although applied econometric literature provides numerous estimates of substitution elasticities obtained from fexible functional forms cost or production functions, the number of papers dealing with Constant Elasticities of Substitution (CES) production functions, generally favoured in a CGE framework, is still limited. The contribution of this paper is to estimate the substitution relationship between energy and other inputs for the United Kingdom using a new approach that allows to understand whether a nested CES production function is adequate to describe the true input-output relationship. Moreover, the approach can be used to obtain an indication on which nested structure should is the most appropriate for the data considered. Findings suggest that the analysed dataset might support a four-input nested CES production function where the energy-capital are combined in an inner nest.
R15|Approaching regional openness through measures of specialization and spatial market shares: experimentations with micro-data on enterprises|In this paper, I present the results of ongoing experimentations with micro-data data of firms in order to develop better insights into the economic specialization and openness to trade of regions. Using newly developed indicators, one based on Huff-like models and another on Marcon and Puech's M function, I explore the possibilities offered by building analyses on the basis of point data instead of the classic regional aggregations.
R15|The regionalization jhjhjhof national input-output tables: a study of South Korean regions|This paper uses survey-based data for 16 South Korean regions to refine the application of Flegg¡¦s location quotient (FLQ) and its variant, the sector-specific FLQ (SFLQ). These regions vary markedly in terms of size. Especial attention is paid to the problem of choosing appropriate values for the unknown parameter £_ in these formulae. Alternative approaches to this problem are evaluated and tested. Our paper adds to earlier research that aims to find a cost-effective way of adapting national coefficients, so as to produce a satisfactory initial set of regional input coefficients for regions where survey-based data are unavailable.
R15|Economic vulnerabilities in Italy: A network analysis using similarities in sectoral employment|This article presents an original spatial methodology based on a network analysis approach in order to identify and to track spatial similarities among economic activities as well as to analyse their interdependence. Traditionally, such interdependence is analysed using input-output matrices (IO) that track economic flows across sectors. However, models based on IO do not allow to analyse spatial interdependence. In our approach, instead, we make use of local employment patterns. In particular, using sectoral employment of 8091 Italian municipalities across 18 economic activities, our approach allows to identify spatial inter-linkages in terms of employment patterns. By comparing such local employment patterns, our methodology shows inter-linkages among activities, which are important for understanding the transmission of exogenous shocks. Our analysis highlights similarities among economic activities, and allows to identify central activities (hubs) and their relationship with each other. Moreover, simulating the spread of an exogenous shock through the economic structure allows us to identify important activities not only in economic terms but also in terms of centrality and connectivity.
R15|Treatment-Effect Identification Without Parallel paths An illustration in the case of Objective 1- Hainaut/Belgium, 1994-2006|Imagine a region that has a lower income per head than the rest of the territory, and becomes eligible for a generous EU-funded transfer programme (the treatment). The evaluation of the effectiveness of such a policy can rest on a difference-in-differences analysis (DiD); which in essence consists of comparing the income-level handicap before and after the treatment. Imagine that DiD shows that the handicap has not diminished, or even that it has risen. Most observers would conclude to the inefficiency of the policy. The point we raise in this paper is that second thoughts are needed, because DiD rests heavily on the validity of a key assumption: parallel paths in the absence of treatment. Without EU money the outcome difference between the treated and the controls should be time-invariant; so that any statistically significant change of that difference can be ascribed to the treatment. Parallel paths seems a priori unrealistic in the context of old industrial regions, as one of the reasons they become eligible for treatment is that their income-level handicap is on the rise. Also, from a methodological point of view, when more than one pre-treatment period is available in the data, the parallel-paths assumption can easily be abandoned in favour of more flexible assumptions as to the relative dynamics of treated vs. control entities. This paper illustrates the relevance this approach in the case of Objective 1-Hainaut; an EU-funded transfer policy implemented between 1994 and 2006 in Hainaut, the most economically-deprived province of Belgium; a former bastion of the country’s industrial revolution that has endured decades of decline.
R15|The displacement and attraction effects in interurban migration: An application of the input-output scheme to the case of large cities in Korea|In this paper, two migratory impact-assessment schemes are constructed within the framework of Ghoshian and Leontief input-output analysis. These schemes are designed to estimate the rural-to-urban migration-induced and the urban-to-rural migration-induced effects on interurban migration, where the former effect is termed the replacement effect, while the latter the attraction effect. The established input-output schemes are empirically applied to the 2012 data on interregional migration in Korea. The results show that an arrival of migrants to and/or a departure of residents from the 20 largest cities in Korea induce direct and indirect ripples of population flow between those cities. A combination of the displacement and the attraction effects yields a classification of cities by which the 20 largest cities are grouped into four different types.
R15|Information Value and Interregional Input-Output Structure|This paper establishes an economic theory of information value and volume that differs from Shannon’s mathematical theory of communication (Shannon, 1948). The economics of information should be recognized as an important frontier field of economics to explore the 4th industrial revolution including Internet of the things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). However, we need to construct an fundamental way to analyse information flow and stock. Because of this, the value of information goods as a non-market or market good is measured as agents’ willingness to pay (WTP) for travel and telecommunication from the overall viewpoint of transportation and telecommunication economics. And we construct an economic model for analysing the information flow between head and branch offices. This firms’ total profit is maximized by optimally imputing the amount of time which employees devote to collecting and processing internal and external information. Here, factors of production are internal and external information flows and stock information. Finally we propose information inputoutput table explaining inter-regional information flow of the sample economic model.
R15|Cuentas Ambientales del Departamento de Pando en Bolivia: Aplicación del Enfoque Insumo Producto a nivel sub-nacional|La estimación de las cuentas ambientales a nivel subnacional es importante en Bolivia, debido a la heterogénea distribución espacial de los activos ambientales en el territorio nacional, en particular para departamentos de escasa diversificación productiva, donde la extracción de recursos naturales constituye su principal base económica. El presente trabajo se concentra en el departamento de Pando en Bolivia. Aplica la metodología non-survey de regionalización de matrices insumo producto, a una clasificación adecuada de activos y recursos ambientales, para obtener el Producto Interno Bruto (PIB) ambientalmente ajustado del mencionado departamento, cuya desagregación según ingreso permite la estimación cuantitativa del aporte de la naturaleza en la generación del producto e ingreso departamental, medida a través del cálculo de la renta de los recursos naturales. Los resultados de la investigación también confirman la dependencia económica de Pando, respecto de los recursos naturales, al cuantificar su alto grado de apertura hacia mercados externos al departamento, superior al nacional y constituirse en exportador neto de recursos naturales.

R15|Regional Input-Output Matrices, an Application to Manufacturing Exports in Mexico|Based on the national Input-Output Matrix (IOM) 2012 calculated by INEGI, we use Flegg's approach to estimate four regional Input-Output Matrices (RIOMs) using Banco de México's regionalization (Northern, North-Central, Central and Southern). The RIOMs are employed to evaluate the impact on regional gross output, value added and employment resulting from a 10,000 million dollar shock on Mexican manufacturing exports. The results show that the effects on the absolute values of gross output, value added and employment in the North are clearly larger than those estimated for the other regions. Another finding is that the total effects of the regional shocks tend to concentrate in the manufacturing sector, with the highest concentration observed in the North, and the lowest in the South. We also find that indirect effects of these shocks tend to be larger in regions far from the US border.
R15|The Regional Input-Output Model: An Application to the Mexican Automotive Sector|We use the national Input-Output Matrix 2012 of INEGI and Flegg's approach to estimate four Regional Input-Output Matrices (RIOM) applying Banco de Mexico's regionalization. The RIOM are employed to evaluate the effects on gross output, value added and employment at the regional level resulting from two shocks: (a) the construction of a hypothetical automotive plant worth 1,000 million dollars; and (b) the production of 200,000 vehicles per year in that plant. The exercise reveals that: (i) the construction and the operation of the plant at full capacity have differentiated effects across regions and sectors on the studied variables, in both absolute and relative terms; (ii) the spillover effects resulting of both shocks within each region are concentrated in a limited number of sectors; and (iii) the north central region resulted to be the one receiving the largest relative benefits from both shocks.
R15|Análisis insumo-producto y la inversión pública: una aplicación para el Caribe colombiano|Este artículo busca identificar los sectores con mayor impacto intersectorial en la economía de los departamentos del Caribe colombiano, con el objetivo de ubicar actividades estratégicas para orientar la toma de decisiones de inversión pública. A través del análisis insumo-producto regional, usando los coeficientes de localización FLQ en su versión modificada y un método de extracción hipotética, se encuentra que la industria es el sector con mayor efecto multiplicador sobre el producto, empleo e ingreso. A pesar de ello, se evidencia una baja interconexión entre la mayoría de los sectores, en especial en los departamentos periféricos de la región. ***** This paper tries to identify sectors that have a greater multiplier effect on the economy in the departments located on the Caribbean region of Colombia. The purpose of this is to locate strategic sectors that can guide territorial governments’ investment-making decisions. Through regional input-output analysis, and by using the modified FLQ formula and the hypothetical extraction method, we identify that industry has the greatest impact on output, employment, and household income. However, we found low interconnection between most sectors, especially in peripheral areas of the region.
R15|Mediciones del crecimiento económico regional y local en Colombia, 1950-2017: una revisión|Resumen: El artículo contiene una revisión de las principales mediciones del PIB y otras mediciones macroeconómicas en el nivel departamental y municipal en el periodo 1950-2017. Se espera que esta revisión pueda ser de utilidad para las investigaciones sobre la economía regional y urbana de Colombia al señalar sus limitaciones metodológicas y temporales. El común denominador de las diversas mediciones, básicamente PIB departamental y de Bogotá, es su discontinuidad y el reducido número de años de estas estimaciones, exceptuando aquellas realizadas por el DANE, Planeación Departamental de Antioquia y Valle, CEGA y el autor (hasta 2011). Con la serie del PIB del DANE, y la que fue iniciada en CEGA y continuada por el autor, es posible ampliar el horizonte temporal al periodo 1975-2017 e incluso extenderlo hasta mediados del siglo XX. / Abstract : This article contains a review of the main measurements of GDP and other macroeconomic measures at the departmental and municipal level in the period 1950-2017. It aims at being useful for research on the regional and urban economics of Colombia by pointing out methodological and temporary limitations. The common denominator of the several measurements, basically of departmental and Bogota’s GDP, is the discontinuity and the reduced number of years of these estimates, except those calculated by DANE, departmental planning of Antioquia and Valle, CEGA and the author (until 2011). GDP series calculated by DANE, and those initiated by CEGA and continued by the author, can be extended to the period 1975-2017 and back further into the mid-twentieth century.

R15|University location and city development: the effects of Victoria University on the Western Melbourne economy|Does the presence of a local university affect the economic development of an area within a large city? This paper focuses on the Western region of Melbourne, which accounts for 18 per cent of the city's population of 4.5 million. Only one of Melbourne's seven universities has located campuses in Western Melbourne, a region containing many areas of social disadvantage. The importance of the University to the region's economy in 2013 is analysed with the aid of a 6-region CGE model, four of the regions covering Greater Melbourne. The analysis is undertaken by simulating a counterfactual that there was no university in the region during the period 1992 to 2013. Under the counterfactual, students who in actuality had studied in Western Melbourne in the period are assumed to have either attended a university in another Melbourne region or forgone a university education. The simulation accounted for a relocation of both the University's demand-side impacts (operating expenditures and student living costs) and its supply-side impacts (knowledge effects). A particular feature of the analysis was the estimation of the interregional relocation of local productivity effects flowing in 2013 from returns to the stocks of human capital and research knowledge accumulated over the years from 1992. For the human capital effects this involved, for each Melbourne region, undertaking detailed estimates of changes in annual university completions, annual migration rates, labour force participation rates, interregional commuting and returns to university qualifications. Key assumptions related to the effects of university proximity on tertiary participation and of place of study on regional attachment. For local R&D effects, regional estimates were made of annual R&D expenditure, knowledge decay, returns to R&D expenditure and regional knowledge spillovers. The simulation results suggested that the presence of a university in Western Melbourne had a significant effect on the region's GDP, but due to interregional commuting the local university had a more muted effect on the real consumption of the region's households.
R15|The relevance of inter-regional trade data produced by the 2012 Commodity Flow Survey for multi-regional CGE modelling|The objective of this study is to assess the suitability of Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) data released by the US Census Bureau as a check on the estimates of inter-regional trade generated in creating the USAGE-TERM master database. A close inspection of the Census Bureau's CFS data indicate that they record movements to and from transport nodes. In some cases, transport nodes may align with production origins and final use destinations. In other cases, nodes appear to be intermediate points rather than origins or final destinations. This implies that CFS data are often incompatible with the trade flows in a CGE database. Merchandise, that is primary and manufacturing commodities, account for no more than 15% of GDP in the U.S. economy. Therefore, even comprehensive merchandise trade flow data would have limited use in a CGE database. The usefulness of the CFS data is diminished further by its concentration on bulky goods, which account for a small fraction of total trade flows. Bulky trade flows may account for a substantial proportion of the volume of trade but make a small contribution to total economic activity. Mining products excluding oil and gas account for 50.9% of the recorded weight in the survey, but just 3.9% of the value of trades – and only 0.3% of GDP. The CFS data might be useful for examining transport logistics but are of little use in CGE database preparation. There is no evidence that the CFS data supersedes the Horridge gravity method of allocating inter-regional trades. However, CFS data point to the desirability of noting the difference between transport in the Mississippi basin and elsewhere. The basin relies heavily on water transport for moving agricultural, mining and fuel products.
R15|Where Is the Consumer Center of St. Petersburg?|In an urban economy, the distribution of people and real estate prices depends on the location of the central business district of a city. As distance from the city center increases, both prices and population density diminish, for travel costs increase in terms of time and money. As manufacturing gradually leaves the cities, the importance of consumer amenities as attractors of population to the urban areas increases. The role of a business center is being replaced by the consumer center. In this paper, we identify the location of the consumer center of St. Petersburg - the second largest city in Russia and its former capital. For this purpose using the data from open sources in the Internet regarding the location of many different types of urban amenities, the indices of their spatial density are computed. Using the weights based on coefficients of spatial variation and survey-based weights, the individual indices are aggregated to two general centrality indices. Their unique maxima correspond to the city center of St. Petersburg, which is located on Nevsky prospekt, between Fontanka river and Liteinyi prospekt.
R15|The Displacement Effect of Convenience: The Case of Recycling|In light of increasingly ambitious recycling targets it is important to analyse the potential displacement effect of improving access to kerbside provision on other forms of recycling. Do households view the different modes of recycling as substitutes or complements of each other? Does this perceived relationship depend on the type of material recycled? Using data for all of the UK's local governments from 2004Q2 to 2013Q3 we analyse the nature of the relationship between the two main channels of recycling. In the case of dry recycling, the empirical findings are ambiguous on the trade­off between kerbside and non-kerbside recycling. On the one hand, the findings suggest that there is no trade-off when considering the effect of expanding kerbside provision. On the other hand, the findings also suggest that there is a trade-off when we focus on the effect of expanding non­kerbside provision. However, putting together the empirical findings with theory (in particular, the symmetry property of the Hicksian substitution effect) suggests that there is a trade-off irrespective of whether we consider expansion of kerbside or non-kerbside provision. In the case of green (compost) recycling the empirical findings on their own or together with theory unambiguously suggest that there is a trade-off.
R15|QML estimation of spatial dynamic panel data models with endogenous time varying spatial weights matrices|In spatial panel data models, when a spatial weights matrix is constructed from economic or social distance, spatial weights could be endogenous and also time varying. This paper presents model specification and proposes QMLE estimation of spatial dynamic panel data models with endogenous time varying spatial weights matrices. Asymptotic properties of the proposed QMLE are rigorously established. We extend the notion of spatial near-epoch dependence to allow time dependence. By using spatial-time LLN for near-epoch dependence process and CLT for martingale difference sequence, we establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of QMLE. Monte Carlo experiments show that the proposed estimators have satisfactory finite sample performance.
R15|Interregional carbon emission spillover–feedback effects in China|A three-region input–output model was applied in this study to analyze the emission spillover–feedback effects across the eastern, middle, and western regions of China. Results revealed that the interregional trade has important spillover effects (SEs) on the emissions of each region, particularly in the middle and western regions, but the feedback effects are few. Although the eastern regional final demands have a smaller economic SE per unit than those of the middle and western regions in 2002–2010, its emission SE gradually exceeded that of the two other regions. The interregional trade policy has to be enforced in the future, but the emission SEs should be controlled efficiently. Therefore, the central government should continue to implement the policies on the reduction of energy and carbon intensities from the past decade, limit coal consumption, and encourage renewable fuel development. At the same time, the central government and the eastern region can help the middle and western regions control their carbon intensity by providing fiscal, technological, and training assistance. The middle and western regions should set strict admittance standards for energy-intensive plants that transferred from the eastern region.
R15|Input-output and structural decomposition analysis of Singapore's carbon emissions|Singapore is an island city-state. It lacks conventional energy resources and is alternative energy disadvantaged. In the past decade (2000–2010), its energy-related carbon emissions increased from 37.8 to 44.4 million tonnes of CO2. This paper analyses the city state's carbon emissions from the demand perspective using the input-output (I-O) method and investigate the drivers of emission changes using structural decomposition analysis (SDA). It is the first comprehensive analysis of Singapore's emissions using the I-O framework. The results obtained show that exports accounted for nearly two-thirds of its total emissions and growth in its emissions in the last decade was largely export-driven. Emissions increased as export-oriented industries and export volume expanded. Fuel switching and energy efficiency, however, helped to lower growth in emissions. Besides exports, household-related emissions accounted for about a quarter of Singapore's total emissions. The emissions related to different household groups remained fairly stable as increases in embodied (indirect) emissions were offset by decreases in direct emissions. The high-income household group registered the largest increase in direct emissions, while the middle-income household group registered the largest increase in embodied emissions. The policy implications of our findings are discussed.
R15|The economic impact of supply chain disruptions from the Great East-Japan earthquake|The Great East-Japan Earthquake of March 11th, 2011 had a serious negative economic impact on the Japanese economy. The earthquake substantially reduced production not only in regions directly hit by the earthquake but also in other parts of Japan through supply chain disruptions. We examine the economic impact of the supply chain disruptions immediately following the earthquake using a unique interregional input-output table combining two different regional IO tables, the JIP database, and other regional statistics. To conduct our analysis, we modify the forward linkage methodology to take into account the bottleneck effect in the intermediate input of manufacturing production. Our estimates show that the production losses caused by the supply chain disruptions would amount to at least 0.35% of the country’s GDP. We also analyzed how establishing multiple supply chains would work to mitigate the damage of potential natural disasters in the future. However, as multiple supply chains may lose production efficiency at the firm level, we would require policies that provide incentives to firms that diversify supply chains.
R15|Co‐inventor networks and knowledge production in specialized and diversified cities|Research on the US urban system has shown that metropolitan regions with more local and non‐local network ties outperform cities where economic agents are isolated. Yet, little attention is given to the character of the local knowledge base and how that influences network structure. We show that co‐inventor networks differ between cities that produce specialized and diversified knowledge. Models of tie‐formation show inventors in specialized cities value spatial proximity less and cognitive proximity more than inventors in diversified cities as they partner with non‐local inventors. These findings suggest that the influence of social networks on knowledge production is conditioned by the architecture of the local knowledge base. La investigación sobre el sistema urbano de los EE.UU. ha demostrado que el desempeño de las regiones metropolitanas con una mayor concentración de vínculos de redes locales y no locales supera al de las ciudades donde los agentes económicos están aislados. Sin embargo, se presta poca atención al carácter de la base de conocimiento local y a la forma en que esto influye en la estructura de la red. Se demuestra que las redes de co‐inventores difieren entre las ciudades que producen conocimientos especializados y diversificados. Los modelos de formación de vínculos muestran que los inventores de las ciudades especializadas valoran menos la proximidad espacial que la proximidad cognitiva en comparación con los inventores de ciudades diversificadas, a la hora de asociarse con inventores no locales. Estos hallazgos sugieren que la influencia de las redes sociales en la producción de conocimiento está condicionada por la arquitectura de la base de conocimiento local. 米国の都市システムに関する研究により、地域的と非地域的なネットワークの結合を持つ大都市の地域が、経済主体が孤立している都市よりも優れていることが示されている。しかしながら、地域のナレッジベースの特性と、それがネットワークの構造にどのように影響するかについては、ほとんど関心が向けられていない。本稿では、共同発明者のネットワークは、専門的および多様な知識を生み出す都市によって異なることを明らかにする。ネットワークの結合形成のモデルから、専門的都市における発明者は、地元以外の発明者と提携するため、多様な都市における発明者ほどには空間的近接性に価値を認めておらず、また多様な都市における発明者よりも認知的近接性に価値を認めていることが示された。これらの知見から、知識生産に対する社会的ネットワークの影響は、地域のナレッジベースの構造によって条件づけられることが示唆される。
R15|¿El comercio lleva a la convergencia? Un análisis del efecto del TLCAN sobre la convergencia local en México|Background: Regional Economics and Economic Growth focus on the question of whether trade leads to a greater concentration of economic activity. Nevertheless, little empirical work has assessed the impact of trade on regional convergence. Therefore, this paper studies the regional convergence that has occurred in Mexico since NAFTA came into effect. Unlike previous papers, working with municipal-level data allows us to both observe the convergence patterns across space more clearly and to identify the effect of NAFTA. Methods: A conditional ß -convergence model and conditional club ß -convergence model were performed. However, in contrast to previous empirical studies, we use municipal panel data to identify more clearly the relationship between trade and regional convergence, and include the 2009 economic census to observe whether, after fifteen years of NAFTA, the economy has decentralized away from Mexico City to the US border regions. Results: The result shows that after NAFTA came into effect, the convergence in regions near the US border grew faster than it did in those further from it. However, there is a significant reduction in the ß coefficient after NAFTA, indicating a slowdown in the rate of convergence. Furthermore, we find that rather than becoming integrated into world markets, municipalities in the south have instead lagged behind their counterparts since the signing of NAFTA. Conclusions: Even though centrifugal forces are starting to function, there is a significant reduction in the ß coefficient after NAFTA came into effect. This suggests that better policies will be needed in order to control the increase in regional disparities.// Antecedentes: La economía regional y el crecimiento económico se enfocan en la pregunta de si el comercio conlleva a una mayor concentración de la actividad económica. No obstante, pocos trabajos empíricos han evaluado los impactos del comercio en la convergencia regional. Por lo tanto, este trabajo estudia la convergencia derivada del comercio de México después del Tratado de Libre Comercio de América Norte (TLCAN). A diferencia de trabajos previos, los datos a nivel municipal permiten observar mejor los patrones de convergencia en el espacio e identificar el efecto del TLCAN. Métodos: Se diseñaron un modelo de convergencia ß condicional y un modelo de convergencia ß condicional de clubes. Sin embargo, a diferencia de estudios empíricos anteriores, se utilizan datos municipales de panel para identificar con mayor claridad la relación entre el comercio y la convergencia regional, además se incluyen datos de los censos económicos de 2009 para observar si, después de 15 años de la entrada en vigor del TLCAN, la actividad económica se ha descentralizado y se ha trasladado de la Ciudad de México a las regiones fronterizas con los Estados Unidos. Resultados: Los resultados muestran que, después de la implementación del TLCAN, la convergencia entre regiones cercanas a la frontera con los Estados Unidos creció más rápidamente que en aquéllas cuya posición geográfica es más lejana. Sin embargo, hay una reducción significativa de los coeficientes ß después del TLCAN, lo que indica una ralentización de la tasa de convergencia. Asimismo, se halla que los municipios del sur no se han integrado a los mercados del mundo; por el contrario, se han quedado rezagados con respecto a sus contrapartes después de la implementación del TLCAN. Conclusiones: A pesar de que las fuerzas centrífugas están empezando a funcionar, hay una reducción significativa del coeficiente ß después de la entrada en vigor del TLCAN. Esto indica que se necesitan mejores políticas para controlar el aumento de las disparidades regionales.
R15|Der Einsatz von MRIO zur Berechnung der Fußabdrücke von Nationen – eine Anwendung der EXIOBASE-Datenbank|Ein Treibhausgas(THG)-Fußabdruck ist ein Maß für die Gesamtmenge an THG-Emissionen. Er erfasst die direkt und indirekt durch eine Aktivität verursachten THG-Emissionen oder die sich über die Lebensdauer eines Produktes akkumulierten THG-Emissionen. Es werden die durch Konsum von Gütern und Dienstleistungen verursachten Emissionen durch private Haushalte, den Staat und andere Endnachfrager berücksichtigt. Durch eine zunehmende internationale Verflechtung der Produktion werden auch die den international gehandelten Gütern und Dienstleistungen zurechenbaren Emissionen erfasst. Der Fußabdruck eines Landes ergibt sich somit aus der Summe der durch Konsum und Investitionen verursachten Emissionen im In- und Ausland. Fußabdrücke unterscheiden sich damit von der territorial abgegrenzten Sichtweise auf die Emissionen der internationalen THG-Berichterstattung. Dieses Paper gibt zunächst eine kurze Einführung in die Systematik der Input-Output-Tabellen und die Input-Output-Analyse. Anschließend wird ein Überblick über die aktuell in der Wissenschaft eingesetzten multiregionalen Input-Output-Modelle (MRIO) gegeben. Es wird die Theorie der Berechnung von Fußabdrücken erläutert und mit dem EXIOBASE-Datensatz ein THG-Fußabdruck für Deutschland berechnet.
R15|The gravity model, global value chain and the brazilian states|"The WTO and the OECD along with many other organizations, suggest trade in value-added is a “better” measuring system than gross value in order to better understand the impact of trade on employment, growth and production . When it comes to the ""domestic"" value chain and internal specializations, internal trade statistics are rarely available. In this work we use a gravity model based on the estimation of exports of the Brazilian states, considered as trade entities, both in traditional terms of gross value and in terms of value-added. Our method is based on an Input-Output table for 2008. The results of the bilateral gravity model for the Brazilian states' exports show that the main determinants (GDP, distance etc.) are fairly similar when exports are estimated in gross or value-added terms. _________________________________ L'OMC et l'OCDE ainsi que de nombreuses organisations internationales, suggèrent que l’évaluation du commerce en valeur ajoutée est «meilleure» que celle en valeur brute car elle permet de mieux saisir l'impact du commerce sur l'emploi, la croissance et la production. Quand il s’agit de la chaîne de valeur ""domestique"" les statistiques commerciales internes sont rarement disponibles. Dans ce travail, nous utilisons un modèle de gravité qui estime les exportations des États brésiliens, considérés comme des entités commerciales, à la fois en termes traditionnels de valeur brute et en termes de valeur ajoutée. Notre méthode est basée sur une table d'entrées-sorties pour 2008. Les résultats du modèle de gravité pour les exportations des États brésiliens montrent que les principaux déterminants du commerce (PIB, distance, etc.) ont des élasticités similaires lorsque les exportations sont estimées en valeur brute ou en valeur ajoutée."
R15|The Analysis of Regional Disparities in Romania with Gini/Struck Coefficients of Concentration|A key objective of regional development policy is to reduce disparities between regions and to ensure a relatively balanced level of development. To achieve this goal studies and social and economic analysis based on certain techniques and methods of evaluation are necessary. In scientific literature, there are plenty of models that can be applied to assess regional disparities. One of the methods commonly used in practice is related to the calculation and analysis of the degree of concentration/diversification of activities within a region. The increase or decrease in the degree of concentration of certain activities or areas of activity in a region provides information on: - the level of overall economic development; - economic development and growth rate; - the specific features of the region, the potential, local traditions, etc. The expert analysis indicate that, in a high level of overall development or a sustained economic growth rate, there are favorable conditions for economic activities to locate in any region, so they are relatively uniformly distributed throughout the country.Knowing the degree of concentration and also the influence factors are useful in making decisions and setting regional policy measures.This article proposes a synthetic analysis of the development level of regions in Romania with the concentration/diversification model (Gini/Struck coefficients), based on the existing key statistical indicators.
R15|Modelling the attraction of shopping centres|Development of major shopping centres continues even though online shopping is increasing. This has implications for mode and destination choice for shopping travel and therefore also for sustainability. In this paper, we estimate models for shopping travel using an unusually rich data set of shopping attractions. We find that shopping travel is best represented in three separate models: consumables in short and long-activity segments and durables. In all of these models, we show that representing nearby attractions outside the destination zone adds to the measured attraction. For both consumables segments, the addition of secondary attractions within 2 km of the main destination adds very significantly to the explanation given by the model, but attractions within 5 km do not add anything. For durables, both 2 km and 5 km added to the model, but 2 km was slightly better. Furthermore, we find significant within-zone correlation in all three models, but are unable to find significant between-zone correlation, indicating that zone boundaries have some behavioural meaning for shopping travellers, but larger areas are not viewed in this way. Shopping attractions with a specifically Swedish impact, Systembolaget (official alcohol outlet in Sweden) and IKEA, proved to be important in all the models. These attractors work better as part of the size than as part of the utility, indicating that they appear to be separate attractors of trips, rather than as adding to the utility of other attractors.
R15|Finding the Consumer Center of St. Petersburg?|In the urban economics, the distribution of people and real estate prices depends on the location of the central business district. As distance from the city center increases, both prices and population density diminish, for travel costs increase in terms of time and money. As manufacturing gradually leaves the cities, the importance of consumer amenities as attractors of population to the urban areas increases. The role of the business center is being taken over by the consumer center. This paper identies the location of the consumer center of St. Petersburg - the second largest city in Russia and its former capital. For this purpose using data from open sources on the Internet regarding the location of dierent types of urban amenities, the indices of their spatial density are computed. Using weights based on coefficients of spatial variation and surveys, the individual indices are aggregated to two general centrality indices. Their unique maxima correspond to the city center of St. Petersburg, which is located on Nevsky prospekt, between Fontanka river and Liteinyi prospekt.
R15|European R&D networks: a snapshot from the 7th EU Framework Programme| Recent empirical studies have investigated the territorial impact of Europe’s research policies, in particular the contribution of the European Framework Programmes to the integration of a European Research Area. This paper deepens the analysis on the integration and participation of peripheral regions, by focusing on the differences in intensity and determinants of inter-regional collaborations across three groups of collaborations. We consider collaborations among more developed regions, between more and less developed regions, and among less developed regions. Building on the recent spatial interaction literature, this paper investigates the effects of physical, institutional, social and technological proximity on the intensity of inter-regional research collaboration across heterogenous European regions. We find that the impact of disparities in human capital and technological proximity on regional R&D cooperation is relevant and differs across subgroups of collaborations. Moreover, despite the efforts of integrating marginal actors, peripheral regions have lower rates of collaborations.
R15|Firm market valuation and intellectual property assets|This paper investigates the relationship between the innovative activity of the top corporate R&D investors worldwide and their valuation on the financial markets. The empirical analysis is based on a sample of more than 1,500 top publicly listed Multinational Corporations (MNCs) performing a considerable share of the business investment in R&D worldwide. The main dataset covers their intellectual properties, patents and trademarks, filed between 2005 and 2012. The paper extends upon the recent literature on the links between IP assets and the firms’ financial valuation. It assesses the potential premium resulting from the interactive use of different IPRs. More importantly, it differentiates the extent to which IPRs confer a market premium to companies with respect to their industrial competitors from the extent to which within-company variations hold the key to a market premium. Finally confirming the relevance of corporate mixes of IP assets, important industrial specificities are found in the premiums granted to both individual and two-ways strategies.
R15|Local determinants of the spatial distribution of exporters in Poland: the role of FDI|In the light of the hereto insufficient empirical evidence on the determinants of location of exporters and given the access to a unique GIS-based database for counties in Poland (LAU 1) on the distances to diverse points of interest (POIs) and infrastructure endowment, and data on regional heterogeneity, we investigate the deep determinants of exporters’ location in Poland. Our analysis is mostly driven by the concepts of NEG theory and the firms’ heterogeneity concept. With the use of econometric modelling, in the first step, we identify the determinants of regional location of exporting firms. In the second step, we try to identify the differences in the locational decisions of firms distinguished by ownership form, namely domestic and foreign-owned exporters. Our findings indicate the more predictable behaviour of foreign-owned exporters, for which the quality of transport endowment and inputs plays a more significant role in the decision in comparison to indigenous exporters, affected to a larger extent by deep-rooted factors and path-dependency. The locational preferences of FOEs are more influenced by the proximity to the airport and the motorways as well as subject to agglomeration externalities. The results point furthermore to the significance of accessibility to markets as evidenced by the role of infrastructure endowment and the role of the greater regional human capital endowment.
R15|Evaluating local government performance in times of crisis|In the recent years of international economic crisis, Spanish local governments have come under increasing pressure to accommodate severe economic restrictions while maintaining (or even increasing) their provision of local public services. This paper aims to analyse overall cost efficiency in Spanish local governments during the period of the economic crisis (2008–2013) which has scarcely been examined to date. To this end, we measure efficiency, for which we consider four different non-parametric methodologies. Moreover, given how problematic it is to precisely define the bundle of services and facilities that municipalities must provide, we compare three different output models in which we consider measures of quantity as well as quality. Our results suggest that Spanish local government efficiency improved over the crisis period 2008–2013 since budget expenditures (inputs or costs) fell while local public services and facilities (outputs) were maintained. We also find evidence of the possible implications of service quality when measuring local governments’ cost efficiency, and of structural differences in the average efficiency between municipalities located in different Spanish regions and provinces. Finally, our results confirm that the level and variation of efficiency scores are affected by the approach taken.
R15|Which estimator to measure local governments’ cost efficiency? An application to Spanish municipalities|We analyse overall cost efficiency in Spanish local governments during the crisis period (2008–2013). To this end, we first consider some of the most popular methods to evaluate local government efficiency, DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) and FDH (Free Disposal Hull), as well as recent proposals, namely the order-m partial frontier and the non-parametric estimator proposed by Kneip, Simar and Wilson (2008), which are also non-parametric approaches. Second, we compare the methodologies used to measure efficiency. In contrast to previous literature, which has regularly compared techniques and made proposals for alternative methodologies, we follow recent proposals (Badunenko et al., 2012) with the aim of comparing the four methods and choosing the one which performs best with our particular dataset, that is, the most appropriate method for measuring local government cost efficiency in Spain. We carry out the experiment via Monte Carlo simulations and discuss the relative performance of the efficiency scores under various scenarios. Our results suggest that there is no one approach suitable for all efficiency analysis. We find that for our sample of 1,574 Spanish local governments, the average cost efficiency would have been between 0.54 and 0.77 during the period 2008–2013, suggesting that Spanish local governments could have achieved the same level of local outputs with about 23% to 36% fewer resources.

R15|Lifelong Learning and Employability in the Danube Region Countries: Influences and Correlations|A continuous challenge for education and lifelong learning is to assist individuals in acquiring skills and knowledge for successful work life, especially after the financial crisis which influenced negatively the employment growth in all European Union countries. The paper focuses on finding correlations between employability and lifelong learning in the Danube Region countries of the European Union and more explicitly in the ex-communist ones of this region. As research instruments, two online questionnaires were built based on a thorough literature review and a set of structured interviews and filled in by 390 IT students and 55 IT professors. The surveys’ results revealed a clear positive correlation between the level of education and the opinion about the importance of obtaining a job as a result of the educational endeavors. A special attention in the survey was given to social networks, which were acknowledged as modern facilitators of lifelong learning activities. The conclusions of the current study are particularly important in the Romanian context, as the employment rate of recent graduates is in a decreasing trend, but also for all the Danube Region ex-communist countries, which have to boost their employment rates as well, to assure their economical growth. Identification of factors stimulating employment of young people according with their education contributes at the sustainable economic growth of these countries, at the growth of graduates insertion in the labor market and at the diminution of labor migration.
R15|Analysing the economy-wide impact of the supply chains activated by a new biomass power plant. The case of cardoon in Sardinia| This study investigates the impact on the economy of Sardinia (Italy) generated by a new biomass power plant fed by locally cultivated cardoon. The cardoon also serves the production of biopolymers. The impact is assessed at an economy-wide level using two multiregional closed Input-Output models, which allow us to take into account the entire supply chain activated and the supra-local effects generated by trade across local industries. The effects are computed under alternative scenarios simulating different levels of substitution of existing agricultural activities with the new activity (cardoon). Results show positive and locally significant impacts in terms of value added and employment. However, these impacts are substantially influenced by the degree of substitution. Results also suggest that there are specific territorial areas that are more sensitive to negative effects induced by substitution.
R15|A Framework for Estimating the Linked Economic Contribution of Cotton Production, Ginning, Oilseed Milling, and Warehousing| This poster presents a framework and templates for estimating the economic contribution of the cotton industry, including production, ginning, oilseed milling, and warehousing. The IMPLAN default cotton sector is modified to represent regional production functions using Extension crop budgets. Ginning, cottonseed milling, and warehousing include backward linkages to cotton production that can result in double-counting expenditures. Furthermore, they are sub-industries within broader IMPLAN sectors that contain other important components of the Texas and agricultural economies, so they should not be exclusively modified to fit specific cotton tasks. We survey gins, cottonseed mills, and warehouses in two Texas regions to modify those IMPLAN expenditure patterns. Because ginning is actually a backward link in IMPLAN, a portion of IMPLAN sector 19 expenditures are subtracted. Then analysis-by-parts is used to estimate the ginning, cottonseed milling, and warehousing contributions under both cooperative and corporate ownership. Economists can easily use the developed templates (1) to modify production functions to represent their region and (2) to estimate the economic contributions of the linked industry and its individual components without double-counting inputs and distorting other aspects of the ag support services, oilseed milling, and warehousing sectors.
R15|Tracing Brazilian regions? CO2 emissions in domestic and global trade|The current Brazilian position on climate change has been formalized with the law of National Climate Change Policy (PNMC, in Portuguese), established in December 2009, which provides a legal framework for national actions aimed at mitigation and adaptation. Within PNMC, the country has defined its national voluntary reduction targets for greenhouse gases emissions, with reductions between 36.1% and 38.9% of projected emissions by 2020. The distribution of the corresponding mitigation efforts by regions is of great concern in a large country like Brazil, with substantial regional variation in economic development, physical geography, production system, and energy consumption. In fact, most of Brazilian states have established public policies on climate change. Out of the 27 states, three have mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions: SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, in the most developed Southeast region; Mato Grosso do Sul, in the Central-West region; as well as ParaÃ­ba, in the Northeast region. In this context, questions raised in the literature on global climate change, such as the environmental responsibility for emissions embodied in trade, also apply at the regional level, and perhaps even to a larger extent. In order to analyze at regional level the current relationship between Brazil?s CO2 emissions and domestic and global value chains, in this study we adopt a new framework that combines a world input-output table (WIOT) with an inter-regional input-output table (IRIOT). In our approach, we have chosen not to take one of the datasets (say the WIOT) as a starting point and adapt the other dataset (i.e. the IRIOT) accordingly, instead we construct input coefficients for which both datasets are used. For the empirical application, we use the WIOT for 2008 that was constructed in the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) project. It is a full inter-country input-output table covering 40 countries and the rest of the world as a 41st country. Our IRIOT for 2008 covers the 27 Brazilian states. Both the WIOT and the IRIOT were aggregated to 28 compatible industries. Also, a new database is compiled on Brazilian states? energy use (by fuel) and related CO2 emissions at sectoral level, based on states? official energy balances and estimates of national greenhouses gases emissions for 2008 from Brazil?s Ministry of Science and Technology. We are able to evaluate the CO2 emissions in each of the 27 Brazilian states, considering their respective intra-regional productive structure, energy use, as well as their trade with other states or foreign countries. In this way, our results reveal how CO2 emissions are produced in Brazilian regions by means of domestic and global value chains.
R15|“Innovation, heterogeneous firms, and the region”|This paper investigates the role of regional determinants on innovation performance controlling by the firm’s absorptive capacity and other sources of firm heterogeneity. The findings for a sample of firms in Spain support the hypothesis that regional determinants matter, though their role is subtler than the one frequently assumed. Rather than a direct influence on firm’s innovation, the regional context moderates the effect of internal determinants. In the case of product innovation the most important mechanism of interaction seems to be operating through cooperation in innovation, whereas for process innovation it seems to be through highly skilled labour.
R15|An Empirical Analysis of UK House Price Risk Variation by Property Type|This paper examines the different risk and return profiles of four different property types in England and Wales, both nationally and by region. The property types include flats, terraced houses, semi-detached and detached houses. Motivated by the ICAPM approach of Scruggs (1998) and using an EGARCH in mean model, we find evidence of a positive risk-return relationship, with particular regard to terraced and semi-detached housing, as well as asymmetric adjustment, suggesting that mid-range housing is the property type most like other risk-based assets, which could be due to these property types being the most popular with buy-to-let investors. We also find that this relationship differs across property types, as has previously been found across regions.

Se realiza para los años 2004 y 2012, períodos para los cuales existe una base de datos en formato insumo producto configurada durante el proceso de creación y posterior actualización del modelo multirregional ceer. Se utilizan dos metodologías: los indicadores obtenidos de la matriz inversa de Leontief y los indicadores de encadenamiento puro propuestos por Sonis et al. (1995). Los principales hallazgos del trabajo son 1) las regiones desarrolladas de Colombia muestran altos encadenamientos intrarregionales e interregionales hacia adelante, derivados de la matriz inversa de Leontief; 2) los sectores de industria y servicios, a pesar de haber perdido importancia, se mantienen como los de mayores encadenamientos productivos; 3) construcción y administración pública fueron los sectores de mayores incrementos; y 4) en el agregado, los encadenamientos departamentales no sufrieron cambios significativos.

This methodology is applied to the Colombian economy, identified in seven sectors and 25 regions for 2004 and 2012. Two sets of information are used, which are estimated during the elaboration for both years of the CEER model, a multi-regional model of computable general equilibrium. It is found that, although there are many differences in the results across regions and sectors, the most important factor of change during the period was the increase in the final demand.

R15|The Great Collapse in Value Added Trade|This paper studies the great collapse in value added trade using a structural decomposition analysis. We show that changes in vertical specialisation accounted for almost half of the great trade collapse, while the previous literature on gross trade has mainly focused on final expenditure, inventory adjustment and adverse credit supply conditions. The decline in international production sharing during the crisis may partially account for the observed decrease in global trade elasticities in recent years. Second, we find that the drop in the overall level of demand accounted for roughly a quarter of the decline in value added exports while just under one third was due to compositional changes in final demand. Finally, we demonstrate that the dichotomy between services and manufacturing sectors observed in gross exports during the great trade collapse is not apparent in value added trade data.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
R15|Accounting for the Differences Between Gross and Value Added Trade Balances|One of the main stylised facts that has emerged from the recent literature on global value chains is that bilateral trade imbalances in gross terms can differ substantially from those measured in value added terms. However, the factors underlying the extent and sign of the differences between the two measures have so far not been investigated. Here, we propose a novel decomposition of bilateral gross trade balances that accounts for the differences between gross and value added concepts. The bilateral analysis contributes conceptually to the literature on double counting in trade by identifying the trade flow in which value added is actually recorded for the first time in international trade statistics. We apply our decomposition framework to the development of intra-EU27 trade balances from 1995 to 2011 and show that a growing share of intra-EU bilateral trade balances is due to demand in countries other than the two direct trading partners. The latter accounted for 25% of the total variance of intra-EU gross bilateral trade balances in 2011, which marks a considerable rise from 3% in 1995. A structural decomposition analysis indicates that this evolution was especially due to the rising importance of international production sharing.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
R15|Distribution Free Estimation of Spatial Autoregressive Binary Choice Panel Data Models|This paper proposes a semiparametric estimator for spatial autoregressive (SAR) binary choice models in the context of panel data with fixed effects. The estimation procedure is based on the observational equivalence between distribution free models with a conditional median restriction and parametric models (such as Logit/Probit) exhibiting (multiplicative) heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation. Without imposing any parametric structure on the error terms, we consider the semiparametric nonlinear least squares (NLLS) estimator for this model and analyze its asymptotic properties under spatial near-epoch dependence. The main advantage of our method over the existing estimators is that it consistently estimates choice probabilities. The finite-dimensional estimator is shown to be consistent and root-n asymptotically normal under some reasonable conditions. Finally, a Monte Carlo study indicates that the estimator performs quite well in finite samples.
R15|A Spatial Knowledge Production Function Approach for the Regions of the Russian Federation|At the core of every national innovation system two concepts are of central importance: The generation and the diffusion of innovations and ergo knowledge; on the one hand inside the system itself and on the other across the system's borders. The present study picks up on the aspect of knowledge generation in the context of the Russian Federation. An extended knowledge production function is estimated on the basis of Russian regional data and it is shown that the Russian NIS, nationally as well as internationally, is functional, however, not all channels of knowledge transfer work as efficiently as those in comparable Western European countries.
R15|Matrizes de distâncias entre os distritos municipais no Brasil: um procedimento metodológico|The aim of this technical work is to describe a simple procedure to calculate the distances between the 5565 municipal districts in Brazil. Two types of distance matrices were computed: i) one from the shortest path problem on the multimodal transport network in 2010; ii) another, Euclidean, by geographic coordinates. These matrices, 5565 x 5565, provide relevant information that may potentially be used to develop future academic studies and applied models (eg, degrees of accessibility for several economic activities, regional agglomerations, developing of computable general equilibrium model, among others). Therefore, the main purpose of the development of these matrices is to build a database that can be used by applied studies.
R15|¿Existe un mejor desarrollo local en los municipios con clúster?: el caso del estado de São Paulo en Brasil|Este artículo analiza la contribución de los clústeres para el desarrollo local. Se analiza el caso de los Arreglos Productivos Locales (APL) en los municipios no metropolitanos del estado de São Paulo (Brasil). Mediante la técnica de descomposición de efectos de Oaxaca Blinder se examina si existe una brecha de desarrollo local o “mejor calidad de vida” en los municipios con APL respecto de aquellos donde no hay. Los resultados obtenidos corroboran que los municipios con APL presentan mejores niveles de desarrollo que aquellos sin APL. Sin embargo, tal diferencia responde a las características demográficas y económicas de los municipios con APL, más que a factores inobservables.

Este trabajo estima los impactos económicos de los planes parciales de renovación urbana (PPRU), su efecto en la distribución de ingresos y los impactos en el nivel de empleo a partir de la matriz de contabilidad social (SAM) para el 2010. Los resultados muestran que por cada $ 1 destinado a los planes, se generarían $ 2,1 del total del valor de la producción intermedia. Este efecto generaría cerca de 12.000 nuevos empleos. El valor agregado de la economía aumentaría en $ 592.662 millones; es decir, que por cada $ 1 invertido, $ 1,14 se destinarían a remuneración a los factores. Los ingresos de los hogares aumentarían en $ 465.760 millones, con un incremento mayor en los hogares de ingreso medio y bajo.

R15|Matriz insumo-producto interregional para Colombia, 2012|Este documento presenta un breve resumen de los principales aspectos asociados a la construcción de una matriz de insumo-producto interregional para Colombia. Como parte de un proyecto en curso que tiene como objetivo actualizar un modelo interregional de equilibrio general computable (ICGE), el modelo CEER, se construyó una base de datos bajo condiciones de información limitada. Para ello se estimó un modelo de insumo-producto interregional completamente especificado, que sirvió para la posterior calibración del modelo ICGE. Con este modelo se lleva a cabo un análisis de las participaciones intra e interregionales de los multiplicadores medios de producto. Por otra parte, también se muestran algunas cifras detalladas sobre la descomposición del producto, teniendo en cuenta la estructura de la demanda final.

Esta metodología se aplica para la economía colombiana, dividida en siete sectores y 25 regiones para los años 2004 y 2012. Se utilizó información estimada durante la elaboración del modelo CEER, un modelo de equilibrio general computable multirregional calibrado para ambos años. Se encuentra que, a pesar de la diversidad en los resultados entre regiones y sectores, el factor de cambio más importante fue el aumento generalizado en la demanda final.
R15|Análisis input-output de encadenamientos productivos y sectores clave en la economía mexicana|Este artículo busca identificar las industrias clave de la economía mexicana. Para este propósito, se aplican las siguientes metodologías basadas en el análisis input-output: a) el método Chenery-Watabane (1958) para el cálculo de encadenamientos productivos directos; b) los métodos Rasmussen (1963) para el cálculo de encadenamientos productivos totales; c) el enfoque de demanda de Leontief (1985) para cuantificar los encadenamientos hacia atrás directos y totales; d) el enfoque de oferta de Ghosh (1958, 1968) para la cuantificación de los encadenamientos hacia delante directos y totales. Finalmente, los resultados de estas aplicaciones muestran que los sectores clave de México son las industrias de bienes intermedios y bienes de capital.******This article seeks to identify the industrial sectors that are key to the Mexican economy. To this end the following methodologies are employed, all based on input-output analysis: a) the Chenery-Watabane Method (1958) for calculating direct productive linkages; b) the Rasmussen Methods (1963) for calculating total productive linkages; c) Leontief’s demand focus (1985) for the quantification of direct and total backward linkages; and d) the supply focus of Ghosh (1958, 1968) used to quantify direct and total forward linkages. Finally,
R15|Employment Generated From The Multiplier Effect Of The Spanish Paper Industry|The paper industry is really important in the production system because it is closely intertwined to many activities. Therefore, any change in its production will affect its employment and also the employment of its suppliers. In this study we analyse the effect that the Spanish paper industry exerted through the production system in terms of employment in 2005 (last year for which the last Symmetric Input-Output Table is available). In this study we use an Economic Input Output-Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) to highlight the important impact that this industry has on the employment of its direct and indirect suppliers.
R15|Forty Years Of Employment By Sector And Economic Development In 17 Spanish Regions, 1976-2016|Economic Policies of Spain, for the period 1976-2016, have allowed a great increase of employment in many regions but little advance on convergence of real wages with more advanced countries. Although Spain has experienced the highest increase in employment among the 5 major European countries, both in absolute values and in percentage, with an in increase of 40% in Spain, 11% in Germany, 23% in France, 18% in Italy and 20% in the United Kingdom, this has not been accompanied by other measures addressed to reach the desired increase of production per head and real wage, due to the lack of enough industrial real income. The analysis of production by sector is important in this regard. We analyze both the evolution of employment in Agriculture, Industry, Building and Services in 17 Spanish Regions and the evolution of real income produced by sector. While employment in Agriculture diminished during that period of forty years, there were important increases of non-agrarian employment in all the regions, with the highest increases in Madrid, Andalucia and Cataluña (with an increase higher than one million in each of these three regions) and Comunitat Valenciana (with an increase of more than 800 thousand employed people). Industrial employment diminished in several regions and there was little increase in industrial production per head. The lack of enough industrial development led to increase the foreign trade deficit per capita and made unsustainable the development of services after the crisis of year 2008. We present the estimation of employment equations for each sector, with a pool of 17 Spanish regions for the period 1987-2013, and the relationship between real income of Services and real income produced in other sectors. The main conclusion points to the convenience of increase real income per head in industry, in the majority of the regions, in order to favor sustainable development of Spanish regions.
R15|Flujos intersectoriales de conocimientos tecnológicos en países emergentes: un análisis de insumo-producto|En este trabajo se procura evaluar la producción, el uso y la difusión de tecnología en la estructura productiva de los países emergentes, en particular del Brasil, China, la Federación de Rusia y Sudáfrica, mediante el análisis de: i) usuarios y productores de tecnología; ii) contenido de investigación y desarrollo (i+d) en cada grupo de sectores, y iii) flujos de conocimientos técnicos entre esos grupos. Para alcanzar los objetivos fijados se utilizan matrices de insumo-producto combinadas con estadísticas de i+d sectoriales. Los principales resultados revelan considerables diferencias entre los países emergentes y también entre países en desarrollo y desarrollados, incluso en la jerarquía sectorial en cuanto a la producción y utilización de conocimientos tecnológicos, y en la dirección de los principales flujos de tecnología entre sectores.
R15|Intersectoral flows of technological knowledge in emerging countries: an input-output analysis|In this paper, we aim to assess the production, use and diffusion of technology in the production structure in emerging countries, such as Brazil, China, the Russian Federation and South Africa, through the analysis of: (i) users and producers of technology; (ii) research and development (R&D) content in each group of sectors, and (iii) technical knowledge flows between these groups. We use input-output matrices combined with sectoral R&D statistics to achieve our objectives. Our major findings point to significant differences among the emerging countries and also between developing and developed countries, including differences in sectoral hierarchy in terms of production and use of technological knowledge, and differences in the direction of main technological flows among sectors.
R15|China's carbon emissions embodied in (normal and processing) exports and their driving forces, 2006–2012|This paper constructed a time-series extended input–output dataset (2006–2012) to analyze China's carbon emissions embodied in both normal and processing exports at a detailed 135-sector level. The structural decomposition analysis (SDA) was further applied to shed light on the driving forces behind the changes in their embodied emissions over the entire time period. This empirical study confirms the importance of using the extended model for analyzing the trade-related embodiment, especially for processing exports. The embodied emissions in both normal and processing exports first increased from 2006 to 2008, then dropped during the global financial crisis (2008–2009), and then rose again after 2009. The embodied emissions as a percentage of total CO2 emissions were quite stable before and after the global financial crisis, at around 24% over the 2006–2008 period, and 18% over the 2010–2012 period. From 2006 to 2012, emission intensity played the key role in reducing the embodied emissions (around 595Mt CO2), while the total export effect contributed the most to the increase in embodied emissions (around 552Mt CO2). Similar analysis can be applied to other indicators, such as energy, water, GHG emissions, pollutants and materials.
R15|No blessing, no curse? On the benefits of being a resource-rich southern region of Italy|The aim of this research is to examine the aggregate economic effects of large-scale oil extraction in Basilicata, a southern region of Italy. This paper is the first empirical attempt to test for a regional resource curse by constructing a comparison unit using synthetic control techniques. The comparison unit captures how Basilicata׳s economic activities would have evolved in the absence of the oil extraction industry. The negligible differences between economic parameters in Basilicata and in its comparison unit suggest that a large amount of oil extraction has had no detectable effect on Basilicata׳s economy. A set of tentative political economy explanations of the result of missing effects is also provided, based on control rights structure, the royalty tax rate and organized crime.
R15|El proceso de convergencia regional en México: un análisis de la dinámica de transición bajo heterogeneidad estatal y temporal|En este estudio se utiliza la metodología de Phillips y Sul (2007) a fin de determinar si el PIB por persona de los Estados de México converge al sendero de crecimiento nacional y si es posible encontrar grupos o “Clubes” de regiones que tengan una senda de crecimiento común. Los resultados no validan la hipótesis de convergencia para las 32 entidades federativas de México aunque es posible encontrar clubes de convergencia. En particular, se encuentra un club de ingresos altos conformado por Aguascalientes, Campeche, Coahuila, Chihuahua, Distrito Federal, Nuevo León, Querétaro y Quintana Roo; y un club de ingresos bajos integrado por Chiapas, Guerrero, Estado de México, Nayarit, Oaxaca, Sinaloa, Tabasco, Tlaxcala y Veracruz.
R15|Análisis estructural de la economía mexicana para el año 2008|Identificar sectores productivos, capaces de impulsar la economía, es fundamental para diseñar políticas. Este trabajo analiza la estructura de la economía mexicana con modelos lineales de equilibrio general, que están basados en una matriz de contabilidad social. Primero, realizamos un análisis de sectores clave, a fin de determinar efectos directos, indirectos e inducidos, con una descomposición de multiplicadores. Luego, elaboramos un paisaje tridimensional de la economía e identificamos los multiplicadores de empleo. Finalmente, analizamos la distribución ingreso-gasto de los hogares. Entre otros resultados, los sectores más importantes resultaron ser las actividades comerciales; con menos importancia para la economía, están los sectores de la construcción, servicios de esparcimiento, electricidad, agua y gas, corporativos y minería.
R15|Una red económica norteamericana|Las estructuras económicas pueden entenderse como redes de ramas, vinculadas entre sí mediante el intercambio de bienes producidos. El modelo de Insumo-Producto analiza la interdependencia sectorial en tales estructuras. En este trabajo, identificamos una red económica en una tabla IP trilateral norteamericana. Utilizamos una medida de densidad como indicador de la integración regional. Nuestros resultados muestran que la economía de los Estados Unidos determina el perfil de la estructura de Norteamérica. Canadá y México mantienen escasas relaciones directas y su pertenencia a la región ayuda a entender sus economías.
R15|China's Capital Stock Series by Region and Sector|The lack of capital stock statistics for empirical research of the Chinese economy has for a long time been one of the major impediments in the profession. Professor Gregory Chow is one of the pioneers who attempted to deal with this matter. His seminal paper on China's capital formation and economic growth was published in 1993 (Chow, 1993). Since then many authors have estimated their own capital stock data series. However, most authors have focused on investigations at the national level and their findings are not without controversies. In particular, few studies have provided estimates of capital stock for China's regional economies. This paper adds to the existing literature in several ways. First, it presents a critical review of the methods and findings in the existing literature. Second, it proposes an alternative approach to estimate China's capital stock series by region as well as across three economic sectors (agriculture, industry and services). Finally, preliminary analyses of the derived capital stock statistics are conducted to examine growth, disparity and convergence in China's regional economies.

The Federal Planning Bureau constructed this table in 2015 in cooperation with the statistical authorities of the country's three Regions (IBSA, SVR and IWEPS). The following standard IO analyses based on applying the Leontief model to the interregional IO table are presented here: the derivation of multipliers for each region and the estimation of regional value added and regional employment generated by domestic final demand and exports.
R15|Spatial Development and Innovation in Russia|"This article is an editorial introduction to the special section of the issue ""Spatial Development and Innovation: Russian Practice"""
R15|Modeling the Development of Regional Economy and an Innovation Space Efficiency|Forming the regional space of innovation is accompanied by the simultaneous development of various structures. The contemporary model of innovative development assumes interactions between government, industry, and universities. In this paper, the set of potential links between research organizations and the innovation activity of enterprises is characterized as the innovative space and is seen as a resource for innovation. Obtaining quantitative characteristics of such links and interactions is one of the most difficult tasks in analysing innovation processes. Our hypothesis is that regional innovation depends on the size of the innovation space and on how effectively it is used. The econometric modeling results do not contradict our hypothesis. Our estimates of the size of the innovation space used by regions of Russia when creating new production technologies confirm the high potential value of this resource. Using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model that we developed, we analysed the innovative elements of regional economies (based on the example of the Republic of Bashkortostan) and quantitatively assessed the effects of different scenarios that aim to improve the socio-economic system. We included an indicator of the effective use of the innovation space for a given region as one of the agents of the CGE model production function. Our results indicate the important role of regional authorities in promoting cooperation between the state, industry, and the research and education communities as well as in developing regional innovation systems.
R15|Emissions trading schemes in Japan: their potential and possible impact|This paper examines the impact of introducing an emissions trading scheme (ETS) in Japan using an input-output model. Using demand forecast data from the Ministry of the Environment (2012), we examined the impacts of two cases: one in which emissions were reduced without introducing a scheme (the business as usual (BAU) case) and one in which a scheme was introduced (ETS case). In both cases, the aggregate repercussion effects were negative, but the negative impact was significantly greater in the ETS case (1.3 trillion JPY, which is approximately 0.14% of GDP). The negative repercussion effects are consistent with the results from MOE (2012). However, our study showed positive repercussion effects on employment regardless of employment status. This occurs because the labor absorptive capacity is low in sectors such as steel, where demand will decline due to the introduction of a scheme, so there is a small impact on employment; in contrast, sectors that benefit from the adoption of the scheme have high labor absorptive capacities. Accordingly, the adoption of an ETS in Japan would be positive for jobs but would not have a significant impact in terms of stimulating output.
R15|An Econometric Analysis Of The Demand For Tourism In Mexico, Un Analisis Econometrico De La Demanda De Turismo En Mexico|This paper aims to determine the factors affecting tourism demand of Mexico in the US market. The econometric results show the main factor affecting the demand for tourism in Mexico is the prices of the destinations countries. Similarly, it was found that the variable tourism demand of residents of the United States to Mexico have significant common cycle with variable relative wealth. This explains that in the short term wealth of Americans is a determining factor in the demand for tourism to Mexico.
R15|“Innovation, heterogeneous firms, and the region”|This paper investigates the role of regional determinants on innovation performance controlling by the firm’s absorptive capacity and other sources of firm heterogeneity. The findings for a sample of firms in Spain support the hypothesis that regional determinants matter, though their role is subtler than the one frequently assumed. Rather than a direct influence on firm’s innovation, the regional context moderates the effect of internal determinants. In the case of product innovation the most important mechanism of interaction seems to be operating through cooperation in innovation, whereas for process innovation it seems to be through highly skilled labour.
R15|A unified framework of trade in value added : physical, monetary, exchange rates, and GHG emissions|Koopman et al. (2014) developed a method to consistently decompose gross exports in value-added terms that accommodate infinite repercussions of international and inter-sector transactions. This provides a better understanding of trade in value added in global value chains than does the conventional gross exports method, which is affected by double-counting problems. However, the new framework is based on monetary input--output (IO) tables and cannot distinguish prices from quantities; thus, it is unable to consider financial adjustments through the exchange market. In this paper, we propose a framework based on a physical IO system, characterized by its linear programming equivalent that can clarify the various complexities relevant to the existing indicators and is proved to be consistent with Koopman's results when the physical decompositions are evaluated in monetary terms. While international monetary tables are typically described in current U.S. dollars, the physical framework can elucidate the impact of price adjustments through the exchange market. An iterative procedure to calculate the exchange rates is proposed, and we also show that the physical framework is also convenient for considering indicators associated with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
R15|Compilation of a regionally extended inter-country input–output table and its application to global value chain analyses|Abstract Studies on the rise of global value chains (GVCs) have attracted a great deal of interest in the recent economics literature. However, due to statistical and methodological challenges, most existing researches ignore domestic regional heterogeneity in assessing the impact of joining GVCs. GVCs are supported not only directly by domestic regions that export goods and services to the world market, but also indirectly by other domestic regions that provide parts, components, and intermediate services to final exporting regions. To better understand the nature of a country’s position and degree of participation in GVCs, we need to fully examine the role of individual domestic regions. Understanding the domestic components of GVCs is especially important for larger economies such as China, the USA, India, and Japan, where there may be large variations in economic scale, geography of manufacturing, and development stages at the domestic regional level. This paper proposes a new framework for measuring domestic linkages to global value chains. This framework measures domestic linkages by endogenously embedding a target country’s (e.g., China or Japan) domestic inter-regional input–output tables into the OECD inter-country input–output model. Using this framework, we can more clearly understand how global production is fragmented and extended internationally and domestically.
R15|Spatial spillover effects in determining China's regional CO2 emissions growth: 2007–2010|This study proposes an alternative input–output based spatial structural decomposition analysis to elucidate the importance of domestic regional heterogeneity and inter-regional spillover effects in determining China's regional CO2 emissions growth. Our empirical results, based on the 2007 and 2010 Chinese inter-regional input–output tables, show that changes in most regions' final demand scale, final expenditure structure, and export scale have positive spatial spillover effects on other regions' CO2 emissions growth; changes in most regions' consumption and export preference help reduce other regions' CO2 emissions; changes in production technology and investment preferences may exert positive or negative effects on other region's CO2 emissions growth through domestic supply chains. For some regions, the aggregate spillover effect from other regions may be larger than the intra-regional effect in determining regional emissions growth. All these facts can significantly help provide a better, deeper understanding of the driving forces behind the growth of regional CO2 emissions and can thus enrich the policy implications concerning a narrow definition of “carbon leakage” through domestic inter-regional “trade” as well as a relevant political consensus about responsibility sharing between developed and developing regions inside China.
R15|Where does EU money eventually go? The distribution of CAP expenditure across the European space|Abstract This paper aims to assess the distribution of overall Gross Domestic Product and employment effects produced by Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) payments across the European Union space. It is empirically investigated how policy funds redistribute their effects among regions with different levels of rurality and economic development according to their degree and form of integration. This analysis is performed by constructing and applying a multiregional Input–Output model at a very high level of geographical disaggregation (NUTS 3 level). Alternative allocation of funds across regions (policy scenarios) are considered in order to assess redistributive impacts of possible CAP reforms. Results show that the impacts generated by the CAP across space do not only depend on the initial allocation of funds but also on intersectoral and interregional linkages. This evidence implies that even a radical reallocation of funds, though it may contribute to reducing regional imbalances, is less redistributive than expected.
R15|The Concept of the Model for the Selection of Sustainable Office Building Location|The paper presents the concept of the decision-making model facilitating the selection of location for an office building fulfilling the requirements of sustainable construction. The concept of responsible property investing was discussed on the basis of literature studies. Sustainable office buildings are one of the ways of its practical implementation and the location of a building is among the evaluation criteria in sustainable building multicriteria certification systems, so it can improve the rating of a building. The proposed decision model for the selection of location was elaborated on the basis of multicriteria decision analysis applied in the GIS environment. Analytical criteria applied in the model were compiled on the basis of the BREEAM certification system. When the required data and spatial information are applied to this model, it allows to prepare the map of optimal spatial decisions.
R15|Local and spatial cointegration in the wage curve – a spatial panel analysis for german regions|Abstract The wage curve introduced by Blanchflower and Oswald (1990, 1994b) postulates a negative correlation between wages and unemployment. Empirical studies use different channels for a theoretical underpinning the relationship. Panel data models mostly draw on bargaining power or the efficiency wage hypothesis. Spatial econometric approaches can be rationalized by monopsonistic competition. However, the approaches either ignore the issue of nonstationarity or treat the data as if it were nonspatial. In this paper, we adopt a global cointegration approach to account for nonstationarity of regional data. By specifying a spatial error correction model (SpECM), equilibrium adjustments are considered in both time and space. For West Germany, strong evidence for the existence of a long-run wage curve with spatial effects is found.
R15|Three Regions, three economies ?|Are the production structures in the Flemish, Walloon and Brussels Regions interconnected, or conversely, do they tend to function independently of one another ? The article shines a light on trade between the three Regions and assesses the size of the regional barriers that exist in Belgium. Establishing a trade relationship with a firm located in a different Region does in fact entail an additional cost. The estimates indicate that a Flemish firm faces an implicit barrier equivalent to 10 km when wishing to make a sale to a Walloon firm. A Walloon supplier seeking a Flemish trade customer is confronted by an implicit barrier of 30 km. The presence of interregional barriers does not prevent trade between the Regions. Half of all firms in Belgium sell to trade customers in another Region. Overall, each Region is involved in the export trade of the other two Regions. Moreover, 7 % of Flemish value added is invested or consumed by households or public authorities in the other two Regions. For Flanders, the Walloon market alone is comparable in size to the German or French market, and larger than the Dutch market. For Wallonia and Brussels, the interregional market absorbs 9 % and 40 % respectively of the value added created. It accounts for a bigger share than the German and French markets taken together. In that connection, the authors draw attention to the striking contrast between the foreign markets served by Flanders and those of Wallonia.
R15|Economic importance of the Belgian ports: Flemish maritime ports, Liège port complex and the port of Brussels - Report 2014|This paper is an annual publication issued by the Microeconomic Analysis service of the National Bank of Belgium. The Flemish maritime ports (Antwerp, Ghent, Ostend, Zeebrugge), the Autonomous Port of Liège and the port of Brussels play a major role in their respective regional economies and in the Belgian economy, not only in terms of industrial activity but also as intermodal centers facilitating the commodity flow. This update paper1 provides an extensive overview of the economic importance and development of the Flemish maritime ports, the Liège port complex and the port of Brussels for the period 2009 - 2014, with an emphasis on 2014. Focusing on the three major variables of value added, employment and investment, the report also provides some information based on the social balance sheet and an overview of the financial situation in these ports as a whole. These observations are linked to a more general context, along with a few cargo statistics. Annual accounts data from the Central Balance Sheet Office were used for the calculation of direct effects, the study of financial ratios and the analysis of the social balance sheet. The indirect effects of the activities concerned were estimated in terms of value added and employment, on the basis of data from the National Accounts Institute. As a result of the underlying calculation method the changes of indirect employment and indirect value added can differ from one another. The developments concerning economic activity in the six ports in 2013 - 2014 are summarised in the table on the next page: In 2014 the growth of maritime traffic in the Flemish sea ports was once again due solely to developments in the port of Antwerp. However, that did not necessarily mean that direct value added followed the same trend: except for the port of Zeebrugge, all other lemish ports recorded an increase. Direct employment is continuing to decline, except in the port of Ghent where it remains steady. Investment appears to be picking up, after last year’s weak figures. Cargo traffic in the ports of Liège and Brussels was up in 2014, but that did not result in any increase in value added. The decline in direct employment also persisted, certainly in the port of Liège. This report provides a comprehensive account of these issues, giving details for each economic sector, although the comments are confined to the main changes that occurred in 2014. This report is available for download at the following address http://www.nbb.be.
R15|Assessment of rural credit impact on land and labor productivity for Brazilian family farmers [Assessment of rural credit impact on land and labor productivity for Brazilian family farmers]|The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of rural credit on land and labor productivity for Brazilian family farmers and assess factors influencing the rural credit approval process. The study employs data contained in the 2006 Brazilian Municipality1 Agricultural Census and a “trade index” (TI) specifically constructed to differentiate family farmers. The impact of credit on land and labor productivity was calculated by comparing the productivity of a group of family farmers that received credit with the productivity of a group of family farmers that were credit restricted. The groups were constructed with the aid of propensity score matching. When statistically significant, the average effect of credit was found to increase the recipient’s productivity of land and labor. It was also found that productivity increases due to the use of credit aligned with the level of the family farmer’s integration into the commercial market and, therefore, one credit policy does not fit for all Brazilian family farmers.
R15|Boom goes the price: Giant resource discoveries and real exchange rate appreciation|We estimate the effect of giant oil and gas discoveries on bilateral real exchange rates. The size and plausibly exogenous timing of such discoveries make them ideal for identifying the effects of an anticipated resource boom on prices. We find that a giant discovery with the value of a country's GDP increases the real exchange rate by 14% within 10 years following the discovery. The appreciation is nearly exclusively driven by an appreciation of the prices of non-tradable goods. We show that these empirical results are qualitatively and quantitatively in line with a calibrated model with forward looking behaviour and Dutch disease dynamics.

Se destaca como novedad lo que se ha denominado efecto “boca-a-boca-del-conmutante"" y el uso de una formulación que explica cómo los ingresos afectan la conmutación. La investigación responde a: es relevante el aporte del turismo en estas localidades?; existe correlación entre un efecto alométrico con los salarios requeridos? y, regiones con alto PIB per cápita o ingresos promedios capturan en términos netos más conmutantes?. Las fuentes de información son el CENSO del año 2002 (Censo02), la Encuesta Nacional de Caracterización Socioeconómica del año 2009 (Casen09), y la Nueva Encuesta Suplementaria de Ingresos del año 2012 (Nesi12). Los resultados indican que el turismo no es gravitante, que regiones con altos PIB per cápita y/o salarios presentan en términos netos más conmutantes y, que el efecto boca-a-boca se puede determinar. || Given the closeness of Valdivia, Osorno, Puerto Montt and Entre Lagos to Puyehue National Park (PNP), this article reviews the economic impact of the increased visits. We also study the salary changes required in order to motivate work in the area, using commutation as proxy of the labour market. As a novelty, the so-called “commuter-word-of-mouth"" effect is to be highlighted, as well as the use of a formulation that explains how income affects commutation. This research provides answers to the following questions: Is the contribution of tourism relevant to these villages? Is there some correlation between an allometric effect and the required salaries? And do higher GDP per capita regions attract more commuters, in net numbers? The sources of information were the Census of 2002 (Censo02), the National Poll of Socioeconomic Characterization of 2009 (Casen09) and the New Supplementary Income Poll of 2012 (Nesil12). The results indicate that: tourism does not have a strong influence; regions with higher GDP per capita and/or salaries have more commuters in net ammounts; and the “word-of-mouth"" effect can be determined."
R15|Oil demand and price elasticity of energy consumption in the GCC countries: A panel cointegration analysis|This paper examines the cointegrating relationship between oil demand and price elasticity of energy consumption in the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries during the period 1980-2010. The paper has applied the recently developed panel cointegration techniques, Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) and panel DOLS in a panel of GCC countries. The region is being recognized as the major region of oil production and export in the global economy. In recent times, the region is emerging as a fastest growing oil consuming region globally. This fast increase in the level of oil consumption in the major oil exporting countries raises the energy security implications in the sphere of the growing oil demand in the world economy. This is likely to bring many pitfalls in the form of price distortions and reduced growth rates in and outside the oil export region. The empirical finding reveals a cointegrating relationship among the variables and indicates an income elastic and price inelastic demand for oil in the long-run in the GCC countries. The outcomes of income elastic and price inelastic demand for oil are also consistent in the short-run. The income and price inelastic demand for oil though exists for a full panel of countries but vary across the GCC countries. The result of the Granger Causality test also depicts a unidirectional causality running from income to oil consumption and bidirectional causality running between oil prices and income in the GCC countries. Moreover, the outcomes reveal that demand for oil varies positively with the growth of income and negatively with the price level in the economy.
R15|Space-time patterns of rank concordance: Local indicators of mobility association with application to spatial income inequality dynamics|In the study of income inequality dynamics, the concept of exchange mobility plays a central role. Applications of classical rank correlation statistics have been used to assess the degree to which individual economies swap positions in the income distribution over time. These classic measures ignore the underlying geographical pattern of these rank changes. Rey (2004) introduced a spatial concordance statistic as an extension of Kendall’s rank correlation statistic, a commonly employed measure of exchange mobility. This article suggests local forms of the global spatial concordance statistic: Local Indicators of Mobility Association (LIMA). The LIMA statistics allow for the decomposition of the global measure into the contributions associated with individual locations. They do so by considering the degree of concordance (stability) or discordance (exchange mobility) reflected within an economy’s local spatial context. Different forms of the LIMAs derive from alternative expressions of the neighborhood and neighbor set. Additionally, the additive decomposition of the LIMAs permits the development of a meso-level analytic to examine whether the overall space-time concordance is driven by either interregional or intraregional concordance. The measures are illustrated in a case study that examines regional income dynamics in Mexico.
R15|Driving forces of different productivity models|In the present study, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used for the period spanning from 1980 to 2012 and for a total of 32 countries which are classified into four groups, according to their level of development (Developing, BRICS, Developed, G7). DEA allows us to measure technical efficiency under constant (CRS) and variable (VRS) returns to scale and also the Malmquist index and its components (TECHCH, EFFCH, PECH, SECH). Furthermore, we develop an order-α approach for the determination of partial frontiers. An output oriented model is applied. Labor and capital are used as inputs while the GDP index is used as output. Subsequently, energy is incorporated in the model as an additional input variable and CO2 emissions as undesirable output. A comparison of productivity indices as derived from the analysis, allows us to highlight the different levels of productivity before and after the integration of energy and CO2 emissions as additional variables, for each group of countries and therefore their sustainability gaps.
R15|Evaluating direct and indirect treatment effects in Italian R&D expenditures|"During the last decades SUTVA has represented the ""gold standard"" for the identification and evaluation of causal effects. However, the presence of interferences in causal analysis requires a substantial review of the SUTVA hypothesis. This paper proposes a framework for causal inference in presence of spatial interactions within a new spatial hierarchical Difference-in-Differences model (SH-DID). The novel approach decomposes the ATE, allowing the identification of direct (ADTE) and indirect treatment effects. In addition, our approach permits the identification of different indirect causal impact both on treated (AITET) and on controls (AITENT). The performances of the SH-DID are evaluated by a Montecarlo Simulation. The results confirm how omitting the presence of interferences produces biased parameters of direct and indirect effects, even though the estimates of the ATE in the traditional model are correct. Conversely, the SH-DID provides unbiased estimates of both total, direct and indirect effects. On this basis, we provide empirical evidence on the effectiveness of public policies in Italy. The estimates show the additionality of the policies on R&D expenditures. Decomposing the ATE, we demonstrate positive and significant direct effects, while the indirect impact is negative and meaningful, even if limited to the treated."
R15|Spatial Externalities and Growth in a Mankiw-Romer-Weil World: Theory and Evidence|This paper presents a theoretical growth model that accounts for technological interdependence among regions in a Mankiw-Romer-Weil world. The reasoning behind the theoretical work is that technological ideas cannot be fully appropriated by investors and these ideas may diffuse and increase the productivity of other firms. We link the diffusion of ideas to spatial proximity and allow for ideas to flow to nearby regional economies. Through the magic of solving for the reduced form of the theoretical model and the magic of spatial autoregressive processes, the simple dependence on a small number of neighbouring regions leads to a reduced form theoretical model and an associated empirical model where changes in a single region can potentially impact all other regions. This implies that conventional regression interpretations of the parameter estimates would be wrong. The proper way to interpret the model has to rely on matrices of partial derivatives of the dependent variable with respect to changes in the Mankiw-Romer-Weil variables, using scalar summary measures for reporting the estimates of the marginal impacts from the model. The summary impact measure estimates indicate that technological interdependence among European regions works through physical rather than human capital externalities. (author's abstract)
R15|A SAS® Macro for the Generalized RAS Algorithm|Demographers and economists frequently encounter the problem of constraining matrices of mixed sign to controls of possibly mixed sign. The recently developed Generalized RAS (GRAS) algorithm is presented to solve these problems. The GRAS algorithm produces a unique solution that minimizes an entropy-like function. The algorithm is applied to a well-known example and compared to the solution originally obtained using a generalization of the Akers-Siegel procedure.
R15|The spatial autocorrelation problem in spatial interaction modelling: a comparison of two common solutions|Abstract Spatial interaction models of the gravity type are widely used to describe origin-destination flows. They draw attention to three types of variables to explain variation in spatial interactions across geographic space: variables that characterize the origin region of interaction, variables that characterize the destination region of interaction, and variables that measure the separation between origin and destination regions. A violation of standard minimal assumptions for least squares estimation may be associated with two problems: spatial autocorrelation within the residuals, and spatial autocorrelation within explanatory variables. This paper compares a spatial econometric solution with the spatial statistical Moran eigenvector spatial filtering solution to accounting for spatial autocorrelation within model residuals. An example using patent citation data that capture knowledge flows across 257 European regions serves to illustrate the application of the two approaches.
R15|Main Determinants of Romanian Emigration. A Regional Perspective|Statistical data reveal considerably higher emigration rates in certain regions of Romania, usually the less developed ones, marked by high unemployment and poverty rates. This suggests that a deeper understanding of Romanian out-migration patterns and the underlying factors of influence can be reached by investigating the phenomenon from a regional perspective. Consequently the paper explores the major causes of Romanian emigration using county level data from the last Census. We are testing some potential push factors, such as low development, small income and high unemployment. The average level of education by county is also considered by using two relevant variables: share of secondary education graduates, as well as university graduates, in stable population aged 10 years and over. We test for spatial dependence in the number of emigrants by county and estimate both classic OLS regression models and spatial models, namely spatial lag and spatial error models. In accordance with previous findings in the literature, our results point to the development level (captured by GDP per capita) as a negative factor of influence for emigration. This means that poorer counties provide more emigrants compared to the richer ones. Surprisingly, the characteristics of the regional labour market, reflected by average wage and unemployment rate, influence the emigration flows in opposite direction than expected. We explained this outcome in the context of highly significant impact of human capital, as we found stronger propensity towards emigration for the persons having higher skills and qualifications, which are seldom affected by unemployment and low income. To sum up, our empirical analysis points to well-educated people from poorer counties as the most likely emigrants. This result should raise awareness on the waste of human capital (“brain drain”) with long-lasting negative consequences for the Romanian society and economy.
R15|The Impact of Economic Crisis on Convergence Processes in European Union Regions|The effects of the financial crisis, that started in 2008 and first emerged on the American housing market, have been experienced by many European economies. The purpose of this article is to attempt to measure and assess the sensitivity of convergence processes to crisis in European Union’s regional economies taking into consideration their sectoral structure. Particular resistence to crisis is associated with the presence of “modern” sectors of the economy. The study covers the panel of the European Union NUTS-2 level regions in the period 2005-2011. In the analysis, the application of panel data allows for inclusion of the specific non-measurable aspects characteristic for particular regions and time.
R15|Regional Economic Impact Assessment with Missing Input-Output Data: A Spatial Econometrics Approach for Poland|We propose a method of constructing multisector-multiregion input-output tables, based on the standard multisector tables and the tools of spatial econometrics. Voivodship-level (NUTS-2) and subregion-level data (NUTS-3) on sectoral value added is used to fit a spatial model, based on a modification of the Durbin model. The structural coefficients are calibrated, based on I-O multipliers, while the spatial weight matrices are estimated as parsimoniously parametrised functions of physical distance and limited supply in certain regions. We incorporate additional restrictions to derive proportions in which every cross-sectoral flow should be interpolated into cross-regional flow matrix. All calculations are based on publicly available data. The method is illustrated with an example of regional economic impact assessment for a generic construction company located in Eastern Poland.
R15|Clustering methodology of the Russian Federation regions with account of sectoral structure of GRP|The methodology to identify similar groups of Russian regions is presented, each of which has its own model of productive capacity, which determines the dependence of the GRP from the fixed assets and number of employees. It is carried out to test the hypothesis that the parameters of the functions describing the production potential of the regions included in the different groups, different by reason of the sectoral structure of GRP. The procedure for constructing the auxiliary integral indicators based on component analysis is offered, it is reflected the specialization of regions. Developed and tested on data for the period 2009–2013 algorithm of forming a similar group of regions. It is revealed the presence of a greater sensitivity to changes in GRP value of fixed assets for the group of regions with a specialization in mining and mixed type specialty than for groups of regions specializing in manufacturing and agriculture. At the same time, last two groups of regions and the group of regions with emerging economies are more sensitive to changes in the number of employees. The developed methodology is an element of forecasting procedures and planning options for sustainable socio-economic development of regions of the Russian Federation.
R15|Local Labor Markets in a New Economic Geography Model|Space economy is determined by the interaction between markets and the mobility of production factors. Capital and labor mobility affects the functioning of the product and labor markets in the regions of origin and destination. This feeds back into the earnings of production factor owners and changes the incentives to move through the modification of demand levels in both regions. In this paper, we build a model with two regions and two production factors, labor and capital, à la Tabuchi-Helpman in order to embody both capital and labor mobility in a unique model. Considering the conditions for agglomeration and dispersion to arise, we show that the features of the labor market are a key parameter along with well-known trade costs. The results show that, depending on labor market conditions, the industry and the population display a smooth bell-shaped curve of spatial development. Dispersion prevails when trade costs are either high or low, while agglomeration occurs in between. Market integration and factor mobility exacerbate regional disparities.
R15|Does Broadband Matter for Rural Entrepreneurs and Creative Class Employees?|"Efforts to attract entrepreneurs and ""creative class"" workers have become important components of economic development strategies for rural communities. One commonly held perception is that broadband access is important for these types of employees; however, empirical research on the relationship between the two is generally lacking. This study uses county-level data from the continental U.S. to estimate spatial and first-differenced regression models on the association between broadband and measures of entrepreneurship/creative-class employees in rural areas. The results suggest that high levels of broadband adoption may in fact serve to reduce the numbers of entrepreneurs and creative class employees in rural America. These findings serve as a reminder that broadband is not a panacea for all issues of importance to rural communities and provide evidence that there may be negative implications associated with efforts to increase levels of rural broadband access and adoption."
R15|Woody biomass processing: Potential economic impacts on rural regions|This paper estimates the economic and environmental impacts of introducing woody biomass processing (WBP) into a rural area in central Appalachia. WBP is among the most promising additions to energy generation portfolios for reducing import dependency while at the same time providing economic opportunity to stimulate regional economies, especially in rural regions where economic development options are often limited. We use an input-output framework to assess WBP under three different pathways, fast pyrolysis, ethanol and coal-biomass to liquids. We find that the proposed WBP will increase regional output by 0.5–1.3% of gross regional product; it will increase income by $17.32 to $51.31 million dollars each year, and regional employment by 218.1–1127.8 jobs, depending on the chosen pathway. Of these impacts, the direct portions are 63–77% of the total impact, depending on the chosen pathway. The economic analysis and the results from the accompanying environmental assessment show that only the ethanol pathway has both economic and environmental benefits. We conclude that because long-run economic development strategies in rural regions are limited and negative impacts do not alter dramatically the regional environmental profile, regional policymakers should include WBP among their development portfolio options.
R15|Polycentricity functional analysis of the Romanian counties|The development of polycentricity at the national level involves the balanced development of network of settlements and the achievement of a harmonious relationship between settlement and territory based on principles of sustainable development, internal balance, the opening towards the exterior, and the exploitation of the exiting potential, functional complementarity and the growth of local autonomy. For this reason, the assessment of polycentricity at the county level is extremely important. The methodology in assessing the degree of polycentricity at NUTS 3 level consists in identifying certain domains significant for the characterization of polycentricity and some relevant indicators within such domains and then, after transformation indicators’ values into scores, it consists in calculating some composite indicators corresponding to the domains and polycentricity. The analysis of these findings leads to some interesting conclusions, necessary for the formulation of some local, regional and national development policies.
R15|Spatial Externalities, Openness and Financial Development in SADC: Beyond the Multilateral Monetary Agreement|This study empirically evaluates spatial externalities in financial development in SADC in line with spatial proximity theory, which asserts that externalities increase with proximity. Precisely, the study tests if financially less developed economies in SADC benefit from linkages with and proximity to South Africa, a financially developed economy. The Spatial Durbin Model estimated using GMM and Dynamic Panel Estimations, establishes that financial development in the SADC region is sensitive to space and hence not immune to spatial externalities. Results indicate that monetary measures are highly sensitive to geography than credit and that allowing for spatiality, credit from South Africa crowds-out domestic and private credit of other SADC countries. Precisely, proximity to South Africa brings negative externalities in credit but positive externalities in money markets. Implicitly, the spatial variable has a substitution effect in the local credit market and a complementary effect in the money market. Estimations that controlled for effects of monetary union in the model also confirms that financial development is affected by spatiality in the money market and is not responsive to spatial effects in credit. The results also indicated that financial openness is a necessary condition for financial development to take place in the SADC region.
R15|Sectoral Productivity, Convergence And Space Between European Regions|The aim of our analysis is the evaluation of the total and sectoral convergence of labour productivity between 896 NUTS-3 regions of EU-12 over the period 1980-2010. We adopt a β- and σ-convergence approach along with a methodology based on Getis’ spatial filters that allows decomposing the variables into their spatial and a-spatial components ensuring their spatial independence. This guarantees reliable regression results and unbiased variance estimation. The estimates highlight a process σ- and β-convergence of regional economies in which spatial interrelations among regions play an important role.
R15|Treatment-Effect Identification Without Parallel paths An illustration in the case of Objective 1-Hainaut/Belgium, 1994-2006|Imagine a region that has a lower income per head than the rest of the territory, and becomes eligible for a generous EU-funded transfer programme (the treatment). The evaluation of the effectiveness of such a policy can rest on a difference-in-differences analysis (DiD); which in essence consists of comparing the income-level handicap before and after the treatment. Imagine that DiD shows that the handicap has not diminished, or even that it has risen. Most observers would conclude to the inefficiency of the policy. The point we raise in this paper is that second thoughts are needed, because DiD rests heavily on the validity of a key assumption: parallel paths in the absence of treatment. Without EU money the outcome difference between the treated and the controls should be time-invariant; so that any statistically significant change of that difference can be ascribed to the treatment. Parallel paths seem a priori unrealistic in the context of old industrial regions, as one of the reasons they become eligible for treatment is that their income-level handicap is on the rise. Also, from a methodological point of view, when more than one pre-treatment period is available in the data, the parallel-paths assumption can easily be abandoned in favour of more flexible assumptions as to the relative dynamics of treated vs. control entities. This paper illustrates the relevance this approach in the case of Objective 1-Hainaut; an EU-funded transfer policy implemented between 1994 and 2006 in Hainaut, the most economically-deprived province of Belgium; a former bastion of the country’s industrial revolution that has endured decades of decline.
R15|The Socioeconomic Impacts of Low Income Housing Programs in São Paulo State, Brazil|The public policies programs for low-income housing in Brazil started in the 1930s, and most recently the well-advertised program “My House, My Life” by the Federal government had on its goals to improve the quality of life of poor people, to reduce the housing deficit and to foster the economy. The question raised by this paper is how important was the contribution of the program for the economic growth observed in the Brazilian economy in previous years? In a way to shed light on this question, the case of the low-income housing programs in the state of São Paulo is take as an example. The State program being a joint venture among the federal, state and municipal governments. To do so, a specific interregional input-output model is estimated for two regions, São Paulo and Rest of Brazil, with the insertion in the model of 6 different typologies of low income housing, ranging from a single house to building complexes. The impacts are measured in terms of GDP, tax collection and employment in the State of São Paulo and in the Rest of Brazil, showing that depending on the housing typology, the impacts in the economy are different, and that part of the investments made returns to the government in terms of tax collection. As results, the programs affects the state economy system for expanding the demand for inputs for the construction of new buildings (direct effect); demand in other sectors due to the initial shock (indirect effect); and the income of families - as more labor is required and therefore widens the aggregated wage – it extends the demand for goods and services in the economy (induced effect).
R15|Are clusters more resilient in crises? Evidence from French exporters in 2008-2009|"Clusters have already been extensively shown to favor firm-level economic performance (productivity, exports, innovation etc.). However, little is known about the capacity of firms in clusters to resist economic shocks. In this paper, we analyze whether firms that agglomerate in clusters and firms that have been selected to benefit from the ""competitiveness cluster'' industrial policy, implemented in France in 2005, have performed better on export markets during the recent economic turmoil. We show that, on average, both agglomeration and the cluster policy are associated with a higher survival probability of firms on export markets, and conditioning on survival, a higher growth rate of their exports. However, these effects are not stronger during the 2008-2009 crisis; if anything, the opposite is true. We then show that this weaker resilience of competitiveness cluster firms is probably due to the fact that firms in clusters are more dependent on the fate of the ``leader'', i.e. the largest exporter in the cluster."
R15|Location matters for pro-environmental behavior: a spatial Markov Chains approach to proximity effects in differentiated waste collection|We analyze data on differentiated waste collection (as a proxy of pro-environmental behaviors) in Italian provinces in the years 1999–2012. We make use of a Markov Spatial Transition approach to model the dynamic of local transitions among different levels of environmental pro-sociality, and we find that behaviors, and in particular differentiated waste collecting habits, tend to be strongly influenced by proximity effects, so that provinces with good levels of environmental pro-sociality may positively influence nearby ones, and vice versa for provinces with poor levels of environmental pro-sociality. We also show that in the long term separate clusters with markedly different levels of differentiated waste collection rates emerge. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016

R15|Real estate bubble and urban population density: six Spanish metropolitan areas 2001–2011|Abstract After a period of exorbitant growth in building sector, it is appropriate to measure the impact it has had on the spatial structure of the main Spanish metropolitan areas. Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Sevilla, Bilbao and Zaragoza are surveyed, and two periods are compared: 2001 and 2011. The main driving factor behind the evolution of urban density is the huge and fast arrival and settlement of immigrants. This article explores these transformations through exploratory spatial data analysis and classic econometric models that relate urban density with distance to central business district. The presence of spatial effects is tested: spatial lag and error models are considered. Spatial error models are estimated. Two main consequences of real state bubble are as follows: (1) spatial autocorrelation has grown and (2) in Madrid, Barcelona and Zaragoza central areas with high urban density are larger than before. From a methodological point of view, the introduction of spatial effects in the classical urban population density models implies a clear reduction in the explaining power of distance.
R15|Evaluation of urban scenarios using bid-rents of spatial interaction models as hedonic price estimators: an application to the Terceira Island, Azores|Abstract This paper aims to present and test a methodology capable of determining the impact of urban scenarios and policies through the use of calibrated bid-rents of a spatial interaction model (SIM) as hedonic price estimators of the real estate houses. This approach responds to the increasing requirement of decision support systems to assess complex effects of urban policies because through linking the bid-rents with hedonic prices, it is possible to connect the quantity estimates of the spatial interaction models with the value estimates of the hedonic price approach. The combined methodology is applied to Terceira Island to assess the spatial and economic impact of the decrease in activity of Lajes Military Airfield on employment and on the real estate value of the island. The SIM distributes employment and population by the 31 zones of Terceira Island in the Azores given the distances between zones, the basic employment per zone, the average distances for commuting and shopping and the space available for urban activities. The model’s friction parameters are iteratively calibrated to secure that estimated average commuting and shopping distances are equal to those observed in reality; bid-rents are also calibrated to guarantee that the demand for space in each zone does not overcomes the available sspace for urban activities per zone. The SIM is coded and integrated in MATLAB 2013a. Afterward, a hedonic price regression is estimated to explain house prices in relation to the calibrated bid-rents and house typologies. The effect of the Lajes Military Airfield drawdown is estimated by the SIM, which evaluates the impacts on employment and population, and a hedonic price regression is subsequently performed with the new SIM bid-rents,to appraise the new real estate value. Results show that the Lajes Military Airfield reduction of 750 basic employment will result not only in a decrease of 1552 total employments and 3502 of the 56,437 residents of the island but also in a loss of 55 million € in real estate value. The method has proved its usefulness and effectiveness for predicting the impacts of exogenous shocks in complex urban systems.
R15|Distribution dynamics of Russian regional prices|Abstract The objective of this paper is twofold: first, to show an application of the distribution dynamics approach developed in the literature on economic growth and income inequality to spatial price analysis, and second, to study the behaviour of Russian regional prices for staples during the decade of 2001–2010. The study includes three veins: first, tracing the evolution of price dispersion and changes in the shape of the cross-region price distribution over time; second, analysing changes in price ranking of regions (rank mobility); and third, analysing quantity mobility with the use of stochastic kernel. Results obtained evidence that regional relative prices in Russia remained fairly stable during 2001–2010. No significant changes are found in price dispersion and cross-region price distribution over this time span. Rank mobility was very low with seasonal surges. The pattern of quantity mobility manifests neither convergence nor divergence of regional prices. However, a long-run price distribution has an unpleasant feature, predicting potential emergence of a price convergence club in the Russian Far East. Given that potentialities for price convergence among Russian regions existed by 2001, the pattern obtained can be termed stagnation rather than stability.
R15|Understanding of economic spillover mechanism by structural path analysis: a case study of interregional social accounting matrix focused on institutional sectors in Japan|Abstract The aim of this research is to introduce a multiregional social accounting matrix (SAM) in Japan evaluating the regional and interregional spillover effects of economic impacts and to show the impact flows of economic linkages based on SAM. While research on national and regional SAM has become common, examples of interregional SAM are rare currently. This study points out that there is a substantial need to build a small regional and interregional SAM because of economic sensitivity. Our work evaluates the economic effects of national and regional government behavior, such as changes of the local tax system and decentralization of power, on the regional economy by structural path analysis. This research finds the differential impact flows of local government expenditures to regional incomes between a remote area and the rest of Japan (ROJ), or the leakages of remote area’s money to ROJ via property income.
R15|Crisis and the city: profiling urban growth under economic expansion and stagnation|Abstract Economic crises have influenced urban growth altering building cycles and re-shaping house and labour markets as a consequence of increased socioeconomic disparities. In southern Europe, one of the most affected regions by the 2007–2008 global crisis, evidence on the recession’s impact on urban growth characteristics and directions are still occasional and restricted to local contexts. This study contributes to this issue by identifying similarities and differences in short-term urban expansion before and during recession. Population growth over 2000–2007 and 2008–2014 was assessed in 235 urban districts and municipalities of Rome metropolitan region, Italy. Local-scale changes in the distribution of resident population are considered a reliable indicator of recent growth trends at the city scale and were compared with evidence from previous studies exploring trends in settlement and land-use indicators. Local-scale population distribution showed relevant differences in the time intervals investigated. While early-1990s depopulation of some central districts continued over 2000–2007, demographic re-polarization was observed especially over 2008–2014 in an increasing number of inner districts. At the same time, suburban growth occurred in different spatial directions and speed over the two periods. Our results identify a more rapid growth rate and a higher spreading of population over space during 2000–2007 compared to 2008–2014, identifying a trend towards population densification and settlement re-compacting in the last years. Our results corroborate previous evidence from other southern European urban agglomerations bringing insights on the debate over the future development of sprawling cities.
R15|Structural decompositions of energy consumption, energy intensity, emissions and emission intensity - A sectoral perspective: empirical evidence from WIOD over 1995 to 2009|Using more than 68 million data points from the newly introduced World Input-Output Database (WIOD) over 1995 to 2009, this study investigates the historical dynamics of energy consumption, aggregate energy intensity, total emissions and total emission intensity at sectoral level by decomposing their relative changes in the input-output framework into five influencing factors: intensity effect, inter-industry structural effect, trade effect in intermediate inputs, structural change effect in final demand and total final demand effect. It identifies crucial empirical patterns that support UNIDO’s ISID initiative: increases in energy consumption and total emissions at sectoral level driven by economic growth can be partially or even largely offset by the efficiency technology related intensity effect and the intensity effect within sectors contributes the most to reductions in aggregate energy intensity and total emission intensity.
R15|Determinants Of Fdi Inflows: The Case Of Russian Regions|This paper empirically analyses the determinants of foreign direct investment inflows into the Russian regions. This problem has become highly relevant for the necessary modernization of the Russian economy after the recent economic slowdown and sharp decrease in budget revenues. The authors model foreign direct investment flows with the use of the gravity approach according to which investment flows are positively correlated with the size of the investorâ€™s country as well as the size of the recipient region and are negatively correlated with the distance between investor and recipient. The empirical analysis is based on a constructed database consisting of the foreign direct investment flows from 179 investor countries into 78 Russian regions for the period 2006â€“2013. The authors apply the Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood method and identify the following factors determining foreign direct investment inflows into the Russian economy: the gross domestic product of the investorâ€™s country, the gross domestic product per capita in the recipient region, the distance from the investor to Moscow, the openness of the region, the economic situation in the region, the innovative capacity of the region and the foreign direct investment of the previous period. Interestingly, the distance from the recipient region to Moscow matters for the regions in the western part of Russia (relatively close to Moscow) but is not significant for the regions in the eastern part (remote regions).
R15|Organization of Land Surrounding Airports: The Case of the Aerotropolis|We analyze the conditions driving the organization of the territory near airports by studying the distribution of economic activities. We consider how commercial firms, service operators, and consumers compete for land. The theoretical setting identifies an aerotropolis (airport city) as a land equilibrium outcome characterized by the following spatial sequence: services area, commercial area, residential area. Using data on the distribution of establishments in the United States, we analyze the existence and determinants of aeropolitan configurations. Estimations performed with parametric methods detect some interesting dynamic patterns affecting the density and distribution of activities around selected U.S. airports.
R15|Connection Between Similarity and Estimation Results of Property Values Obtained by Statistical Methods|The article discusses the topic of the application range of statistical methods in estimating property value on the grounds of a comparative approach. The analysis of application effects to estimate the unitary value of properties, respectively similar and dissimilar sets of market properties, by using the method of least squares and a linear price model. The prepared test set was developed from a priori assumed explanatory variable values as well as deterministically specified dependent variables (simulated prices) which were subjected to additional modification by a random factor. On the basis of the prepared set and series of accounting experiments, the estimation effects of any property out of a tested set were analyzed, understood as the determination of the value of the function of explanatory variables in the way of extrapolation or interpolation of values describing these variables. The experiments carried out show that the estimation of an explanatory variable for a random property out of a set of elements serving as the estimation base can be reliable only when it is related to the interpolation in the set of explanatory variables of this base. The application as an estimation base – a set in relation to which explanatory variables of the estimated property exceed the limits of corresponding variables, requires the completion of a basic set with records describing properties similar or close to the estimated property so that the values of explanatory variables for the estimated property are contained in the appropriate subsections of values of corresponding explanatory variables of the basic set.

R15|Multifamily residential asset and space markets and linkages with the economy| We show that a proper assessment of the linkages between real estate markets and the economy requires state of the art modelling techniques, which treat economic variables endogenously and allow for a number of long-run relationships. We therefore use a long-run structural modelling approach, which incorporates equilibrium relationships that are predicted by economic theory, in an otherwise unrestricted vector autoregressive model. The application of this approach to Swiss multifamily residential data shows that four long-run equilibrium relations exist among inflation, long- and short-term interest rates, real M2, real GDP, real construction expenditures, real market rents and capitalisation rates. Disturbances to the equilibria last for approximately five years before they completely vanish. The analysis of the short-run dynamics additionally suggests that the linkages between real estate and economic variables are bi-directional. Our findings should provide for a better understanding of the linkages and feedback mechanisms between a developed economy and its real estate markets and thereby help in the identification and quantification of both market interventions by policy-makers and risks borne by investors.
R15|The Mediterranean Port-City Economy: The Cases Of Marseille And Mersin|The economic fortunes of port-cities have evolved over time. Ports have been drivers of trade-related economic wealth in the past, but current economic benefits to their cities are more ambiguous. Port-cities and their evo-lutions have been categorised in various ways. This article aims to assess the applicability of these typologies by confronting two port-cities in the Mediter-ranean of similar size and similar dominance of port functions: Marseille in France and Mersin in Turkey. After an analysis of the different port develop-ment trajectories, the article assesses the economic impact of these two ports. Following a similar methodology, it provides calculations of port-related em-ployment, value added and inter-regional spill-overs. It compares the economic trajectories and possible future development paths. By confronting these differ-ent trajectories, the article attempts to assess the applicability of generic port-city typologies and models of port-city evolutions.
R15|The Relation between Industry and Services in Terms of Productivity and Value Creation|Summary The share of manufacturing in GDP is declining, whereas the share of services – and business-related services in particular – is rising in almost all advanced economies. However, as these industries are mutually dependent in various ways this study focuses on the manufacturing sector as a user of activities provided by the services industries and – in particular – the way the latter contributes to productivity and value creation in the former. To the extent that this is the case, manufacturing industries benefit from a vibrant business-services industry and themselves play an important ‘carrier function’ of services – issues which are addressed by considering manufacturing activities in a value chain approach. As a consequence, EU Member States facing a declining share of manufacturing might still be part of the manufacturing value chain via the provision of services whereas other countries benefit from services provided by other countries. The role of cross-border flows of services and the patterns of outsourcing and offshoring of such activities across Europe is therefore gaining importance. It is argued that a differentiated pattern of specialisation emerged within Europe with a set of countries keeping a stronghold in manufacturing industries and others are specialising in the provision of related services, whereas some countries have faced a decline in their manufacturing shares, but have not succeeded in increasing their specialisation in business services either. The first four sections of the study present selected quantitative indicators concerning the ‘manufacturing value chains’, discuss the relative importance of the manufacturing–services interaction and its cross-border dimensions, and point towards differences across countries, industries and services activities, and the respective changes over time. Further, impacts of these interactions on manufacturing performance are addressed econometrically. The following two sections highlight important dimensions of services use in manufacturing and issues related to services trade and potential barriers in that respect for selected industries and countries, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative insights.
