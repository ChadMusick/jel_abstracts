Z23|Parimutuel Betting On The Esports Duels: Reverse Favourite-Longshot Bias And Its Determinants|We analyse betting behaviour patterns of the visitors of the specialized betting website dedicated to the popular eSports game Counter-Strike: Global O ensive. The reverse favourite-longshot bias is found both in the in-sample and out-of-sample datasets. This phenomenon is rather unusual for parimutuel betting markets because favourite-longshot bias is more common. We de ne simple betting strategies based on the bets on underdogs and show that these strategies make a suciently large positive pro t, which is a sign of market ineciency. Next, we investigate determinants of the reverse favourite-longshot bias. We hypothesize that popular teams attract more unsophisticated gamblers which adds to the stronger reverse favourite-longshot bias in matches with such teams. Geographical proximity is found to be a signi cant factor that increases the bias, whereas the e ect of internet popularity measured by the number of team players' followers on Twitter surprisingly follows the U-shape curve
Z23|My kingdom for a horse (or a classic car)|This paper investigates the price determinants and investment performance of classic cars comprising various categories starting from veteran cars (built between 1888 and 1907) up to modern classics (built between 1975 and 1990). We examine a sample of 29,000 classic car auction sales conducted globally between 1998 and 2017. A hedonic pricing methodology is used to construct several classic car price indices, which enable a risk-return analysis. Classic cars appreciated annually by 3.37% and 5.63%, respectively in real and in nominal terms before transaction costs. Investments in ‘blue chip’ classic cars (12.50%) and Italian classics (11.28%) generate the highest annual nominal returns. On a risk-adjusted basis, classic cars have outperformed equity and other emotional assets such as art, but underperformed bonds and gold over the past two decades. The risk-adjusted returns on the category of affordable classics are similar to those of equity investments.
Z23|Megaâ€ Events And Tourism: The Case Of Brazil|Megaâ€ sporting events such as the FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup are expensive affairs. Host countries often justify the spending required to stage these events by predicting that megaâ€ events will draw large numbers of tourists. This paper analyzes monthly foreign tourist arrivals into Brazil between 2003 and 2015 and finds that the 2014 FIFA World Cup increased foreign tourism by roughly 1 million visitors. This number far exceeded expectations, but we show that roughly a quarter of this increase in foreign tourism was caused by the fortuitous advancement of Argentina's national team, and potential hosts should not count on the event to consistently produce outâ€ sized tourism figures. We conclude that onâ€ field results can greatly influence FIFA World Cup tourism. (JEL L83, F14)
Z23|Explaining the Number of Social Media Fans for North American and European Professional Sports Clubs with Determinants of Their Financial Value|The aim of this article is to investigate the explanatory variables of the number of Facebook fans and Twitter followers for professional sports clubs based on the financial value literature. Such explanatory variables are related to local market conditions and on-field and off-field performance. Based upon a sample of North American major league clubs and the most valuable European soccer clubs as evaluated by Forbes over the 2011-2013 period (423 observations), our results indicate a range of variables with a significant positive impact on the number of social media fans: population, no competing team in the market, current sports performance, historical sports performance, facility age, attendance, operating income, expenses/league mean, and being an English football club. An improved understanding of the effectiveness of clubs' social media presence is important for contemporary sport managers in terms of enhancing supporter communication, involvement, and accountability, as well as maximizing clubs' revenue generation possibilities. Our findings could help sport managers to realize their clubs' social media potential in pursuit of these objectives, specifically to understand which variables are under-exploited and why some clubs over-perform, which will allow managers to prioritize decisions to increase their number of social media fans and financial value.
Z23|Hidden Subsidies and the Public Ownership of Sports Facilities: The Case of Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara|Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California is an example of a private financing / public ownership arrangement. While the stadiumï¿½s construction resulted in no direct tax increases, this ownership arrangement allows the San Francisco 49ers to avoid many types of taxes on the income generated from Leviï¿½s Stadium. We estimate the total tax savings to the 49ers at between $106 and $213 million over the first 20 years of Leviï¿½s Stadium compared with a privately financed and owned option. We argue that tax savings inherent in private financing / public ownership arrangements represent indirect and hidden subsidies.
Z23|Market-internal financial regulation in sports as an anticompetitive institution|"Financial regulation in sports is usually discussed in the context of representing an instrument against ""financial doping"". Notwithstanding the merits of this discussion, this paper takes the opposite perspective and analyses how market-internal financial regulation itself may anticompetitively influence sporting results. Virtually every regulative financial intervention distorts sporting competition to some extent and creates beneficiaries and losers. Sometimes, the actual winners and losers of financial regulation stand in line with the (legitimate) goals of the regulation like limiting financial imbalances or preventing distortive midseason insolvencies of teams. However, financial regulation may also display unintended side-effects like protecting hitherto successful teams from new challengers, cementing the competitive order, creating foreclosure and entry barriers, or serving vested interests of powerful parties. All of these effects may also be hidden agendas by those who are implementing and enforcing market-internal financial regulation or influencing it. This paper analyses various types of budget caps (including salary caps) with respect to potentially anticompetitive effects. UEFA's so-called Financial Fair Play Regulations are highlighted as an example. Furthermore, the paper discusses allocation schemes of common revenues (like from the collective sale of broadcasting rights) as another area of financial regulation with potentially anticompetitive effects. Eventually, the effects of standards for accounting, financial management, and auditing are discussed."
Z23|Corruption in the Bidding, Construction, and Organization of Mega-Events: An Analysis of the Olympics and World Cup|In the processes required to host a sports mega-event, corruption has been prevalent on numerous occasions, leading to unnecessary costs becoming the ultimate responsibility of a host governmentï¿½s taxpayers. Little progress has been made in the prevention of such behavior. In this chapter, we examine the history of corruption in sports mega-events, namely the Olympics and World Cup, to identify parts of the bidding and preparation processes that are vulnerable to illicit behavior. We propose potential solutions to be implemented at various levels in order to prevent further corruption.
Z23|Professional Sports Events, Concerts, and Urban Place Based Policy: Evidence from the Staples Center|We analyze the relationship between sports events and concerts, important hospitality demand drivers and key components of many urban renewal projects, in the Staples Center in Los Angeles, an arena home to three pro teams, and nearby hotel performance, exploiting exogenous daily variation in the timing of games and concerts from 2002 to 2017. Results show a small positive impact on revenue per available room at hotels within one mile of the arena and an offsetting decrease at hotels located one to four miles away. Granting nearby hotels exemptions from Los Angeles hotel taxes reduces potential tourism-generated hotel tax revenue increases.

A szerzők egészen mást gondolnak arról, hogy mi a piaci és a bürokratikus koordináció kívánatos súlya, mi a kapcsolat az innováció és a munkanélküliség között, mennyire hatékony a szabadalmi rendszer - és általában, hogy mi jellemzi az ideális, innovációt támogató gazdaságpolitikát. A mélyebb összehasonlításból azonban az is kitűnik, hogy sokkal több dologban értenek egyet, mint az első pillantásra látszik.* Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) kód: D61, H54, Z23.

A szakirodalomban egyetértés mutatkozik abban, hogy a sportberuházásoknak nincs bizonyítható szignifikáns, pozitív hatásuk a gazdasági fejlődésre. Ugyanakkor számos olyan pozitív externália köthető a sporthoz, amely jelentős társadalmi hasznot nyújthat. Annak a kérdésnek a megválaszolásához, hogy ezek a pozitív externáliák valóban indokolhatják-e a közfinanszírozást, kidolgoztunk egy olyan költség-haszon elemzési keretrendszert, amely a társadalmi haszon monetarizálására is kísérletet tesz.

Z23|Willingness-To-Pay For Sporting Success Of Football Bundesliga Teams|" type=""main"" xml:id=""coep12148-abs-0001""> This study shows that fans and people living in the region of 28 Football Bundesliga teams from all three divisions are willing to support their team financially. Survey respondents were asked for their willingness-to-pay to avoid a negative outcome (e.g., relegation) and to achieve a positive outcome (e.g., promotion). Fan bonds are applied as an alternative payment vehicle within the contingent valuation method. The results show that different factors affect the decision to support the team and the actual amount of willingness-to-pay—for attendees and nonattendees. Public goods are particularly relevant for reporting a positive willingness-to-pay. (JEL Z23, L83, H41)"

Z23|Sport u vremenu globalizacije|U ovoj knjizi težište je na prikazu prodiranja profesionalnog sporta kao gospodarske djelatnosti, koja ima sva obilježja privredne grane. Ona spaja, kako ističe dr.sc Mario Ančić, bogato akademsko iskustvo i osobnu predanost vrhunskom svjetskom sportu. U knjizi se sport gleda kroz oči ne samo vrhunskih znanstvenika, nego i sudionika velikih sportskih manifestacija. Želja autora je pokazati kako je sportska djelatnost postala dinamičan sektor ekonomije sa stopom rasta većom od prosjeka ostalih grana, što ubrzava razvoj gospodarstva u cjelini. Ova je knjiga prikazala evoluciju sporta i međusobnog odnosa sporta i društva kroz povijest te njegove promjene . Čitatelj ima mogućnost komparacije razvoja, strukture, djelatnosti i utjecaja svakog pojedinog sporta, naglašava prof.dr.sc Ivo Andrijanić, profesor emeritus, DIU Libertas. Knjiga se bavi ekonomijom sporta, pisana na znanju, iskustvu i aktivnom osobnom sudjelovanju u vrhunskom svjetskom sportu, uz prikaz biografija vrhunskih svjetskih sportaša, a povezivanje dva zasebna velika područja, gospodarstva i sporta njezina je osnovna ekonomska vrijednost, istaknuo je prof.dr.sc. Ljubo Jurčić, sa zagrebačkog Ekonomskog fakulteta. Mogli bismo ju nazvati i svojevrsnom malom enciklopedijom jer u njoj se nalazi pregled BDP strukture svjetskog proizvoda, životopisi najpoznatijih svjetskih i hrvatskih sportaša, lista najpoznatijih svjetskih managera te pregled sportova po važnosti i težini . Vrlo su kvalitetne analize kao i statistički podaci koji čitatelju pojašnjavaju način djelovanja velikih sportskih organizacija te fenomen sporta kao jednog od vrlo važnih čimbenika gospodarstva. Spomenuti su i dobitnici medalja te sportski rekordi, a obrađen je i fenomen uključivanja sportaša u razne grane gospodarstva i politike. Provedena je i opsežna razrada sportskih disciplina te njihova vrijednost na gospodarskom tržištu. Posebno je poglavlje posvećeno i Olimpijskim igrama, koje su od amaterskog natjecanja prerasle u ozbiljan događaj koji generira znatan novac.
Z23|Overconfident Investors, Predictable Returns, and Excessive Trading|The last several decades have witnessed a shift away from a fully rational paradigm of financial markets toward one in which investor behavior is influenced by psychological biases. Two principal factors have contributed to this evolution: a body of evidence showing how psychological bias affects the behavior of economic actors; and an accumulation of evidence that is hard to reconcile with fully rational models of security market trading volumes and returns. In particular, asset markets exhibit trading volumes that are high, with individuals and asset managers trading aggressively, even when such trading results in high risk and low net returns. Moreover, asset prices display patterns of predictability that are difficult to reconcile with rational expectations-based theories of price formation. In this paper, we discuss the role of overconfidence as an explanation for these patterns.
Z23|Eurozone Convergence Impact on the Romanian Fiscal Budgetary System|The Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Romania's main responsibility is to strengthen the national economy, to ensure real and nominal convergence, the integration in the Economic and Monetary Union. Basically, the completion of the integration of the Romanian state. In this context, special attention should be paid to the convergence. In its realization requiring strict coordination of macroeconomic policies, and thus of the fiscal and budgetary emphasizing structural reforms and ensuring a stable economic environment and robust. Therefore, the content of this paper includes an analysis of measures taken to strengthen fiscal discipline and how the fiscal targets have been or can be met.
Z23|Going for the Gold: The Economics of the Olympics|"In this paper, we explore the costs and benefits of hosting the Olympic Games. On the cost side, there are three major categories: general infrastructure such as transportation and housing to accommodate athletes and fans; specific sports infrastructure required for competition venues; and operational costs, including general administration as well as the opening and closing ceremony and security. Three major categories of benefits also exist: the short-run benefits of tourist spending during the Games; the long-run benefits or the ""Olympic legacy"" which might include improvements in infrastructure and increased trade, foreign investment, or tourism after the Games; and intangible benefits such as the ""feel-good effect"" or civic pride. Each of these costs and benefits will be addressed in turn, but the overwhelming conclusion is that in most cases the Olympics are a money-losing proposition for host cities; they result in positive net benefits only under very specific and unusual circumstances. Furthermore, the cost–benefit proposition is worse for cities in developing countries than for those in the industrialized world. In closing, we discuss why what looks like an increasingly poor investment decision on the part of cities still receives significant bidding interest and whether changes in the bidding process of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) will improve outcomes for potential hosts."
Z23|Do New Sports Facilities Attract New Businesses?|We examine the impact of new sports facilities on new businesses, an unexplored topic in the literature. We use data from the Dun and Bradstreet MarketPlace files to examine how new sports facilities affect nearby business activity in terms of the number of new businesses and workers. We find no evidence of increased new businesses openings after the opening of new sports facilities in 12 U.S. cities in the 2000s; employment at new businesses near new facilities is larger than at new businesses elsewhere in the metropolitan statistical area; this increase cannot be linked to businesses in any specific industry.
Z23|Where’s the Money? Incentives, Coaching, and the Long-term Athlete Development Model|The purpose in this paper is to examine the effectiveness of the long-term athlete development (LTAD) model compared to a model based on economic incentives. The emphasis, however, is on the LTAD model and reasons why it is incompatible with coach education, particular the coaching of judo. The major influences on the LTAD approach are reviewed along with recent evidence that leads to questions about its usefulness. While Judo Canada has attempted to implement the LTAD model in its program to train coaches, there remains a great deal of incongruity between the LTAD and the pedagogy that often characterizes judo. As a result,coaches who follow a program of certification do not, subsequently, employ what they have learned but, rather, return to their ‘old ways’. I argue that the incentives for becoming certified are wrong. I conclude that, rather than the attempt to standardize coaching via the LTAD model is misguided because a system that facilitates innovation is desired. Financial incentives whereby coaches and athletes are amply rewarded for success provide a better route to innovation and the Olympic podium than long-term athlete development model.
Z23|The relevance of sports financing| According to estimations sports exploit approximately two percent of world GDP. In addition sports represent an important function in culture, socialization and also in education, act an outstanding role in economy, as well, though academic researchers cannot find positive relationship between sports financing and economic growth. Sports were originally civil actions, with non-profit nature, where they did not aspire to reach high returns, but fulfilment of sport itself. However returns can be realized and reinvested in sports. This paper tries to collect the different aspects of sports financing in order to highlight its relevance.
Z23|Sports financing in Croatia| Sport is a complex social activity that encompasses various areas. Some of these activities come within the category of public needs, which implies that sport is an activity of wider social interest and requires public intervention in its financing. These needs are determined by law and are an integral part of state and local budgets. It is also indisputable that the sport is an activity of exceptional significance for the society and it is equally clear that the investment into sport in Croatia is not proportional to that significance and top scores, which are achieved by the Croatian athletes. Sport can be in a partner relationship with the economy and the promoter of social changes and habits, but in order to become and remain that, general public has to be truthfully interested into sports.
Z23|Sport as power of integration among minorities| The opportunities and development of skills in the field of sports may open a door to social inclusion that also facilitates social integration. Based on the funding provided by the national sports strategy and integration, the research project can be developed further on and implemented. The efforts of the European Union (EU) and of the European Council towards the member states are carried out through its directives, and the analyses of these documents provide guidelines for the elaboration of the Hungarian Roma strategies. Funding is one of the key factors for the elaboration of Roma integration strategy and its efficiency. The research highlights upon the way of thinking and mentality of Roma young people about sports currently, and on the importance of sport affairs for them. Also, reflects on the factors which promote motivation to have successful career goals and achieve those based on the program. The sports integration survey suggests conclusions on the role of mentoring in Roma youngsters’ studies, in sports, in building social relations, the role model motivating for them, or on the supportive role of the parents or even the lack of it in their families. The expected result would be a survey on sporting habits of the Roma minority and disadvantaged youth and their positioning in education through which we could develop programs to promote the integration of the Roma minority and to improve their general circumstances.
Z23|Information content of a sports undertaking’s statements serving different purposes – particularly with reference to the player rights| In the 21st century, sport is not just a fun, social cohesive force but also a business; it has become an independent industry by now and several countries possess developed sport markets. According to estimates, sport accounts for 4% of the EU’s GDP. The actuality of our research is given by the fact that the economic aspect of sports develops continuously which is also due to that more and more amounts already stream into sports in our days. In Hungary, sport is mainly state aided and has mostly financing problems while the sport businesses existing in the more developed Western Europe are principally sponsored by the private sector. The government considers sport as a strategic branch (HERCZEG et al, 2015) and manages as such because they see the international breakthrough potencies in sport as well. Sport companies must also adapt the business-based thinking, which requires the strategic planning and operation (BECSKY, 2011). The research covers the subject of economic approach of the players’ rights. The task of accounting is to give a true and fair image about the property, income and financial situation of an undertaking. Information provided by accounting is essential for both the management decisionmaking and the market operators. In Hungary, the sports undertakings, as each managing entity, have to prepare their statements according to the Act C of 2000 on Accounting (AoA.) (NAGY – BÁCSNÉ BÁBA, 2014). The purpose of this research is to examine how a domestic sports undertaking demonstrates the value of available players in the books and how the incomes and expenditures incurred with the players are accounted for, based on the regulations of the Hungarian, international associations and the Union of European Football Associations (hereinafter: UEFA). In order that the leaders of the businesses can make quick and appropriate economic decisions, it is essential in this intensively changing world that an enterprise should have a well-functioning accounting system based on up-to-date information. International Financial Reporting Standards (hereinafter: IFRS) are intended to provide the comparability across borders. Firstly, we deal with the accounting reporting system, both the Hungarian, international financial reporting standards and, relating to UEFA, the investigation of the intangible assets to a great extent during analysing the balance sheets. Then, we examine the income statements from the viewpoint player transfers. To what extent the rules of a statement laid down by UEFA differ from the ones of a statement prepared according to AoA? What is the difference in domestic and international relations? In this study, we search after the answers for questions mentioned before.
Z23|Entwicklung der öffentlichen Ausgaben für Sport im vereinten Deutschland|Im Bewusstsein darüber, dass der Sport als Konsumaktivität von seinen Produkteigenschaften her ein meritorisches Gut mit positiven Gemeinwohleigenschaften ist, engagiert sich der Staat üblicherweise in der Sportförderung durch Bereitstellung einer Basisinfrastruktur an Sportanlagen und -geräten (objektbezogene Sportförderung) und Betreuern und Trainern (subjektbezogene Sportförderung). Darüber hinaus bezuschusst der Staat den weitestgehend ehrenamtlich organisierten Sport der Sportvereine und -verbände durch mittelbare und unmittelbare Transferleistungen (vgl. Langer 2006, S. 121). Unter anderem gewährt der Staat Steuervorteile für die gemeinnützigen Sportvereine, stellt seine Sportanlagen den Sportvereinen kostenlos oder stark vergünstigt zur Verfügung oder aber bezuschusst direkt die Vereins- und Verbandsarbeit. Dennoch darf nicht verkannt werden, dass sich die Sportvereine primär durch Zahlungen ihrer Mitglieder finanzieren (vgl. Breuer & Wicker 2008, S. 18). Es stellt sich nun die Frage, ob die derzeit vom Staat getätigten sportspezifischen Ausgaben den identifizierten sportspezifischen Investitionsbedarf befriedigen können. Vor diesem Hintergrund nimmt das vorliegende Discussion Paper eine detaillierte Bestandsaufnahme und Analyse der durch die Öffentliche Hand getätigten Ausgaben für Sportzwecke vor. Dazu werden die sportspezifischen Detailergebnisse der Rechnungsstatistik der öffentlichen Haushalte für den Gesamtzeitraum 1992 bis 2005 ausgewertet. Abschnitt 2 befasst sich zunächst mit der Entwicklung der sportbezogenen Nettoausgaben der Gebietskörperschaften für die drei sportspezifischen Ausgabenkategorien „Badeanstalten“, „Sportstätten“ und „Förderung des Sports“. Innerhalb des dritten Abschnitts werden anschließend die unmittelbaren Ausgaben des Bundes und der 16 Bundesländer für Sportzwecke betrachtet und abschließend den zugeordneten Einnahmen gegenübergestellt. Im darauffolgenden Abschnitt 4 erfolgt eine vertiefte Analyse der Ausgabenstrukturen nach Ausgabenarten. Auch hier werden wieder Entwicklungen auch für die Ebene der Bundesländer separat dargestellt.
Z23|Marriage Matters: Spousal Similarity in Life Satisfaction|Spousal similarity in life satisfaction is important for causal theories of life satisfaction. This study examined the concurrent and cross-lagged spousal similarity in life satisfaction over a 21-year period based on 847 married couples in the German Socio-Economic Panel. Concurrent spousal similarity (e.g., husband 1990 & wife 1990) was considerably higher than one-year lagged similarity (e.g., husband 1990 & wife 1991). This finding reveals spousal similarity in the variable component of life satisfaction that fluctuates from year to year. In addition, cross-lagged spousal similarity systematically decreased with length of the time lag. This finding reveals spousal similarity in the changing component of life satisfaction. Finally, there was considerable cross-lagged spousal similarity over the longest time lag (e.g., husband 1984 & wife 2004). This finding reveals spousal similarity in the stable component of life satisfaction. The evidence for a changing component in spousal similarity in life satisfaction provides conclusive evidence that changes in one spouse's life satisfaction are systematically related to changes in the other spouse's life satisfaction.
Z23|The Quest for the Cup: Assessing the Economic Impact of the World Cup| Baade R. A. and Matheson V. A. (2004) The quest for the cup: assessing the economic impact of the World Cup, Reg. Studies 38, 343-354. Hosting the World Cup, the world's second largest sporting event, is a potentially expensive affair. The co-hosts of the 2002 games, Japan and South Korea, spent a combined US$4 billion building new facilities or refurbishing old facilities in preparation for the event. An ex post analysis of the 1994 World Cup held in the US suggests that the economic impact of the event cannot justify this magnitude of expenditures and that host cities experienced cumulative losses of $5·5 to $9·3 billion as opposed to ex ante estimates of a $4 billion gain touted by event boosters. Potential hosts should consider with care whether the award of the World Cup is an honour or a burden.
