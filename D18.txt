D18|Non-salient fees in the mortgage market|This paper studies supply-side product pricing when consumers underreact to non-salient fees. Using comprehensive data on issued and offered mortgages in the UK, I document that lenders differ substantially in the fees they charge, and that borrowers appear less overall cost-sensitive to products with fees. In order to distinguish from demand factors such as unobservable preferences or product characteristics, I show that lenders pass on firm-specific funding cost shocks via fees, but not interest rates, consistent with strategic pricing of fees, and maintaining competitive prices in the salient price dimension, interest rates. I further find heterogeneity in pricing across lenders: those who rely on high fees tend to have higher funding cost, lower return on equity and larger branch networks, in line with a specialization equilibrium in which high-cost lenders are able to match with less cost-sensitive consumers.
D18|Attention-driven demand for bonus contracts|In many markets supply contracts include a series of small, regular payments made by consumers and a single, large bonus that consumers receive at some point during the contractual period. But, if for instance its production costs exceed its value to consumers, such a bonus creates inefficiencies. We offer a novel explanation for the frequent occurrence of bonus contracts, which builds on a model of attentional focusing. Our main result identifies market conditions under which bonus contracts should be observed: while a monopolist pays a bonus to consumers - if at all - only for low-value goods, firms standing in competition always - i.e., independent of the consumers’ valuation - offer bonus contracts. Thus, competition does not eliminate but rather exacerbates inefficiencies arising from contracting with focused agents. Common contract schemes in markets for electricity, telephony, and bank accounts are consistent with our model, but cannot be reconciled with alternative approaches such as models on consumption smoothing, (quasi-)hyperbolic discounting, or switching costs.
D18|Financial Consequences of Identity Theft: Evidence from Consumer Credit Bureau Records|This paper examines how a negative shock to the security of personal finances due to severe identity theft changes consumer credit behavior. Using a unique data set of consumer credit records and alerts indicating identity theft and the exogenous timing of victimization, we show that the immediate effects of fraud on credit files are typically negative, small, and transitory. After those immediate effects fade, identity theft victims experience persistent, positive changes in credit characteristics, including improved Risk Scores. Consumers also exhibit caution with credit by having fewer open revolving accounts while maintaining total balances and credit limits. Our results are consistent with consumer inattention to credit

D18|Asymmetric information on the market for energy efficiency: Insights from the credence goods literature|Imperfect information is widely acknowledged to hamper the adoption of energy efficient technologies. In this paper, we study supply-side implications of the associated incentive structure. We build on existing evidence suggesting that energy efficiency owns a credence component, whereby the supply side of the market has more information about what technology is best for consumers. The literature on credence goods markets suggests that informational advantage by an expert-seller leads to market inefficiencies, including low trade volume. We start by developing a simple framework to study supply-side incentives related to the provision of energy efficient technologies. We then document inefficiencies and potential remedies by discussing linkages between an empirical literature on credence goods and that on the market for energy efficiency. Doing so, we identify policy implications and research gaps that are relevant for the adoption of energy efficiency technologies.
D18|Monthly Payment Targeting and the Demand for Maturity|In this paper, we provide evidence of the importance of monthly payments in the market for consumer installment debt. Auto debt in particular has grown rapidly since the Great Recession and has eclipsed credit cards in total debt outstanding. Auto-loan maturities have also increased such that most auto-loan originations now have a term of over 72 months. We document three phenomena we jointly refer to as monthly payment targeting. First, using data from 500,000 used auto loans and discontinuities in contract terms offered by hundreds of lenders, we show that demand is more sensitive to maturity than interest rate, consistent with consumers managing payment size when making debt decisions. Second, many consumers appear to employ segregated mental accounts, spending exogenous payment savings on larger loans. Third, consumers bunch at round-number monthly payment amounts, consistent with the use of budgeting heuristics. These patterns hold in subsamples of constrained and unconstrained borrowers, challenging liquidity constraints as a complete explanation. Our estimates suggest that borrower focus on payment size, combined with credit-supply shocks to maturity, could significantly affect aggregate outstanding debt.
D18|Freeing Financial Education via Tablets: Experimental Evidence from Colombia|Financial knowledge is critical for making sound decisions that foster financial health and protect consumers from predation. A widely-used tool for building this capability is financial education. Yet evidence suggests that conventional approaches which teach concepts in classroom-style settings are ineffective and expensive at scale, especially for lower-income users. More recent findings indicate that customizing financial education to the needs, interests, and location of participants may increase impact, though doing so in a cost-effective and scalable way remains challenging. This randomized evaluation of a tablet-based financial education program with mostly female recipients of a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program in Colombia offers evidence for how to design and scale an effective digital-based financial education program. Results indicate that the LISTA Initiative had significant positive impacts on financial knowledge, attitudes, practices, and performance, increasing for poorer, less educated, and more rural populations, with users exhibiting increased financial health over two years later. Critical mechanisms included well-designed content and a social learning component. Yet the longer-term impact on formal financial inclusion was limited, suggesting the possible benefits of combining supply-side solutions with financial education interventions.
D18|Predicting Consumer Default: A Deep Learning Approach|We develop a model to predict consumer default based on deep learning. We show that the model consistently outperforms standard credit scoring models, even though it uses the same data. Our model is interpretable and is able to provide a score to a larger class of borrowers relative to standard credit scoring models while accurately tracking variations in systemic risk. We argue that these properties can provide valuable insights for the design of policies targeted at reducing consumer default and alleviating its burden on borrowers and lenders, as well as macroprudential regulation.
D18|Deceptive Products on Platforms| On many online platforms, sellers offer products with additional fees and features. Platforms often deliberately shroud these fees from consumers. Examples are shipping fees, luggage fees on flight-aggregator websites, or resort fees and upgrades on hotel booking platforms. We explore the incentives of two-sided platforms to disclose additional fees and design a transparent marketplace when consumers might naively ignore shrouded additional fees. First, we find that platforms have stronger incentives to shroud additional fees than sellers in the absence of platforms. This result holds for monopoly platforms and in some competitive settings. Second, competition might induce platforms to regulate additional fees, which benefits consumers. We discuss connections to frequent practices like drip pricing, and platforms like Amazon or eBay regulating shipping fees.
D18|Children and consumer temptations - Financial personality test for children|Goals: Our research aimed to explore the financial attitudes of teenagers (10-14 years old). Its goal is to compare the answers given by the children surveyed with the results of the Financial Personality Test addressing adults. Methods: The survey consists of 20 questions and respondents (2067 upper secondary pupils) can assess on a scale from 1 to 5 how typical of them a certain finance-related quality, behaviour or attitude is. Results: Results show that the upper secondary age-group possess higher level skills in handling money than previously presumed, they have well-established financial habits, they are willing to work for money while they know exactly how much money they have and how much things cost. They are much more exposed to temptations encouraging consumption than adults, therefore they are more likely to face financial difficulties, they do not always know what their money is spent on. At the same time, children are less likely to expect their parents to give them everything than the parents themselves. The study classifies respondent children into three clusters: 1. conscious savers, 2. spenders, 3. the passive, incompetent in their finances. Recommendations: Spenders should learn about controlling shopping impulses, planning and economizing, while the financially fragile passive group should learn about financial strategy, coping skills and motivation as well.
D18|More competition in delegated portfolio management: A win-win situation? An experimental analysis|With a novel design, we investigate how competition between fund managers and disclosure of other managers' fees and performance influence fees, risk taken, earnings and investor concentration in a fund management experiment. We find that more competition and disclosure leads to a significant reduction of fees â€“ the relative decrease being larger for Management Fees than for Performance Fees. While the decrease in fees does not affect manager's investment strategies, it significantly increases investors' readiness to entrust their funds to a manager. This leads to higher overall earnings, with the benefits going to investors and those fund managers who are able to attract investors. While there is an extensive literature arguing that a competitive environment may lead to unwanted outcomes, our results suggest that more competition is mostly beneficial to investors and those fund managers that succeed in attracting investors.
D18|Market power, efficiency and welfare performance of banks: evidence from the Ghanaian banking industry|The study analyses the welfare performance of banks’ lending services in the Ghanaian banking industry with emphasis on the role of market power and efficiency. We made use of pooled OLS regression with fixed effect model. For robustness, we adopted Prais–Winsten (1954) regression and two-stage least squares (2SLS) instrumental variables procedures on an unbalanced panel data of 24 banks for years 2009 through 2017. The results reveal that during our study period, there was a welfare loss of about 0.433 percent of observed total loans. Encouragingly, cost efficiency in the banking system fits well within the world’s mean efficiency but has been decreasing over time. Further, there is evidence that prices have not moved toward a competitive level. Cost efficiency estimates are found to be negatively associated with loss of consumer surplus estimates. Market power is found to be positively related to a loss in consumer surplus. Additional analysis shows that the market power effect is dominant in both domestic and large banks. Overall, the results indicate that market power and bank efficiency are competing interests for policymakers in their consideration of policy reforms geared toward an efficient and well-functioning banking system. An additional implication of these results suggests that antitrust enforcement may be socially beneficial to provide an incentive for competitive pricing in the lending business segment of banking. Other implications are also discussed.
D18|Beyond quantified ignorance: Rebuilding rationality without the bias bias|If we reassess the rationality question under the assumption that the uncertainty of the natural world is largely unquantifiable, where do we end up? In this article the author argues that we arrive at a statistical, normative, and cognitive theory of ecological rationality. The main casualty of this rebuilding process is optimality. Once we view optimality as a formal implication of quantified uncertainty rather than an ecologically meaningful objective, the rationality question shifts from being axiomatic/probabilistic in nature to being algorithmic/ predictive in nature. These distinct views on rationalitymirror fundamental and longstanding divisions in statistics.
D18|Systemic usury and the European Consumer Credit Directive|Usury is a frequent occurrence in consumer credit markets and particularly affects low-income households. Systemic usury exploits poverty by shifting usury into additional products and leveraging usury gains by stringing together individual loan agreements. This paper reviews the economic rationale for usury legislation and on this basis evaluates the European Consumer Credit Directive 2008/48/EC. Systemic usury is a market failure. The most powerful explanations for such failure in consumer credit markets are monopoly power, where the consumer is locked in a bilateral credit relationship, discrimination through risk-based pricing, and negative externalities, where the least solvent borrowers are cross-subsidized by the more solvent ones. Incomplete information of consumers cannot explain systemic usury in credit markets, because even fully informed consumers would be discriminated and trapped into a situation of bilateral monopoly. However, the European Consumer Credit Directive is primarily based on the model of incomplete information, which it seeks to correct by informational duties. As a consequence, usurious practices and products are implicitly acknowledged as legal, which has eroded the national combat against usury. Therefore, this Directive is not effective and must be reformed.
D18|Vague lies and lax standards of proof: On the law and economics of advice|This paper analyzes a persuasion game where a seller provides (un)biased and (im)precise advice and may be fined by an authority for misleading the buyers. In the equilibrium, biasing the advice and making it noisier are complements. The advice becomes both more biased and less precise with a stricter standard of proof employed by the authority, a larger share of credulous consumers, and a higher buyers' heterogeneity. The optimal policy of the authority is characterized in terms of a standard of proof and resources devoted to the investigation.
D18|Digital Identity: the current state of affairs|In a world where the rise in the use of the Internet is increasing exponentially, the ability to prove your identity is crucial for the economic, financial and social development. Individuals and companies need identity solutions valid across different services, markets, standards and technologies.
D18|Revalorisation 2017 des contrats d’assurance-vie et de capitalisation – engagements à dominante épargne et retraite individuelle|Dans le contexte de taux d’intérêt bas persistants, le niveau des revalorisations attribuées par les organismes d’assurance aux polices d’assurance-vie et aux bons de capitalisation appelle une vigilance particulière de l’autorité de supervision, tant au regard du contrôle prudentiel que de la bonne exécution des termes contractuels et des dispositions afférant à la participation aux résultats.
D18|Revalorisation 2017 des contrats d’assurance-vie et de capitalisation – engagements à dominante retraite collectifs|Cette analyse se concentre sur les engagements liés aux retraites dans le cadre de l’assurance-vie, en regroupant plusieurs catégories de contrats1, représentant 125 milliards d’euros de provisions mathématiques moyennes en 2017. La plus importante de ces catégories, les contrats collectifs en cas de vie, représente 79% des encours moyens des contrats d’assurance-vie à dominante retraite. Le taux de revalorisation moyen des contrats collectifs à dominante retraite (hors retraite à points) s’élève à 2,47% au titre de 2017 (net de frais de chargement et de prélèvements sociaux), contre 2,54%, en 2016 sur le même périmètre et après fiabilisation des données. Cette baisse de 7 points de base est comparable à celle observée sur les taux de revalorisation des contrats individuels (de -10 points de base, le taux moyen étant de 1,83% en 2017) et nettement inférieure à l’année précédente (-30 points de base entre 2015 et 2016). La baisse de la rémunération servie est homogène, quel que soit le type de produits. Les taux de revalorisation moyens des contrats PERP sont les plus faibles du marché à 1,49% (-8 points de base entre 2016 et 2017), alors que ceux des contrats collectifs en cas de vie, baissent de 5 points de base pour s’établir à 2,63%. Les taux techniques rattachés aux contrats collectifs à dominante retraite sont élevés (1,48%). Il existe de plus des contraintes de taux techniques très différentes entre les catégories, les PERP ayant un taux technique nul. Les contrats de Retraite Professionnelle Supplémentaire (RPS) offerts par les Institutions de Retraite Professionnelle (IRP) agréées sont au contraire très contraints par leurs taux techniques plus élevés. Ainsi, l’environnement de taux bas pourrait à terme peser sur ce segment du marché de l’assurance-vie collective. Malgré cela, les contrats collectifs sont majoritairement revalorisés à un niveau supérieur au taux technique sous l’effet de contraintes contractuelles engageant l’organisme au-delà de la réglementation ou de la pression des souscripteurs.
D18|Deception and Competition in Search Markets|We study the interplay between deception and consumer search in a search market where firms may deceive some naive consumers with inferior products that display hidden (bad) attributes. We derive an equilibrium in which both superior and inferior quality is offered and show that as search frictions vanish, superior goods are entirely driven out of the market. Deception harms sophisticated consumers, as it forces them to search longer to find a superior product. We argue that policy interventions that reduce search frictions such as the standardization of price and package formats may harm welfare. In contrast, reducing the number of naive consumers through transparency policies and education campaigns as well as a minimum quality standard can improve welfare.
D18|Consumer Search with and without Tracking|In this paper, I develop a tractable framework with sequential consumer search to address the effect of tracking on market outcomes. Tracking search histories is informative about consumersâ€™ valuations because different consumer types have different stopping probabilities. With tracking, the unique equilibrium price path is increasing whereas without tracking, an average uniform price prevails. Welfare effects largely depend on how tracking affects consumersâ€™ search persistence. For intermediate search costs, tracking based price discrimination exacerbates the holdup problem and leads to inefficiently low search persistence. For high search costs instead, tracking prevents a market breakdown as low prices conditional on short search histories secure consumers a positive surplus from search. Tracking prevails endogenously when consumers can dynamically opt out from tracking. This holds since disclosing their search history is always individually rational for consumers, irrespective of the overall effect on consumer surplus.
D18|Policy Evaluation in Behavioral Models|"This paper studies the data requirements to conduct an unambiguous policy evaluation when consumers may exhibit nonstandard preferences. We theoretically analyze how the equilibrium combinations before and after a policy introduction allow to clearly assess different economic indicators. Specifically, we study the data requirements for an unambiguous evaluation of two distinct consumer ""cooling off"" policies in a model in which consumers may exhibit a projection bias when making consumption decisions. We find that market-level data can help to make simple policy evaluations using baseline statistics and sometimes even discriminate between different classes of consumer preferences. We further discuss the generalizability to other models and the use for ex-ante policy design."
D18|Playing with Fire? Debt near Retirement in Canada|Because retired households cannot adjust quickly to shocks, for example by working more, they represent a vulnerable group when credit conditions deteriorate. We analyze the evolution of debt among households nearing retirement in Canada over the period 1999-2016. First, we find that debt as a ratio of income has risen considerably over that period and debt as a fraction of assets has also doubled even tough assets remain roughly five times as large as debt. Second, we report that mortgage debt has risen the most but that average mortgage payments have remained relatively constant over the period due to the downward trend in borrowing costs. Finally, we find that a small but significant fraction households are playing with fire, being vul-nerable to a sudden rise on borrowing costs or a drop in house values which could jeopardize their standard of living in retirement.
D18|Bait and Ditch: Consumer Naiveté and Salesforce Incentives|We analyze a model of price competition between a transparent retailer and a deceptive one in a market where a fraction of consumers is naive. The transparent retailer is an independent shop managed by its owner. The deceptive retailer belongs to a chain and is operated by a manager. The retailers sell an identical base product, but the deceptive one also offers an add-on. Rational consumers never consider buying the add-on, yet naive ones can be talked into buying it. By offering its store manager a contract that pushes him to never sell the base good without the add-on, the chain can induce an equilibrium in which both retailers obtain more-than-competitive profits. The equilibrium features market segmentation with the deceptive retailer targeting only naive consumers whereas the transparent retailer serves only rational ones. Welfare is not monotone in the fraction of naive consumers in the market. Hence, policy interventions designed to de-bias naive consumers might backfire.
D18|Regulation with Experimentation: Ex Ante Approval, Ex Post Withdrawal, and Liability|Dynamic adoption policies of activities with uncertain returns are characterized by three key decisions: in the ex ante experimentation phase, the decisions when to abandon experimentation and when to introduce to market; in the ex post learning phase, the decision when to withdraw following the accumulation of bad news. In a tractable continuous-time model, we study the optimal mix of the three instruments regulators employ to align the private incentives of firms: ex ante approval regulation, ex post withdrawal regulation, and liability. Our results can rationalize the array of regulatory environments observed across applications ranging from product safety to patent protection. We also consider costly lying and show that the social planner can be better off when the firm privately observes research results.
D18|Arbitration with Uninformed Consumers|This paper argues that firms have an informational advantage over consumers in selecting arbitrators in consumer arbitration. We document how the selection process impacts arbitration outcomes by studying roughly 9,000 consumer arbitration cases in the securities industry. Securities disputes present a good laboratory: arbitration is mandatory for all disputes, eliminating selection concerns; the parties choose arbitrators from a randomly generated list, and arbitrators are compensated only if chosen; and the selection mechanism is similar to other major arbitration forums. We document three facts. First, some arbitrators are systematically more industry friendly than others. Second, firms appear to exploit this information: despite a randomly generated list of potential arbitrators, industry-friendly arbitrators are forty percent more likely to be selected. Third, more experienced firms and less sophisticated consumers select more industry friendly arbitrators. We develop and calibrate a model of arbitrator selection with uninformed consumers. We find that competition between arbitrators exacerbates the informational advantage of firms resulting in all arbitrators slanting towards being industry friendly and resulting in roughly $16,000 lower awards. Counterfactuals suggest that several proposals aimed at improving customer outcomes in arbitration, such as increasing arbitrator incentives and increasing the number of strikes, lead to quantitatively more industry friendly arbitration due to firms' informational advantage.
D18|Price transparency in residential electricity: Experiments for regulatory policy|"We report two laboratory studies conducted in collaboration with a national energy regulator. The first tested whether consumers have difficulties when confronted with unit prices expressed as discounts from standard rates that vary between suppliers. The results imply that such discounts bias decisions and that percentage discounts reduce consumers' ability to integrate product information. The second study pretested an intervention: a mandatory ""Estimated Annual Bill"" (EAB) calculated for a customer with average usage. The results indicate that the EAB is likely to help consumers to assess the value of advertised packages, to choose packages with lower unit rates, and to integrate product information accurately. In addition to providing evidence for policy, our findings are consistent with decision-making mechanisms that give increased weight to product information that is easy to process."
D18|Villains or Scapegoats? The Role of Subprime Borrowers in Driving the U.S. Housing Boom|An expansion in mortgage credit to subprime borrowers is widely believed to have been a principal driver of the 2002–06 U.S. house price boom. Contrary to this belief, we show that the house price and subprime booms occurred in different places. Counties with the largest home price appreciation between 2002 and 2006 had the largest declines in the share of purchase mortgages to subprime borrowers. We also document that the expansion in speculative mortgage products and underwriting fraud was not concentrated among subprime borrowers.
D18|Liquidity Crises in the Mortgage Market|Non-banks originated about half of all mortgages in 2016, and 75% of mortgages insured by the FHA or VA. Both shares are much higher than those observed at any point in the 2000s. We describe in this paper how non-bank mortgage companies are vulnerable to liquidity pressures in both their loan origination and servicing activities, and we document that this sector in aggregate appears to have minimal resources to bring to bear in a stress scenario. We show how the same liquidity issues unfolded during the financial crisis, leading to the failure of many non-bank companies, requests for government assistance, and harm to consumers. The high share of non-bank lenders in FHA and VA lending suggests that the government has significant exposure to the vulnerabilities of non-bank lenders, but this issue has received very little attention in the housing-reform debate.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D18|Hidden Baggage : Behavioral Responses to Changes in Airline Ticket Tax Disclosure|We examine the impact on air travelers of an enforcement action issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation in January 2012 that required U.S. air carriers and online travel agents to incorporate all mandatory taxes and fees into their advertised fares. Exploiting cross-itinerary ticket tax variation within international city market pairs, we provide evidence that the more prominent display of tax-inclusive prices is associated with a significant reduction in tax incidence on consumers and a decline in passenger volume along more heavily-taxed itineraries. Ticket revenues are commensurately reduced. These results suggest a pronounced degree of inattention to ticket taxes prior to the introduction of full-fare advertising and reinforces the theoretical predictions and experimental findings of the literature on tax salience in a quasi-experimental context where taxes average more than $100 per ticket and where firms may engage in price-setting behavior.
D18|Does CFPB oversight crimp credit?|We study the effects of regulatory oversight by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on credit supply as well as bank risk-taking, growth, and operating costs. We use a difference-in-differences approach, making use of the fact that banks below a $10 billion size cutoff are exempt from CFPB supervision and enforcement activities. We find little evidence that CFPB oversight significantly reduces the overall volume of mortgage lending. However, we find some evidence of changes in the composition of lending—CFPB-supervised banks originated fewer loans to risky borrowers, offset by an increase in large “jumbo” mortgages. We find no clear evidence of substitution in lending between bank and nonbank subsidiaries, or effects on asset growth or bank noninterest expenses.
D18|Credit Card Landscape Update|This recap of a January 2017 Payment Cards Center workshop conducted by Frank Martien of First Annapolis Consulting, Inc. (since acquired by and now part of Accenture) adds to the literature on conditions in the markets for consumer and commercial credit cards, and credit and debit cards use by small businesses, at a point some years after the 2007–2009 recession. Some insights are provided as to how the supply and demand sides for these products are operating after this major economic disruption and the enactment of two pieces of legislation affecting payment cards. The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act) and the Durbin Amendment, which went into effect in 2010 and 2011, respectively, had implications for the market for payment cards used by consumers and small businesses. Commercial cards used by corporations and government were not affected by these regulations, but there have still been major developments in that product line. Readers will get a glimpse of some of the innovations occurring in commercial cards.
D18|Combining Forces to Combat Elder Financial Victimization How Consumers Can Avoid the Financial Pitfalls of Cognitive Aging and What They Should Be Asking Their Financial Institutions|Medical research has linked financial vulnerability to accelerated cognitive aging — the process by which cognitive abilities decline with age. Consumers who understand the risks of cognitive aging and what their financial institutions are doing to detect and deter financial crimes are better positioned to safeguard their retirement savings. In this paper, we examine how consumers and financial institutions can prepare for the financial pitfalls of aging. We present seven important steps that consumers aged 50 or older can take to protect themselves. We also provide consumers with a list of six questions to determine how well their financial institutions are prepared to detect signs of diminished financial capacity, elder fraud, and financial abuse, and to prevent financial losses from occurring.
D18|Dynamic Pricing of Credit Cards and the Effects of Regulation|We construct a two-period model of revolving credit with asymmetric information and adverse selection.In the second period, lenders exploit an informational advantage with respect to their own customers. Those rents stimulate competition for customers in the first period. The informational advantage the current lender enjoys relative to its competitors determines interest rates, credit supply, and switching behavior. We evaluate the consequences of limiting the repricing of existing balances as implemented by recent legislation. Such restrictions increase deadweight losses and reduce ex ante consumer surplus. The model suggests novel approaches to identify empirically the effects of this law.
D18|The economics of debt collection: enforcement of consumer credit contracts|In the U.S., third-party debt collection agencies employ more than 140,000 people and recover more than $50 billion each year, mostly from consumers. Informational, legal, and other factors suggest that original creditors should have an advantage in collecting debts owed to them. Then, why does the debt collection industry exist and why is it so large? Explanations based on economies of scale or specialization cannot address many of the observed stylized facts. The authors develop an application of common agency theory that better explains those facts. The model explains how reliance on an unconcentrated industry of third-party debt collection agencies can implement an equilibrium with more intense collections activity than creditors would implement by themselves. The authors derive empirical implications for the nature of the debt collection market and the structure of the debt collection industry. A welfare analysis shows that, under certain conditions, an equilibrium in which creditors rely on third-party debt collectors can generate more credit supply and aggregate borrower surplus than an equilibrium where lenders collect debts owed to them on their own. There are, however, situations where the opposite is true. The model also suggests a number of policy instruments that may improve the functioning of the collections market.
D18|Rethinking nudge: not one but three concepts|Nudge is a concept of policy intervention that originates in Thaler and Sunstein's (2008) popular eponymous book. Following their own hints, we distinguish three properties of nudge interventions: they redirect individual choices by only slightly altering choice conditions (here nudge 1), they use rationality failures instrumentally (here nudge 2), and they alleviate the unfavourable effects of these failures (here nudge 3). We explore each property in semantic detail and show that no entailment relation holds between them. This calls into question the theoretical unity of nudge, as intended by Thaler and Sunstein and most followers. We eventually recommend pursuing each property separately, both in policy research and at the foundational level. We particularly emphasize the need of reconsidering the respective roles of decision theory and behavioural economics to delineate nudge 2 correctly. The paper differs from most of the literature in focusing on the definitional rather than the normative problems of nudge.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D18|Scale matters: risk perception, return expectations, and investment propensity under different scalings|Abstract With a novel experimental design we investigate whether risk perception, return expectations, and investment propensity are influenced by the scale of the vertical axis in charts. We explore this for two presentation formats, namely return charts and price charts, where we depict low- and high-volatility assets with distinct trends. We find that varying the scale strongly affects people’s risk perception, as a narrower scale of the vertical axis leads to significantly higher perceived riskiness of an asset even if the underlying volatility is the same. Furthermore, past returns predict future return expectations almost perfectly. In our setting perceived profitability was considered more important than perceived riskiness when making investment choices. Overall we show that adapting the scale of a chart makes it easier to recognize yearly return variations within a single security, but at the same time makes it harder to identify differences between dissimilar securities. This is something regulators should be aware of and take into account in the rules they set.

D18|Artificial Intelligence and Consumer Privacy|Thanks to big data, artificial intelligence (AI) has spurred exciting innovations. In the meantime, AI and big data are reshaping the risk in consumer privacy and data security. In this essay, I first define the nature of the problem and then present a few facts about the ongoing risk. The bulk of the essay describes how the U.S. market copes with the risk in current policy environment. It concludes with key challenges facing researchers and policy makers.
D18|Financial Fraud among Older Americans: Evidence and Implications|The consequences of poor financial capability at older ages are serious and include making mistakes with credit, spending retirement assets too quickly, and being defrauded by financial predators. Because older persons are at or past the peak of their wealth accumulation, they are often the targets of fraud. Our project analyzes a module we developed and fielded in the 2016 Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Using this dataset, we evaluate the incidence and risk factors for investment fraud, prize/lottery scams, and account misuse, using regression analysis. Relatively few HRS respondents mentioned any single form of fraud over the prior five years, but nearly 5% reported at least one form of investment fraud, 4 % recounted prize/lottery fraud, and 30% indicated that others had used/attempted to use their accounts without permission. There were few risk factors consistently associated with such victimization in the older population. Fraud is a complex phenomenon and no single factor uniquely predicts victimization. The incidence of fraud could be reduced by educating consumers about various types of fraud and by increasing awareness among financial service professionals.
D18|Financial Inclusion and Contract Terms: Experimental Evidence From Mexico|This paper provides evidence on the difficulty of expanding access to credit through large institutions. We use detailed observational data and a large-scale countrywide experiment to examine a large bank's experience with a credit card that accounted for approximately 15% of all first-time formal sector borrowing in Mexico in 2010. Borrowers have limited credit histories and high exit-risk – a third of all study cards are defaulted on or canceled during the 26 month sample period. We use a large-scale randomized experiment on a representative sample of the bank's marginal borrowers to test whether contract terms affect default. We find that large experimental changes in interest rates and minimum payments do little to mitigate default risk. We also use detailed data on purchases and payments to construct a measure of bank revenue per card and find it is generally low and difficult to predict (using machine learning methods), perhaps explaining the bank's eventual discontinuation of the product. Finally, we show that borrowers generating a favorable credit history are much more likely to switch banks providing suggestive evidence of a lending externality. Taken together these facts highlight the difficulty of increasing financial access using large formal sector financial organizations.
D18|Arbitration with Uninformed Consumers|We examine whether firms have an informational advantage in selecting arbitrators in consumer arbitration, and the impact of the arbitrator selection process on outcomes. We collect a novel data set containing roughly 9,000 arbitration cases in securities arbitration. Securities disputes present a good laboratory: the selection mechanism is similar to other major arbitration forums; arbitration is mandatory for all disputes, eliminating selection concerns; and the parties choose arbitrators from a randomly generated list. We first document that some arbitrators are systematically industry friendly while others are consumer friendly. Firms appear to utilize this information in the arbitrator selection process. Despite a randomly generated list of potential arbitrators, industry-friendly arbitrators are forty percent more likely to be selected than their consumer friendly counterparts. Better informed firms and consumers choose more favorable arbitrators. We develop and calibrate a model of arbitrator selection in which, like the current process, both the informed firms and uninformed consumers have control over the selection process. Arbitrators compete against each other for the attention of claimants and respondents. The model allows us to interpret our empirical facts in equilibrium and to quantify the effects of changes to the current arbitrator selection process on consumer outcomes. Competition between arbitrators exacerbates the informational advantage of firms in equilibrium resulting in all arbitrators slanting towards being industry friendly. Evidence suggests that limiting the respondentâ€™s and claimantâ€™s inputs over the arbitrator selection process could significantly improve outcomes for consumers.
D18|Learning by Suffering? Patterns in Flu Shot Take-up|An annual flu shot is one of the least controversial and most widely-recommended preventative health measures. In spite of such advice, only a fraction of those who are suggested to get a flu shot actually receive it. We focus on past personal outcomes to understand how individual learning in influences patterns over time using medical claims for a 5% panel sample of Medicare FFS beneficiaries. We find that individuals learn from personal suffering from flu and such learning is conditional on whether they have taken a flu shot in the same flu season. If they did not take a flu shot, having the flu later on encourages them to get the flu shot next year. But if they had the flu shot and still got the flu, their likelihood of getting a flu shot next year is significantly reduced. The 2009 outbreak of bird flu does not break the qualitative pattern of “learning by suffering” but it does change the strength of learning.
D18|Bail-in and Legacy Assets: Harmonized rules for targeted partial compensation to strengthen the bail-in regime|In the wake of the global financial crisis, several large bank rescues by governments further entrenched bail-out expectations in the wider public. Then, following a problematic ad-hoc bail-in in Cyprus early 2013, EU rules introduced provisions for ‘bail-in’, that is, the administrative power to require write-down or conversion into equity of non-equity claims – a significant regime change to deal with banks failing or likely to fail. This paper focuses on the implications of this regime change for consumer/investor protection, especially for socially more vulnerable households, and on the resulting risk for political acceptance and the achievement of the bail-in objective. Therefore, it reviews these rules and their application in recent cases, focusing on the treatment of retail bond holders. Moreover, it explores the distribution of retail holders of bank bonds across economy-wide income quantiles in the euro area and various euro area countries. We find that neither the share of below-medianincome households with bank bonds in the total number of households with bank bonds nor the relative vulnerability to ‘bail-in’ of these households that tend to have higher levels of financial illiterateness are negligible. Recent applications of bail-in-rules, while diverse with respect to legal basis, scope and purpose, have barely gone beyond the write-down and conversion of capital instruments, thus excluding senior bonds. Nevertheless, in all these cases, some sort of compensation scheme for retail investors was deemed necessary and implemented, varying in design, but mostly benefiting almost all retail holders. In two prominent cases there was no effective bail-in of retail holders. In conclusion, following a lesser-known example from Italy, we propose EU harmonized partial compensation rules for socially more vulnerable retail holders of bank debt securities acquired before 2016. They would render implementation of bail-in socially more acceptable, politically more feasible and economically more efficient. During the transition period until household investment behaviour will have fully adjusted to the new world of bail-in, the proposed compensation rules would help avoid effective non-application of bail-in that otherwise results from excluding senior bonds and/or granting excessive compensation.
D18|Structure Demand Estimation of the Response to Food Safety Regulations in the Japanese Poultry Market|Since their implementation in 1995, the Agreements on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and Technical Barriers to Trade of the World Trade Organization have played an increasingly important role in the conduct of international negotiations. This study employs the method of moments estimator proposed by Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) and Nevo (2001) to estimate the effect of Japanese pesticide residue standards on poultry consumption with a particular focus on the maximum residue limits (MRLs) on pesticide and veterinary drugs. The results confirm that more stringent MRLs on pesticide and veterinary drugs enhance the demand for poultry imports by ensuring higher food safety. The results shed light on Japanese consumers’robust preference for food safety. Further counterfactual experiments of alternative MRLs show that the demand-enhancing effect may vary among the exporting countries, and appears to be more prominent for imported poultry from developed countries.
D18|An experimental method for the elicitation of implicit attitudes to privacy risk|We test an experimental method for the elicitation of implicit attitudes to privacy risk. We ask individuals to decide whether to incur the risk of revealing private information to other participants. This type of risk that involves a social component corresponds to privacy threats that individuals may face in the field. We derive a measure of individual attitudes to privacy risk with our method. We empirically test the validity of this measure by running a laboratory experiment with 148 participants. Our results confirm that the willingness to incur a privacy risk is driven by a complex array of factors including risk attitudes, self-reported value for private information, and general attitudes to privacy (derived from survey methods in our study). We also observe that attitudes to privacy risk depend on the order in which measures of risk attitude are elicited, but do not depend on whether there is a preexisting threat to privacy, over which participants have no control. We explain how our method can be simplified and extended for use in eliciting attitudes to a wide range of privacy risks and various types of private information.
D18|Consumer exploitation and notice periods|Firms often set long notice periods when consumers cancel a contract, and sometimes do so even when the costs of changing or canceling the contract are small. We investigate a model in which a firm offers a contract to consumers who may procrastinate canceling it due to naive present-bias. We show that the firm may set a long notice period to exploit naive consumers.
D18|Persuasion Against Self-Control Problems|I derive a social planner\'s optimal information design in an environment with quasi-hyperbolic discounting consumers without commitment. Consumption induces instantaneous utility, but unknown delayed cost. Consumers may or may not acquire additional costless information on the cost parameter. The planner\'s optimal signal can be interpreted as an incentive compatible consumption recommendation whenever the cost parameter is below some cut-off. Welfare strictly exceeds the one under full information. I characterize distributional conditions under which welfare attains first best.
D18|Financial Inclusion, Financial Literacy, and Financial Education in Azerbaijan|We discuss the status of financial inclusion, education, and literacy in Azerbaijan as well as measures to foster the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, which currently have inadequate access to financial resources. The Government of Azerbaijan is facing the primary challenge of defining its role in creating broader access to financial products and services. We highlight the barriers to financial inclusion, recommend solutions to overcoming the challenges, and discuss lessons learned and a potential way forward.
D18|Seemingly Exploitative Contracts|This paper studies sequential price discrimination of sophisticated present-biased consumers in the credit market. The optimal contract utilizes present bias to improve screening by inducing certain consumers to over-consume and over-accumulate debt without the presence of naivete. This shows that the optimal contract can have seemingly exploitative features that cause certain consumers to experience ex-post welfare losses even when they are sophisticated. This has important policy implications. If the intention of ﬁrms is to screen and not exploit consumers, then financial regulations aimed at protecting consumers by eliminating seemingly exploitative features could introduce additional distortions. I also analyze the optimal contract for naive consumers. The main difference between contracts for sophisticated and naıve consumers is the lack of a commitment mechanism in exploitative contracts, while the presence of teaser rates, late fees or overdraft fees does not necessarily make contracts exploitative.
D18|Can Words Breed or Kill Investment? Metaphors, Imagery, Affect and Investor Behaviour|"In ""building your portfolio"", building is what linguists call a conceptual metaphor: the investor does not literally pile up his assets like they were bricks, but ""building"" is used as a metaphor for putting together elements. We could therefore also say ""cooking"", ""sewing"" or ""weaving"" your portfolio, as these are also activities that involve putting together elements to make your life comfortable. Conceptual metaphors make some aspects of the topic at hand salient, and hide others. Metaphors create imagery and induce affect. As the latter is shown to influence risk perception and return expectations, it is worthwhile to study metaphors in stock market reporting. In this paper we identify the metaphors in newspaper articles on the stock market both during a crash and in “normal” times. We find that both in the general and the financial press journalists use many metaphors, that these come from a limited number of source domains, and that the latter are predominantly masculine, thus “priming” readers with certain aspects of investing. We speculate that this may create positive affect among men, not women, and bias masculine investors toward excess trading. If so, stock market reporting in newspapers could contribute to the gender difference in stated risk tolerance, financial risk taking, stock market participation and (excess) trading. We suggest further research to verify this."
D18|Attention-driven demand for bonus contracts|In many markets supply contracts include a series of small, regular payments made by consumers and a single, large bonus that consumers receive at some point during the contractual period. But, if for instance its production costs exceed its value to consumers, such a bonus creates inefficiencies. We offer a novel explanation for the frequent occurrence of bonus contracts, which builds on a model of attentional focusing. Our main result identifies market conditions under which bonus contracts should be observed: while a monopolist pays a bonus to consumers—if at all—only for low-value goods, firms standing in competition always—i.e., independent of the consumers’ valuation—offer bonus contracts. Thus, competition does not eliminate but rather exacerbates inefficiencies arising from contracting with focused agents. Common contract schemes in markets for electricity, telephony, and bank accounts are consistent with our model, but cannot be reconciled with alternative approaches such as models on consumption smoothing, (quasi-)hyperbolic discounting, or switching costs.
D18|Price Discrimination and Dispersion under Asymmetric Profiling of Consumers|Two duopolists compete in price on the market for a homogeneous product. They can use a 'profiling technology' that allows them to identify the willingness-to-pay of their consumers with some probability. If both firms have profiling technologies of the exact same precision, or if one firm cannot use any profiling technology, then the Bertrand paradox continues to prevail. Yet, if firms have technologies of different precisions, then the price equilibrium exhibits both price discrimination and price dispersion, with positive expected profits. Increasing the precision of both firms' technologies does not necessarily harm consumers.

Le taux de revalorisation moyen des fonds euros des contrats individuels, net de frais de chargement (mais avant prélèvements sociaux), pondéré par les provisions mathématiques correspondantes, s’élève à 1,93 % au titre de 2016 après 2,27% au titre de 2015 et 2,54% au titre de 2014..
D18|Scope of Maximum Interest Rate Regulations (Report of Workshops (1))|"Statutory provisions regulating maximum interest rates (referred to generally hereafter as ""maximum interest rate regulations"") employ words that are interpreted to include various payments to creditors such as ""fees"" in addition to ""interest in substance"" (i.e. ""compensation for the use of principal""). Although this is considered effective in preventing evasion of regulation, it may have the effect of including payments made by parties to financial transactions without any intention to evade these regulations. The Report of the Workshops on ""Contemporary Financial Transactions and Their Regulatory Treatment"" (2016) (the ""Report"") explores this issue with regard to the interpretation of relevant laws and legislative actions. The Report refers to economics discourses related to maximum interest rate regulations and clarifies the intent and purpose of such regulations."
D18|Portfolio Selection by Japanese Households: Investigation Using Japanese and US Households Questionnaire Survey|In Japan, cash and deposits continue to be the main financial assets of households. What keeps Japanese households cautious about portfolio allocations? Elucidating the mechanisms behind household behavior is an important issue in discussing the influence of monetary policy. In this study, we outline the analysis by Ito et al. (2017), who examined mechanisms that influence household portfolio selection, using a questionnaire survey for Japanese and US households. The analysis suggests that further improvements in institutional aspects and an increase in financial knowledge, as well as an improvement in market performance and the mitigation of future concerns, are important factors in making the investment environments in Japan more attractive.

D18|The Cost of Distorted Financial Advice - Evidence from the Mortgage Market|Many households lack the sophistication required to make complex financial decisions and risk being exploited when seeking advice from intermediaries. We build a model of financial advice, in which banks attain their optimal mortgage portfolio by setting rates and providing advice to their clientele. “Sophisticated” households know which mortgage type is best for them; “naive” are susceptible to the bank’s advice. Using data on the universe of Italian mortgages, we estimate the model and quantify the welfare implications of distorted financial advice.The average cost of the distortion is equivalent to an increase in the annual mortgage payment by 11%. However, since even distorted advice conveys information, banning advice altogether results in a loss of 998 euros per year on average. A financial literacy campaign is beneficial for naive households, but hurts sophisticated ones.
D18|Attention Manipulation and Information Overload|When a decision-maker’s attention is limited, her decisions depend on what she focuses on. This gives interested parties an incentive to manipulate not only the substance of communication but also the decision-maker’s attention allocation. This paper models such attention manipulation. In its presence, competitive information supply can reduce the decision-maker’s knowledge by causing information overload. Further, a single information provider may deliberately induce information overload to conceal information. These findings, pertinent to consumer protection, suggest a role for rules that restrict communication, mandate not only the content but also the format of disclosure, and regulate product design.
D18|Effects of payment instruments on unhealthy purchases|"In this online replication study we investigate if the pain of paying in cash - as opposed to paying by cards - can curb impulsive urges to purchase unhealthy or 'vice' products. This effect was found by Thomas et al (2011) when comparing the payment instruments cash and credit card. We investigate whether these results also hold in the Netherlands, where the dominant payment methods are cash and debit card. In total, 2,213 participants bought on average 12.3% more unhealthy supermarket products when paying with cards compared to cash. Participants who paid with cards bought more products in general (5.1%), however, the difference for healthy or 'virtue' products was not significant. The pattern of the mean scores per payment instrument indicate that paying with cards has a specific effect on vice purchases, but this study does not have the statistical power to show that convincingly. A regression analysis shows that the number of purchases of vice products is partly explained by paying with cards. Other explanatory variables are impulsivity, seduceability, gender, age, education and conscious eating behaviour. Pain of paying did not differ by payment instrument, but was larger for participants that paid with their usual means of payment, either debit card or cash. The present study contributes to the literature of so-called ""pay cash, eat less trash"" - studies, as it shows that the use of cash limits overall spending and purchases of vice products."
D18|When Harry Fired Sally: The Double Standard in Punishing Misconduct|"We examine gender differences in misconduct punishment in the financial advisory industry. We find evidence of a ""gender punishment gap"": following an incident of misconduct, female advisers are 20% more likely to lose their jobs and 30% less likely to find new jobs relative to male advisers. Females face harsher outcomes despite engaging in misconduct that is 20% less costly and having a substantially lower propensity towards repeat offenses. The gender punishment gap in hiring and firing dissipates at firms with a greater percentage of female managers at the firm or local branch level. The gender punishment gap is not driven by gender differences in occupation (type of job, firm, market, or financial products handled), productivity, misconduct, or recidivism. We extend our analysis to explore the differential treatment of ethnic minorities and find similar patterns of ""in-group"" tolerance. Our evidence is inconsistent with a simple Bayesian model and suggests instead that managers are more forgiving of missteps among members of their own gender/ethnic group."
D18|Regulation of Charlatans in High-Skill Professions|We model a market for a skill that is in short supply and high demand, where the presence of charlatans (professionals who sell a service that they do not deliver on) is an equilibrium outcome. We use this model to evaluate the standards and disclosure requirements that exist in these markets. We show that reducing the number of charlatans through regulation decreases consumer surplus. Although both standards and disclosure drive charlatans out of the market, consumers are worse off because of the resulting reduction in competition amongst producers. Producers, on the other hand, strictly benefit from the regulation, implying that the regulation we observe in these markets likely derives from producer interests. Using these insights, we study the factors that drive the cross-sectional variation in charlatans across professions. Professions with weak trade groups, skills in larger supply, shorter training periods and less informative signals regarding the professional's skill, are more likely to feature charlatans.
D18|Systematic mistakes in the mortgage market and lack of financial sophistication|Institutions often offer a menu of contracts to consumers in an attempt to create a separating equilibrium that reveals borrower types and provides better pricing. We test the effectiveness of a specific set of contracts in the mortgage market: mortgage points. Points allow borrowers to exchange an upfront amount for a decrease in the mortgage rate. We document that, on average, points takers lose about $700. Also, points takers are less financially savvy (less educated, older), and they make mistakes on other dimensions (e.g., inefficiently refinancing their mortgages). Overall, our results show that borrowers overestimate how long they will stay with the mortgage.
D18|Exponential-growth bias and overconfidence|There is increasing evidence that people underestimate the magnitude of compounding interest. However, if people were aware of their inability to make such calculations they should demand services to ameliorate the consequences of such deficiencies. In a laboratory experiment, we find that people exhibit substantial exponential-growth bias but, more importantly, that they are overconfident in their ability to answer questions that involve exponential growth. They also exhibit overconfidence in their ability to use a spreadsheet to answer these questions. This evidence explains why a market solution to exponential-growth bias has not been forthcoming. Biased individuals have suboptimally low demand for tools and services that could improve their financial decisions.

D18|Cheap promises: Evidence from loan repayment pledges in an online experiment|Across domains, people struggle to follow through on their commitments. This can happen for many reasons, including dishonesty, forgetfulness, or insufficient intrinsic motivation. Social scientists have explored the reasons for persistent failures to follow through, suggesting that eliciting explicit promises can be an effective way to motivate action. This paper presents a field experiment that tests the effect of explicit promises, in the form of “honor pledges,” on loan repayment rates. The experiment was conducted with LendUp, an online lender, and targeted 4,883 first-time borrowers with the firm. Individuals were randomized into four groups, with the following experimental treatments: (1) having no honor pledge to complete (control); (2) signing a given honor pledge; (3) re-typing the same honor pledge as in (2) before signing; and (4) coming up with a personal honor pledge to type and sign. I also randomized whether or not borrowers were reminded of the honor pledge they signed prior to the repayment deadline. The results suggest that the honor pledge treatments had minimal impacts on repayment, and that reminders of the pledges were similarly ineffective. This suggests that borrowers who fail to repay loans do so not because of dishonesty or behavioral biases, but because they suffer from true financial hardship and are simply unable to repay.
D18|New Evidence on an Old Unanswered Question : Why Some Borrowers Purchase Credit Insurance and Other Debt Protection and Some Do Not|Credit related insurance and other debt protection are products sold in conjunction with credit that extinguish a consumer’s debt or suspends its periodic payments if events like death, disability, or involuntary unemployment occur. High penetration rates observed in the 1950s and 1960s raised concerns about coercion in the sale of credit insurance. This study presents evidence on credit insurance purchase and debt protection decisions from a new survey. The findings provide little evidence of widespread or systematic coercion in purchases. Instead, findings suggest that risk aversion and health or financial concerns motivate consumers to purchase credit insurance and debt protection, just as these concerns also motivate purchases of other types of insurance.
D18|Access to credit and financial health: evaluating the impact of debt collection|Despite the prevalence of debt collection and the intense regulatory activity surrounding this industry, little is known about how these practices impact consumers. This paper conducts an empirical analysis of the effect of debt collection on consumer credit and on indicators of financial health, employing individual credit record data and a difference-in-differences research design that compares outcomes for consumers in states that increased the restrictiveness of legislation with those for consumers in the remaining states. We find consistent evidence that restricting collection activities leads to a decrease in access to credit and a deterioration in indicators of financial health. Moreover, our estimated treatment varies considerably with the borrower's age and baseline credit score, with effects concentrated primarily among borrowers with the lowest credit scores.
D18|Can Data Sharing Help Financial Institutions Improve the Financial Health of Older Americans?|This paper explores how increased data sharing among financial institutions could improve the financial outcomes of older adults suffering from cognitive impairment. Among the first signs of cognitive impairment in older adults is a decline in financial capacity, which is also a risk factor for abuse or exploitation. Banks and other financial institutions are at the front lines to monitor and detect changes in financial capacity and susceptibility to fraud and abuse. However, industry experts have found that, in many cases, no mechanism exists for financial service providers to communicate signs of cognitive impairment, abuse, or fraud to family, financial caregivers, or other financial institutions. Creating a regulatory environment whereby financial institutions can more easily share data among themselves could be an important component of a more comprehensive strategy to bridge the communication gap and reduce the frequency and severity of financial losses for older adults.
D18|Who Stole Me? Identity Theft on Social Media in the UAE|"""Objective – This paper is a first attempt at investigating the self-reported number of instances of identity theft on social media among student population the U.A.E while providing an overview of its impact. Methodology/Technique – As a pilot, this study uses arithmetic analysis to record the first-such study of instances of identity theft among students and its impact on the respondents. Findings – The results of this study showed that students between the ages of 12 and 18 plus are highly active on social media. Although only 59% of the sample reported being victims of some form of SMIDT, in a small sample size of 128, 59% is considered quite high. Novelty – In late 2015, UAE users lost more than five billion dirhams due to cybercrimes such as identity theft (Sophia, 2015). However, little or no research has been conducted on the issue of identity theft on social media to begin to understand the depth of the problem."""

Increasing the precision of both firms’ technologies does not necessarily harm consumers.
D18|Inferior Products and Profitable Deception|We analyse conditions facilitating profitable deception in a simple model of a competitive retail market. Firms selling homogenous products set anticipated prices that consumers understand and additional prices that naive consumers ignore unless revealed to them by a firm, where we assume that there is a binding floor on the anticipated prices. Our main results establish that “bad” products (those with lower social surplus than an alternative) tend to be more reliably profitable than “good” products. Specifically, (1) in a market with a single socially valuable product and sufficiently many firms, a deceptive equilibrium—in which firms hide additional prices—does not exist and firms make zero profits. But perversely, (2) if the product is socially wasteful, then a profitable deceptive equilibrium always exists. Furthermore, (3) in a market with multiple products, since a superior product both diverts sophisticated consumers and renders an inferior product socially wasteful in comparison, it guarantees that firms can profitably sell the inferior product by deceiving consumers. We apply our framework to the mutual fund and credit card markets, arguing that it explains a number of empirical findings regarding these industries.
D18|When Harry Fired Sally: The Double Standard in Punishing Misconduct|We examine gender discrimination in the financial advisory industry. We study a less salient mechanism for discrimination, firm discipline following missteps. There are substantial differences in the punishment of misconduct across genders. Although both female and male advisers are disciplined for misconduct, female advisers are punished more severely. Following an incidence of misconduct, female advisers are 20% more likely to lose their jobs and 30% less likely to find new jobs relative to male advisers. Females face harsher punishment despite engaging in less costly misconduct and despite a lower propensity towards repeat offenses. Relative to women, men are three times as likely to engage in misconduct, are twice as likely to be repeat offenders, and engage in misconduct that is 20% costlier. Evidence suggests that the observed behavior is not driven by productivity differences across advisers. Rather, we find supporting evidence for taste-based discrimination. For females, a disproportionate share of misconduct complaints is initiated by the firm, instead of customers or regulators. Moreover, there is significant heterogeneity among firms. Firms with a greater percentage of male executives/owners at a given branch tend to punish female advisers more severely following misconduct and also tend to hire fewer female advisers with past record of misconduct.
D18|Regulation of Charlatans in High-Skill Professions|We study a market for a skill that is in short supply and high demand, where the presence of charlatans (professionals who sell a service that they do not deliver on) is an equilibrium outcome. We use this model to evaluate the belief that reducing the number of charlatans through regulation increases consumer surplus. We show that this belief is false: both information disclosure as well as setting standards reduces consumer surplus. Although both standards and disclosure drive charlatans out of the market, consumers are worse off because of the resulting reduction in competition amongst producers. Producers, on the other hand, strictly benefit from the regulation, implying that the regulation we observe in these markets likely derives from producer interests. The model provides insights into the parameters that drive the cross-sectional variation in charlatans across professions. Professions with weak trade groups, skills in larger supply, shorter training periods and less informative signals regarding the professional's skill, are more likely to feature charlatans. We conclude that the number of charlatans in equilibrium is positively related to the value added of that profession to consumers.
D18|Who Falls Prey to the Wolf of Wall Street? Investor Participation in Market Manipulation|Manipulative communications touting stocks are common in capital markets around the world. Although the price distortions created by so-called “pump-and-dump” schemes are well known, little is known about the investors in these frauds. By examining 421 “pump-and-dump” schemes between 2002 and 2015 and a proprietary set of trading records for over 110,000 individual investors from a major German bank, we provide evidence on the participation rate, magnitude of the investments, losses, and the characteristics of the individuals who invest in such schemes. Our evidence suggests that participation is quite common and involves sizable losses, with nearly 6% of active investors participating in at least one “pump-and-dump” and an average loss of nearly 30%. Moreover, we identify several distinct types of investors, some of which should not be viewed as falling prey to these frauds. We also show that portfolio composition and past trading behavior can better explain participation in touted stocks than demographics. Our analysis offers insights into the challenges associated with designing effective investor protection against market manipulation.
D18|Economic Damage of Cookie Lifetime Restrictions| Over the past few years, regulators have begun to consider restricting a cookie’s lifetime or even banning cookies altogether as a way to protect consumer privacy. Most of this debate has taken place in the absence of any quantified cost-benefit analysis. To begin to fill this gap in the discourse, we estimate the potential economic damage of lifespan restrictions on cookies. Our analysis is based on an empirical study on cookies of 54,127 users who received about 130 million ad impressions over 2.5 years. Only 22% of all cookies increase their daily value over time but the value of that quantile represent 61% of the value of all cookies. This analysis suggests that restricting their lifetime to one year as the European Union proposes (two years as Google advocates) decreases cookie lifetime value by 14.8% (5.9%), which represents a decrease in the value of all cookies of about 7.4% (1.3%). Overall, we find that the average lifetime of a cookie is 215 days (median 68 days) and the average value of a cookie is €1.43 (median €.02).
D18|Behavioural economics and financial consumer protection|"The G20/OECD Task Force on Financial Consumer Protection has highlighted that ""regulators and supervisors can use the insights gained through behavioural economics research to inform their approach to potential remedies to help consumers"". This paper, prepared under the aegis of the G20/OECD Task Force, first provides some historical context for the development of the field of behavioural economics and its increased application to policy. It then looks more specifically at the application of behavioural economics in the area of financial consumer protection. Common biases that individuals demonstrate in the context of making financial decisions are identified, and an overview of how numerous governments are testing and implementing the application of behavioural economics for policies promoting financial consumer protection is provided. The paper concludes by highlighting the opportunity for behavioural economics to help provide cost-efficient ways of making policy more effective at promoting positive outcomes for consumers, and stressing the need to continue an open dialogue with policy makers, regulators and supervisors to exchange experiences and good practices."
D18|The Ephemeral Concept of Parasitic Commercial Practices in the EU|Research background: It has been one decade since the transposition deadline regarding the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. The EU´s growth strategy, Europe 2020, and all EU member states are committed to smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth, to the single internal market and to R&D leading to innovations. These positive priorities, however, often conflict with one another. The EU crossed the Rubicon and decided to harmonize the protection against parasitic commercial practices hurting intellectual property and consumers. Is this appropriate, effective and efficient? Purpose of the article: The primary purpose of this article is to assess the appropriateness, effectiveness and efficiency of the EU harmonization of the ephemeral concept of parasitic commercial practices. The secondary purpose is to assess approach(es) of the EU and EU member states to this overlap of the competition and intellectual property regimes. The third purpose is to assess the feasibility of the integrative harmonization in this arena. Methodology/methods: The multi-disciplinary nature of this article, and its three purposes, leads to the employment of Meta-Analysis, of the critical comparison of laws and the impact of their application, to the holistic perception of historical and national contexts, and to case studies. The primary sources (field search) and secondary sources (literature) are explored and the yield knowledge and data are confronted with the explored cases. The dominating qualitative research and data are complemented by the quantitative research and data. Findings & Value added: The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive harmonizes the protection of various issues, including the ephemeral concept of parasitic commercial practices. The set trio of purposes leads to a conclusion that this overlap of competition and intellectual property protection is highly sensitive and nationally particular. EU integration in this sphere is needed, but the undertaken harmonization is not fully effective and efficient, and perhaps even not appropriate.

The state of confidence in the sector's producers has been reported according to numerous reports on this topic. Attention has been paid to the main problem areas that the food industry faces in terms of food safety. It is food counterfeiting, additives, and the risks related to the production of genetically modified food. All these areas are presented in relation to the consumer trust. The aim of the paper was to analyse selected factors determining trust from the food sector perspective. In this study, a critical analysis of the literature was applied. (original abstract)
D18|The timing of choice-enhancing policies|Recent studies investigate policies motivating consumers to make an active choice as a way to protect unsophisticated consumers. We analyze the optimal timing of such choice-enhancing policies when a firm can strategically react to them. In the model, a firm provides a contract with automatic renewal. We show that a policy intending to enhance consumers’ choices when they choose a contract can be detrimental to welfare. By contrast, a choice-enhancing policy at the time of contract renewal increases welfare more robustly. Our results highlight that policies should be targeted in timing to the actual choice inefficiency.
D18|Pay cash, buy less trash? – Evidence from German payment diary data|This research note empirically investigates whether cash can prevent consumers from making needless purchases in unexpected shopping situations. Cash can have a disciplinary effect on short-term consumption because it imposes a strong temporary budget constraint and also reinforces the pain of paying. I use a sample of unexpected shopping situations that were recorded by participants of the Bundesbank’s study on payment behaviour. I find that the probability of a transaction subsequently being declared unnecessary is significantly lower when the consumer had paid the transaction in cash. The results are similar across different socioeconomic groups based on age, gender, education and income. I conclude that restricting the use of cash for transaction purposes can entail a reduction in consumer welfare.
D18|Financial consulting: A qualitative study on its role in financial decision making|The current study examines the way people deal with financial decisions. The purpose of this study is to explore the role of financial consulting in the decision making process and the complex decision dynamics in the run up to a decision. Data for this study were collected through a series of semi-structured interviews with both financial consultants of a savings bank and their clients. The findings provide insights into different attitudes towards financial decision making, locate financial consulting within the decision process, and compare the information habits and the degree to which decision autonomy is maintained, restricted, or given up across different types of clients. Besides, the study shows how trust between client and consultant encourages reciprocal behavior and increases the willingness to accept opportunity costs. The paper discusses these findings with respect to consulting practices and consumer policy and outlines directions for future research.
D18|Ursachen von Stromsperren in Privathaushalten: Empirische Ergebnisse aus der Allgemeinen Sozialberatung<BR>[Factors correlated with utility arrears and power cut-offs in Germany: Empirical evidence from data on social counseling]|In diesem Aufsatz wird untersucht, welche Merkmale Haushalte aufweisen, denen Stromsperren (Unterbrechungen der Stromversorgung wegen Zahlungsrückständen) angedroht wurden bzw. bei denen sie umgesetzt wurden und welche Bedeutung diese Merkmale relativ zueinander haben. Dazu wird erstmals ein Datensatz aus der Beratungspraxis des Deutschen Caritasverbandes mittels multipler logistischer Regression ausgewertet. Die empirische Untersuchung zeigt, dass Stromsperren und ihre Androhung häufig auftreten, wenn ein Haushalt bereits bestehende Schulden hat. Haushalte, die Grundsicherungsleistungen beziehen, sind überdurchschnittlich oft von der Androhung bzw. Umsetzung einer Stromsperre betroffen. Im Gegensatz zur Androhung einer Stromsperre kommt es überproportional häufig zur tatsächlichen Umsetzung einer Stromsperre, wenn die Betroffenen über ein besonders geringes Bildungsniveau verfügen sowie in Ein-Personen-Haushalten. Insgesamt stützen die Ergebnisse die These, dass die Problematik der Stromsperren einer herkömmlichen Verschuldungsproblematik ähnlich ist. Gegenmaßnahmen sollten daher nicht alleine auf das Einkommen oder die Stromkosten der Haushalte fokussieren, sondern müssen auch kognitive und psychologische Faktoren adressieren, die mit Ver- bzw. Überschuldung einhergehen.
D18|Markets for leaked information|We study markets for sensitive personal information. An agent wants to communicate with another party but any revealed information can be intercepted and sold to a third party whose reaction harms the agent. The market for information induces an adverse sorting effect, allocating the information to those types of third parties who harm the agent most. In equilibrium, this limits information transmission by the agent, but never fully deters it. We also consider agents who naively provide information to the market. Their presence renders traded information more valuable and, thus, harms sophisticated agents by increasing the third party's demand for information. Halfbaked regulatory interventions may hurt naive agents without helping sophisticated agents. Comparing monopoly and oligopoly markets, we find that oligopoly is often better for the agent: it requires a higher value of traded information and therefore has to grant the agent more privacy.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D18|An Economic Analysis of Beverage Size Restrictions| We model the potential efficiency and distributional consequences of a government beverage-size restriction that is designed to curb or reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. Unsurprisingly, we find that a credibly implemented restriction can curb consumption, particularly by “high-type” consumers who consume large amounts of sweetened beverages. Surprisingly, we find that for small to moderate restrictions that might be consistent with the magnitude of the NYC soda-ban, consumer welfare will be unaffected by the regulation. Instead, most consumption inefficiency induced welfare losses will be borne by sellers. Thus, policy debates concerning welfare losses from soft-drink sales should focus on business losses rather than consumer welfare losses.
D18|Turfgrass producer preferences for certification and royalty fee structures| Plant scientists have bred turfgrass varieties to create more desirable traits for long-term maintenance, appearance, utility, and resistance to abiotic and biotic stressors. As universities seek to capture revenue to cover research costs, these varieties are increasingly protected by intellectual property rights such as US plant patents and plant variety protection certificates. Producers require license to produce and sell proprietary varieties, and are required to pay royalties, impacting the types of varieties marketed for sale. Therefore, turf breeders must identify producer demand for various grass varieties, and understand their marketability. An online turfgrass preference survey with sod producers using a discrete choice experiment was conducted in Spring 2015. The design incorporated attributes such as variety, certification agency, fee structure, maintenance reduction potential, and price per square foot. Results from the analysis indicate that producers preferred genetically modified breeds and fee structures that allow producers to share the cost with the breed developers.
D18|Changing Food Safety Risk Perceptions: The Influence of Message Framings & Media Food Safety Information| Human cases of E. coli O157:H7 infections linked to the consumption of contaminated beef products consistently receive public attention due to their far-reaching health and economic implications. As consumers’ risk attitudes and perceptions remain pivotal to beef food safety initiatives, the study seeks to investigate the role of message framings and media food safety information on consumers’ valuation of their risk of an E. coli food infection, and attitudes towards food safety technologies. Using a nationally representative sample of 1,842 residents across the US, respondents were randomly assigned into six information groups. Findings reveal that message framings, particularly loss-framed messages influence consumers’ perceived risks, and attitudes towards food safety interventions. Respondents who received the media story about the plight of a consumer who suffered an E. coli infection showed more concern about the risk of an infection, while those who received loss-framed information were in general more accepting of food safety interventions such as vaccines and direct fed microbials. These findings could help the beef industry and policy makers develop effective food safety communication strategies.
D18|Undue charges and price discrimination|In this paper, we draw attention to a type of price discrimination that seems to be widespread, but has gone unnoticed by the literature: one based on false mistakes and the heterogeneous cost of complaining. We focus on the example case of a bank manager that charges an undue fee from a client’s balance, and setup a model of price discrimination. We also devise a test for the detection of such behavior in a setting where the authorities have less information about the clients than the bank manager.
D18|Le taux technique en assurance vie (Code des Assurances)|Le taux technique est un paramètre contractuel fondamental d’une police d’assurance. De manière générale, il s’agit surtout d’un élément servant à la tarification des polices. Cependant, dans le cadre plus restreint de l’assurance-vie, il est souvent assimilé à un taux de rendement minimum garanti pour toute la vie du contrat. Les organismes proposant des produits d’assurance-vie peuvent relever de trois régimes distincts (Code des assurances, Code de la mutualité, Code de la Sécurité sociale). Même si les trois Codes sont très proches pour ce qui concerne la règlementation du taux technique, certaines nuances ainsi que des décalages sur l’entrée en vigueur des textes ne permettent pas de les analyser conjointement. Cette étude se limite donc au seul Code des assurances et aux organismes qui y sont assujettis. Les taux techniques sont encadrés par le Code des assurances et une série mensuelle des taux techniques plafonds en vigueur a pu être reconstituée. Depuis 1995, le maximum règlementaire de taux technique est établi en référence au taux moyen des emprunts de l’État français. Dans un deuxième temps, il s’est agi de caractériser le positionnement des assureurs-vie français relativement à cette borne règlementaire. En l’absence d’information précise disponible sur les dates de souscription des contrats, et donc sur leur ancienneté, l’étude s’est appuyée sur les dates de première commercialisation renseignées par les assureurs dans l’enquête annuelle ‘Taux de revalorisation’ de l’ACPR. Ce proxy, bien qu’imparfait, permet de mettre en évidence plusieurs éléments, et d’offrir une première description factuelle de l’évolution des taux techniques : 1) Le niveau moyen des taux techniques par année de première commercialisation constaté à fin 2014 apparaît aujourd’hui très en-deçà du plafond légal en vigueur à ce moment-là. On peut interpréter ce constat de plusieurs manières : certains contrats commercialisés à cette époque étaient déjà assortis de taux techniques très bas, pour d’autres, les assureurs sont parvenus, suite à l’impulsion règlementaire de 1993, à faire baisser les taux techniques moyens associés à ces années de première commercialisation, par avenant notamment pour les contrats à groupe ouvert, ou du fait de la moyenne entre les taux techniques élevés liés aux primes anciennes et aux taux techniques bas sur des primes plus récentes ; 2) Les familles de contrats assorties de taux techniques strictement nuls sont de loin les plus nombreuses, et ce quelles que soient les années de première commercialisation. On observe néanmoins des différences substantielles entre assureurs ; 3) La comparaison de versions successives de l’enquête ‘Taux de revalorisation’ semble mettre en évidence une tendance à la décroissance des taux techniques moyens entre deux dates ; 4) Pour finir, les contrats assortis de taux techniques élevés semblent être associés à une forte décollecte nette ou à des baisses de leurs taux.
D18|Étude sur les taux de revalorisation des contrats collectifs d’assurance-vie et PERP au titre de 2015|Cette étude présente un état des lieux des taux de revalorisation des contrats collectifs d’assurance vie en 2015, sur la base d’une enquête réalisée annuellement par l’ACPR dans le cadre du contrôle prudentiel des organismes d’assurance et du suivi des pratiques commerciales en assurance-vie. La présente analyse complète ainsi celle portant sur les contrats individuels, publiée dans l’Analyses et Synthèses n°70. Sont pris en compte dans le présent document tous les contrats collectifs d’assurance-vie ou de retraite professionnelle, y compris les PERP. Le taux de revalorisation moyen des contrats collectifs, net de frais de gestion, a enregistré une légère baisse, passant de 2,98 % en 2014 à 2,83 % en 2015. Cette baisse de 15 points de base est nettement inférieure à celle observée sur les taux de revalorisation des contrats individuels (de -27 points de base, le taux moyen étant de 2,27 % en 2015) et à celle du taux des emprunts d’état à 10 ans (-81 points de base, à 0,85 % en 2015). Ainsi, la majorité des contrats collectifs (correspondant à 65 % des provisions mathématiques) a été revalorisée en 2015 à un taux inférieur à celui de 2014, mais certains contrats (correspondant à près de 18 % des provisions mathématiques), ont fait l’objet d’une révision à la hausse de leur taux de revalorisation. Les observations des années précédentes restent valides en 2015. Les organismes présentant les plus gros portefeuilles différencient les taux de revalorisation entre leurs différents contrats. Pour les organismes de taille plus modeste, environ 15 % des organismes ayant répondu à l’enquête (représentant 11 % du total des provisions techniques) ont appliqué un taux de revalorisation identique à l’ensemble de leur portefeuille et 32 % (soit 13 % des provisions mathématiques) ont servi des taux variant de moins de 30 points de base sur leur portefeuille. Les contrats collectifs en cas de vie, et tout particulièrement ceux nommés par référence au code général des impôts « articles 39 », « article 83 » et « article 82 » ainsi que les contrats retraite « Madelin », gardent une place prépondérante (80 % de l’ensemble des contrats collectifs) dans les portefeuilles des organismes étudiés et sont principalement souscrits auprès des entreprises d’assurance (74 % des provisions mathématiques des contrats collectifs en cas de vie). En moyenne, ce type de contrat a fait l’objet d’une revalorisation de 2,9 %, très légèrement supérieure au taux moyen de l’ensemble des contrats collectifs. Une analyse en termes de seuils montre que deux tiers des contrats (67 % des provisions mathématiques) ont été revalorisés en 2015 à un taux au moins égal à 2,5 %. On note cependant une disparité croissante entre les contrats les moins bien rémunérés dont le taux moyen baisse de 8 points de base à 1,34 % et les contrats les mieux rémunérés dont le taux de revalorisation augmente de 13 points de base à 4,50 %. Le maintien d’un taux de revalorisation plus élevé que sur les contrats individuels est la contrepartie du caractère non rachetable de ces contrats, qui ne peuvent en général être liquidités qu’à partir de la date de la retraite. Le marché des contrats PERP en euros représente 9 % des contrats collectifs et reste dominé par les groupes de bancassurance, malgré un léger recul (62 % du total des provisions mathématiques en 2015 contre 64 % en 2014). Ce type de contrat voit son taux de revalorisation fortement diminuer en moyenne, de 32 points de base passant de 2,54% en 2014 à 2,22% à 2015, soit des taux similaires à ceux observés sur les contrats d’assurance vie individuels. On note enfin une faible différenciation des revalorisations appliquées à ces contrats, puisque la quasi-totalité des PERP a été revalorisé à un taux compris entre 1,6 et 2,6%.
D18|Analyse des taux de revalorisation des contrats individuels en 2015|Le niveau des taux de revalorisation servis aux assurés appelle une vigilance particulière du superviseur, au regard de ses objectifs à la fois de contrôle prudentiel et de suivi des pratiques commerciales en assurance vie. Le taux de revalorisation moyen des fonds euros des contrats individuels, net de frais de chargement (mais avant prélèvements fiscaux et sociaux), pondéré par les provisions mathématiques correspondantes, s’élève à 2,27 % au titre de 2015. Cette même année, les taux longs sur obligations souveraines françaises ont atteint des niveaux historiquement bas, à hauteur de 0,85% en moyenne annuelle pour l’emprunt phare à 10 ans (contre 1,66 % en 2014). Ce niveau a pesé sur les rendements courants des actifs des assureurs mais aussi sur leurs perspectives futures de rendements. Ainsi, le recul de la rémunération des provisions mathématiques (-27 points de base) aurait pu être plus important au regard de celui observé sur les taux souverains français en 2015 (-81 points de base). Il convient d’ailleurs de noter que les taux souverains ont encore poursuivi leur baisse en 2016, se situant autour de 0,65 % en moyenne sur le premier trimestre de cette année. En termes de provisions mathématiques, la part des contrats revalorisés à un taux net inférieur à l’année précédente est prépondérante (92 % en 2015 contre 90 % en 2014). À l’inverse, les contrats bénéficiant d’un relèvement ou d’une stabilité du taux de revalorisation net par rapport à l’année précédente représentent des parts très faibles (respectivement 3 % en 2015 contre 7 % en 2014 et 5 % des provisions mathématiques 2015 contre 3 % en 2014). En 2015, seulement 32 % des contrats, en termes de provisions mathématiques, affichent un taux de revalorisation net supérieur ou égal à 2,5%, alors que c’était encore le cas de la majorité (53 % des provisions mathématiques) en 2014. De plus, 70% des provisions mathématiques ont été rémunérées à un taux de revalorisation net supérieur à 2%, contre 84 % en 2014. La dispersion des taux de revalorisation nets s’est légèrement accrue cette année. Le taux moyen pondéré des 25 % de provisions mathématiques les moins rémunérées a été de 1,6 % alors que les 25 % de provisions les plus rémunérées l’ont été à un taux moyen de 3,1 %. Ces taux étaient respectivement de 1,9 % et 3,3 % en 2014. Par ailleurs, près de 76 % des provisions mathématiques présentent un taux technique en 2015 égal à 0 %, contre 75% en 2014 et 65% en 2012. Cette faiblesse des taux techniques et leur baisse en moyenne au cours du temps est un facteur d’adaptabilité des assureurs à la situation de taux bas. Toutefois, une autre composante de la revalorisation des provisions mathématiques à laquelle les assureurs ne peuvent se soustraire pour l’année écoulée provient d’engagements pris soit en termes de taux pour une durée qui ne peut excéder 2 ans en application des articles A 132-2 et A 132-3 du Code des assurances, soit pour des montants qui dépendent des performances de l’organisme et résultent des clauses contractuelles ou des obligations réglementaires, soit encore en vertu de normes applicables avant 2010. Ces engagements s’ajoutent à la contrainte de revalorisation que constitue le taux technique, mais sont en général soit limités à l’année en cours, soit modulables en fonction des performances financières de l’assureur. Ils peuvent néanmoins contraindre à posteriori les assureurs dans la baisse de leur taux de revalorisation, alors même que le rendement des nouveaux placements dans lesquels ils peuvent investir ont continué de baisser.
D18|Organization And Governance In Social Economy Enterprises: An Introduction|In this introduction, we briefly overview the topics covered by the contributions included in this special issue which, from different angles, deal with the organization and governance of social economy enterprises. Three different approaches are taken by the contributions to the special issue: one is theoretical, another is empirical and the last one is a case- based, qualitative perspective.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D18|Consumer Debt Stress, Changes In Household Debt, And The Great Recession|" type=""main"" xml:id=""ecin12218-abs-0001""> This research examines psychological debt stress and changes in household debt holdings for consumers during the Great Recession using data from a monthly national U.S. household survey covering the period 2006 through 2012. Debt stress measures in the population rose by over 50% at the bottom of the recession. Determining relative stress for eight different types of household debt, we find that noncollateralized debts are more stressful than collateralized debt and that during the recession the composition of debt shifted away from collateralized debt and toward noncollateralized. Our empirical results show that women and Hispanics experienced higher measured levels of stress. (JEL D12, D18)"
D18|A Constitutional Economics Perspective on Soft Paternalism|Using a framework that distinguishes short-term consumer preferences, individual reflective preferences and political preferences, we discuss from a constitutional economics perspective whether individuals find it in their common constitutional interest to endow representatives and bureaucrats with the competence to impose soft paternalist policies. The focus is specifically on soft paternalist policies, because these often work with non-transparent 'nudges' that are considered as manipulative in some contributions to the literature. We show that those soft paternalist policies that are manipulative indeed collide with three criteria of consumer sovereignty, reflective sovereignty and citizen sovereignty that can be argued to represent common constitutional interest of citizens. On the other hand, we argue that the set of paternalist policies that is deemed acceptable on the constitutional level is restricted to non-manipulative instruments, and their application as government policies is limited to cases with stable and very homogenous preferences. However, we also argue that competitive markets are capable of supplying many mechanisms that allow individuals to cope with problems in their decision-making processes on a private level.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D18|Making the World a Better Place: Consumers' Group Identity in the Markets with Competition and Two-sided Opportunism|Consumer boycotts often provide a disciplinary mechanism against firms deviating from established social norms. Such actions tend to be organized by people through reference groups with a social mission. The intensity of the group identity is, however, private information. Therefore, the membership is the subject of opportunistic free riding. Moreover, opportunism reinforces opportunism in the market transactions as both a deviating and a non-deviating firm can also take the advantage. Despite such limitations on the maintenance of the code of the high ethical conduct, the paper shows that the joint impact competition and the group effect support the profits of firms with a high ethical code. Paradoxically, a strong group identity effect among the consumers may advance the low ethical code as high-cost competitors are not survived. As the monitoring by the consumer groups is focused on large firms these are - against the received wisdom – more likely to adopt the code of the high ethical conduct than the small firms. Pareto-efficient bargaining with the buyers’ alliance may not turn out to be an attractive strategy for a firm.
D18|Monopoly price discrimination and privacy: The hidden cost of hiding|A monopolist can use a ‘tracking’ technology to identify a consumer’s willingness to pay with some probability. Consumers can counteract tracking by acquiring a ‘hiding’ technology. We show that consumers may be collectively better off absent this hiding technology.
D18|Excessive Competition for Headline Prices|When firms' shrouding of charges, as in Gabaix and Laibson (2006), meets with consumers' salient thinking, as in Bordalo et al. (2013), this can have severe welfare implications. The ensuing excessive competition for headline prices tends to inefficiently bias consumers' choice towards low-quality products, which is compounded when firms react and reduce quality beyond what would be cost efficient. As more intense shopping leads to a greater pass through of shrouded charges into lower headline prices, which aggravates the problem, competition policy is no substitute for consumer protection policy. While in our model all consumers are potential victims of salient thinking and shrouded charges, salient thinking becomes effective only for those who are attentive to different offers. Attentive consumers are likely to show ex-post regret and they can be ex-ante worse off, even though their choice set is larger. The combination of shrouding and salient thinking can sufficiently disadvantage high-quality firms so as to make them willing to educate consumers and unshroud all charges. While there is no unshrouding on equilibrium, high-quality firms' threat of unshrouding may sufficiently discipline firms to make efficient product choices.
D18|Restoring Rational Choice: The Challenge of Consumer Financial Regulation|This lecture considers the case for consumer financial regulation in an environment where many households lack the knowledge to manage their financial affairs effectively. The lecture argues that financial ignorance is pervasive and unsurprising given the complexity of modern financial products, and that it contributes meaningfully to the evolution of wealth inequality. The lecture uses a stylized model to discuss the welfare economics of paternalistic intervention in financial markets, and discusses several specific examples including asset allocation in retirement savings, fees for unsecured short-term borrowing, and reverse mortgages.
D18|Loan Product Steering in Mortgage Markets|We present evidence of a particular type of loan steering in which lenders lead borrowers to take out high margin mortgage products. We identify this activity by comparing borrowers who were rejected by lenders but were subsequently approved by their affiliates (steered borrowers) to other initially rejected borrowers who obtained loans elsewhere. Although steered borrowers default less, they pay significantly higher interest rates and are more likely to borrow through contracts with unconventional features, such as negative amortization or prepayment penalties. Female borrowers, single borrowers with no co-signers, and borrowers in low-income locations are more likely to be steered.
D18|Borrower protection and the supply of credit: Evidence from foreclosure laws|Laws governing the foreclosure process can have direct consequences for the costs of foreclosure and, therefore could affect lending decisions. We exploit the heterogeneity in judicial requirements across US states to examine their impact on banks’ lending decisions in a sample of urban areas straddling state borders. A key feature of our study is the way it exploits an exogenous cutoff in loan eligibility to government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) guarantees, which shift the burden of foreclosure costs onto the GSEs. We find that judicial requirements reduce the supply of credit only for jumbo loans, which are ineligible for GSE guarantees, i.e., in the nonsubsidized segment of the market. Thus, while we find a significant effect on credit supply, the aggregate impact is muted by the indirect cross-subsidy by the GSEs to borrower-friendly states.
D18|Consumers’ credit card repayment decisions: The role of higher anchors and future repayment concern|We investigated two aspects of credit card repayment decisions: the extent to which the anchoring effect of minimum repayment information may be mitigated by information on alternative anchors, specifically repayments that would repay the balance in two years (Study 1) or nine months (Study 2); and the role of future repayment concern. In two experiments, three realistic credit card statements were presented with different outstanding balances. Participants, who were randomly allocated to one of four information conditions depending on supplementary information provided on the statements, stated how much they would repay that month. They were then asked about concerns they would have about repayment difficulties if they had a fixed consumer loan over three years. In Study 1 the alternative two-year repayment anchor had a negative effect on percent repayment, whereas in Study 2 the nine-month repayment anchor had a significant positive effect, especially for those with higher future repayment concern. Also, in both studies, future repayment concern had a direct inverse effect on repayment decisions which partially mediated the effect of disposable income. It is concluded that the addition to credit card statements of a table of cost and duration information for a range of repayment amounts may usefully support repayment decisions.
D18|Helping consumers with a front-of-pack label: Numbers or colors?|This paper contributes to the debate on front-of-pack nutritional labels. Because of their dissimilar formats, Guideline Daily Amount (GDA) and Traffic Light (TL) may trigger different responses among consumers. While GDA is comprehensive and cognitively demanding, information is coarser and more salient in TL. We implement an incentivized laboratory experiment to assess the relative performance of GDA and TL labeling schemes in assisting consumers to build a healthy daily menu. Participants must compose a daily menu, choosing from a finite set of products, and are paid a fixed cash amount only if the menu satisfies pre-determined nutritional goals. Goals correspond to achieving the Guideline Daily Amount values of 1 (kcal), 4 (kcal, fat, sugar, salt) or 7 (kcal, fat, sugar, salt, fiber, vitamin C and calcium) different nutritional attributes. Three different labels, GDA, TL and a combined GDATL are provided. Results show that GDA performs better than TL when subjects do not face time constraints. When time is limited however, TL and GDA have identical efficacy with 4 nutritional goals, and TL even outperforms GDA with 7 nutritional goals.
D18|New trends in the debate on geographical indications: evidence from Ecuador|Geographical Indications (GIs) are names of regions, specific places or, in exceptional cases, countries, used to describe an agricultural product or a foodstuff (EC 510/2006, Art. 2). They have received much attention in recent years not only at the European level, where they stem from, but also at different international forums such as at the World Trade Organization (wto). Being a particular form of intellectual property, these certification schemes have the potential to be applied also to non-agrifood commodities or even services. Furthermore, due to the grave menace of biodiversity loss caused by globalization, GIs could serve as a tool to promote biodiversity if linked to plant varieties or animal species in danger of disappearance. It seems that at European level these issues are gathering momentum. For this reason, the purpose of this paper is to support new interpretations regarding GI legislation. In the remainder of this paper, the authors will present a short description of GIs as they have been discussed at different international forums. Also, the innovative implementation of GIs in Ecuador will be illustrated by means of two examples: the Sombrero of Montecristi and the cacao Nacional Arriba. Based on these examples we trace possible scenarios of GI implementation in a particular type of service economy such as food tourism. In the final part, some conclusions will be presented.
D18|Il Food Safety Modernization Act|La materia della sicurezza alimentare presenta una natura complessa ed è regolamentata da normative che cercano di tener conto e bilanciare un insieme molteplice di interessi sociali ed economici.Dal 2011, a seguito dell’emanazione del Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) la Food and Drugs Administration americana (FDA) è responsabile della sicurezza alimentare dei prodotti nazionali e delle forniture d’importazione.I produttori statunitensi e gli importatori sono tenuti a sviluppare e attuare piani di prevenzione e controllo dei rischi alimentari mentre la FDA può effettuare ispezioni periodiche e disporre il richiamo dei prodotti non conformi.Tutto ciò prevede l’applicazione di un complesso ma efficiente sistema di tracciabilità degli alimenti.
D18|Access to Short-term Credit and Consumption Smoothing within the Paycycle|I study the effect of access to payday loans on the timing, level and composition of consumption. Using a newly obtained military administrative dataset of sales at on-base grocery and department stores, I examine how consumption behavior changes after the passage of a federal law that effectively bans military personnel from accessing payday loans in some states but not others. The military setting is ideal for this analysis because military personnel are assigned to locations across the United States with varying degrees of access to payday loans. Furthermore, since military personnel face varying known wait times between paycheck receipts throughout the year, I can examine daily consumption patterns in ways that were infeasible with previous datasets and surveys. I first present evidence that food expenditures spike on payday and are significantly lower at the end of a pay period; the fact that these patterns hold for perishable goods like produce indicates that food consumption is also not smooth, even over a two-week period. Then using a difference-in-difference framework, I find that payday loan access enables consumers to better smooth their consumption between paychecks, with no detectable effect on the level of food consumption. These patterns imply that payday loans enable liquidity-constrained individuals to smooth their consumption. However, I also find suggestive evidence that they lead to temptation purchases. Military personnel purchase more alcohol and electronics when given access to payday loans. Further evidence suggests that there may be significant heterogeneity in the population, with indications of present-biased preferences among some individuals and forward-looking, self controlled behavior among others.
D18|Did the Target data breach change consumer assessments of payment card security?|Previous research has found that perceptions of payment security affect consumers’ use of payment instruments. We test whether the Target data breach in 2013 was associated with a change in consumers’ perceptions of the security of credit cards and debit cards and with subsequent changes in consumers’ use of payment cards. Using data from the Survey of Consumer Payment Choice (SCPC), we find that, controlling for possible confounding effects of demographic differences between the two groups, ratings by consumers who assessed the security of personal information of debit cards shortly after the breach were lower than ratings by consumers who responded before the breach was reported. On average, the rating on the security of personal information of debit cards relative to the rating on the security of other payment instruments was 11.3 percent lower shortly after the Target breach. Based on prior research on the impact of security assessments on payment instrument use, we would expect a small (economically insignificant) decline in debit card use from this lower rating. However, we find no statistically or economically significant change in debit card use from 2013 to 2014. For credit cards, there was no difference in the ratings given by consumers who responded to the survey before the breach was reported and the ratings of those who responded after the breach was reported.
D18|Identity theft as a teachable moment|This paper examines how instances of identity theft that are sufficiently severe to induce consumers to place an extended fraud alert in their credit reports affect their risk scores, delinquencies, and other credit bureau variables on impact and thereafter. We show that for many consumers these effects are relatively small and transitory. However, for a significant number of consumers, especially those with lower risk scores prior to the event, there are more persistent and generally positive effects on credit bureau variables, including risk scores. We argue that these positive changes for subprime consumers are consistent with the effect of increased salience of credit file information to the consumer at the time of the identity theft.
D18|The Market for Financial Adviser Misconduct|We document the economywide extent of misconduct among financial advisers and the associated labor market consequences. Seven percent of advisers have misconduct records, and this share reaches more than 15 percent at some of the largest firms. Roughly one-third of advisers with misconduct are repeat offenders. Approximately half of advisers lose their jobs after misconduct. The labor market partially undoes firm-level discipline by rehiring such advisers. Firms that persistently engage in misconduct coexist with firms that have clean records. We show that this phenomenon may be explained by some firms “specializing” in misconduct and catering to unsophisticated consumers.
D18|The Influence of the European Union Consumer Protection Policy on Croatian Consumers|The European Union Consumer Protection Policy (EU CPP) focuses on the awareness and active participation of consumers in the internal market and therefore counts on consumers’ knowledge of their own conferred rights. Since it is not yet clear what Croatian consumers’ attitudes towards the EU Consumer Protection Policy are, this paper attempts to analyze the impact of the EU Consumer Protection Policy on Croatian consumers’ interest, knowledge, their source of information and their perceived security as consumers. Quantitative (survey) data collection among consumers within the entire Croatia has been used for the analysis. The collected data has been analyzed by using descriptive statistics, correlation and regression analysis, and the analysis of variance (ANOVA). The paper eventually finds significant correlations between Croatian consumers’ degrees of interest, actual knowledge, preferred information sources and perceived security. It furthermore shows that the attitude of Croatian consumers towards the European Union’s system of consumer protection currently shows a significant lack of interest and knowledge. The paper concludes with a premise which states that the attempts to increase interest and knowledge among Croatian consumers require the use of information provided via visible Internet sources.

D18|Loan Product Steering in Mortgage Markets|We present evidence of a particular type of loan steering in which lenders lead borrowers to take out high margin mortgage products. We identify this activity by comparing borrowers who were rejected by lenders but were subsequently approved by their affiliates (steered borrowers) to other initially rejected borrowers who obtained loans elsewhere. Although steered borrowers default less, they pay significantly higher interest rates and are more likely to borrow through contracts with unconventional features, such as negative amortization or prepayment penalties. Female borrowers, single borrowers with no co-signers, and borrowers in low-income locations are more likely to be steered.
D18|Misled and mis-sold: financial misbehaviour in retail banks?|We use an audit methodology where auditors ask for tax saving instruments from banks and document the disclosures made on product features at the time of sale. In private sector banks with high sales incentives, the high commission product is recommended. In public sector banks, where there are deposit mobilisation targets, fixed deposits are recommended. Banks rarely make voluntary disclosures on product features. When specifically requested, information provided is inaccurate or incomplete. Our results demonstrate the challenges of mandating disclosures when buyers have little understanding of the relevance of product characteristics, and distributors are themselves ignorant or influenced by incentives. They also raise concerns regarding private sector banking without regulatory capacity.
D18|Financial Education Policies in Asia and the Pacific|A number of factors and trends have driven the development of financial education policies in Asia and the Pacific in recent years. In some countries and economies, the development of financial education policies has been mostly spurred by high levels of financial exclusion, both among households and small businesses, in a context of low financial literacy, low general education and high poverty. In others, current or anticipated population ageing is also playing an important role. Various countries and economies in the region have engaged in the development of financial education and financial consumer protection policy responses to help address these issues. This report provides an overview of the recent trends and developments on financial education in Asia and the Pacific. It describes the status of national strategies for financial education and highlights financial education programmes targeting different audiences and through a variety of delivery channels. Based on the analysis of these initiatives, the report offers policy and practical suggestions for policy makers and other stakeholders.
D18|Search Deterrence|We study sales techniques which discourage consumer search by making it harder or more expensive to return to buy after a search for alternatives. It is unilaterally profitable for a seller to deter search under mild conditions, but sellers can suffer when all do so. When a seller cannot commit to its policy, it exploits the inference that those consumers who try to buy later have no good alternative, and in many cases the outcome is as if the seller must make an exploding offer. Search deterrence results in sub-optimal matching of products to consumers and often raises the price consumers pay.
D18|Insolvency After the 2005 Bankruptcy Reform|Using a comprehensive panel data set on U.S. households, we study the effects of the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA), the most substantive reform of personal bankruptcy in the United States since the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. The 2005 legislation introduced a means test based on income to establish eligibility for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and increased the administrative requirements to file, leading to a rise in the opportunity cost and, especially, the financial cost of filing for bankruptcy. We study the effects of the reform on bankruptcy, insolvency, and foreclosure. We find that the reform caused a permanent drop in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy rate relative to pre-reform levels, due to the rise in filing costs associated with the reform, which can be interpreted as resulting from liquidity constraints. We find that the decline in bankruptcy filings resulted in a rise in the rate and persistence of insolvency as well as an increase in the rate of foreclosure. We find no evidence of a link between the decline in bankruptcy and a rise in the number of individuals who are current on their debt. We document that these effects are concentrated at the bottom of the income distribution, suggesting that the income means tests introduced by BAPCPA did not serve as an effective screening device. We show that insolvency is associated with worse financial outcomes than bankruptcy, as insolvent individuals have less access to new lines of credit and display lower credit scores than individuals who file for bankruptcy. Since bankruptcy filings declined much more for low income individuals, our findings suggest that BAPCPA may have removed an important form of relief from financial distress for this group.
D18|FinTech in Developing Countries: Charting New Customer Journeys|A customer’s journey is the path the customer travels to satisfy their needs and wants and will typically consist of several separate processes. FinTech product and service developers in advanced economies often understand how difficult many customers find their journey with banks and have been able the make the journey more pleasant and seamless. They are aided in this by their personal similarities to their customers in terms of background, education, and technological literacy. However, these similarities do not exist when products and services are being designed for customers in developing countries. In these markets, product designers need to rely on an evidence-based assessment of customer needs and wants, which will usually have to be specially commissioned, coupled, ideally, with visiting local villages and speaking to the local people who will be the potential customers for the products and services. The failure to appreciate the nuances of local customer journeys underlies many of the FinTech failures in the developing world.
D18|The Prospects, Benefits and Challenges of Sui Generis Protection of Geographical Indications of South Africa|This article appraises the prospects, benefits and challenges of sui generis protection of geographical indications (GIs) in South Africa (SA). In SA, there is no specific legislation protecting GIs, and the country relies, amongst others, on the common law system and various legislations, such as the Agricultural Products Standards Act of 1990; Counterfeit Goods of 1997; the Liquor Products; the Trademark Act; the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Act of 2013; and the Consumer Protection Act of 1998. It is therefore argued that SA needs a specific law that considers GIs as a specific, separate intellectual property right (IPR).
D18|Non-governmental organisations in European Union and its role in consumer protection|The article is based on an analysis of the subject literature, the legal acts and information from the official web sites of European non-governmental organisations (NGO?s), the main purpose of which is to present the idea and the primary role of NGO?s, whose priority is to propagate and popularize consumer protection in the European Union.In addition an analysis is conducted of the systematics of Consumer non-governmental sector in European Union. Also the relation between non-governmental organisations and European Commission are indicated. The article includes a characterisation of the specific role of the European Economic and Social Committee, which consists of representatives of the various economic and social components of organised civil society, such as consumers in the development of consumer protection in the European market. Generally consumer protection policy was established after the year 1992. At that time, on 7 February 1992 in Maastricht, the Treaty on the European Union undertaken to integrate Europe was signed by the members of the European Community. The Treaty devoted to consumer protection is under a separate title, XI. From that time, the Community shall contribute to the attainment of a high level of consumer protection. One of the ways to achieve this aim is the development of NGO?s within the consumer sectors, which can be called the dedicated voice of the consumer at national and Community level.In the next section of the article the chosen European Union non-government organization and its role in consumer protection is analyzed. In particular the specific actions undertaken on that matter by the European Community of Consumer Co-operatives (Euro Coop), the European Farmers Organisation, the European Association for the co-ordination of Consumer Representation in Standardisation (ANEC) and the Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs ( BEUC ) are analysed.The final section of the article is the conclusion of the real role of consumer NGO?s both now and in the future in European Union policy. Those considerations are based on real European Union regulations such as Regulation (EU) No 254/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on a multiannual consumer programme for the years 2014-20, and the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the Proposal for the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Consumer Programme 2014-2020.
D18|Insufficiencies and loopholes of self- regulation in overindebtedness prevention: The case of the Dominican Republic|The Dominican Republic’s microfinance sector is considered to be a growing and solid market. However, the widely implemented overindebtedness prevention best practices are by themselves not sufficient to prevent financial fragility among a part of the MFIs’ clients.We identify these practices as self-regulation mechanisms and, based on fieldwork conducted between 2012 and 2015, we show how they fail to fully fulfil their goals in the Dominican market. While financial exclusion supports the idea of an unlimited microcredit market, we argue that the focus on growth imperatives and high competition strongly jeopardize the positive outcomes of microcredit on clients’ well-being.
D18|Undue Charges and Price Discrimination|In this paper, we draw attention to a type of price discrimination that seems to be widespread, but has gone unnoticed by the literature: one based on false mistakes and the heterogeneous cost of complaining. We focus on the hypothetical example case of a bank manager that charges an undue fee from a client’s balance, and setup a model of price discrimination. We also devise a test for the detection of such behavior in a setting where the authorities have less information about the clients than the bank manager
D18|Spanish regulation for labeling of financial products: a behavioral-experimental analysis|Abstract This paper assesses the impact of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness’ (Board of Executives (BOE) Order ECC/2316/2015. Economy and Competitiveness Ministry, Spain, 2015) new regulation for financial product labeling. We design and conduct an economic experiment where subjects make risky investment decisions under three different treatments: a control group where subjects have only objective information about the key features of the products they must select and two treatment groups introducing visual labels resembling the labels required under the new Spanish regulation. The results of the experiment are analyzed within the framework of rank-dependent utility theory. While visual labels do not change the utility function of the subjects, they do significantly affect the subjects’ weighting functions. The introduction of numerical and color-coded labels significantly increases the concavity of the weighting functions and increases pessimism and risk-aversion in cases where the probability of obtaining the best outcome is high. Labels widen the difference between real subjects’ behavior and that of the perfectly rational agents described by expected utility theory. Consequently, our empirical findings raise doubts as to whether the new regulation actually achieves its objectives. The regulation seeks to empower retail investors by enhancing their understanding of financial products. Introducing the visual labels, however, seemingly increases the differences between actual risk levels and the decision weights applied by subjects when making decisions. Moreover, labels increase investors’ pessimism and risk-aversion when the best outcome is likely and fail to alter investors’ risk-aversion when the worst outcome is likely.

D18|Catering to investors through product complexity|This study investigates the rationale for issuing complex securities to retail investors. We focus on a large market of investment products targeted exclusively at households: retail structured products in Europe. We develop an economic measure of product complexity in this market via a text analysis of 55,000 product payoff formulas. Over the 2002–2010 period, product complexity increases, risky products become more common, and product headline rates diverge from the prevailing interest rates as the latter decline. The complexity of a product is positively correlated with its headline rate and risk. Complex products appear more profitable to the banks distributing them, have a lower expost performance, and are more frequently sold by banks targeting low-income households. These empirical facts are consistent with banks strategically using product complexity to cater to yield-seeking households. JEL Classification: I22, G1, D18, D12
D18|Choosing whether to compete: Price and format competition with consumer confusion|We run a market experiment where subjects take the role of firms and can choose not only their price but also whether to present comparable offers. Firms are faced with artificial demand whereby consumers make mistakes in assessing the net value of products on the market. Some of those consumers are however able to identify the best of the comparable offers if some offers are comparable, and favor that offer vs. non-comparable offers. We vary the portion of such consumers and the strength of their preferences for the best of the comparable offers. In treatments where firms observe the past decisions of their competitors, firms learn to collude in not presenting comparable offers. This occurs after initial periods with strong competition. Collusion lowers welfare for all consumers and is most frequent when many consumers prefer comparable offers. In treatments where firms cannot monitor competitors however, firms respond to the preference of a portion of consumers for comparable offers. This leads to an improvement in welfare for all consumers.
D18|Market Regulation of Voluntary Add-on Contracts|This paper analyzes contract choices and the effectiveness of consumer protection policies when firms can offer voluntary add-on insurance for their products at the point of sale. We develop a model in which a base product can be sold together with a voluntary extended warranty contract that insures consumers against the risk of product breakdown. Some consumers do not pay attention to extended warranties before making a base product choice, but they overestimate the value of such warranties at the point of sale. Under retail competition, if the resulting extended warranty profits are sufficiently high, a no-arbitrage condition prevents the full profits from being redistributed to consumers via a lower base product price. Inducing competition in the extended warranty market weakly increases consumer welfare and weakly outperforms a minimum warranty standard, which can even reduce consumer surplus. The results of the paper are consistent with the effects of recent changes regarding extended warranty regulation by UK legislators.
D18|Cellular Service Demand: Biased Beliefs, Learning, and Bill Shock|Following FCC pressure to end bill shock, cellular carriers now alert customers when they exceed usage allowances. We estimate a model of plan choice, usage, and learning using a 2002-2004 panel of cellular bills. Accounting for firm price adjustment, we predict that implementing alerts in 2002-2004 would have lowered average annual consumer welfare by $33. We show that consumers are inattentive to past usage, meaning that bill-shock alerts are informative. Additionally, our estimates imply that consumers are overconfident, underestimating the variance of future calling. Overconfidence costs consumers $76 annually at 2002-2004 prices. Absent overconfidence, alerts would have little to no effect. (JEL D12, D18, L11, L96, L98)
D18|Implantación de la trazabilidad y su relación con la calidad: marco conceptual y retos estratégicos. Aplicación al sector pesquero| El objetivo de este trabajo es proponer un marco conceptual que facilite a las empresas la implantación de la trazabilidad en el sector pesquero y permita aprovechar al máximo todas sus oportunidades. El marco conceptual propuesto está fundamentado en crear redes de cooperación entre los agentes de la cadena de valor. La creación de este tipo de redes no solo facilitaría la creación de cadenas de valor más seguras sino también permitiría informar al consumidor sobre las propiedades intrínsecas relevantes que dotan de calidad al producto (ej. origen). En cuanto a la señalización de la trazabilidad, se demanda la creación de indicadores claros, creíbles y fáciles de utilizar por el consumidor. Por último, se hace necesario mejorar el proceso de autenticación o verificación de las propiedades intrínsecas en los puntos críticos de la cadena de valor.
D18|Consumer willingness to pay for animal welfare attributes in a developing country context: The case of chicken in Nairobi, Kenya| In developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, policy makers have been reluctant to formulate animal welfare policies. This is despite potential benefits of such policies including increased domestic and global consumers’ demand for products that are compliant with humane treatment of animals. This study employed a choice experiment method to establish consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for animal welfare attributes in chicken. Data were drawn from 200 chicken consumers in Nairobi, Kenya and estimated using a random parameter logit model. The results indicate that consumers were willing to pay a premium for humanely-treated chicken. The consumers had a positive and significant preference for use of certified transportation means, humanely slaughtered chicken and animal welfare labelling. However, the consumers showed a negative preference for use of antibiotics in chicken production. These findings are vital for formulation of product differentiation strategies in the industry as well as food policy.

D18|Factors Influencing U.S. Poultry Exports| We investigate major factors behind U.S. poultry exports. While many economic variables such as exchange rate and foreign consumer income and animal disease such as avian influenza affect U.S. poultry exports, trade barriers of various kinds tend to impact U.S. poultry exports more significantly. The major trade barriers facing U.S. poultry exports include EU technical trade barrier, Indian protectionism using avian influenza as a guise, various anti-dumping cases, Russian ban in retaliation to U.S. economic sanctions, and religious trade barriers encountered in some Muslim countries.
D18|Household Debt: Facts, Puzzles, Theories, and Policies|Borrowing decisions affect most households, with large stakes and implications for research subfields as varied as macroeconomics and industrial organization.

I also discuss opportunities and challenges in policy evaluation. A key takeaway is that puzzles abound, and I highlight numerous avenues for further research.
D18|Complaining Behaviour and Consumer Safety: Research on Romania Online Shopping|In the last decade, new economic phenomena have emerged and their implications regarding consumer wellbeing need a thorough analysis. Synthesizing statistics in the European Union, it revealed a tendency in recent years of increasing the number of notifications on products that pose safety or security risks to consumers as well as a rising number of buyers resorting to online shopping. Utilizing new data collected through the statistical survey research method, the paper represents a study on the complaining behaviour of Romanians who opt to purchase products from online stores, as members or the European Union, their consumer safety regarding online shopping and the degree to which they are properly informed and know their rights. The results showed that Romanian consumers are circumspect about purchasing products online. However, they tend to be occasional buyers and they are reluctant regarding registering complaints concerning noncompliant products purchased online due. The paper provides an original study on complaining behaviour and consumer safety in Romania regarding products purchased from the internet and the identified solutions can lead to an improvement of consumer protection in the online environment.
D18|Bancarizing with Credit Cards: Experimental Evidence on Interest Rates and Minimum Payments Elasticities for New Clients|"We study the bancarization of marginal borrowers using credit cards and document that this process is difficult: default risk is substantial, returns heterogeneous, and account closings common. We also take advantage of a randomized control trial that varied interest rates and minimum payments in a very wide range. Against our hypothesis, we find that default risk is very insensitive to (randomized) large changes in interest rates and minimum payments. This could imply that regulating these contract terms may not necessarily ""protect"" consumers against default and that moral hazard in this market is negligible on average."
D18|Dynamic Competition in Deceptive Markets|In many deceptive markets, firms design contracts to exploit mistakes of naive consumers. These contracts also attract less profitable sophisticated consumers. I study such markets when firms compete repeatedly and gather usage data about their customers which is informative about the likelihood of a customer being sophisticated. I find that in sharp contrast to a model with only rational consumers, this customer information is of great value to its owner despite perfect competition. Formally, I introduce a two-period model in which all consumers are aware of a transparent price component. Naives additionally pay a hidden fee, e.g. for an add-on service, that they do not take into account. Competing firms cannot discriminate between new consumers, but in period 2 can employ their private information to offer type-dependent contracts to their first-period customer base. I find that in period 2, firms offer a transparent discount to continuing naives but not to sophisticates, thereby making the less profitable sophisticates more prone to switch to poaching competitors. Uninformed competitors therefore adversely attract unprofitable sophisticates, leading them to compete less vigorously. This allows firms to earn positive margins on continuing naives, while breaking even on sophisticates. Since the adverse attraction of sophisticates mitigates competition, margins from naives increase in the share of sophisticates and firms prefer an even mix of both customer types. I also show that if firms can educate (some) naives about hidden fees, competition is already mitigated when firms compete for customers in the first period with symmetric information. Intuitively, firms coordinate prices in period 1 to prevent education in period 2. As a result, total profits increase already before firms learn about their customersâ€™ naivetÃ©. I analyze a policy that discloses customer information to all firms and thereby increases consumer surplus, and illustrate the robustness of results through several extensions.
D18|Children and the Financial Regulatory Landscape in Latin America|In spite of the increasing evidence that has revealed that early access to financial services has long-term impacts, children and adolescents continue to face major obstacles to be financially included, particularly in the developing world. This document presents the main results of a survey conducted among 14 Latin American countries and reports the landscape of regulation and policies that may enhance child and youth financial inclusion in the region giving policy recommendations stemming from a cross-country analysis. The results of this mapping exercise suggest that a) there is a great diversity in approaches to financial service regulation for children and youth in the region, b) The policies or intentions from national authorities do not always resonate in either regulation or implementation and c) young people are not often seen as independent economic actors. ****** Este documento presenta los principales resultados de una encuesta a Autoridades Reguladoras del Sistema Financiero de catorce países de América Latina y el Caribe, exponiendo el panorama de la inclusión y la educación financiera de niños y jóvenes en la región. El documento propone recomendaciones de políticas a partir del análisis de las respuestas de las Autoridades Reguladoras en las temáticas de acceso a servicios financieros, protección al consumidor financiero y educación financiera. Los resultados sugieren que en la región hay una gran heterogeneidad en el abordaje de la inclusión financiera de niños y jóvenes, que las políticas diseñadas no siempre redundan en un marco regulatorio o implementación adecuados y que tanto jóvenes como niños no siempre son vistos desde las políticas públicas como actores económicos.
D18|Autonomy-Enhancing Paternalism|" type=""main""> We present a form of soft paternalism called “autonomy-enhancing paternalism” that seeks to increase individual well-being by facilitating the individual ability to make critically reflected, autonomous decisions. The focus of autonomy-enhancing paternalism is on helping individuals to become better decision-makers, rather than on helping them by making better decisions for them. Autonomy-enhancing paternalism acknowledges that behavioral interventions can change the strength of decision-making anomalies over time, and favors those interventions that improve, rather than reduce, individuals' ability to make good and unbiased decisions. By this it prevents manipulation of the individual by the soft paternalist, accounts for the heterogeneity of individuals, and counteracts slippery slope arguments by decreasing the probability of future paternalistic interventions. Moreover, autonomy-enhancing paternalism can be defended based on both liberal values and welfare considerations."
D18|Nouvelles technologies et protection des épargnants : l’action de l’AMF|New technologies foster the emergence of innovative financial intermediation channels and allow a better allocation of savings in the interest of investors and the economy as a whole. These can also help companies reduce their bank financing dependence. Through three examples, this article depicts new issues the financial regulator is facing. The rise of new technologies should be accompanied and encouraged but the regulator also has to prevent and take action against all abusive practices that may surface in the wake of online tools. Forex trading platforms provide a typical example of financial products that are not suited to individual investors. On the contrary, the introduction of regulated status and a label dedicated to crowdfunding help secure a new investment vehicle for investors which might diversify and supplement traditional financing sources for companies in the long run. Finally, this article focuses on social media as a new communication tool for financial agents. Social media allow professionals to offer particularly rich and innovative customer experience, and can contribute to strengthening the quality of the information provided to investors when good practices are met.

D18|Putting on a tight leash and levelling playing field: An experiment in strategic obfuscation and consumer protection|The paper reports the results of an experiment where asymmetric sellers of a product can obfuscate the market. We show that policy measures may have unintended effects of increasing obfuscation incentives. We find that policies that limit the effectiveness of obfuscation and policies that promote parity between firms can lead less prominent firms to increase their obfuscation efforts. Despite this unintended effect, however, the former type of policies is effective in boosting consumer welfare.
D18|Debt out of control: The links between self-control, compulsive buying, and real debts|In a representative sample of the German population (n=946), we explored the links between self-control, compulsive buying, and debts. Participants completed the self-control scale (Tangney, Boone, & Baumeister, 2004) and the German Addictive Buying Scale (Raab, Neuner, Reisch, & Scherhorn, 2005). Additionally, they gave information about their real debts. It was observed that self-control was negatively related to debts while compulsive buying was positively related to debts. Detailed analyses revealed that the link between self-control and debts was fully mediated by compulsive buying. Finally, there was a gender effect on compulsive buying: women were more prone to compulsive buying than men. Age also was significantly negatively related to compulsive buying and positively linked to self-control. Household income was not linked to self-control, compulsive buying, and debts. Implications for practice, policy, and research are discussed.
D18|Effects of informational nudges on consumer debt repayment behaviors|This study examines the impact of billing disclosure changes mandated by the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act on consumers’ decisions about their monthly credit card debt repayments. The study uses data from a nationally representative monthly survey of households from June 2006 through December 2011. Estimates show that the CARD Act disclosures were effective in inducing households to increase the amounts of credit card debt paid off each month, with the strongest effects seen in the proportion of households who pay off balances in full each month. Among households who continue to carry credit card debt, there is minimal evidence of repayment behavior changes due to CARD. Results are robust to controlling for selection into credit card ownership and to a variety of time controls and subsample periods.

Mnogobrojnost, nesistematiziranost i neusuglašenost pravnih izvora, kao i njihovo stalno mijenjanje, otežavaju primjenu širokog potrošackog prava jer se zahtijeva njegovo dublje poznavanje. Pravilima o zaštiti potrošaca nastoji se osigurati njihov bolji položaj na tržištu u odnosu na trgovca jer su slabija strana. Uobicajeno je da trgovci unaprijed kreiraju ugovore sa standardiziranim sadržajem te ih takve nude potrošacima, a mnoge su od tih formuliranih odredbi nepoštene. Prisutna je izrazita neravnopravnost potrošaca u odnosu na trgovca, koji ili mora prihvatiti takve odredbe zbog monopolskog položaja trgovca ili cak nije ni svjestan da ih prihvaca, jer mu trgovac namjerno ne skrece pažnju na njih. Najcešce se nepoštene klauzule nalaze u adhezijskim ugovorima ili opcim uvjetima poslovanja na koje potrošac ne može utjecati. Prava potrošaca krše se i nepoštenim poslovnim praksama trgovaca koje idu od lažnog oglašavanja pa sve do potpunog neuvažavanja potrošaca kad želi reklamirati manjkavi proizvod ili raskinuti ugovor. Materijalnopravnim i postupovnim zakonskim odredbama nastoji se sprijeciti nesavjesno postupanje trgovaca i poboljšati položaj potrošaca.

D18|A tale of two vintages: credit limit management before and after the CARD act and Great Recession|This paper uses tradeline-level credit card data to examine initial credit limits and early credit limit increases before and after the Great Recession and implementation of the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the CARD Act). I compare two vintages of credit card accounts, those opened in 2005 and 2011; I also follow each vintage for more than two years after the account opening. In general, I find that significantly less credit was extended to approved credit card applicants in 2011 than in 2005. Accounts in the 2011 vintage started out with lower initial credit limits, received fewer limit increases, and received a smaller increase amount in dollar terms. These changes were most pronounced among the riskiest 25 percent of accounts opened in 2011. For this segment of the market, the median initial credit limit fell 66.7 percent to $500, and the median limit increase amount fell by at least 25 percent at each observation point. At the same time, limit increases occurred more often and sooner for this group, perhaps in recognition of the very low starting limits.
D18|Debt Collection Agencies and the Supply of Consumer Credit|I examine the role of third-party debt collectors in consumer credit markets. Using law enforcement as an instrument for the number of debt collectors, I find that higher density of debt collectors increases the supply of unsecured credit. The estimated elasticity of the average credit card balance with respect to the number of debt collectors per capita is 0.49, the elasticity of the average balance on non-credit card unsecured loans with respect to the number of debt collectors per capita is 1.32. I also find evidence that creditors substitute unsecured credit for secured credit when the number of debt collectors increases. Higher density of debt collectors improves recoveries, which enables lenders to extend morecredit. Finally, creditors charge higher interest rates and lend to a larger pool of borrowers when the density of debt collectors increases, presumably because better collections enable them to extend credit to riskier applicants.
D18|Out of sight, out of mind: consumer reaction to news on data breaches and identity theft|We use the 2012 South Carolina Department of Revenue data breach to study how data breaches and news coverage about them affect consumers’ take-up of fraud protections. In this instance, we find that a remarkably large share of consumers who were directly affected by the breach acquired fraud protection services immediately after the breach. In contrast, the response of consumers who were not directly exposed to the breach, but who were exposed to news about it, was negligible. Even among consumers directly exposed to the data breach, the incremental effect of additional news about the breach was small. We conclude that, in this instance, consumers primarily responded to clear and direct evidence of their own exposure to a breach. In the absence of a clear indication of their direct exposure, consumers did not appear to revise their beliefs about future expected losses associated with data breaches.
D18|Helping consumers with a front-of-pack label: numbers or colours? Experimental comparison between Guideline Daily Amount and Traffic Light in a diet building exercice|This paper contributes to the debate on front-of-pack nutritional labels. Because of their dissimilar formats, Guideline Daily Amount (GDA) and Traffic Light (TL) may trigger different responses among consumers. While GDA is comprehensive and cognitively demanding, information is coarser and more salient in TL. We implement an incentivized laboratory experiment to assess the relative performance of GDA and TL labelling schemes in assisting consumers to build a healthy daily diet. Participants must compose a daily diet, choosing from a finite set of products, and are paid a fixed cash amount only if the diet satisfies pre-determined nutritional goals. Goals correspond to the guideline daily amount values for different nutritional attributes, whose number varies from 1 (kcal) to 7 (kcal, fat, sugar, salt, fibre, vitamin C and calcium). Three different labels, GDA, TL and a combined GDATL are provided. Results show that GDA performs better than TL when subjects do not face time constraints. When time is limited however, TL and GDA have identical efficacy with 4 nutritional goals, and TL even outperforms GDA with 7 nutritional goals.
D18|Billions on the Sidewalk: Improving Savings by Reducing Investment Mistakes|This paper contributes the on-going debate on income inequality in advanced economies with a proposal aimed at reducing costly investment mistakes that are prevalent among middle-class households. The paper starts by describing how households should invest, compares it with what we know about how households do invest, and highlights discrepancies between the two (investment mistakes). After evaluating the costs of investment mistakes, the paper suggests that they could be reduced by accommodating cognitive biases through a simple process of ?nancial education and appropriate default options. The policy described in this paper is immediately actionable at basically no cost and can have a large e¤ect on the welfare of middle-class households in advanced economies.

D18|Eye in the Sky: Contextualizing Development with Online Privacy Concern in Western Balkan Countries|The online privacy issue has received a great deal of scholarly attention in the past decade. Studies for Western developed societies have shown that privacy concern and risk awareness are higher in more developed countries; however, the relevance of online privacy concern in the context of economic development remains unexplored. In a digital society, online privacy concern could have significant impact on the real economy; therefore it is not to be underestimated. If indeed development is influenced by the penetration of new technologies, the connection between online privacy concern and development could have a major role in post-transition economies. In this paper we try to determine the level of online privacy concern in a set of post-transition, Western Balkan countries and its repercussions on the future development of these countries. Past research for the Western Balkan region has shown significant structural differences in general privacy concern and here we introduce a new approach which focuses on online privacy concern. We contextualize online privacy with the implementation of reforms which are crucial for the Western Balkan region as well as for other less developed and post-transition economies. The differences in the level of online privacy concern among post-transition Western Balkan countries are discussed in the context of their economic, technological and institutional development, and policy implications are suggested.
D18|Collateral Valuation and Borrower Financial Constraints: Evidence from the Residential Real Estate Market|Financially constrained borrowers have the incentive to influence the appraisal process in order to increase borrowing or reduce the interest rate. We document that the average valuation bias for residential refinance transactions is above 5%. The bias is larger for highly leveraged transactions, around critical leverage thresholds, and for transactions mediated through a broker. Mortgages with inflated valuations default more often. Lenders account for 60%–90% of the bias through pricing. This paper was accepted by Wei Jiang, finance .
D18|Falta de transparencia y arrepentimiento del consumidor|De acuerdo a la literatura, los asesores de ventas de las tiendas departamentales podrían estar llevando a cabo un manejo estratégico de la información para incentivar que los clientes adquieran los productos. La omisión de la información proporcionada a los clientes no se limita a las desventajas del producto, sino que también alcanza los términos del contrato crediticio, derivando en prácticas poco éticas o predatorias. En este artículo se analiza si el arrepentimiento de ‘proceso’ de los consumidores que adquirieron algún producto es mayor cuando éstos no cuentan con la información financiera y si están sujetos a la presión del asesor de ventas. Los resultados de las estimaciones indican que el ocultamiento de la información financiera relacionada con los términos del contrato de crédito departamental y la presión ejercida para el cierre de la venta se asocian con una mayor probabilidad de arrepentimiento de los clientes. / According to literature, stores’ salesmen might be pursuing astrategic information management to encourage customers purchasing. As the omission of information about the weaknesses of the item reaches the terms of the credit contract too, unethical or predatory practices could be performed. In this paper we analyze whether the lesser the financial information and the greater the pressure enforced by salesmen in order to close the deal, the greater the regret associated with the customers´ decision making process. According to estimates, concealing the terms of the store’s credit contract, as well as forcing to close the deal, are associated with a greater likelihood of customers’ regret about the process they followed to make the decision.
D18|Banks and Payday Lenders: Friends or Foes?|This paper investigates the geographic distribution of payday lenders and banks that operate throughout the United States. State-level data are used to indicate differences in the regulatory environment across the states. Given the different constrains on interest rates and other aspects of the payday loan products, we empirically examine the relationship between the number of payday lender stores and various demographic and economic characteristics. Our results indicate that number of stores is positively related to the percentage of African American population, the percentage of population that is aged 15 and under and the poverty rate. The number of stores is also negatively related to income per capita and educational levels. Copyright International Atlantic Economic Society 2015
D18|Are Consumer Decision-Making Phenomena a Fourth Market Failure?|This paper challenges the increasingly common view that the findings of behavioural economics constitute a fourth type of market failure. It shows how many behavioural phenomena, while they do imply departure from the standard competitive market model, undermine the use of this idealized model for policy analysis. A case study of the three-part tariff illustrates two problems: the validity of inferring that consumers’ choices after an intervention are superior to previous choices and the potential for distributional consequences when policy alters choice. These issues make behavioural phenomena fundamentally different from the standard market failures, as the deductive theoretical framework can no longer provide criteria to determine whether a policy improves consumer welfare. Thus, conceiving of behavioural phenomena as another form of market failure is to underestimate their implications for policymaking. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
D18|When Does the General Public Lose Trust in Banks?|When does the general public lose trust in banks? We provide empirical evidence using responses by Dutch survey participants to eight hypothetical scenarios. We find that members of the general public care strongly about executive compensation. Negative media reports, falling stock prices, and opaque product information also affect trust in banks. Experiencing a bank bailout leads to less concern about government intervention, while experience of a bank failure leads to greater concern on bonuses.

D18|Search and Ripoff Externalities|This paper surveys models of markets in which only some consumers are “savvy”. I discuss when the presence of savvy consumers improves the deals available to all consumers (the case of search externalities), and when the non-savvy consumers fund generous deals for all consumers (ripoff externalities). I also discuss when the two groups of consumers have aligned or divergent views about market interventions. The analysis focusses on two kinds of models: (1) an indivisible product in a market with price dispersion; and (2) products that involve add-on pricing.

D18|Customer Satisfaction Evaluation Using Multidimensional Item Response Theory Models|In this paper Multidimensional Item Response Theory models, developed in the fields of psychometrics and ability assessment, are discussed in connection with the problem of evaluating customer satisfaction. These models allow us to take into account latent constructs at various degrees of complexity and provide interesting new perspectives for services quality assessment. Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques are considered for estimation and the problem of missing data is faced. An application to a real dataset is also presented.

Using a simple economic model, we provide four principles for designing and evaluating behaviorally-motivated policy. We then outline rules for determining which contexts reliably reflect true preferences and discuss empirical strategies for measuring internalities. As a case study, we focus on energy efficiency policy, including Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards and appliance and lighting energy efficiency standards.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D18|Risk and Risk Management in the Credit Card Industry|Using account level credit-card data from six major commercial banks from January 2009 to December 2013, we apply machine-learning techniques to combined consumer-tradeline, credit-bureau, and macroeconomic variables to predict delinquency. In addition to providing accurate measures of loss probabilities and credit risk, our models can also be used to analyze and compare risk management practices and the drivers of delinquency across the banks. We find substantial heterogeneity in risk factors, sensitivities, and predictability of delinquency across banks, implying that no single model applies to all six institutions. We measure the efficacy of a bank’s risk-management process by the percentage of delinquent accounts that a bank manages effectively, and find that efficacy also varies widely across institutions. These results suggest the need for a more customized approached to the supervision and regulation of financial institutions, in which capital ratios, loss reserves, and other parameters are specified individually for each institution according to its credit-risk model exposures and forecasts.
D18|Financial Education for Migrants and their Families|Money remitted by international migrants is a major source of income for many countries around the world, exceeding all international development funds combined. Yet individual migrants and their families are often amongst the most vulnerable people in society, and many face significant barriers to the access and use of appropriate financial products. Recognising their importance and vulnerability, some home and host countries are taking measures to support migrant workers and their families and improve their financial literacy; in some cases this occurs within the framework of a national strategy for financial education. In order to increase the extent of such support and to improve international co-operation, this paper seeks to illustrate the key challenges and suggest possible ways forward. The lessons learned will be used by the OECD and its International Network on Financial Education to develop a checklist for policy makers in order to increase the coverage of high-quality financial education for migrants.
D18|Late National Approaches of Consumer Problems|The present paper reviews some of the late national approaches of consumer problems developed in countries such as Japan, China or other socialist economies where the evolution of consumerist society was inhibited for a long period of time, for various reasons, the concerns for consumer protection being left in the shadow.
D18|The Need for Consumer Protection in the Consumerist Society|In order to better understand the importance of the intervention within the market in favor of the consumer, and also the mechanisms by which it can be effectively implemented, the present paper presents the historical and social context of the assertion of the need for consumer protection and its evolution due to the development of a consumerist society.
D18|Il ruolo emergente dell'edutainment nei percorsi di educazione finanziaria|Il raggiungimento di una solida cultura finanziaria tra i cittadini e del loro benessere economico sono ormai priorità fondamentali all’interno delle agende istituzionali. Una delle preoccupazioni principali è quella di rendere i giovani più consapevoli dell’importanza della gestione del denaro e della pianificazione per il loro futuro. Il paper affronta il tema dell’edutainment nell’ottica di migliorare l’efficacia dei programmi di educazione finanziaria rivolti a bambini e ragazzi. Posto che la motivazione e la curiosità dei discenti rappresentano una forza trainante per l’apprendimento, nel lavoro si ipotizza un ruolo per i progetti di financial edutainment, considerata la loro capacità di catturare l’attenzione dei giovani discenti ed instillare conoscenze ed esperienze finanziarie in un modo divertente e piacevole.
D18|Introduction of a Debt Management Procedure for Natural Persons in Hungary|Excessive indebtedness makes support for rehabilitation necessary for millions of households. Hungary – mainly using the experiences of European countries – introduced the institution of personal bankruptcy this year. This paper attempts to compare the European model and the US practice, the former being characterised by a creditor-oriented approach, while the latter focusing on the debtor. On the basis of this, the paper discusses the objectives of the Hungarian personal bankruptcy law in an international context, including the importance of a “new beginning” for the debtor and the main features of the procedure in and out of court. It emphasises that in Hungary as well, the debtor must initiate a debt management procedure – an agreement to be reached through negotiations – first out of court and then in court. The debt remaining at the end of the procedure can be cleared after five years – similarly to European practice. Since the procedure under the new law can be initiated first by debtors who can no longer pay their housing mortgage loans, it is expected to have favourable social and macro-economic effects.
D18|March 2011 earthquake, tsunami and Fukushima nuclear accident impacts on Japanese agri-food sector|The paper presents findings of a large study on socio-economic impacts of the March 2011 earthquake, tsunami and Fukushima nuclear disaster on the Japanese agriculture and food sector. It contains fourteen parts: introduction with the framework of analysis; a brief description of events and their overall social, economic and environmental effects; assessments on affected farms and agricultural resources; progress and challenges of restoration of agricultural communities, lands, infrastructure and businesses; assessments of impacts on food industries; analysis of radioactive contamination of agri-food products; evaluation of the effects on markets, consumers and international trade; analysis of effects on food regulation and inspection system; estimates on farms and agri-businesses damages from the nuclear accident; assessment of overall impact on farms and agricultural resources; assessment of overall impact on agricultural productions; assessment of overall impact on agricultural output and income; assessment of overall impact on farm economy; and conclusion with lessons and recommendations.
D18|Oligopolistic Competition with Choice-Overloaded Consumers|"A large body of experimental work has suggested the existence of a ""choice overload"" effect in consumer decision making: Faced with large menus of choice options, decision makers often defer or avoid choice. A suggested reason for the occurrence of this effect is that the agents attempt to avoid the cognitive effort that is associated with choosing from larger menus. Building on this explanation, we propose and analyse a model of duopolistic competition where firms compete in menu design in the presence of a consumer population with heterogeneous preferences and overload menu-size thresholds. The firms' strategic trade-off is between offering a large menu in order to match the preferences of as many consumers as possible, and offering a small menu in order to avoid losing choice-overloaded consumers to their rival. Assuming uniformly distributed preferences, we focus on symmetric pure-strategy equilibria under various assumptions on the overload distribution and product markups. We also propose and analyse a measure of consumer welfare that applies to this environment. Among other things, we provide conditions for ""maximum-"" and ""minimum-variety equilibria"" to be possible, whereby both firms either offer the entire set of available products or the same one product, respectively."
D18|Financial Education in Asia: Assessment and Recommendations|This paper assesses the case for promoting financial education in Asia. It argues that the benefits of investing in financial education can be substantial. Data are limited, but indicate low financial literacy scores for selected Asian countries. As economies develop, access to financial products and services will increase, but households and small and medium-sized enterprises need to be able to use the products and services wisely and effectively. More effective management of savings and investment can contribute to overall economic growth. Moreover, as societies age and fiscal resources become stretched, households will become increasingly responsible for their own retirement planning. Asia’s evolving experience suggests that more national surveys of financial literacy are needed and that coherent, tailored national strategies for financial education are essential for success.
D18|Requirements for intermediaries and advisors in the area of mortgages resulting from Mortgage Credit Directive – implications for Poland|The dynamic development of the mortgage market, especially in the period before the current financial crisis, revealed that within the EU there are local mortgage credit markets and that it is necessary to harmonize the rules of the system and consumer protection within the Community. The intention of the creators of the Mortgage Credit Directive was to organize the mortgage lending market for residential purposes and make it transparent, as well as increase the safety of the consumer credit market, along the lines of what took place earlier in the consumer credit market regulations (The Consumer Credit Directives no. 2008/48/EC and earlier no. 87/102/EEC). The Mortgage Credit Directive implies for lenders - credit institutions to act at every stage of the lending process with respect to the consumer’s interest and to provide them with adequate services for their needs. Due to the large role of indirect distribution channels of mortgages by banks there are certain requirements for intermediaries, brokers and credit advisors. The implementation term of the Directive, appointed for March 2016, implies action to be taken in order to implement the provisions of this Directive into Polish law. The legislative process is being conducted by the Ministry of Finance and supported by the Group on implementation of the Mortgage Credit Directive operating with the Council of Financial Market Development.
D18|Personal and social impacts of significant financial loss|This paper examines the impact on individuals who suffer significant financial loss. The collapse of Storm Financial is used as a qualitative case study to investigate such impacts, based on elements of grounded theory and narrative analysis. Significant financial loss is devastating, with an individualâ€™s emotional wellbeing a primary casualty, and mental health also vulnerable. Oneâ€™s social world is impacted, including relationships with family and friends, engagement in community activities and familial/cultural roles. Financial victims perceive a sense of judgement from society about their losses, further exacerbating emotive and social impacts. These impacts demonstrate that significant vulnerability exists when encouraging self-sufficiency in retirement.
D18|Verbraucher und die digitale Welt – wo geht die Reise hin?|Researchers at the fourth consumer research panel on digital transformation developed an agenda for the study of modern consumption that raises questions with regard to a number of multidisciplinary issues. First, data-driven business models pose various challenges and numerous opportunities. What is the value of data and how should the privacy concerns of customers be dealt with? Second, data, analytics, cognitive systems and design thinking concepts are customisable, but the direction such customisation takes is an open question. Third, new business models in the field of digital retail payment systems may have implications for consumers, payment system providers and regulators alike. How do they influence consumers’ acceptance of these innovative systems? Finally, Gary S. Becker’s production function of consumption identifies factors which allow research and politics to distinguish between consumption in the modern printing press society and in the next digital media society. What style of consumption will be produced in the next society? Copyright ZBW and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015
D18|Incentives and Information as Driving Forces of Default Effects|The behavioral relevance of non-binding default options is well established. While most research has focused on decision makers' responses to a given default, we argue that this individual decision making perspective is incomplete. Instead, a comprehensive understanding of the foundation of default effects requires taking account of the strategic interaction between default setters and decision makers. We provide a theoretical framework to analyze which default options arise in such interactions, and which defaults are more likely to affect behavior. The key drivers are the relative level of information of default setters and decision makers, and their alignment of interests. We show that default effects are more pronounced if interests of the default setter and decision makers are more closely aligned. Moreover, decision makers are more likely to follow default options the less they are privately informed about the relevant decision environment. In the second part of the paper we experimentally test the main predictions of the model. We report evidence that both the alignment of interests as well as the relative level of information are key determinants of default effects. An important policy relevant conclusion is that potential distortions arising from default options are unlikely if decision makers are either well-informed or reflect on the interests of default setters.
D18|Take it or leave it: Experimental evidence on the effect of time-limited offers on consumer behaviour|Time-limited offers have become one of the most frequently applied pricing practices worldwide. We devise an experiment to explore the influence of time-limited offers on consumersâ€™ behaviour and the mechanisms by which time-limited offers generate this influence. In our experimental tasks, subjects choose among several offers in which one might be time-limited. We vary the time pressure level, the offer value and the occurrence timing of time-limited offers. We control the amount of feedback information that subjects get in various treatments and also subjectsâ€™ degree of risk aversion. The experimental results show a strong tendency for subjects to choose time-limited offers. Feedback information has a significant impact on subjects' decisions. Subjects' decision quality shows no improvement with experience. Time-limited offers cause significant consumer welfare losses.
D18|The effect of payday lending restrictions on liquor sales|We exploit a change in lending laws to estimate the causal effect of restricting access to payday loans on liquor sales. Leveraging lender- and liquor store-level data, we find that the changes reduce sales, with the largest decreases at stores located nearest to payday lenders. By focusing on states with state-run liquor monopolies, we account for endogenous supply-side variables that are typically unobserved. Further analysis of consumer-level data indicates that the lending restrictions reduce alcohol expenditures without affecting total household spending. This is consistent with a distinct relationship between payday lending access and alcohol purchases, and suggests that present biased motivations underlie some loan use. The finding is significant because it shows that payday loan access is associated with unproductive borrowing, and directly links payday loan access to public health issues.
D18|Consumer confusion, obfuscation and price regulation|This paper studies firms’ obfuscation choices in a duopoly setting where two firms differ in their marginal costs of production. We show that the high-cost firm chooses maximum obfuscation while the lowcost firmchooses minimal (maximal) obfuscation if the cost advantage is large (small). We argue that price regulation might be a useful policy in such an environment for two reasons: Introducing a price cap benefits consumers as it i) makes pricing more competitive and ii) reduces firms’ incentives to obfuscate.

D18|Survey on the Viewpoints of Credit Beneficiaries Qua Consumers in Order to increase Banking Accountability|The paper aims to demonstrate that the unprecedented granting of consumer credits to population in recent years, under the circumstances of a spectacular goods supply growth, has adversely affected some consumers, and jeopardized the protection of their life, health and safety. The research method consists in a survey that gave, to a number of 560 credit beneficiaries, qua consumers, the opportunity to freely express their viewpoints. Data collection and processing has resulted in the filling of a 14 queries questionnaire by each of the 560 consumers in the South-Western Oltenia region and, subsequently, in data analysis. The main findings show that consumers have experienced a decline in what concerns their standard of living and that sustainable consumption of goods was barely stimulated. Based on the survey results, the paper proposes a banking accountability indicators system and a consumer credits quality pattern of analysis that would increase banking accountability towards such credits by reducing their negative externalities on people’s lives, stimulating sustainable consumption, giving thorough and accurate information, managing complaints and disputes, educating and raising consumers awareness.
D18|Stochastic Dynamic Model on the Consumption – Saving Decision for Adjusting Products and Services Supply According with Consumers` Attainability|The recent crisis and turbulences have significantly changed the consumers’ behavior, especially through its access possibility and satisfaction, but also the new dynamic flexible adjustment of the supply of goods and services. The access possibility and consumer satisfaction should be analyzed in a broader context of corporate responsibility, including financial institutions. This contribution gives an answer to the current situation in Romania as an emerging country, strongly affected by the global crisis. Empowering producers and harmonize their interests with the interests of consumers really require a significant revision of the quantitative models used to study long-term consumption-saving behavior, with a new model, adapted to the current conditions in Romania in the post-crisis context.
D18|Producer`s Responsibility Concerning the Assurance and Statement of Quality for Foods with “Organic Image” based on the Model of a Romanian Company|The responsibility of organizations to the consumer has now become a permanent concern, the principles of ethics in their activities result in attracting new customers and thus in their remaining within competition.
D18|The System of the Geographical Indication – Important Component of the Politics of the Consumers` Protection in European Union|The paper deals with the use and diffusion of the geographical indication in the European Union countries, having as objective the protection of the products’ names, which are registered as Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) and Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) labels. The reason for treating this theme started from the fact that the level of knowledge of the system and its symbols by the consumers is very low. In the introductory part, specification of surveyed topic is given and importance of consumer education and information is highlighted. Empirical research is based on two approaches. First, 1114 product names from DOOR database (Database for agricultural products and foodstuffs in EU countries) were analysed in order to investigate the frequency of labels utilization by country and product classes, cluster analysis was applied to show the labels distribution by countries. Dominant countries in number of labels are Italy, France and Spain having registered over 50 % of all products. The most frequent product class is Fruits, vegetables and cereals for PGI and Cheeses for PDO. The second approach reflects consumer view on the issue; survey of 250 consumers in the Czech Republic was carried out with the purpose to identify awareness and perceived credibility of labels. Findings reveal a low awareness of labels, credibility of labels is influenced by their low familiarity. The main problem is lack of information. Respondents show interest in getting information regarding this topic. Quality labels have potential to communicate with consumers and facilitate their food purchases, but it is necessary to improve their promotion.
D18|The Responsibility of Organisations towards Customers. Case Study – Romanian Travel Agencies|Organizations` responsibilities towards consumers and consumer rights gained increasing attention during recent decades, alongside with intensifying competition on the market of goods and services, increasing their complexity and diversity, evolving of technology and transport means, growing population, etc. Within this context, increasing consumer protection, promoting sustainable consumption, rapid and efficient resolution of complaints, education and consumer awareness represent imperatives of a modern organization, aware that its existence on market depends on meeting customer requirements in the best way.
D18|Ways to Reduce Consumer Complaints – the EU Perspective|Organizations are currently concerned with meeting consumers’ demands and needs by creating products that meet their expectations. Addressing wider issues of consumers’ protection and relying on a detailed research of the latest data from the European Union, our paper analyses and synthesizes ways to reduce consumers’ complaints on products and services purchased, based on a series of causal links and interrelated activities. It is a dual approach in order to link quantitative and qualitative arguments as well as the analysis of correlations between efforts and the recorded effects in the domain of the consumer’ protection. Based on data provided by the Flash Eurobarometer 332 there were determined the existing influences in consumers’ protection, calculating correlations among a number of indicators registered in the European Union in the field of consumer protection. Based on the relations established between the indicators that describe the domain of the protection of consumer, a model that centres on complaining in case of problems, indicating the main ways to reduce these complaints was developed and built.
D18|Assessing the Impact of the National Cultural Framework on Responsible Corporate Behaviour towards Consumers: an Application of Geert Hofstede`s Cultural Model|This article aims to define and measure responsible corporate behaviour towards consumers in EU countries by defining an index of responsible corporate behaviour towards consumers and to establish the impact of Geert Hofstede`s cultural dimensions on the responsible behaviour of organisations towards consumers. The index uses a specific measurement methodology based on three major components of responsible corporate behaviour towards customers and on content analysis of the Eurostat databases, the RAPEX 2012 Annual Report, the 2012-2013 Global Competitiveness Report and the Global Reporting Initiative database. We used the multifactorial regression and the Wald significance test to demonstrate that organisations operating in countries characterised by low power distance, individualism, femininity, tolerance of unknown and long-term orientation pay more attention to responsible corporate behaviour towards customers. The study highlights theoretical considerations that support the influence of the national cultural framework on responsible corporate behaviour towards consumers. The methodology for calculating the index of responsible corporate behaviour towards consumers can become a basis of analysis of responsible corporate behaviour towards local consumers or other stakeholders.
D18|The Effects of Faulty or Potentially Harmful Products on Brand Reputation and Social Responsibility of Business|Building a strong brand requires a good management of brand reputation over time. Social responsibility of business is a key factor in evoking a positive brand reputation. Both the product itself and brand related actions and communications define brand reputation in the eyes of consumers, thus influencing perceived corporate social responsibility. As a consequence, it can be easily hindered or endangered by many product related issues such as faulty products or potentially harmful products. The purpose of this article is to provide an insight on the link between brand reputation and social responsibility in order to help organizations provide better services and protection for consumers. We examined how brand reputation is influenced by the negative bias generated by brand related communications regarding potentially harmful products. This study also analyzes how under normal consumption circumstances, consumers` experiences related to faulty products can influence brand reputation. To investigate this, we propose a model based on perceptual brand constructs and possible outcomes of brand reputation. In both circumstances, negative spillover effects are highlighted using structural equation modeling. The findings reveal that both faulty products and potentially harmful products have a negative bias on brand reputation, but affected perceptual brand constructs are different.
D18|Consumer Right to Information before Purchase: Research on the Romanian Online Stores for Technical Consumer Goods|The goal of the present paper is to evaluate the status of the protection of consumer right to information before the purchase from Romanian online stores. The perspective focuses on technical consumer goods. The research pursued two major objectives. The former consisted in analysing the compliance of the online stores with the provisions of article 6 paragraph 1 of the Directive 2011/83/EU on consumer rights, relative to the information provided to potential buyers before the purchase. The latter was to identify the consumer awareness of the rights stipulated by article 6 of the directive, as well as to study the opinions of consumers relative to the information that online stores are compelled to supply before purchase. The first objective was accomplished by applying the content analysis method to the information available on the Web for a sample of 100 online stores. The second objective was achieved through the survey method on a sample of 351 persons from the 25 to 34 age group, residing in Bucharest. Compared to other studies, the major contributions of the present research approach are the following: the investigation of an extensive sample of online stores; the wider range of products; the focus on both online stores and consumers. The results show that improvements are needed in the level of compliance and in the consumer awareness of own rights.
D18|Nano Food Packages: from Food Preservation Efficiency to Consumer Legal Protection|The paper explores some aspects related to the application of nanomaterials in food packaging. Therefore, the paper is structured into two sections. In the first section, aspects that could restrict/restrain the application of nanomaterials in food packaging industry in terms of environmental and human risks, the consumer`s rights to be informed regarding the utilization of nano-packages and regulation issues in the field of large scale application of food nano-packages are discussed. In the second section, the efficiency of a nano-package based on Ag/TiO2 to preserve for a longer time (6 days) the physical attributes of wheat bread (moisture, specific volume, porosity) by comparison with shorter ranges allowed by the common polyethylene bag (3 days) and non-packaging respectively (1 day) is demonstrated.

D18|Comparative Analysis of the Consumer Protection, Considering the Globalisation and Technological Changes, within Member States of the European Union|Recent globalization and technological changes have produced significant changes in consumption patterns, shopping online becoming increasingly more important. Under these conditions, in this article we analyze the most important issues relating to the level and quality of consumer protection in the European Union countries for the period 2008-2012 . In this article we aimed to analyze the most important issues related to the level and quality of consumer protection in European Union 27 countries in the period 2008-2012. For this scope, we have chosen the most important five consumer indicators, which are the components of the Consumer Conditions Index, which provide information on both the level and the quality of consumer protection: the protection perceived by consumers (feeling protected as a consumer), illicit commercial practices, the product safety, the consumer complaints, and the redress measures.Initial data were collected from the European Commission for each Member State of the European Union 27, for the last five years, from 2008 to 2012. We have used statistical and econometric methods. For the year 2012, using the selected indicators, we have presented the descriptive statistics in order to observe their caracteristics, we have analysed the correlation matrix and we have determined the structure of four clusters, which reveals common features of countries in each cluster. In order to capture the impact of the variables illegal commercial practices and redress measures on the dependent variable protection perceived by the consumers, we have realized panel regressions with cross-section fixed effects, using data for the period 2008-2012. Also for this period, comparative statistical analyzes were performed (average, minimum, maximum, trend) between Member States.The results reflect the correlations between the analyzed indicators during the period 2008-2012, and a comprehensive scan of how these indicators developed in territorial profile within European Union 27, recently one of the most significant markets in terms of globalization and technological change.
