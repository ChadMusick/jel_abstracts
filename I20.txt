I20|Intelligence and Slave Exports from Africa|This article examines the role of cognitive ability or intelligence on slave exports from Africa. We test a hypothesis that countries which were endowed with higher levels of cognitive ability were more likely to experience lower levels of slave exports from Africa probably due to comparatively better capacities to organise, corporate, oversee and confront slave traders. The investigated hypothesis is valid from alternative specifications involving varying conditioning information sets. The findings are also robust to the control of outliers.

I20|Human Capital and Economic Growth|The aim of this entry is (I) to undertake a critical reading of the seminal contribution of Lucas’ work to construct a model which represents the complexity of the links between human capital and economic growth (II) to review the empirical assessments of its endogenous nature.
I20|Technology, Education, Life and Non-life Insurance in Africa|This article examines the relevance of information and communication technology (ICT) in modulating the effect of education on life insurance and non-life insurance consumption in 48 African countries for the period 2004-2014. Education is measured with primary school, secondary school and tertiary school enrollments. ICT is measured with mobile phone, internet and broadband subscriptions. The empirical evidence is based on generalized method of moments. The following main findings are established. First, from the nexuses between education, ICT and life insurance, there are positive conditional effects from the interaction between: (i) broadband subscriptions and primary school enrollment; (ii) broadband subscriptions and secondary school enrollment and (iii) internet penetration and tertiary school enrollment. Second, from the nexuses between education, ICT and non-life insurance: (i) there is a negative net effect from the interactions between mobile phone penetration and primary education while positive net effects are apparent from the interactions between: mobile phone penetration and secondary school enrollment; secondary school enrollment and broadband subscriptions and; tertiary school enrollment and broadband subscriptions.
I20|The role of ICT in modulating the effect of education and lifelong learning on income inequality and economic growth in Africa|This study assesses the role of ICT in modulating the impact of education and lifelong learning on income inequality and economic growth. It focuses on a sample of 48 African countries from 2004 to 2014. The empirical evidence is based on the generalised method of moments (GMM). The following findings are established. First, mobile phone and internet each interact with primary school education to decrease income inequality. Second, all ICT indicators interact with secondary school education to exert a negative impact on the Gini index. Third, fixed broadband distinctly interacts with primary school education and lifelong learning to have a positive effect on economic growth. Fourth, ICT indicators do not significantly influence inequality and economic growth through tertiary school education and lifelong learning. These main findings are further substantiated. Policy implications are discussed.
I20|On the road to integration? Immigrant’s demand for informal (& formal) education|In this paper we study the allocation of time devoted to informal learning and education, i.e. those activities carried out during leisure time and outside formal education courses which boost individuals’ human and social capital. For immigrants the private investment in these activities is likely to have relevant external effects as informal learning and education enhances the likelihood of greater socio-economic integration in the host society. We first develop a simple theoretical framework, which allows us to highlight the different constrains/opportunity costs faced by immigrants as compared with natives. Then, we empirically investigate the determinants of participation in informal education using the American Time Use Data (ATUS; period 2003-2015) which contains detailed information on daily time budgets of a large sample of immigrants and natives in the US. Consistently with a theoretical model of time allocation we find evidence that immigrants are more likely to engage in informal education and, conditionally on participation, they allocate more time to these activities. Over time, immigrants show a higher degree of assimilation into the host society. Our results also highlight heterogeneous patterns across gender.
I20|Education and gender differences in mortality rates|We examine the gender asymmetries in the health benefits of acquiring further education at a time of increasing gender equality and women’s greater access to economic opportunities. A labor market reform in Spain in 1980 raised the minimum legal working age from 14 to 16, while the school-leaving age remained at 14. We apply a difference-in-difference strategy to identify the reform’s within-cohort effects, where treated and control individuals differ only in their month of birth. Although the reform improved the educational attainment of both women and men, the long-term effects over mortality differ by gender. We find that the reform decreased mortality at young ages (14-29) by 6.3% among men and by 8.9% among women. This was driven by a decrease (12.2% for men, 14.7% for women) in the probability of dying from external causes of death (accidents). However, we also find that the child labor reform increased mortality for prime-age women (30-45) by 6.3%. This effect is driven by increases in HIV mortality (11.6%), as well as by diseases of the nervous and circulatory system (8.7%). This pattern helps explain the narrowing age gap in life expectancy between women and men in Spain.
I20|Improving Schools through School Choice: An Experimental Study of Deferred Acceptance|In the context of school choice, we experimentally study the student-optimal stable mechanism where subjects take the role of students and schools are passive. Specifically, we study if a school can be better off when it unambiguously improves in the students’ true preferences and its (theoretic) student-optimal stable match remains the same or gets worse. Using first-order stochastic dominance to evaluate the schools’ distributions over their actual matches, we find that schools’ welfare almost always changes in the same direction as the change of the student-optimal stable matching, i.e., incentives to improve school quality are nearly idle.
I20|Self-selection of peers and performance|In many natural environments, carefully chosen peers influence individual behavior. Using a framed field experiment at secondary schools, we examine how self-selected peers affect performance in contrast to randomly assigned ones. We find that self-selection improves performance by approximately 15% of a standard deviation relative to randomly assigned peers. Our results document peer effects in multiple characteristics and show that self-selection changes these characteristics. However, a decomposition reveals that variations in the peer composition contribute only little to the estimated average treatment effects. Rather, we find that self-selection has a direct effect on performance.

I20|Widening the high school curriculum to include soft skill training: impacts on health, behaviour, emotional wellbeing and occupational aspirations|"From 2020 Personal, Social, Health and Economic Education will be compulsory in UK schools for adolescents, however less is known about how it can be taught in a an effective manner. We examine, through a randomised trial, the impact of an evidenced based health related quality of life (HRQoL) curriculum called Healthy Minds that ran in 34 high schools in England over a four-year period. We find robust evidence that Healthy Minds positively augments many physical health domains of treated adolescents. We also find some evidence that Healthy Minds positively affects behaviour, but has no impact on emotional wellbeing. We find notable gender effects, strongly favouring boys. We also present evidence that Healthy Minds changes career aspirations, with those exposed to treatment being less likely to choose competitive work and more likely to choose work that involves ""people-skills"". Overall our work illustrates the potential for later childhood interventions to promote HRQoL and develop the career aspirations of adolescents."
I20|Setting a good example? Examining sibling spillovers in education achievement using a regression discontinuity design|We identify externalities in human capital production function arising from sibling spillovers. Using regression discontinuity design generated by school-entry cutoffs and school records from one district in Florida, we find positive spillover effects from an older to a younger child in less affluent families and negative spillover effects from a younger to an older child in more affluent families. These results are consistent with direct spillovers dominating in economically disadvantaged families and with parental reinforcement in more affluent families.
I20|Promoting Child Development in a Universal Preschool System: A Field Experiment|This study tests an intervention that introduces a structured curriculum for five-year olds into the universal preschool context of Norway. We conduct a field experiment with 691 five-year-olds in 71 preschools and measure treatment impacts on children’s development in mathematics, language and executive functioning. Compared to business as usual, the nine-month curriculum intervention has effects on child development at post-intervention and the effects persist one year following the end of the treatment. The effects are entirely driven by the preschool centers identified as low-quality at baseline, suggesting that a structured curriculum can reduce inequality in early childhood learning environments.
I20|Do digital skill certificates help new workers enter the market?: Evidence from an online labour platform|This paper studies the effects of a voluntary skill certification scheme in an online freelancing labour market. The paper show that obtaining skill certificates increases a worker’s earnings. This effect is not driven by increased worker productivity but by decreased employer uncertainty. The increase in worker earnings is mostly realised through an increase in the value of the projects obtained (up to 10%) rather than an increase in the number of projects obtained (up to 0.03 projects). In addition, the paper finds evidence for negative selection to completing skill certificates, which suggests that the workers who complete more skill certificates are, on average, in a more disadvantaged position in the labour market. Finally, skill certificates are found to be an imperfect substitute to other types of standardised information. On the whole, the results suggest that certificates play a role in helping new workers break into the labour market, but are more valuable to workers with at least some work experience. More stringent skill certification tests could improve the benefits to new workers.
I20|Education and Polygamy: Evidence from Cameroon|We take advantage of a wave of school constructions in Cameroon after World War II and use variations in school supply at the village level to estimate labor and marriage market returns to education in the 1976 population census. Education increases the likelihood to be in a polygamous union for men and for women, as well as the overall socioeconomic status of the spouse. We argue that education increases polygamy for women because it allows them to marry more educated and richer men, who are more likely to be polygamists. To show this, we estimate a structural model of marriage with polygamy. The positive affinity between a man’s polygamy and a woman’s education is mostly explained by the affinity of education.
I20|Impacto de los programas de ampliación de la jornada escolar sobre el desempeño en matemáticas y lenguaje: un metanálisis para 8 países|Este documento sintetiza los resultados de las investigaciones disponibles que estudian el efecto de la ampliación de la jornada escolar sobre el logro académico, medido en pruebas estandarizadas en matemáticas y lenguaje. Para esto, se emplea un metanálisis con efectos aleatorios de 14 referencias que cumplieron los criterios de selección y fueron publicados entre 2007 y 2017. Estas publicaciones incluyen resultados para 8 países. Los documentos del metanálisis surgen de una búsqueda en 6 bases de datos electrónicas y 2916 referencias iniciales. El efecto promedio global estimado para logro académico de matemáticas en primaria es de 0,04 desviaciones estándar (SD) y secundaria 0,10SD. A su vez, el efecto promedio global para lenguaje de 0,04SD y 0,08SD para primaria y secundaria, respectivamente. Los tamaños de efecto promedio son mayores en secundaria que en primaria. Para todos los resultados y niveles de escolaridad existe una considerable heterogeneidad en los tamaños del efecto.
I20|Los 10 pasos para hacer de Colombia la mejor educada de América Latina|Si Colombia quiere convertirse en la mejor educada de América Latina, es urgente cambiar el enfoque de su política educativa. Colombia ya ha cursado la primera fase de desarrollo de un sistema educativo, en el que se dirigen los recursos a mejorar la cobertura, meta que se ha logrado con las notables excepciones de las zonas rurales y la educación Media. La tesis rectora de la presente investigación es que Colombia debe reenfocar su política educativa desde metas de aumento de cobertura, hacia una mejora de la calidad y los resultados de su proceso de aprendizaje, el cual sucede a partir de la interacción entre el profesor y el estudiante dentro del aula de clase. Las preguntas estratégicas que se debe hacer el país –y que intentamos responder en la presente investigación– son: ¿qué tan importante es el aprendizaje como foco del sistema de educación básica?, ¿cómo se desarrolla el aprendizaje como eje sobre el cual articular el sistema durante los próximos años?, y ¿cómo se consigue implementar una reforma integral que cree capacidades dentro del sistema (pedagógicas y administrativas) para buscar el mejoramiento continuo del aprendizaje? Como estrategia de política educativa es imperativo, y así se reitera a lo largo del documento, construir sobre lo ya construido. Colombia ha dado los primeros pasos en la dirección correcta, ahora es el momento de diseñar una estrategia unificada que permita mantener este camino y convertir al país en una economía basada en el conocimiento. Por esto, en el presente libro hicimos un esfuerzo por unificar dentro de nuestra propuesta de Reforma tanto las estrategias más efectivas en la experiencia internacional, como la profundización y expansión de las experiencias propias que se han impulsado recientemente en el país y han mostrado resultados positivos, y que es necesario no abandonar sino fortalecer y expandir. Con este libro queremos poner sobre la mesa un plan de acción en términos de política pública, con el fin de transformar el sistema colombiano de educación Preescolar, Básica y Media, e impulsarlo hacia un nivel superior de calidad en el aprendizaje.
I20|Measuring the Effect of Competitive Teacher Recruitment on Student Achievement: Evidence from Ecuador|In the last decade, several Latin American governments have implemented new teacher recruitment policies based on evaluations of candidates’ competency and knowledge so as to raise the quality of their teachers and schools. Since 2007, the Ecuadorian government has required teacher candidates to pass national standardized tests before they can participate in merit-based selection competitions for tenure at public schools. Has this new recruitment system served as an effective screening device? Has it ultimately helped to raise student learning? To answer these questions, I analyze data from a unique Ecuadorian survey of schools in the academic year 2011-2012. I first estimate the value-added to student achievement using OLS and hierarchical linear regressions to evaluate the effect of Ecuador’s new competitive recruitment policy. I then use propensity score matching to simulate a random assignment of students to teachers and estimate causal treatment effects. The evidence suggests that teachers who were granted tenure through the new competitive recruitment policy were no more effective, overall, in raising students’ learning in reading or math than their peers at schools. Nonetheless, poorer children who were assigned to these teachers had significantly better scores in reading. Furthermore, test-screened teachers, regardless of their tenure status, seem to have had positive significant effects in reading, particularly for students living in poverty. This finding suggests that Ecuador’s teacher recruitment policy had a positive impact on the nation’s most vulnerable students.
I20|Born in the Family: Preferences for Boys and the Gender Gap in Math|We study the correlation between parental gender attitudes and the performance in mathematics of girls using two different approaches and data. First, we identify families with a preference for boys by using fertility stopping rules in a population of households whose children attend public schools in Florida. Girls growing up in a boy-biased family score 3 percentage points lower on math tests when compared to girls raised in other families. Second, we find similar strong effects when we study the correlations between girls' performance in mathematics and maternal gender role attitudes, using evidence from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. We conclude that socialization at home can explain a non-trivial part of the observed gender disparities in mathematics performance and document that maternal gender attitudes correlate with those of their children, supporting the hypothesis that preferences transmitted through the family impact children behavior.
I20|Education and Conflict: Evidence from a Policy Experiment in Indonesia|This paper studies the impact of school construction on the likelihood of conflict, drawing on a policy experiment in Indonesia, and collecting our own novel dataset on political violence for 289 districts in Indonesia over the period 1955-1994. We find that education has a strong, robust and quantitatively sizeable conflict-reducing impact. It is shown that the channels of transmission are both related to economic factors as well as to an increase in inter-religious trust and tolerance. Interestingly, while societal mechanisms are found to have an immediate impact, economic channels only gain importance after some years. We also show that school construction results in a shift away from violent means of expression (armed conflict) towards non-violent ones (peaceful protests).
I20|Brave Boys and Play-it-Safe Girls: Gender Differences in Willingness to Guess in a Large Scale Natural Field Experiment|We study gender differences in willingness to guess using approximately 10,000 multiple-choice math tests, where for half of the questions, both wrong answers and omitted questions are scored 0, and for the other half, wrong answers are scored 0 but omitted questions are scored +1. Using a within-participant regression analysis, we find that female participants leave significantly more omitted questions than males when there is a reward for omitted questions. This gender difference, which is stronger among high ability and older participants, hurts female performance as measured by the final score and position in the ranking. In a subsequent survey, female participants showed lower levels of confidence and higher risk aversion, which may explain this differential behavior. When both are considered, risk aversion is the main factor explaining the gender differential in the willingness to guess. A scoring rule that is gender neutral must use non-differential scoring between wrong answers and omitted questions.
I20|Understanding Gender Differences in STEM: Evidence from College Applications|While education levels of women have increased dramatically relative to men, women are still greatly underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) college programmes. We use unique data on preference rankings for all secondary school students who apply for college in Ireland and detailed information on school subjects and grades to decompose the sources of the gender gap in STEM. We find that, of the 22 percentage points raw gap, about 13 percentage points is explained by differential subject choices and grades in secondary school. Subject choices are more important than grades -- we estimate male comparative advantage in STEM (as measured by subject grades) explains about 3 percentage points of the gender gap. Additionally, differences in overall achievement between girls and boys have a negligible effect. Strikingly, there remains a gender gap of 9 percentage points even for persons who have identical preparation at the end of secondary schooling (in terms of both subjects studied and grades achieved); however, this gap is only 4 percentage points for STEM-ready students. We find that gender gaps are smaller among high-achieving students and for students who go to school in more affluent areas. There is no gender gap in science (the large gaps are in engineering and technology), and we also find a smaller gender gap when we include nursing degrees in STEM, showing that the definition of STEM used is an important determinant of the conclusions reached.
I20|Distance Learning in Higher Education: Evidence from a Randomized Experiment|Using a randomized experiment in a public Swiss university, we study the impact of online live streaming of lectures on student achievement and attendance. We find that (i) students use the live streaming technology only punctually, apparently when random events make attending in class too costly; (ii) attending lectures via live streaming lowers achievement for low-ability students and increases achievement for high-ability ones and (iii) offering live streaming reduces in-class attendance only mildly. These findings have important implications for the design of education policies.
I20|Estimated Costs of Injuries in College and High School Female Sports|Injury rates in thirteen U.S. women’s college sports and four U.S. girls’ high school sports are examined in this paper. The sports are categorized as high injury (H) or low injury (L) and differences in injury rates between the two are examined. Estimates are presented of the injury savings that would result if the H sports were changed to have injury rates similar to those in the L sports. The estimated college savings are 13,610 fewer injuries per year and 2,020 fewer healthy years lost-to-injury per year. The estimated high school savings are 143,900 fewer injuries per year and 24,300 fewer healthy years lost-to-injury per year. For concussions the savings are 2,750 per year for college and 49,390 per year for high school. The estimated dollar value (in 2015 dollars) of the total injury savings is between $122 million and $505 million per year for college and between $1.3 billion and $4.9 billion per year for high school.
I20|Union Reform, Performance Pay, and New Teacher Supply: Evidence from Wisconsin's Act 10|This study examines the impact of performance pay on teacher selection. I exploit a shift toward performance pay in Wisconsin induced by the enactment of Act 10, which gave school districts autonomy to redesign their compensation schemes. Following the law, half of Wisconsin school districts eliminated salary schedules and started negotiating pay with individual teachers based on performance. Comparing the quantity of teaching degrees in Wisconsin institutions before and after Act 10, and relative to those in similar states, I find that Act 10 led to a 20\% increase in teaching degrees. This effect was entirely driven by selective universities.
I20|Venciendo la adversidad: trayectorias educativas de estudiantes pobres en zonas rurales del Perú|El sistema educativo peruano se caracteriza por sus altos niveles de acceso, bajos niveles de aprendizaje y alta inequidad. Son varias las razones por las cuales unos estudiantes acceden a un alto nivel educativo y de aprendizaje, mientras que otros no. En general, se puede afirmar que existe una conexión entre las características socioeconómicas y el rendimiento de los estudiantes, y que las escuelas pueden intervenir para obtener mejores resultados de los que cabría esperar. Utilizando datos longitudinales de Niños del Milenio, este estudio busca entender por qué algunos estudiantes que nacen en un contexto de pobreza en zonas rurales logran obtener mejores resultados educativos que sus pares a los 15 años. Se encuentra que los estudiantes que migran de zonas rurales a zonas urbanas son los que mejoran más sus puntajes. Pese a que las posibles explicaciones son diversas, sugerimos que las que tienen un efecto más claro están relacionadas con mejorar las oportunidades educativas de los estudian­tes de las escuelas rurales.
I20|El desgobierno del mercado educativo y la intensificación de la segregación escolar socioeconómica en el Perú|El Perú es el país de Latinoamérica con la mayor brecha en los logros educativos de estudiantes provenientes de familias ricas y pobres. A la vez es un ejemplo radical de la tendencia global hacia el desarrollo de mercados educativos. En el marco de la liberalización de la inversión educativa privada, la libre elección de escuelas se ha enraizado en el sistema educativo. No obstante, las familias no cuentan al momento de elegir con el apoyo de fondos públicos, con información transparente, con una regulación apropiada ni con políticas que amortigüen los efectos de la elección escolar en las dinámicas de segregación educativa. Este documento analiza las tendencias de segregación escolar por nivel socioeconómico en el país. Consideramos que lo que principalmente explica sus patrones existentes es el uso extendido de la elección escolar, tanto en el sistema educativo privado como en el público.
I20|El conocimiento del contenido por parte de los docentes y su relación con el rendimiento de los estudiantes de sexto de primaria: una mirada a las tres regiones naturales del Perú|La literatura ha mostrado la importancia tanto de la figura del docente como de las variables asociadas al contexto educativo, dado que afectan directamente los aprendizajes y pueden ser influenciadas por políticas de corto plazo. Este estudio determina el conocimiento del contenido —nivel de conocimiento respecto al área disciplinar que se enseña— de los docentes de Matemática de la costa, sierra y selva, y analiza los factores que lo explican. Se encuentra, por una parte, que el nivel socioeconómico, la lengua materna y el sexo del docente se asocian con un alto conocimiento del contenido; y por otra, que la gestión y la infraestructura escolar afectan el nivel de conocimiento del contenido del docente. Hay que destacar que los efectos de ambos hallazgos no son iguales en las tres regiones naturales —costa, sierra y selva—. Por último, se puede afirmar que el conocimiento del contenido alto por parte del docente afecta positiva y significativamente el rendimiento de los estudiantes, tanto en el ámbito nacional como en las regiones.
I20|Does Evaluating Teachers Make a Difference?|In France, secondary school teachers are evaluated every six or seven years by senior experts of the Ministry of education. These external evaluations mostly involve the supervision of one class session and a debriefing interview, but have nonetheless a direct impact on teachers' career advancement. In this paper, we show that these evaluations contribute to improving students' performance, especially in math. This effect is seen not only for students taught by teachers the year of their evaluations but also for students taught by the same teachers the subsequent years, suggesting that evaluations improve teachers' core pedagogical skills. These positive effects persist over time and are particularly salient in education priority schools, in contexts where teaching is often very challenging. Overall, a system of light touch evaluations appears to be much more cost-effective than more popular alternatives, such as class size reduction.
I20|Fading Legacies: Human Capital in the Aftermath of the Partitions of Poland|This paper studies the longevity of historical legacies in the context of the formation of human capital. The Partitions of Poland (1772-1918) represent a natural experiment that instilled Poland with three different legacies of education, resulting in sharp differences in human capital among the Polish population. I construct a large, unique dataset that reflects the state of schooling and human capital in the partition territories from 1911 to 1961. Using a spatial regression discontinuity design, I find that primary school enrollment differs by as much as 80 percentage points between the partitions before WWI. However, this legacy disappears within the following two decades of Polish independence, as all former partitions achieve universal enrollment. Differences in educational infrastructure and gender access to schooling simultaneously disappear after WWI. The level of literacy converges likewise across the former partitions, driven by a high intergenerational mobility in education. After WWII, the former partitions are not distinguishable from each other in terms of education anymore.
I20|A multi-sensory tutoring program for students at-risk of reading difficultiesa. Evidence from a randomized field experiment|Although reading is a fundamental skill, many students leave school without being proficient readers. We examine a literacy program targeting students most at-risk of reading difficulties in kindergarten and first grade. The program includes multi-sensory learning methods, which focus on phonological awareness and phonics and are delivered in a one-to-one or one-to-two tutoring setting. Using a randomized field experiment with 161 students in 12 Swedish schools, we find large positive effects on our two primary outcomes measures: a standardized test of decoding and a standardized test of letter knowledge. We also find positive effects on measures of phonological awareness and self-efficacy and small and statistically insignificant effects on measures of enjoyment and motivation. The program compares favorably to similar programs in terms of cost-effectiveness.
I20|Decentralization of wage determination. Evidence from a national teacher reform|Despite a global trend of wage decentralization over the past 30 years, we know very little about the labor market implications of decentralized wage determination. A main reason is the lack of exogenous variation in wage regulation linked to detailed outcome data. Using Swedish registry data and exploiting a reform that replaced the fixed national pay scale for teachers with individual wage bargaining, I overcome these issues and provide new evidence on the labor market effects of wage decentralization. The paper presents three sets of empirical results. First, I show that the reform significantly changed the wage structure of teachers. Second, I demonstrate that these wage changes did not affect teacher composition or student outcomes. Finally, I find support for a wage spillover effect to substitute occupations, providing evidence on the dynamics of wage determination across occupations. I argue that the wage spillover effect coupled with the compressed Swedish wage structure likely explains the lack of effects on teacher and student outcomes.
I20|Gender Grading Bias in Junior High School Mathematics|Admission to high school in Sweden is based on the final grades from junior high. This paper compares students’ final mathematics grade with new data from a high school introductory test score in mathematics. Both the grades and the test are based on the same syllabus, but teachers enjoy great discretion when deciding final grades, as the grades are not externally evaluated. The results show a substantial grading difference, consistent with grading bias against boys.​
I20|The Impact of Grade Inflation on Higher Education Enrolment and Earnings|"Although grade inflation is unfair and may imply inefficient allocation of human resources, current knowledge of grade inflation effects on individual outcomes is scarce. One explanation is probably the challenge of measuring and estimating causal grade inflation effects. This study examines the consequences of grade inflation at the upper secondary education level on enrolment in higher education and earnings for Sweden. Rigorous diagnostic testing supports our empirical approach. Grade inflation at the school level affects earnings mainly through choice of university and the chosen field of education, rather than through enrolment per se, because attending universities of higher quality and pursuing high-paying fields of education have a substantial impact on earnings. On the other hand, high-skilled students attending upper secondary schools without grade inflation and, unexpectedly, low-skilled women attending ""lenient"" schools are harmed by this. This causes extensive unfairness and, plausibly, detrimental welfare effects."
I20|The Four Motives Of Educational Innovators|Education systems across the world are experiencing significant transformations. Grassroots innovators play an important role in these changes. To stimulate the development of grassroots innovations it is important to understand the mechanisms that underlie their creation. This paper investigates the motivation of individuals who initialize innovative projects in education. The approach to measuring motivation was adopted from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED) initially developed for social and commercial entrepreneurs. The Russian version of the methodology was elaborated and validated to study educational innovators. The sample consists of 437 participants of the Competition for Innovation in Education (KIVO). Four types of motivation are identified: social, self-realization, status, financial. They are explained within the self-determination theory (SDT) and grassroots innovations. The social and self-realization motives are inherent in all the actors, while the other two vary among innovators. This motivational structure allows the authors to differentiate between specific types of innovators – social entrepreneurs and ‘non-entrepreneurs’. The discussion, following the conclusion in this article, focuses on which environment would be favorable for developing innovations, considering the personal motives for innovative activity. The results can be valuable for education policy.
I20|Inequality of opportunity in education: Accounting for the contributions of Sibs, schools and sorting across East Africa|Inequalities in the opportunity to obtain a good education in low-income countries are widely understood to be related to household resources and schooling quality. Yet, to date, most researchers have investigated the contributions of these two factors separately. This paper considers them jointly, paying special attention to their covariation, which indicates whether schools exacerbate or compensate for existing household-based inequalities. The paper develops a new variance decomposition framework and applies it to data on more than one million children in three low-income East African countries. The empirical results show that although household factors account for a significant share of total test score variation, variation in school quality and positive sorting between households and schools are, together, no less important. The analysis also finds evidence of substantial geographical heterogeneity in schooling quality. The paper concludes that promoting equity in education in East Africa requires policies that go beyond raising average school quality and should attend to the distribution of school quality as well as assortative matching between households and schools.
I20|Does Stimulating Physical Activity Affect School Performance?|This paper investigates whether encouraging children to become more physically active in their everyday life affects their primary school performance. We use data from a field quasi- experiment called the Active Living Program, which aimed to increase active modes of transportation to school and active play among 8- to 12-year-olds living in low socioeconomic status (SES) areas in the Netherlands. Difference-in-differences estimations reveal that while the interventions increase time spent on physical activity during school hours, they negatively affect school performance, especially among the worst-performing students. Further analyses reveal that increased restlessness during instruction time is a potential mechanism for this negative effect. Our results suggest that the commonly found positive effects of exercising or participating in sports on educational outcomes may not be generalizable to physical activity in everyday life. Policymakers and educators who seek to increase physical activity in everyday life need to weigh the health and well-being benefits against the probability of increasing inequality in school performance.
I20|Parental Beliefs, Investments, and Child Development: Evidence from a Large-Scale Experiment|This paper experimentally estimates medium term impacts of a large-scale and low-cost parenting program targeting poor families in Chile. Households in 162 public health centers were randomly assigned to three groups: a control group, a second group that was offered eight weekly group parenting sessions, and a third group that was offered the same eight group sessions plus two sessions of guided interactions between parents and children focused on responsive play and dialogic reading. In spite of its short duration and intensity, three years after the end of the intervention, the receptive vocabulary and the socio-emotional development of children of families participating in either of the treatment arms improved (by 0.43 and 0.54 standard deviation, respectively) relative to children of nonparticipating families. The treatments also led to improvements in home environments and parenting behaviors of comparable magnitudes, which far outlasted the short duration of the intervention.
I20|Selection and educational attainment: Why some children are left behind? Evidence from a middleincome country|We model schooling as a sequential process and examine why some children are left behind. We focus on the factors that explain selection at early stages of the education system. Our findings for Uruguay suggest that long-term factors, such as parental background or ethnicity matter across all education stages while the effect of short-term factors, such as family income, wear out as individuals progress in the education system, suggesting a severe selection process at early stages.
I20|"Regional development of education as a ""coordination game"""|"In this paper, we try to assess the ability of educationally backward countries, such as Portugal, to catch-up with more developed nations withinthe EU. For that purpose,we use a framework composed by a symmetric coordination n person game that is played by a set of candidates to attend a post-compulsory educational degree, such as university. Higher education has a positive payoff only if a ""critical mass"" (indeed the unanimity)of students with a low socioeconomic background decide to attend the university. Two strict Nash equilibria exist in this game: either all players decide to attend the university or none does it in equilibrium. By using the ""risk dominance""approach to the selection of a unique Nash equilibrium that was suggested by HARSANYI and SELTEN (1988), we are able to recognize the factors that make either strict Nash equilibrium the likelysolution. In spite of the progress they have achieved in schooling, structurally lagging countries such as Portugal seem to be hindered in education development by the fact that, in a large majority of households, income is low and parents lack post-compulsory education. While low household income makes the relative cost of university education high even if tuition fees are modest, a small share of highly educated parents makes the achievement of a ""critical mass"" of students who attend the university more difficult and thus renders the benefits of college education riskier and less safe."
I20|The value of specific skills in a globalized world - Evidence from international trade shocks|This paper examines whether workers’ earnings after trade shocks depend on workers’ skill specificity. We construct a measure for occupational specificity using task information from an official dataset for career guidance and merge this information to a large register dataset from Germany. We find that rising import competition resulted in larger earnings losses for workers with specific skills than for those with general skills, but workers with specific skills profited more from increasing exports. On average, we even find larger positive net effects for workers with specific skills, but they experience lager earnings inequality in response to increasing international trade.
I20|Ageing and Skills: The Case of Literacy Skills|The relationship between ageing and skills is of growing policy significance due to population ageing, the changing nature of work and the importance of literacy for social and economic well-being. This article examines the relationship between age and literacy skills in a sample of OECD countries using three internationally comparable surveys. By pooling the survey data across time we can separate birth cohort and ageing effects. In doing so we find literacy skills decline with age and that, in most of our sample countries, successive birth cohorts tend to have poorer literacy outcomes. Therefore, once we control for cohort effects the rate at which literacy proficiency falls with age is much more pronounced than that which is apparent based on the cross-sectional relationship between age and literacy skills at a point in time. Further, in studying the literacy-age relationship across the skill distribution in Canada we find a more pronounced decline in literacy skills with age at lower percentiles, which suggests that higher initial literacy moderates the influence of cognitive ageing.
I20|Selection and Educational Attainment: Why Some Children Are Left Behind? Evidence from a Middle-Income Country|We model schooling as a sequential process and examine why some children are left behind. We focus on the factors that explain selection at early stages of the education system. Our findings for Uruguay suggest that long-term factors, such as parental background or ethnicity matter across all education stages while the effect of short-term factors, such as family income, wear out as individuals progress in the education system, suggesting a severe selection process at early stages.
I20|Born in the Family: Preferences for Boys and the Gender Gap in Math|We study the correlation between parental gender attitudes and the performance in mathematics of girls using two different approaches and data. First, we identify families with a preference for boys by using fertility stopping rules in a population of households whose children attend public schools in Florida. Girls growing up in a boy-biased family score 3 percentage points lower on math tests when compared to girls raised in other families. Second, we find similar strong effects when we study the correlations between girls' performance in mathematics and maternal gender role attitudes, using evidence from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. We conclude that socialization at home can explain a non-trivial part of the observed gender disparities in mathematics performance and document that maternal gender attitudes correlate with those of their children, supporting the hypothesis that preferences transmitted through the family impact children behavior.
I20|The Intergenerational Transmission of Teaching|Parental influences, particularly parents' occupations, may influence individuals' entry into the teaching profession. Importantly, this mechanism may explain the relatively static demographic composition of the teaching force over time. We assess the role of parental influences on occupational choice by testing whether the children of teachers are disproportionately likely to become teachers themselves and whether the intergenerational transmission of teaching varies by race or sex. Overall, children whose mothers are teachers are 9 percentage points (or more than two times) more likely to enter teaching than the children of non-teacher mothers. This rate of occupational transmission is significantly larger than for several comparable professions. The transmission of teaching from mother to child is about the same for white children of both sexes and for black daughters; however, transmission rates for Hispanic daughters are even larger while those for black sons are about zero. Limited data on father's occupation suggests that sons whose fathers are teachers are more likely to enter the profession than the sons of non-teachers, though there is no such effect for daughters.
I20|The Effect of Parental Job Loss on Child School Dropout: Evidence from the Occupied Palestinian Territories|This paper explores how negative economic shocks affect household schooling decisions in the context of a developing country. In particular, we study the effect of parental job loss on child school dropout using data from the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). Our analysis focuses on Palestinian workers employed in Israel during the Second Intifada (2000-2006), whose job separation is arguably involuntary as determined by the intensity of the conflict. We employ an instrumental variable strategy and use individual's exposure to conflict as a plausibly exogenous source of variation in the employment status. Our results show that parental job loss increases child school dropout probability by 9 percentage points. The effect varies with the gender and the academic ability of the child, with the level of parental education, and the number of children in the household. We find evidence suggesting that the effect operates through the job loss-induced reduction in household income. We exclude alternative mechanisms such as family disruption or household relocation.
I20|Distance Learning in Higher Education: Evidence from a Randomized Experiment|Using a randomized experiment in a public Swiss university, we study the impact of online live streaming of lectures on student achievement and attendance. We find that (i) students use the live streaming technology only punctually, apparently when random events make attending in class too costly; (ii) attending lectures via live streaming lowers achievement for low-ability students and increases achievement for high-ability ones and (iii) offering live streaming reduces in-class attendance only mildly. These findings have important implications for the design of education policies.
I20|Does evaluating teachers make a difference?|In France, secondary school teachers are evaluated every six or seven years by senior experts of the Ministry of education. These external evaluations mostly involve the supervision of one class session and a debrie_ng interview, but have nonetheless a direct impact on teachers' career advancement. In this paper, we show that these evaluations contribute to improving students' performance, especially in math. This e_ect is seen not only for students taught by teachers the year of their evaluations but also for students taught by the same teachers the subsequent years, suggesting that evaluations improve teachers' core pedagogical skills. These positive e_ects persist over time and are particularly salient in education priority schools, in contexts where teaching is often very challenging.
I20|Expertise and Independence on Governing Boards: Evidence from School Districts|In this paper, we study the roles of expertise and independence on governing boards in the context of education. In particular, we examine the causal influence of professional educators elected to local school boards on education production. Educators may bring valuable human capital to school district leadership, thereby improving student learning. Alternatively, the independence of educators may be distorted by interest groups. The key empirical challenge is that school board composition is endogenously determined through the electoral process. To overcome this, we develop and implement a novel research design that exploits California's randomized assignment of the order that candidates appear on election ballots. The insight of our empirical strategy is that ballot order effects generate quasi-random variation in the elected school board's composition. This approach is made possible by a unique dataset that combines election information about California school board candidates with district-level data on education inputs and outcomes. The results reveal that educators on the school board causally increase teacher salaries and reduce district enrollment in charter schools relative to other board members. We do not find accompanying effects on student test scores. We interpret these findings as consistent with educators on school boards shifting bargaining in favor of teachers' unions.
I20|The Long-Run Effects of Recessions on Education and Income|This paper examines the long-run effects of the 1980-1982 recession on education and income. Using confidential Census data, I estimate difference-in-differences regressions that exploit variation across counties in recession severity and across cohorts in age at the time of the recession. For individuals age 0-10 in 1979, a 10 percent decrease in earnings per capita in their county of birth reduces four-year college degree attainment by 9 percent and income in adulthood by 3 percent. Simple calculations suggest that, in aggregate, the 1980-1982 recession led to 1-3 million fewer college graduates and $64-$145 billion less earned income per year.
I20|Who Gains from Active Learning in Higher Education?|The aim of this paper is to study whether and how teaching style (i.e., traditional vs active mode) affects academic performance of young individuals in tertiary education. We focus on entrepreneurship education as an ideal subject for experimenting alternative teaching methods. Identification relies on Triple Differences (DDD) estimates based on detailed administrative data for the universe of students in a Master's program in Management and Finance in Italy over 2011-2015. We measure academic achievement through several indicators, both right after the end of the entrepreneurship course (short run) and at the end of the program (long run). Our preferred estimates show no significant effects of the teaching mode on student's achievement, both in the short and in the long run. However, further estimates reveal interesting heterogeneities across students, being active teaching more effective in the case of females and students from secondary schools with an academic track.
I20|Does Stimulating Physical Activity Affect School Performance?|This paper investigates whether encouraging children to become more physically active in their everyday life affects their primary school performance. We use data from a field quasi-experiment called the Active Living Program, which aimed to increase active modes of transportation to school and active play among 8- to 12-year-olds living in low socioeconomic status (SES) areas in the Netherlands. Difference-in-differences estimations reveal that while the interventions increase time spent on physical activity during school hours, they negatively affect school performance, especially among the worst-performing students. Further analyses reveal that increased restlessness during instruction time is a potential mechanism for this negative effect. Our results suggest that the commonly found positive effects of exercising or participating in sports on educational outcomes may not be generalizable to physical activity in everyday life. Policymakers and educators who seek to increase physical activity in everyday life need to weigh the health and well-being benefits against the probability of increasing inequality in school performance.
I20|Secondary School Enrolment and Teenage Childbearing: Evidence from Brazilian Municipalities|This article investigates whether increasing secondary education opportunities influences childbearing among young women in Brazil. We examine a novel dataset reflecting the vast expansion of secondary education in Brazil between 1997 and 2009 and exploit variation in the introduction of schools across 4,884 municipalities to instrument for school enrolment. Our most conservative estimate suggests that for every 9.7 students enrolled there is one fewer teenage births. These findings are robust to a number of specifications and sensitivity tests. Our estimates imply that Brazil’s secondary school expansion accounts for 34% of the substantial decline in teenage childbearing observed over the same period. We further look at heterogeneous effects across a number of municipal characteristics and discuss what these results suggest about the mechanisms underlying the school-childbearing relationship.
I20|Parental Beliefs, Investments, and Child Development: Evidence from a Large-Scale Experiment|This paper experimentally estimates medium term impacts of a large-scale and low-cost parenting program targeting poor families in Chile. Households in 162 public health centers were randomly assigned to three groups: a control group, a second group that was offered eight weekly group parenting sessions, and a third group that was offered the same eight group sessions plus two sessions of guided interactions between parents and children focused on responsive play and dialogic reading. In spite of its short duration and intensity, three years after the end of the intervention, the receptive vocabulary and the socio-emotional development of children of families participating in either of the treatment arms improved (by 0.43 and 0.54 standard deviation, respectively) relative to children of nonparticipating families. The treatments also led to improvements in home environments and parenting behaviors of comparable magnitudes, which far outlasted the short duration of the intervention.
I20|Research for REGI Committee – Externalities of Cohesion Policy|The study investigates the effects of Cohesion Policy (CP) which occur in a country other than the one in which CP resources were actually spent. The study estimates that macroeconomic spillovers significantly contribute to the impact of CP. Spillovers directed to EU countries represent around 9% of the total annual CP expenditure. Other spillovers to Non-EU countries are around 8% of the CP expenditure. Macro and micro spillovers together arrive at 21% of the annual CP expenditure, 67% of which is distributed among EU countries. Around 20% of the CP expenditure can trigger sectoral spillover effects in the environment, transport and higher education sectors. The analysis demonstrates that externalities reinforce EU growth and competitiveness without CP deserting its convergence objective.
I20|Education and Polygamy : Evidence from Cameroon|We take advantage of a wave of school constructions in Cameroon after World War II and us evariations in school supply at the village level to estimate labor and marriage market returns to education in the 1976 population census. Education increases the likelihood to be in a polygamous union for men and for women, as well as the overall socioeconomic status of the spouse. We argue that education increases polygamy for women because it allows them to marry more educated and richer men, who are more likely to be polygamists. To show this, we estimate a structural model of marriage with polygamy. The positive aﬃnity between a man’s polygamy and a woman’s education is mostly explained by the aﬃnity of education.
I20|Measuring the effect of competitive teacher recruitment on student achievement: Evidence from Ecuador|In the last decade, several Latin American governments have implemented new teacher recruitment policies based on evaluations of candidates' competency and knowledge so as to raise the quality of their teachers and schools. Since 2007, the Ecuadorian government has required teacher candidates to pass national standardized tests before they can participate in merit-based selection competitions for tenure at public schools. Has this new recruitment system served as an effective screening device? Has it ultimately helped to raise student learning? To answer these questions, I analyze data from a unique Ecuadorian survey of schools in the academic year 2011-2012. I first estimate the value-added to student achievement using OLS and hierarchical linear regressions to evaluate the effect of Ecuador's new competitive recruitment policy. I then use propensity score matching to simulate a random assignment of students to teachers and estimate causal treatment effects. The evidence suggests that teachers who were granted tenure through the new competitive recruitment policy were no more effective, overall, in raising students' learning in reading or math than their peers at schools. Nonetheless, poorer children who were assigned to these teachers had significantly better scores in reading. Furthermore, test-screened teachers, regardless of their tenure status, seem to have had positive significant effects in reading, particularly for students living in poverty. This finding suggests that Ecuador's teacher recruitment policy had a positive impact on the nation's most vulnerable students.
I20|Maternal Health, Children Education and Women Empowerment: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from India|The empirical evidence on the inter-generational effects of maternal health interventions is inconclusive, particularly the impact on cognitive ability of children. In this paper, we study one such popular policy from India, viz, the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) which is a agship health and safe motherhood program. We exploit plausible exogenous variation in exposure to the program generated by the institutional features of the implementation, in a cross-sectional difference-in-difference framework to find evidence of reduction in academic test scores of children whose parents remained unexposed to the policy intervention. We also find that such children spend less time on homework during the week, were less likely to attend and enjoy school. We also find negative effects on women empowerment measures for the unexposed women. The results suggest that the JSY led to increase in women empowerment and improved cognitive outcomes for children.
I20|On the road to integration? Immigrants’ demand for informal (& formal) education|In this paper we study the allocation of time devoted to informal learning and education, i.e. those activities carried out during leisure time and outside formal education courses which boost individuals’ human and social capital. For immigrants the private investment in these activities is likely to have relevant external effects as informal learning and education enhances the likelihood of greater socio-economic integration in the host society. We first develop a simple theoretical framework, which allows us to highlight the different constrains/opportunity costs faced by immigrants as compared with natives. Then, we empirically investigate the determinants of participation in informal education using the American Time Use Data (ATUS; period 2003-2015) which contains detailed information on daily time budgets of a large sample of immigrants and natives in the US. Consistently with a theoretical model of time allocation we find evidence that immigrants are more likely to engage in informal education and, conditional on participation, they allocate more time to these activities. Over time, immigrants show a higher degree of assimilation into the host society. Our results also highlight heterogeneous patterns across gender.
I20|Impact of Early Childcare on Immigrant Children’s Educational Performance|This paper investigates the impact of attending early childcare on second generation immigrant children’s cognitive outcomes. Our analysis draws on administrative data on the entire population of students in fifth grade collected by the Italian Institute for the Evaluation of the Educational System (INVALSI) for school years 2014/2015 to 2016/2017 matched to unique administrative records on the early childcare public available slots at the municipal level. Our identification strategy exploits cross-sectional and time series variation in the provision of early childcare service across Italian municipalities as an instrument for individual early childcare attendance. Our results point out that the effect of early childcare attendance differs between native and immigrant children. Although we find no effects for Italian children, our estimates show a positive and significant effect on literacy test scores for immigrant children of low educated parents, which suggests that early childcare may be particularly relevant for immigrant children from a disadvantaged background.
I20|The only child, birth order and educational outcomes|The one-child policy was implemented in September 1980 and abolished in late 2015. With this change in the demographic policy, the fertility decision of families also changed. Such decisions can result in an increase in the number of siblings in a family. Individuals' educational outcomes may be affected by a change in their parents' fertility decision. The objective of this paper is to provide evidence of the difference of educational outcomes between the only child and the first born. The authors try to estimate the change of educational outcomes when the only child of a family turns to the first born of a family. Moreover, they estimate different channels to interpret these effects. They employ the dataset of China Education Panel data in this paper. In the part of mechanism check, the Sobel-Good test is used for checking the mediation effects of different channels. They found the only child has significant higher educational outcomes comparing to a child who has siblings. Furthermore, the middle child has the lowest educational outcomes of a family. The last born has higher educational outcomes than his or her siblings. To explain these effects, the authors use three channels to interpret: (1) money resource, (2) parenting time, and (3) closeness of parent-child relationships. The policy implication is to help the policymaker estimate and predict the impact of the new demographic policy.
I20|Mindfulness, preferences and well-being: Mindfulness predicts adolescents' field behaviour|Mindfulness could influence economic and health related behaviour by bringing about increased and unbiased attention to the present moment, for example to a decision making process. This study explores the relationship between mindfulness and economic preferences, and consequently well-being, of adolescents. Comprehensive data of 525 German secondary school students were elicited and show no evidence for a strong linear or non-linear correlation between mindfulness and economic preferences. However, both mindfulness and preferences have explanatory power for adolescents' field behaviour and thus contribute to explaining variation in behaviour that may translate into serious health and economic consequences. In this regard, my findings indicate that the two concepts play rather complementary than substitutable roles, which implies that an integration of economic preferences and personality traits such as mindfulness may improve the analysis of potential sources of variation in life outcomes. As mindfulness reflects on a healthier lifestyle (less smoking and smaller BMI) and higher life satisfaction, the findings furthermore point into the direction that the development of mindfulness skills might help students to grow social-emotional capacities and increase physical and psychological well-being.
I20|Labor Demand Shocks at Birth and Cognitive Achievement during Childhood|As epidemiological studies have shown that conditions during gestation and early childhood affect adult health outcomes, we examine the effect of local labor market conditions in the year of birth on cognitive development in childhood. To address the endogeneity of labor market conditions, we construct gender-specific predicted employment growth rates at the state level by interacting an industry's share in a state's employment with the industry's national growth rate. We find that an increase in employment opportunities for men leads to an improvement in children's cognitive achievement as measured by reading and math test scores. Additionally, our estimates show a positive and significant effect of male-specific employment growth on children's Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test scores and in home environment in the year of birth. We find an insignificant positive effect of buoyancy in females' employment opportunities on said test scores.
I20|The Early Life Influences of Teachers' Genders on Later Life Charitable Giving: Evidence from the Natural Disasters in Japan|What determines human beings' decisions to donate money to a charity? Using a nationally representative survey of the Japanese population, we demonstrate that having been taught by a female teacher in their first year of school makes individuals more likely to donate to charities following natural disasters. The findings are robust in controlling for lessons on prosocial behaviors, such as group learning. We tested our results separately for men and women, as well as on prosocial attitude outcomes. Overall, our results suggest potential prosocial implications may arise from teacher-student gender matching.
I20|Is Early Start a Better Start? Evaluating California State University's Early Start Remediation Policy|Remediation has long been a costly way to address the misalignment between K-12 and higher education. In 2011, the California State University (CSU), the nation's largest public four-year university system, enacted Early Start, requiring students needing remediation to enroll in such courses in the summer before their freshmen year. We estimate the impact of Early Start summer remediation relative to both traditional fall remediation and relative to no remediation at all. Our results suggest Early Start summer remediation has not improved student performance or persistence relative to either alternative. As many states move away from remedial courses altogether, there is continued need for both innovation and for evidence in policy and practice to improve college readiness and success.
I20|Industry Fluctuations and College Major Choices: Evidence from an Energy Boom and Bust|This paper examines how college students in the United States altered their college major decisions during the energy boom and bust of the 1970s and 1980s. We focus on petroleum engineering and geology, two majors closely related to the energy industry. We find strong evidence that the energy boom increased the prevalence of these two energy-related majors and the energy bust lowered the prevalence of these majors. Effects are particularly strong for young people born in energy intensive states. Thus, college major decisions responded to industry fluctuations with important location-specific effects consistent with frictions to migration and information flows.
I20|Children's Time Use and Educational Achievement: Assessing Evidence from the Japan Child Panel Survey|This paper investigates the relationship between how children spend their time and parental socio-economic status, and the relationship between time spent for learning outside of school and academic achievement drawing on the Japan Child Panel Survey (JCPS). From the wide range of activities for which children spend their time, we focuses on watching TV (DVD), playing video games, doing homework, and total extra-curricular learning time by children, and delineates how time spent on each activity vary according to parental socio-economic status and change over the age of the child. First, time spent watching TV tends to be shorter with a higher level of parental educational background and total extra-curricular learning time tends to be longer with higher parental income. Second, while the effect of household income on how children spend their time was found to be limited, it did have a positive correlation with time spent doing homework and children's learning time. Third, the analysis which took into account the child's fixed effect found that household income had no influence on total learning time outside of school but that there was a positive relationship between students' learning time and academic achievement in mathematics and Japanese language.
I20|Birth Cohort Size Variation and the Estimation of Class Size Effects|We present evidence that the practice of holding back poorly performing students affects estimates of the impact of class size on student outcomes based on within-school variation of cohort size over time. This type of variation is commonly used to identify class size effects. We build a theoretical model in which cohort size is subject to random shocks and students whose performance falls below a threshold are retained. Our model predicts that initial birth cohort size is mechanically related to the grade-level share of previously retained students once these cohorts reach higher grades. This compositional effect gives rise to an upward bias in class size effects exploiting variation in birth cohort size. Using administrative data on school enrollment for all primary schools in one federal state of Germany, we find support for this compositional effect. Correcting for the resulting bias in a unique dataset on standardized test scores for the full student population of third graders, we find that not only are smaller classes beneficial for language and math test scores, but also for reducing grade repetition.
I20|Oh Mother: The Neglected Impact of School Disruptions|Temporary school closures (TSC) represent a major challenge to policymakers across the globe due to their potential impact on instructional time and student achievement. A neglected but equally important question relates to how such closures affect the labor market behavior of parents. This paper provides novel evidence on the effect of temporary school closures on parental labor market behavior, exploiting the prevalence of primary school teacher strikes across time and provinces in Argentina. We find clear evidence that temporary school closures negatively impact the labor market participation of mothers, in particular lower-skilled mothers less attached to the labor force and mothers in dual-income households who face a lower opportunity cost of dropping out of the labor force. This effect translates into a statistically significant and economically meaningful reduction in labor earnings: the average mother whose child is exposed to ten days of TSCs suffers a decline in monthly labor earnings equivalent to 2.92% of the mean. While we do not find any effects among fathers in general, fathers with lower predicted earnings than their spouses also experience negative labor market effects. This suggests that the parental response to TSCs depend, at least in part, on the relative income of each parent. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggest that the aggregate impact of TSCs on annual parental earnings is more than $113 million, and that the average mother would be willing to forego 1.6 months of labor earnings in order to ensure that there are no TSCs while her child is in primary school.
I20|Widening the High School Curriculum to Include Soft Skill Training: Impacts on Health, Behaviour, Emotional Wellbeing and Occupational Aspirations|"From 2020 Personal, Social, Health and Economic Education will be compulsory in UK schools for adolescents, however less is known about how it can be taught in a an effective manner. We examine, through a randomised trial, the impact of an evidenced based health related quality of life (HRQoL) curriculum called Healthy Minds that ran in 34 high schools in England over a four-year period. We find robust evidence that Healthy Minds positively augments many physical health domains of treated adolescents. We also find some evidence that Healthy Minds positively affects behaviour, but has no impact on emotional wellbeing. We find notable gender effects, strongly favouring boys. We also present evidence that Healthy Minds changes career aspirations, with those exposed to treatment being less likely to choose competitive work and more likely to choose work that involves ""people-skills"". Overall our work illustrates the potential for later childhood interventions to promote HRQoL and develop the career aspirations of adolescents."
I20|Technology, Education, Life and Non-life Insurance in Africa|This article examines the relevance of information and communication technology (ICT) in modulating the effect of education on life insurance and non-life insurance consumption in 48 African countries for the period 2004-2014. Education is measured with primary school, secondary school and tertiary school enrollments. ICT is measured with mobile phone, internet and broadband subscriptions. The empirical evidence is based on generalized method of moments. The following main findings are established. First, from the nexuses between education, ICT and life insurance, there are positive conditional effects from the interaction between: (i) broadband subscriptions and primary school enrollment; (ii) broadband subscriptions and secondary school enrollment and (iii) internet penetration and tertiary school enrollment. Second, from the nexuses between education, ICT and non-life insurance: (i) there is a negative net effect from the interactions between mobile phone penetration and primary education while positive net effects are apparent from the interactions between: mobile phone penetration and secondary school enrollment; secondary school enrollment and broadband subscriptions and; tertiary school enrollment and broadband subscriptions.
I20|The role of ICT in modulating the effect of education and lifelong learning on income inequality and economic growth in Africa|This study assesses the role of ICT in modulating the impact of education and lifelong learning on income inequality and economic growth. It focuses on a sample of 48 African countries from 2004 to 2014. The empirical evidence is based on the generalised method of moments (GMM). The following findings are established. First, mobile phone and internet each interact with primary school education to decrease income inequality. Second, all ICT indicators interact with secondary school education to exert a negative impact on the Gini index. Third, fixed broadband distinctly interacts with primary school education and lifelong learning to have a positive effect on economic growth. Fourth, ICT indicators do not significantly influence inequality and economic growth through tertiary school education and lifelong learning. These main findings are further substantiated. Policy implications are discussed.
I20|Measuring Opportunity in U.S. Higher Education|In identifying whether universities provide opportunities for low-income students, there is a measurement challenge: different institutions face students with different incomes and preparation. We show how a hypothetical university's “relevant pool”–the students from whom it could plausibly draw–affects popular measures: the Pell share, Bottom Quintile share, and Intergenerational Mobility. Using a proof by contradiction, we demonstrate that universities ranked highly on the popular measures can actually serve disproportionately few low-income students. We also show the reverse: universities slated for penalties on the popular measures can actually serve disproportionately many low-income students. Furthermore, the Intergenerational Mobility measure penalizes universities that face relatively equal income distributions, which are probably good for low-income students, and rewards universities that face very unequal income distributions. In short, by confounding differences in university effort with differences in circumstances, the popular measures could distort university decision making and produce unintended consequences. We demonstrate that, with well-thought-out data analysis, it is possible to create benchmarks that actually measure what they are intended to measure. In particular, we present a measure that overcomes the deficiencies of the popular measures and is informative about all, not just low-income, students.
I20|Does Pollution Drive Achievement? The Effect of Traffic Pollution on Academic Performance|We examine the effect of school traffic pollution on student outcomes by leveraging variation in wind patterns for schools the same distance from major highways. We compare within-student achievement for students transitioning between schools near highways, where one school has had greater levels of pollution because it is downwind of a highway. Students who move from an elementary/middle school that feeds into a “downwind” middle/high school in the same zip code experience decreases in test scores, more behavioral incidents, and more absences, relative to when they transition to an upwind school. Even within zip codes, microclimates can contribute to inequality.
I20|When Labor's Lost: Health, Family Life, Incarceration, and Education in a Time of Declining Economic Opportunity for Low-Skilled Men|The economic progress of US men has stagnated in recent decades. The labor force participation rate of men ages 25-54 peaked in the mid-1960s and has declined since then (according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics), while men's real median earnings have been flat since the early 1970s. These population averages mask considerably larger declines in participation among less-educated and non-white men as well as substantial increases in wage inequality. In this paper, we seek to illuminate the broader context in which prime-age men are experiencing economic stagnation. We explore changes for prime-age men over time in education, mortality, morbidity, disability program receipt, family structure, and incarceration rates. We focus on prime-age men, namely those ages 25-54, and on the years 1980-2016 (or 2017 when possible), encompassing much of the period of reduced economic progress for low-skilled men.
I20|The Economic Value of Breaking Bad: Misbehavior, Schooling and the Labor Market|Prevailing research argues that childhood misbehavior in the classroom is bad for schooling and, presumably, bad for adult outcomes. In contrast, we argue that childhood misbehavior represents some underlying non-cognitive skills that are valuable in the labor market. We follow work from psychology and categorize observed classroom misbehavior into two underlying latent factors. We then estimate a model of educational attainment and earnings outcomes, allowing the impact of each of the two factors to vary by outcome. We find one of the factors, labeled in the psychological literature as externalizing behavior (and linked, for example, to aggression), reduces educational attainment yet increases earnings. Unlike most models where non-cognitive skills that increase human capital through education also increase labor market skills, our findings illustrate how some non-cognitive skills can be productive in some economic contexts and counter-productive in others. Policies designed to promote human capital accumulation could therefore have mixed effects or even negative economic consequences, especially for policies that target non-cognitive skill formation for children or adolescents which are aimed solely at improving educational outcomes.
I20|School bus emissions, student health and academic performance|Diesel emissions from school buses expose children to high levels of air pollution; retrofitting bus engines can substantially reduce this exposure. Using variation from 2656 retrofits across Georgia, we estimate effects of emissions reductions on district-level health and academic achievement. We demonstrate positive effects on respiratory health, measured by a statewide test of aerobic capacity. Placebo tests on body mass index show no impact. We also find that retrofitting districts experience significant test score gains in English and smaller gains in math. Our results suggest that engine retrofits can have meaningful and cost-effective impacts on health and cognitive functioning.
I20|Does Class Size Matter? How, and at What Cost?|Using high quality administrative data on Greece we show that class size has a hump shaped effect on achievement. We do so both nonparametrically and parametrically, while controlling for potential endogeneity and allowing for quantile effects. We then embed our estimates for this relationship in a dynamic structural model with costs of hiring and firing. We argue that the linear specification form used in past work may be why it found mixed results. Our work suggests that while discrete reductions in class size may have mixed effects, discrete increases are likely to have very negative effects while marginal changes in class size would have small negative effects. We find optimal class sizes around 27 in the absence of adjustment costs and achievement maximizing ones around 15, and firing costs much larger than hiring costs consistent with the presence of unions. Despite this, reducing firing costs actually reduces achievement. Reducing hiring costs raises achievement and reduces class size. We show that class size caps are costly, and more so for small schools, even when set at levels well above average.
I20|The Effect of the Universal Primary Education Program on Labor Market Outcomes: Evidence from Tanzania|The purpose of this article is to study the effect of education on labor market participation and household consumption in a rural environment. The Tanzanian Universal Primary Education (UPE) program, which provides variations in education across locations and over time, is used as a natural experiment. Exploiting these two exogenous variations to instrument education, I find that education increases household consumption, especially in agriculture and in nonfarm self-employment activities. I also provide evidence that education increases the probability of working in agriculture. These results, initially surprising, suggest that returns to education in agriculture are positive, provided that the skills taught at school are suitable for agriculture.
I20|Understanding the Mechanisms of Parental Divorce Effects on Child’s Higher Education|In this paper we evaluate the degree to which the adverse parental divorce effect on university education operates through deprivation of economic resources. Using one million siblings from Taiwan, we first find that parental divorce occurring at ages 13-18 led to a 10.6 percent decrease in the likelihood of university admission at age 18. We then use the same sample to estimate the effect of parental job loss occurring at the same ages, and use the job-loss effect as a benchmark to indicate the potential parental divorce effect due to family income loss. We find the job-loss effect very little. Combined, these results imply a minor role played by reduced income in driving the parental divorce effect on the child’s higher education outcome. Non-economic mechanisms, such as psychological and mental shocks, are more likely to dominate. Our further examinations show that boys and girls are equally susceptible, and younger teenagers are more vulnerable than the more mature ones, to parental divorce.
I20|Distributional Effects of Education on Health|This paper studies distributional effects of education on health. In 1972, England, Scotland, and Wales raised their minimum school-leaving age from 15 to 16 for students born after 9/1/1957. Using a regression discontinuity design and objective health measures for 0.27 million individuals, we find that education reduced body size and increased blood pressure in middle age. The reduction in body size was concentrated at the upper tail of the distribution with a 7.5 percentage point reduction in obesity. The increase in blood pressure was concentrated at the lower tail of the distribution with no effect on stage 2 hypertension.
I20|Why Unions Survive: Understanding How Unions Overcome The Free-Rider Problem|This paper provides evidence for why individuals join unions instead of free-riding. I model membership as legal insurance. To test the model, I use the incidence of news stories concerning allegations against teachers in the UK as a plausibly exogenous shock to demand for such insurance. I find that, for every five stories occurring in a region, teachers are 2.2 percentage points more likely to be members in the subsequent year. These effects are larger when teachers share characteristics with the news story and can explain 45 percent of the growth in teacher union membership between 1992 and 2010.
I20|Employer Learning and the Dynamics of Returns to Universities: Evidence from Chinese Elite Education during University Expansion|This paper estimates the return to an elite university education over a college graduate’s career using the CHIP 2013 data. We find a substantial premium for graduating from an elite Chinese university at job entry, but it declines quickly with labor market experience. This pattern is entirely driven by the young cohorts who enter college after the higher education expansion that started in 1999. This pattern is more pronounced in coastal provinces and in economically more developed regions, where individual skills are highly rewarded in the labor market. The initial elite premium and its subsequent decline is found just for males; individual skills are much more consistently rewarded for females than males. The results are consistent with employer learning, where employers pay workers based on more easily observable group characteristics at job entry but rely less on these over time when more accurate information about individual productivity becomes available.
I20|Preschool Quality and Child Development|Global access to preschool has increased dramatically yet preschool quality is often poor. We use a randomized controlled trial to evaluate two approaches to improving the quality of Colombian preschools. We find that the first, which was rolled out nationwide and provides additional resources for materials and new staff, did not benefit children’s development and, unintentionally, led teachers to reduce their involvement in classroom activities. The second approach additionally trains teachers to improve their pedagogical methods. We find this addition offset the negative effects on teacher behavior, improved the quality of teaching and raised children’s cognition, language and school readiness.
I20|The Unintended Impacts of Agricultural Fires: Human Capital in China|The practice of burning agricultural waste is ubiquitous around the world, yet the external human capital costs from those fires have been underexplored. Using data from the National College Entrance Examination (NCEE) and agricultural fires detected by high-resolution satellites in China during 2005 to 2011, this paper investigates the impacts of fires on cognitive performance. To address the endogeneity of agricultural fires, we differentiate upwind fires from downwind fires. We find that a one-standard-deviation increase in the difference between upwind and downwind fires during the exam decreases the total exam score by 1.42 percent of a standard deviation (or 0.6 point), and further decreases the probability of getting into first-tier universities by 0.51 percent of a standard deviation.
I20|Explaining the evolution of ethnicity differentials in academic achievements: The role of time investments|Children of Asian immigrants in most English-speaking destinations have better academic outcomes, yet the underlying causes of their advantages are under-studied. We employ panel time-use diaries by two cohorts of children observed over a decade to present new evidence that children of Asian immigrants begin spending more time than their peers on educational activities from school entry; and, that the ethnicity gap in the time allocated to educational activities increases over time. By specifying an augmented value-added model and invoking a quantile decomposition method, we find that the academic advantage of children of Asian immigrants is attributable mainly to their allocating more time to educational activities or their favorable initial cognitive abilities and not to socio-demographics or parenting styles. Furthermore, our results show substantial heterogeneity in the contributions of initial cognitive abilities and time allocations by test subjects, test ages and points of the test score distribution.
I20|Female Science Advisors and the STEM Gender Gap|In an effort to reduce the gender gap in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), policymakers often propose providing women with close mentoring by female scientists. This is based on the idea that female scientists might act as role models and counteract negative gender stereotypes that are pervasive in science fields. However, as of yet, there is still no clear evidence on the role of mentor or advisor gender in reducing the STEM gender gap. We use rich administrative data from a private 4-year college to provide some of the first causal evidence on the impact of advisor gender on women's STEM degree attainment. We exploit a unique setting where students are randomly assigned to academic advisors – who are also faculty members – in their freshman year of college. A college advisor's main role is to provide students with one-on-one personalized mentoring regarding course and major selection. Students declare a major at the end of their freshman year, after having had the opportunity to repeatedly interact with their advisors. We find that being matched to a female rather than a male science advisor substantially narrows the gender gaps in STEM enrollment and graduation, with the strongest effects occurring among students who are highly skilled in math. In contrast, the gender of an advisor from a non-science department has no impact on students' major choice. Our results indicate that providing close mentoring or advising by female scientists can play an important role in promoting women's participation and persistence in STEM fields.
I20|Challenge: To Raise the Employment Rate|Abstract The government reached its 2019 goal of 72% for the employment rate. Yet, the policymaking arena has already rushed to raise the target to 75%. This official employment rate, which measures the share of the employed in the 15–64 aged population, however, conceals large differences both between and within age groups. Particularly problematic is that it overlooks the weak employment situation of those with only a primary education and of persons of foreign background born abroad. In view of this it may be asked whether the official employment rate really is to be considered as a reasonable goal and guiding principle for employment policies. It includes school-aged groups and even youngsters still obliged to participate in compulsory education. It neglects the fact that growing numbers of adults leave working life for upskilling or reskilling due to rapid technological change. Hence, the activity rate (the joint share of students and employed) would be a more relevant indicator especially in the case of youngsters but increasingly so also for adults. Left aside are also key questions such as: Why has the employment rate risen in some age groups but not in others? What is the quality of the employment relationships underlying the observed increase in employment? The design of policy measures needs to be supported by information on group-specific employment rates supplemented with more precise quantitative as well as qualitative indicators.
I20|The competencies of headmasters in students´ practice reflection at the departmental schools in Czech Republic|Aim of papers based on summarizing the results of the authors? survey on the analyses of headmasters? competencies and theirs reflection by students of the study programme Educational management. The goal of the paper is to define and discuss headmasters? competencies reflections of professional practice by educational management students in terms of their theoretical knowledge, practical skills, management and human resources management development potential. From the perspective of future management of the students, authors? research results support the assumption that educational management students gained experience by this professional praxis in the time of study. The research questions is: What headmasters?competencies are more important for students´ educational management practice?
I20|Evaluating Policy and Practicality in Tokyo Metropolitan Government?s Pre-Olympic English Language Pedagogy|In a context of increased internationalization and in preparation for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, in 2014 Japan?s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) released the ?English Education Reform Plan? which aimed to implement English education reform through elementary, lower and upper secondary schools. A year later, the Tokyo Metropolitan Board of Education (TMBOE) distributed the Welcome to Tokyo series of textbooks to all students at grade five and above at public elementary schools in the Tokyo Metropolitan area. The general intention was to bolster young students? English skills. However, rather than focusing on language acquisition, critics have revealed that two main discourses are repeated throughout the policy documents issued by both MEXT and TMBOE. Namely, ?developing human resources? and ?nurturing Japanese identity.? Hiroshi Miyashita has argued that ?careful attention should be paid to these measures because they have potential to lead students to exclusivism or even nationalism without extra care? (Miyashita, 2017). In regards to the subtext and efficacy of these policies, this paper examines the Welcome to Tokyo series. By means of discourse analysis and taking into consideration content, lexical range, representation of race and gender, word frequency and structure, I question the text?s overall suitability for effective English language acquisition in an increasingly internationalized environment. To conclude, a brief summary offering suggestions for improvement and advice for educators in this context will be provided.
I20|WhatsApp utilisation at an initial teacher preparation programme at a university of technology in South Africa|All universities in South Africa are encouraged to use a Learning Management System such as Blackboard to facilitate blended learning. Despite, the availability of Blackboard at one university of technology in the country, some lecturers and students prefer utilising WhatsApp for teaching and learning. The purpose of this study is to investigate students and lecturers? perspectives about learning and teaching using WhatsApp at a university in South Africa. The study was done using a qualitative case study within an intepretivist paradigm. It was guided by Garrison, Anderson and Archer?s Community of Inquiry as a theoretical framework. Sixteen students and two lecturers who heavily use WhatsApp were purposively selected to participate in semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. The study found that lecturers use WhatsApp not only for communication purposes, but to foster collaborative learning among students. Although students noted some limitations which they experience when using WhatsApp, they preferred the social media to blackboard. The study concludes that although WhatsApp is response to students? needs, it does not adequately prepare students to graduate with digital literacy skills expected by the Department of Education in the country.
I20|Teacher perception using the mobile phone in the teacher working group; age matters|This study examined senior teachers and junior teachers at primary school to show their mobile phone activity level among teacher working group in Lampung Province in 5 districts. The category of junior teachers are teachers whom are under 32 years (246 teachers) and senior teachers are categorised among teachers whom are over 50 years (304 teachers) and the total respondent is 550 teachers. There are two main elements of this research. Firstly, there is perception on the activity on junior teachers and senior teachers in primary school in teacher working group in Lampung Province. The research found that senior teachers are more active and care about being a part of teacher working group as compared to junior teachers, but both of them said that teacher working group helps them to improve their competencies. Secondly, there is a perception of the activity by junior teachers and senior teachers in the mobile phone group chat in the teacher working group. The result indicates that the junior teachers perceive themselves as experts (63% of the respondents) in using mobile phone, higher than senior teachers (23%). The result has also found that not all junior teachers were engaged in the group chat in teacher working group (72%), and the same pattern was seen among senior teachers as only 75% of them were engaged in group chat. There is a different perception of activity between junior teachers and senior teacher in collaborative learning through the mobile phone in teacher working group based on t-test with an independent sample test. The data indicates (2 tailed) 0.011 compare to the table
I20|Selection and Performance in Post-Compulsory Education|This paper investigates the determinants of participation and performance in post-compulsory education, controlling for the selection into post-compulsory education and prior attainment, using a unique primary dataset on pupils studying in the post-compulsory grade in 2011-2012 from one district of the Punjab province of Pakistan. The main findings of the paper show that participation and performance in post-compulsory education are two different processes, with participation being driven by availability of post-compulsory institutions within travel distance, while performance, once in post-compulsory education, is determined by ability. The results further highlight that distance reduces participation most for those living in rural areas.
I20|It's Not Just for Boys! Understanding Gender Differences in STEM|While education levels of women have increased dramatically relative to men, women are still greatly underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) college programmes. We use unique data on preference rankings for all secondary school students who apply for college in Ireland and detailed information on school subjects and grades to decompose the sources of the gender gap in STEM. We find that, of the 22 percentage points raw gap, about 13 percentage points is explained by differential subject choices and grades in secondary school. Subject choices are more important than grades -- we estimate male comparative advantage in STEM (as measured by subject grades) explains about 3 percentage points of the gender gap. Additionally, differences in overall achievement between girls and boys have a negligible effect. Strikingly, there remains a gender gap of 9 percentage points even for persons who have identical preparation at the end of secondary schooling (in terms of both subjects studied and grades achieved); however, this gap is only 4 percentage points for STEM-ready students. We find that gender gaps are smaller among high-achieving students and for students who go to school in more affluent areas. There is no gender gap in science (the large gaps are in engineering and technology), and we also find a smaller gender gap when we include nursing degrees in STEM, showing that the definition of STEM used is an important determinant of the conclusions reached.
I20|Human Capital and Economic Growth|The aim of this entry is (I) to undertake a critical reading of the seminal contribution of Lucas’ work to construct a model which represents the complexity of the links between human capital and economic growth (II) to review the empirical assessments of its endogenous nature.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
I20|Selection and educational attainment: Why some children are left behind? Evidence from a middle-income country|We model schooling as a sequential process and examine why some children are left behind. We focus on the factors that explain selection at early stages of the education system. Our findings for Uruguay suggest that long-term factors, such as parental background or ethnicity matter across all education stages while the effect of short-term factors, such as family income, wear out as individuals progress in the education system, suggesting a severe selection process at early stages.
I20|Towards reducing anxiety and increasing performance in physics education: Evidence from a randomized experiment|This study evaluates the effectiveness of an intervention of formative assessments with a clicker-based technology on anxiety and academic performance. We use a randomized experiment in physics education in one school in Dutch secondary education. For treated students the formative assessments are operationalized through quizzing at the end of each physics class, where clickers enable students to respond to questions. Control students do not receive these assessments and do not use clickers, but apart from that the classes they attend are similar. Findings from multilevel regressions indicate that the formative assessments significantly reduce anxiety in physics, and improve academic performance in physics in comparison with a traditional teaching. Furthermore, a mediation effect of anxiety in physics on academic performance is observed. In sum, this implies that an easily to implement technique of formative assessments can make students feel more at ease, which contributes to better educational performance.
I20|Educational achievement and gender differences: The role of the interaction between emotional stability and conscientiousness|The personality traits emotional stability and conscientiousness as well as the concept of gender are known to be predictive of educational achievement. Nevertheless, the interaction between these two traits and their relationship with both educational achievement and gender heterogeneity therein are far less explored and understood. We addressed this issue by using rich data from the British Cohort Study 1970 (BCS70) to targeting the relationship between personality as measured in adolescence and educational achievement in adulthood. We found that emotional stability was positively related to education outcomes for females, while conscientiousness was able to further boost their educational achievement. By contrast, these findings also indicated that less emotional stability was positively related to education outcomes for conscientious males. Our results suggest that an isolated examinations of the relationship between either emotional stability or conscientiousness and educational achievement while neglecting gender heterogeneity within these relations is likely misleading.

I20|Effectively involving low-SES parents in human capital development|In this paper we analyze the effect of involving parents in human capital investment. We study the effect of a parental app on student effort in a digital homework practice tool, and its effect on subsequent human capital development. The randomized field experiment includes more than 2000 7-9 grade students of 2 schools and we specifically focus on different socio-economic status (SES) groups. The results indicate that parental involvement via an app positively affects effort and human capital development of 7th and 8th grade students, but not of 9th grade students. The positive effects are mainly driven by low-SES students and are larger for males.
I20|The role of early-career university prestige stratification on the future academic performance of scholars|"Prestige and mobility are important aspects of academic life that play a critical role during early-career. After PhD graduation scholars have to compete for positions in the labour market. Unfortunately, many of them have few research products such that their inherent ability and skills remain mostly unobserved for hiring committees. Institutional prestige in this context is a key mechanism that signals the quality of candidates, and many studies have shown that a ""good"" affiliation can confer many opportunities for future career development. We know little, however, about how changes of scholar's institutional prestige during early-career relate to future academic performance. In this paper, we use an algorithm to rank universities based on hiring networks in Mexico. We distinguish three groups of scholars that move Up, Down or Stay in the prestige hierarchy between PhD graduation and first job. After controlling for individual characteristics by matching scholars with equal training or the same first job institution, we find that scholars hired by their existing faculty sustain higher performance over their career in comparison to other groups. Interestingly, we find that scholars that move up the hierarchy exhibit, on average, lower academic performance than the other groups. We argue that the negative relation between upward ranking mobility and performance is related to the difficulties in changing research teams at an early-career stage and to the so-called ""big-fish-small-pond"" effect. We observe a high stratification of universities by prestige and a negative association between mobility and performance that can hinder the flows of knowledge throughout the science system."
I20|Education and Gender Differences in Mortality Rates|We examine the gender asymmetries in mortality generated by a Spanish reform raising the legal working age from 14 to 16 in 1980. While the reform, though its effects on education, decreased mortality at ages 14-29 among men (6.3%) and women (8.9%), it increased mortality for prime-age women (30-45) by 6.3%. This last effect is driven by increases in HIV mortality, as well as by diseases of the nervous and circulatory system. All in all, these patterns help explain the narrowing age gap in life expectancy between women and men in Spain.
I20|On the Evolution of Norms in Strategic Environments|In a heterogeneous population divided into two cultural groups, we investigate the intergenerational dynamics of norms, modeled as preferences over actions, as depending on strategic environments. We find that environments with strategic complementarity or substitutability lead to different long-run norms and horizontal socializations. When players face many games within the same class, under complementarity agents converge to the same norm and socialization is high, under substitutability norms may diverge or become neutral and socialization is low. However, for specific games, partial convergence can arise under complementarity, providing an explanation to cultural heterogeneity, and partial divergence can arise under substitutability.
I20|Impact of Early Childcare on Immigrant Children’s Educational Performance|This paper investigates the impact of attending early childcare on second generation immigrant children's cognitive outcomes. Our analysis draws on administrative data on the entire population of students in fifth grade collected by the Italian Institute for the Evaluation of the Educational System (INVALSI) for school years 2014/2015 to 2016/2017 matched to unique administrative records on the early childcare public available slots at the municipal level. Our identification strategy exploits cross-sectional and time series variation in the provision of early childcare service across Italian municipalities as an instrument for individual early childcare attendance. Our results point out that the effect of early childcare attendance differs between native and immigrant children. Although we find no effects for Italian children, our estimates show a positive and significant effect on literacy test scores for immigrant children of low educated mothers, which suggests that early childcare may be particularly relevant for immigrant children from a disadvantaged background.
I20|Factors That Affect Thai University Students? Reading Competence|This research study was conducted to survey factors that affect the reading competence of Thai university students. The participants were the second year undergraduate English major students who registered to study ?English Reading? at Kasetsart University. The research tools used in this study were a survey questionnaire and a semi-structured interview. The statistical method for data analyses were percentage, mean value (x) and standard deviation (SD). A summary was made of key points from the semi-structured interview. Based on both statistical data of the questionnaire and an interview, it was found that the major factors were firstly an inadequate knowledge of vocabulary and sentence structure, followed by a lack of background knowledge, an inability to grasp the main ideas and lastly the inability to understand the writer?s purpose and style.
I20|Methods To Overcome Common Listening Problems Encountered By Thai Students Learning English|Listening is one of the most important skills in learning English as a foreign language. The purpose of this study aimed at investigating problems Thai Students face when listening to spoken English and factors affecting students? listening skills. The participants were 401 undergraduate non-English major students who registered to study Communicative English for Careers in the academic year 2016. They were all Thai. The research instruments used in this study were a questionnaire and a semi-structured interview. The statistical techniques used were percentages with the mean value (x) and standard deviation (SD). The findings revealed that the major problem was not being able to have words repeated. The second largest problem was not being able to remember what was heard when distinguishing between similar sounding words. This was followed by not being able to grasp the main ideas. Factors affecting students? listening skills were unfamiliar vocabulary, speakers? speech rates, speakers? accents, a lack of background knowledge about the topic that they hear and a lack of concentration.
I20|Investigation Of Pre-School And Elementary School Preservie Teacher?s Hopelessness Levels in Terms Of Various Variables|"Hopelessness expresses a negative expectation with a pessimistic attitude, a pessimistic approach and a failure feature. In this study, various variables affecting the hopelessness levels of the fourth (last) grade students that study pre-school and elementary school teaching departmants at Kocaeli University in 2017-2018 semestre will be examined. At this point the problem of this research is hopelessness levels of pre-service and elementary school preservice teachers to be employed in various educational institutions in the future. This research is appropriate to descriptive research model from the types of quantitative research and 81 pre-school and 59 elementary school preservice teachers participated for this investigation. In the research, ""Beck Hopelessness Scale"" developed by Aaron Temkin Beck and ""Personal Information Form"" developed by researchers were used. The results of the research will be shared after the data analysis as the results of the obtained data are still being reviewed."
I20|To what extent is the Course Experience Questionnaire applicable to Japanese Education?|With a shift towards global education and ?world-class? universities, reliable methods to measure the quality of courses becomes more pertinent. The quality of Japanese higher education has been questioned. Simultaneously, the quality assessment system in Japanese higher education has been called fragmented. The Course Experience Questionnaire (CEQ) is recognised as a statically reliable and valid tool for assessing the efficacy of courses and is used in higher education in many countries around the world including Australia and the UK. Therefore, there is potential for its use in Japanese institutions. However, it is based on Western concepts of student learner theories. Confucian values influence Japanese education. Therefore, the extent to which the CEQ could be applicable for use in Japanese higher education requires examining. However, this remains largely unexplored. In this paper first, Japanese academia is examined using two constructs: 1. Hofstede?s cultural dimensions, and 2. a Confucian framework. The findings are then used to examine concepts within the CEQ, to unearth their applicability within Japanese education. This study reveals there are potentially complex ramifications related to implementing the CEQ as a tool for measurement in Japanese higher education. Further research into student learner theories in a Japanese context is recommended to find a way forward for global assessment in higher education.
I20|Fostering the Cultural Identity in Non-formal Art Education|Historically, Lithuania is a multicultural country, where many nations ? Lithuanians, Jews, Russians, Poles, Ukrainians and others ? have beautifully lived together from ancient times. In the face of globalization and migration of nations, a two-way issue arises: how to maintain our own cultural identity and heritage, and how to enrich it, by adopting traditions and customs of other nations. At the same time, it is important to grasp the experience of these issues in neighbouring countries.The aim of the research ? to reveal the approach of young people, who are involved in the artistic activities of non-formal education, towards their cultural identity. This aim dictates research questions: how do young people describe the notion of cultural identity? are they prepared for the integration of cultural heritage of other nations in their artistic activities? what is the extent to which ethnic music and folk art are relevant in the context of their cultural identity today?The theoretical analysis involved the examination of the scientific literature and documents. The empirical research was carried out using questionnaires and interviews. Qualitative research was conducted in 2015-2018.The questionnaire survey (with opened questions) was performed in higher education schools in Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and Ukraine in the processes of non-formal activities (clubs for fine art activities, musical ethno-cultural ensembles). The total sample consisted of 43 informants. The qualitative content analysis was applied processing the accumulated data.Main results show that despite the fact that young people understand very differently the concept of cultural identity, many of them very much appreciate their traditions and ethno-culture. At the same time, they say they want to learn more about other cultures, people of other nations, their art. They highlight the fact, that the multicultural experience and knowledge of ethnic culture makes it possible to be more tolerant for ethnic and cultural differences.
I20|Ethno-cultural education: intercultural and social integration of national minorities|"Multicultural coherence in Lithuania as in all EU is still an aspiration, and its fostering is particularly actual in the face of the ""new movement of nations"", i.e. with the growing influx of immigrants from different countries and in the context of strengthening of nationalism.As a rule, national minorities remain loyal to the country they live in, however, if they lose their loyalty for a variety of reasons (national and social exclusion, unsatisfactory self-expression needs in the cultural context, etc.) this could have very serious consequences even for the survival of the whole state. Fostering the ethnic culture of ethnic minorities (especially in early age), the search for contact points with the culture of the country in which they live, and intensive communication with the local community ? these could be the factors that correct strained socio-cultural or even political situations. Promoters of the cultural heritage emphasize that the opening up of cultural values to the rest of the world, the preservation of ethno-culture, does not encourage cultural closure, and it is a completely opposite phenomenon to nationalism, chauvinism, fundamentalism. The future of human civilization is multicultural diversity and the cultivation of cultural dialogues.The aim of the research ? to reveal the music and art teachers? approach, who are involved in art activities (preschool education) of children of national minorities, towards their ethno-cultural education. This aim is connected with the research questions: do children of national minorities have the need to cherish their ethno-culture; how do they adopt the ethno-culture of the country they live; how do the parents react to the integration of their children into ethno-cultural activities, which are connected with the country they live and with their own nationality; how could the ethno-cultural education interact with the social integration?The theoretical analysis involved the scientific literature and documents, the empirical research was carried out using interviews. Qualitative research was conducted in 2018.The interviews were performed with the music and art teachers of preschool education from Lithuania and Norway. The total sample consisted of 20 informants. The qualitative content analysis was applied processing the accumulated data.Main results show that that appropriate music and art ethno-cultural activities adapted for education of preschool children could have positive influence on the social integration of children of national minorities in the country in which they live and to strengthen intercultural dialogue."
I20|Parental Behaviour As Correlates Of Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders Among Normal Children: Implications For Positive Mental Health|In the family set up, parents continue to be the caregivers and playmates during the childhood and pre-adolescent stages. During these stages, parents also become more concerned with teaching children how to behave (or how not to behave) in various situations. At these stages, the need for parents to manage the children?s budding autonomy in the hope of instilling a sense of social propriety and self-control while taking care not to undermine his curiosity, initiative and feeling of personal competence becomes very critical. Achieving emotional competence is very crucial to children?s social competence, their ability to achieve personal goals in social interaction while continuing to maintain positive relationship with others. This study employed a descriptive research design to investigate parental child rearing behaviours as correlates of anxiety related emotional disorder among normal children. The sample consists of 780 school children with the age range of 7 ? 10 years who were randomly selected from twenty primary schools in Ondo State, Nigeria. The instrument for data collection was a questionnaire consisting of three sections A, B and C. Section A contained items on the children?s bio-data (Age, School, Sex and caregiver). However, only children living with their biological parents were used for the study. Section B dealt with the parental child rearing behaviours with a 40 item likert type scale. The response formats range from Never=1. Rarely=2, Sometimes=3, Often=4, and Almost always=5. This section was designed to provide profile of parent?s behaviours toward their children with important domains of their involvement, being positive, monitoring, consistency in discipline and corporal punishment. Section C contain 20 items bothering on the perceived anxiety by the children based on the domain of: separation anxiety, social and specific phobia, panic anxiety and generalized anxiety. Scoring ranged from never=1, sometimes=2, often=3, and always=4.The findings revealed among others that there is a significant relationship between parental inconsistent discipline (Fcal=8.488>Ftab=3.86), corporal punishment (Fcal=11.771>Ftab=3.86) and child anxiety. However there was no significant relationship between parental involvement (Fcal=0.126>Ftab=3.86), positive parenting (Fcal=2.050>Ftab=3.86), poor parental monitoring (Fcal=2.101>Ftab=3.86) and children anxiety disorder.Parents were thereafter counselled on appropriate child rearing practices for positive parent-child relationship and positive mental health.
I20|Dialogue of cultures in higher education|Internationalisation of higher education is not a new phenomenon. It has existed since the foundation of universities due to the international character of knowledge and the intent to be involved in the educational processes in the world. For decades, with the rise of globalisation the internationalisation of universities has been of growing importance and in consequence Hungarian institutions must face the challenges when foreign students are found in several courses, Hungarian students go abroad to widen their knowledge and outgoing and incoming professors and lecturers can be seen at universities. It means that several cultures can be found at institutions and cross-cultural issues are a key factor. This paper puts the examination in context by outlining the historical background of internationalisation of universities in Hungary, and then it describes the present situation focusing on the regulations determining the international process. This paper looks at intercultural interaction issues and then summarises the differences in behaviour, attitudes and norms. Attitudes of individuals with different cultural backgrounds are of critical importance to the outcomes of the interaction and are a basis for the relationship we form with others. These attitudes of individuals or groups of individuals are shaped, in large part, by prior experiences, and the socialization process, i.e. by culture. The findings of this study prove that culture also influences people?s way of thinking and behaving and result in different understanding toward vision and purposes of universities.
I20|International students? use of technology and the implications for pedagogy: A case study|The pervasiveness of digital technology in all aspects of society generally, has raised concerns in the higher education sector as to the implications for pedagogy especially with the exponential influx of Gen Y students (those coming of age between 1998 and 2006) whose use of such technology is already a seamless part of their daily lives. Understandably, their expectation may well be that such technology will also be embedded in their academic lives as undergraduates and later as postgraduates. On the other hand, pressures on the universities ? cost-effectiveness, increasing diversity and volume of the student body ? are making educational technology appear a ready solution, if not panacea. In the midst of such an academic landscape, international students have their own specific challenges in adapting to the western style, English-language-based Higher Education (HE) environment. This paper aims to investigate international students studying in a commercially operated pathway program at a Sydney-based university and their relationship to technology against the current challenges of using technology to facilitate academic achievement. Key areas of focus include: the disconnect between digital exposure and digital literacy, the use of online tools such as e-dictionaries and students? attitudes to e-learning. Pedagogical implications are explored.
I20|Revisiting the Effect of Teaching of Learning Strategies on Academic Achievement: A Meta-Analysis of the Findings|The main purpose of this study was to determine the effect of teaching of learning strategies on students? academic achievement. In this research, meta-analysis method was adopted to determine the effect of teaching of learning strategies on students? academic achievement and the studies in relation with the subject carried out in Turkey were combined. The effect sizes of the studies included in the meta-analysis were compared in regard of instructional level, course type, and publication type variables. This meta-analysis sought an answer to the problem statement of ?What kind of effect does teaching of learning strategies have on students? academic achievement levels?? Some certain criteria were taken into consideration to include the studies in the meta-analysis. According to the selected criteria, the experimental studies (N = 11) were included in the research. At the end of the research, it was concluded that teaching of learning strategies had a moderate effect size (d = 0.818) on students? academic achievement levels. Besides, while the effect sizes obtained as a result of the meta-analysis were compared with respect to instructional level, course type, publication type variables, it was revealed that there were significant differences in regard of the effect sizes of the studies with respect to all variables in the research.
I20|Suicidal Ideation and Burnout among University students|Suicide is major cause of premature death all over the world. The current study was aimed to find out the prevalence rate of suicidal ideation and its relationship with burnout among Pakistani college students. Data was collected through Rudd?s Suicidal ideation Scale (Rudd, 1989) and Indigenous Burnout scale (Ijaz & Khan, 2012). A total of 1500 students from three cities including Lahore, Rawalpindi and Islamabad were included. Data was sampled through a subtype of cluster sampling technique ?Area Probability Sampling Technique?. The study indicated high level of suicidal ideation and burnout among students. The results also revealed that females experience more suicidal ideation and burnout as compared to males. The results also illustrated that students of Islamabad experience more burnout and suicidal ideation i.e 53.60 % , 4.05% respectively as compare to students of Lahore i.e 48.98%, 3.29% and Rawalpindi i.e 47.74% , 3,43 % respectively Regression analyses shows that burnout significantly predicted suicide. Identifying prevalence rate of suicidal ideation and burnout will enable institutions to provide more focused support and interventions for at risk students.
I20|A Survey On The Use Of Humanoid Robots With Multilingual Interaction Ability In Foreign Language Teaching|Studies show that humanoid robots can be quite useful for many teaching goals since they can be updated with the most current teaching techniques and knowledge, teach one-on-one, and do not get tired no matter how many mistakes students make. Although learning a foreign language is harder for adults, some students struggle to learn a foreign language, too. However, with their distinct features, humanoid robots with multilingual interaction ability can help students learn a foreign language. In this study, we review state-of-the-art humanoid robots that are used in foreign language teaching, present novel approaches in the roles of humanoid robots used for foreign language teaching, investigate research challenges, and state future research directions.
I20|Assistive Technology Tools For Children With Learning Disabilities|Children with learning disabilities are generally behind their age related peers in acquiring new skills required for daily activities and academic learning. Children with learning disabilities can learn and develop new skills, but compared to other children of the same age, they possibly need more time and practice. It has been shown that assistive technology tools are efficient ways to assist and teach children with different types of learning difficulties. In this study, state-of-the-art assistive technology tools that can be used for various educational goals are reviewed, novel approaches in this field are presented, and finally research challenges and future directions are reported.
I20|A comparative assessment of delivery methods of mathematics and technology enhanced learning|This paper is concerned with the delivery methods of mathematics in engineering subjects and the use of technology enhanced learning in higher education systems. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there is a lack of interest in mathematical modules by engineering students in recent years, a trend that appears to be growing. At the same time, many universities have invested heavily in e-learning tools in an effort to engage students. This report aims to investigate whether these tools are a support or barrier when teaching mathematics to engineering students, and to examine if they have had any effect on student engagement. The report also investigates student opinions of technology enhanced learning versus traditional methods of teaching.
I20|A competence development approach for flexible, autonomous and self-directed development of education in technology contexts|The vocational education system is affected by the speed of technology and vocational change. Challenges arise for engineering-technology teachers to keep up with the creation of new education. In an ever faster cycle of development and delivery, engineering-technology teachers are to be educated to acquire domain knowledge for new vocational tasks and transform this into relevant learning tasks for students. To contribute to such engineering-technology teacher challenge, the Teacher Training Institute of Fontys University of Applied Sciences designed a competence development approach for self-directed development of competence in the didactisation of new vocational tasks in technology contexts. The approach described in this paper is based on the modelling of knowledge for new vocational tasks and the didactisation of that knowledge through generic technology and engineering concepts, into meaningful learning activities for students. It is the premise of reuse of technology concepts and didactics, transferable across technology contexts, which is important to the flexible development and delivery of new education. The paper describes how the competence development approach is designed, implemented and evaluated at Fontys University of Applied Sciences, Technical Teacher Education Institute.
I20|Do Human Capital Decisions Respond to the Returns to Education? Evidence from DACA|"This paper studies human capital responses to the availability of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which provides temporary work authorization and deferral from deportation for undocumented, high-school-educated youth. We use a sample of young adults that migrated to the U.S. as children to implement a difference-in-differences design that compares non-citizen immigrants (""eligible"") to citizen immigrants (""ineligible"") over time. We find that DACA significantly increased high school attendance and high school graduation rates, reducing the citizen-noncitizen gap in graduation by 40%. We also find positive, though imprecise, impacts on college attendance."
I20|The Long-Run Effects of Disruptive Peers|A large and growing literature has documented the importance of peer effects in education. However, there is relatively little evidence on the long-run educational and labor market consequences of childhood peers. We examine this question by linking administrative data on elementary school students to subsequent test scores, college attendance and completion, and earnings. To distinguish the effect of peers from confounding factors, we exploit the population variation in the proportion of children from families linked to domestic violence, who have been shown to disrupt contemporaneous behavior and learning. Results show that exposure to a disruptive peer in classes of 25 during elementary school reduces earnings at age 24 to 28 by 3 percent. We estimate that differential exposure to children linked to domestic violence explains 5 percent of the rich-poor earnings gap in our data, and that each year of exposure to a disruptive peer reduces the present discounted value of classmates' future earnings by $80,000.
I20|In God We Learn? The Universal Messages of Religions, their Context-Specific Effects, and the role of Minority Status|We test whether major religious denominations have a uniform impact on education across the world. Using individual data from the World Values Survey for 77 countries, we find that no denomination consistently influences education and, in fact, for each denomination we study there are countries where its impact is significantly positive, significantly negative, or statistically insignificant. To explain this unexpected result, we relate our first finding to minority status and find that denominations that are a minority in a country have a positive effect on the level of education of their followers in that country. Both findings uphold a series of robustness checks, including changing the definition of minority religions, excluding outliers, and changing the measure of education.
I20|Instructional leadership and academic performance: Eastern Cape educators’ perceptions and quantitative evidence|This study aims to explore the experiences and perceptions of school educators on how school principals monitor curriculum delivery. It investigates the principal-agent problem and accountability in education in the Eastern Cape. Two types of data are used: qualitative data from interviews with school principals and teachers, and quantitative data from an international educational evaluation. The interview data were collected in 2015 at selected primary schools within three Eastern Cape education districts. Respondents at each school included the school principal and three foundation phase teachers. To triangulate findings from interviews, the association between school leadership and student academic scores in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2015 dataset was examined for both Grade 5 and 9. The association between measures of instructional leadership (e.g. teachers’ understanding of curricular goals and teachers’ degree of success in implementing curricular goals) and student scores for mathematics and science was explored using linear probability models. Findings confirm the existence of the principal-agent problem in education, since many school respondents indicated that curriculum delivery monitoring was not conducted as expected. From the multivariate analysis, instructional leadership variables, such as teachers’ understanding of curricular goals and teachers’ degree of success in implementing the curriculum appear as important correlates of student achievement, though significance differs according to level of schooling and whether the questions were answered by principals or teachers. Policy implications point to a need to hire, empower and support principals to create a culture of accountability in schools.
I20|How to improve teaching practice? Experimental comparison of centralized training and in-classroom coaching|We experimentally compare two modes of in-service professional development for South African public primary school teachers. In both programs teachers received the same learning material and daily lesson plans, aligned to the official home language literacy curriculum. Pupils exposed to two years of the program improved their reading proficiency by 0.12 standard deviations if their teachers received centralized training, compared to 0.24 if their teachers received in-class coaching. Classroom observations reveal that teachers were more likely to split pupils into smaller reading groups, which enabled individualized attention and more opportunities to practice reading. Results vary by class size and baseline pupil reading proficiency.
I20|Demand for education in the five countries of the South African Customs Union – Projections and implications|Demand for education rises with the level of economic development and over time. Censuses and surveys provide an approximation of realized demand for education for different birth cohorts over a long time span across countries and grades. Of the five SACU countries, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland, all except Namibia have already achieved school participation rates above 90% up to age 14. However, grade achievement is not equally impressive, due to high repetition. The projections of grade completion reported here incorporate UN Population Division demographic projections and assume that completion rates will asymptotically approach an upper limit. Assuming that repetition will stabilize allows estimation of enrolment. Future enrolment growth will slow due to slower growth of the school-aged population and because enrolment is already high. Demand for new teachers, however, should slow less, as the age structure of the current teaching personnel implies high levels of retirement. Tertiary enrolment will be constrained by the supply of tertiary places. To meet young people’s rising labor market expectations requires strong economic growth and labor absorption, improved education quality, and a focus on teaching appropriate skills. International tests show that education quality is weak in the SACU countries. Providing specialized tertiary and technical training for the four small SACU economies will require collaborative efforts.
I20|Biology and the Gender Gap in Educational Performance: The Role of Prenatal Testosterone in Test Scores|This paper explores the contribution of biological factors in explaining gender differences in educational performance, with a particular focus on the role of prenatal testosterone. We exploit the fact that prenatal testosterone is hypothesized to transfer in-utero from a male twin to his twin sibling causing exogenous variation in exposure to prenatal testosterone in twins. By using Dutch administrative data and controlling for potential socialization effects, we find that girls with a twin brother score 7% of a standard deviation lower on math compared to girls with a twin sister. Adherence to traditional gender norms can explain this finding, implying that our results are not just driven by biology but materialize depending on environmental factors.
I20|A Distributional Analysis of Upper Secondary School Performance|We examine the relationship between the distribution of upper secondary school performance and a range of individual and school level characteristics using unconditional quantile regression methods and data from Ireland. We find that determinants such as social class, maternal unemployment, extra private tuition, and working part-time have differential effects for low and high ability students and that important insights are lost by focusing on the conditional mean. The implication is that while certain factors can impact on whether or not a student is likely to proceed to higher education, other factors may affect where students go and what they study.

I20|Educación artística, elección de bachillerato y capacidades. Efecto de la creación del bachillerato artístico en la matrícula universitaria|This paper evaluates the effects of a high school curriculum reform on students' probability to choose Arts as college major. The reform was introduced in 2006 and involved, among other things, the creation of the Art and Expression track in the last two years of the upper secondary level, incorporating for the first time multi-artistic education as a high school diploma. Based on administrative data covering students from the Social and Artistic Area (ASYA, in Spanish) of the Universidad de la República (UdelaR) between 2004 and 2016, the empirical analysis is carried out by applying a difference-in-differences model. After controlling for sex, age and year of graduation from high school as well as place of residence, the results show that the reform increased the probability of choosing a major in Arts by 8.98 pp., conditional on choosing a free entry career of the ASYA, in students who finished public day-time high school between 2004 and 2010. Furthermore, being a woman reduces the impact of the reform, while finishing the secondary school in Montevideo Metropolitan Area increases it. The age of graduation from high school does not have significant effects on the studied probability. Based on Amartya Sen’s (1985) Capabilities Approach and Akerlof and Kranton’s (2000, 2002) Identity Economics, this research constitutes a first approach to the decision making process of students who chose arts in high school to later pursue university artistic formation. In this sense, the contribution to national production on educational evaluation, in general, and to the capabilities and identity literature applied to Uruguay, in particular, stands out.
I20|The effect of grade retention on secondary school performance: Evidence from a natural experiment|We study the effects of grade retention on secondary school performance by considering a change in Colombia’s educative legislation. In 2010, the rule that forced schools to retain up to a 5% of students was abolished. Exploiting variation in schools’ retention rates in a difference-in-differences framework, we find that retained (marginally non-retained) students improve (decline) their performance on language but not on math test scores. We suggest the school’s position in the retention distribution, and the proportion of inexperienced teachers in the classroom, can be the mechanisms by which the marginally decreasing returns of grade retention are determined.

I20|Human development thresholds for inclusive mobile banking in developing countries|This study assesses human development thresholds at which mobile banking mitigates poverty and inequality in 93 developing countries for the year 2011. Mobile banking entails: ‘mobile used to pay bills’ and ‘mobile used to receive/send money’, while the modifying policy indicator is the human development index (HDI). The empirical evidence is based on interactive quantile regressions. A summary of the findings shows that with increasing human development: (i) ‘mobiles used to pay bills’ contribute to reducing inequality in countries at the bottom and top ends of the inequality distribution, while (ii) ‘mobiles used to receive/send money’ have an appealing role in promoting inclusive development in all poverty distributions, with the exception of the top-end or 90th decile. The modifying thresholds of the HDI vary from 0.542 to 0.632 and 0.333 to 0.705 in inequality and poverty specifications, respectively. The relevance of the findings is discussed in light of the current transition from Millennium Development Goals to Sustainable Development Goals.
I20|Talent Discovery, Layoff Risk and Unemployment Insurance|In talent-intensive jobs, workers’quality is revealed by their performance. This enhances productivity and earnings, but also increases layoff risk.Firms cannot insure workers against this risk if they compete fiercely for talent. In this case, the more risk-averse workers will choose less quality-revealing jobs. This lowers expected productivity and salaries. Public unemployment insurance corrects this inefficiency, enhancing employment in talent-sensitive industries and investment in education. The hypothesis that the generosity of unemployment insurance should be positively correlated with the share of workers in talent-sensitive industries is consistent with international and U.S. evidence.
I20|How Much Does It Cost to Complete Medical School? Evidence from Cost Analysis of Kabul Medical School|Background: Efficient and effective investments in developing human resources for health are essential. Kabul Medical University, a public institution, plays a pivotal role in producing and supporting high quality health workforce for Afghanistan’s health system. This report describes the first ever costing exercise of Kabul Medical University (KMU). The results intend to assist university managers and government to improve the efficiency of their programs by understanding the various costs associated with specific activities and faculties within the university. Methodology: Step-down Cost Accounting approach was used for generating costs and unit costs. Two cost centers were identified for apportioning costs: 1) Support Cost Center and 2) Service Cost Center. A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet was used to enter cost data and obtain estimations. Data were collected by HEFD over a period of 1.5 months in collaboration with KMU management. Findings: In 1390 (March 2011 – March 2012), the total cost of all faculties at KMU is $3,436,995 USD. The cost per student for each faculty include: $18,476 USD for Curative; $5,534 USD for Nursing; $1,199 USD for Public Health; and $16,543 USD for Stomatology. The largest proportion of costs for supporting cost center activities are attributed to administrative and supportive staff (26.1%), trainings (31.2%), and teaching hospitals (21.6%). The distribution of costs among teaching staff is highest among the latter classes. Conclusions: Based on this study, the majority of costs for 1390 (2012) went to the Curative faculty for services. Additionally, the majority of support costs went to training 19 teaching staff (donor supported) and salaries for administration and supportive staff. The Nursing and Stomatology faculties are largely skewed towards female students. At the same time, the proportion of women in Curative faculty is very low given the needs of female health workers, especially doctors, in the health sector. As the government moves towards a model of self-sustained financing, stronger financial accounting mechanisms are needed to ensure the appropriate use of public funds. This report serves as a baseline for KMU costs, which can now be monitored in the future in light of limited resources.
I20|Drivers of Student Performance: Evidence from Higher Secondary Public Schools in Delhi|We examine the role of teachers and students in the formation of test scores at the higher secondary level (grade 12) in public schools in Delhi, India. Using the value added approach, we find substantial variation in teacher and student quality within schools: over the period spanning grades 11 and 12, being taught by a one standard deviation better than average teacher raises test scores by 0.373 standard deviation; and being a one standard deviation better than average student raises it by 0.799 standard deviation. Being permanent (tenured) positively predicts teacher effectiveness, while educational qualifications, training, experience and personality traits have no predictive power. Relative to families where only fathers earn, those where both parents earn negatively predict student effectiveness, while religion, caste and parents' education have no predictive power.

I20|Career expectations of undergraduate and graduate students at agricultural universities in Uzbekistan|Since national independence, the government of Uzbekistan has been paying attention to developing its education system, including agriculture. A number of regulations have been adopted in order to address the problems in education. Among these, the Law on Education (1997) and the National Training Programme (1997) are the main two regulations adopted to address issues related to the national educational system of Uzbekistan. Nevertheless, a problem of a lack of qualified agricultural personnel in rural areas still exists, and the majority of young cadres try to find jobs in cities. This analytical study aims to analyze the motivation, aspirations, and career expectations of undergraduate and graduate students of Samarkand Agricultural Institute. In the first part of the analytical study, we review the agricultural education system and underlying policies in Uzbekistan by dividing them into pre- and post-independence periods. In the second part, we discuss the survey results of 400 undergraduate and 50 graduate students from Samarkand Agricultural Institute. The results reveal that half of observed students did not make a career choice yet and face uncertainties in employment decisions. Compared with undergraduate students, the share of graduate students wishing to continue their education (doing a PhD) was higher. The following recommendations are given: (i) agricultural vocational/professional colleges and agricultural universities should collaborate in teaching students. Also, college and university staff members should cooperate with industries and farmers to develop employment opportunities for graduates in rural areas. (ii) Economic incentives based on higher wages/salaries are very important to attract more qualified specialists to rural areas, hence policymakers should consider this issue in a broader way. Developing extension service organizations can be an option where qualified staff will be needed. Availability of good rural infrastructure for graduates from agricultural universities can encourage students to stay in rural areas.
I20|A method for measuring detailed demand for workers' competences|There is an increasing need for analysing the demand for skills in the labour market. While most studies aggregate skills in groups or use available proxies for them, the authors analyse the demand by employers for individual competences. Such an analysis better reflects reality because companies usually require job candidates to have particular competences, rather than generally defined groups of skills. However, no method exists to analyse on a large scale which competences are required by employers. At a detailed level, there are hundreds of competences; thus, this demand cannot be measured in a sample survey. The authors propose a method for conducting a continuous and efficient analysis of the demand for competences of prospective employees. The method involves collecting online job offers and analysing them with data mining and text analysis tools. The authors use this method to analyse transversal competences in the Polish labour market. Their findings indicate that companies typically required only certain competences-especially 'language and communication competences'-while neglecting others. The number of job candidate requirements was counter-cyclical. However, the structure of the competences demanded did not change during the analysed period.
I20|Better Together? Social Networks in Truancy and the Targeting of Treatment|Truancy correlates with many risky behaviors and adverse outcomes. We use detailed administrative data on by-class absences to construct social networks based on students who miss class together. We simulate these networks and use permutation tests to show that certain students systematically coordinate their absences. Leveraging a parent-information intervention on student absences, we find spillover effects from treated students onto peers in their network. We show that an optimal-targeting algorithm that incorporates machine-learning techniques to identify heterogeneous effects, as well as the direct effects and spillover effects, could further improve the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the intervention subject to a budget constraint.
I20|The effects of computers and acquired skills on earnings, employment and college enrollment: Evidence from a field experiment and California UI earnings records|This paper provides the first evidence on the earnings, employment and college enrollment effects of computers and acquired skills from a randomized controlled trial providing computers to entering college students. We matched confidential administrative data from California Employment Development Department (EDD)/Unemployment Insurance (UI) system earnings records, the California Community College system, and the National Student Clearinghouse to all study participants for seven years after the random provision of computers. The experiment does not provide evidence that computer skills have short- or medium-run effects on earnings. These null effects are found along both the extensive and intensive margins of earnings (although the estimates are not precise). We also do not find evidence of positive or negative effects on college enrollment. A non-experimental analysis of CPS data reveals large, positive and statistically significant relationships between home computers, and earnings, employment and college enrollment, raising concerns about selection bias in non-experimental studies.
I20|Social Interactions, Mechanisms, and Equilibrium: Evidence from a Model of Study Time and Academic Achievement|We develop and estimate a model of student study time on a social network. The model is designed to exploit unique data collected in the Berea Panel Study. Study time data allow us to quantify an intuitive mechanism for academic social interactions: own study time may depend on friend study time in a heterogeneous manner. Social network data allow us to embed study time and resulting academic achievement in an estimable equilibrium framework. We develop a specification test that exploits the equilibrium nature of social interactions and use it to show that novel study propensity measures mitigate econometric endogeneity concerns.
I20|Entry Through the Narrow Door: The Costs of Just Failing High Stakes Exams|In many countries, important thresholds in examinations act as a gateway to higher levels of education and/or good employment prospects. This paper examines the consequences of just failing a key high stakes national examination in English taken at the end of compulsory schooling in England. It uses unique administrative data to show that students of the same ability have significantly different educational trajectories depending on whether or not they just pass or fail this exam. Three years later, students who just fail to achieve the required threshold have a lower probability of entering an upper-secondary high-level academic or vocational track and of starting tertiary education. Those who fail to pass the threshold are also more likely to drop out of education by age 18, without some form of employment. The moderately high effects of just passing or failing to pass the threshold in this high stakes exam are therefore a source of educational inequality with high potential long-term consequences for those affected.
I20|Growing Up in Ethnic Enclaves: Language Proficiency and Educational Attainment of Immigrant Children|Does a high regional concentration of immigrants of the same ethnicity affect immigrant children\'s acquisition of host-country language skills and educational attainment? We exploit the exogenous placement of guest workers from five ethnicities across German regions during the 1960s and 1970s in a model with region and ethnicity fixed effects. Our results indicate that exposure to a higher own-ethnic concentration impairs immigrant children\'s host-country language proficiency and increases school dropout. A key mediating factor for this effect is parents\' lower speaking proficiency in the host-country language, whereas inter-ethnic contacts with natives and economic conditions do not play a role.
I20|Can Online Surveys Represent the Entire Population?|"A general concern with the representativeness of online surveys is that they exclude the ""offline"" population that does not use the internet. We run a large-scale opinion survey with (1) onliners in web mode, (2) offliners in face-to-face mode, and (3) onliners in face-to-face mode. We find marked response differences between onliners and offliners in the mixed-mode setting (1 vs. 2). Response differences between onliners and offliners in the same face-to-face mode (2 vs. 3) disappear when controlling for background characteristics, indicating mode effects rather than unobserved population differences. Differences in background characteristics of onliners in the two modes (1 vs. 3) indicate that mode effects partly reflect sampling differences. In our setting, re-weighting online-survey observations appears a pragmatic solution when aiming at representativeness for the entire population."
I20|Heat and Learning|We provide the first evidence that cumulative heat exposure inhibits cognitive skill development and that school air conditioning can mitigate this effect. Student fixed effects models using 10 million PSAT-takers show that hotter school days in the year prior to the test reduce learning, with extreme heat being particularly damaging and larger effects for low income and minority students. Weekend and summer heat has little impact and the effect is not explained by pollution or local economic shocks, suggesting heat directly reduces the productivity of learning inputs. New data providing the first measures of school-level air conditioning penetration across the US suggest such infrastructure almost entirely offsets these effects. Without air conditioning, each 1°F increase in school year temperature reduces the amount learned that year by one percent. Our estimates imply that the benefits of school air conditioning likely outweigh the costs in most of the US, particularly given future predicted climate change.
I20|Birth Order Effects and Educational Achievement in the Developing World|Studies on the role of birth order in educational achievement in developing countries have yielded contradictory findings. This study uses unique and novel data on 4,362 siblings living in alternative care families in 54 countries. Results suggest negative birth order effects among biological siblings, implying inferior outcomes for laterborns. A second analysis offers reasons for why previous studies might have found contradictory results. Three sources of heterogeneity are surveyed. Extreme hardship, parental gender preferences, and tutoring between siblings are identified as moderators of birth order effects. The findings can inform development interventions by helping to prioritize individuals in highest need.
I20|Doping to Underperform: The Impact of Coffee Consumption on Test Scores|We report results of an experiment that randomly distributed coffee and an herbal infusion with no caffeine to students before a non-experimental midterm (ie: with real incentives). Coffee consumption decreases test scores. This is driven by students who are not habituated to consume coffee and who self-report feeling nervous in similar tests. Regular coffee drinkers do not seem to benefit or lose from coffee consumption except if they are coffee-deprived the day of the exam (in which case they perform worse, consistent with the withdrawal reversal hypothesis).
I20|Impactos de corto plazo del programa extracurricular de refuerzo escolar “Con Las Manos” en un colegio de Bogotá|En este trabajo se evalúan los impactos de corto plazo de un programa de refuerzo extracurricular de matemáticas y aprendizaje basado en proyectos, denominado “Con Las Manos”, sobre la habilidad cognitiva, la regulación emocional y la función ejecutiva de estudiantes de quinto de primaria de un colegio de Bogotá. La evaluación se basa en una asignación aleatoria a nivel de estudiante. Se tienen en cuenta los efectos indirectos del programa a través de pares tratados en la red de cada estudiante. A tan sólo 4 meses de iniciado el programa, se encuentra un impacto positivo de 0,3 desviaciones estándar (DE) sobre la habilidad matemática de los estudiantes, pero un impacto negativo de 0,28 DE sobre su regulación emocional.
I20|Improving childcare quality at scale: the effects of “From Zero to Forever”|The focus in developing countries has shifted from increasing access to early childhood education to improving its quality. However, large scale studies of childcare quality improvement are scarce. In this paper we study the immediate and medium-term effects of a large-scale expansion of integrated early education services on child development, by analyzing the expansion of the Colombian national early childhood strategy known as “From Zero to Forever” between 2011 and 2013. The results indicate that the increased access to enhanced early education had a large immediate effect on language that still persists five years into the intervention.
I20|Early Stimulation and Nutrition: The Impacts of a Scalable Intervention|This paper evaluates the effects of the implementation of a structured early stimulation curriculum combined with a nutritional intervention through public large-scale parenting support services for vulnerable families in rural Colombia, known as FAMI, using a clustered randomized controlled trial. We randomly assigned 87 towns in rural areas to treatment and control and 1,460 children younger than 1 year of age were assessed at baseline. The interventions were also complemented with training, supervision and coaching of FAMI program facilitators. We assessed program effects on children’s nutritional status, and on cognitive and socio-emotional development; as well as on parental practices. The interventions had a positive and significant effect on a cognitive development factor based on the Bayley-III of 0.15 standard deviations. We also report a reduction of 5.8 percentage points in the fraction of children whose height-for-age is below -1 standard deviation. We do not find any effects on socio-emotional development. We report positive and statistically significant effects on the quality of the home environment (0.34 SD).
I20|Center-Based Care for Infants and Toddlers: The aeioTU Randomized Trial|Extensive research has shown comprehensive early intervention can improve the developmental outcomes of disadvantaged children. However, little is known about the effectiveness of center-based programs for infants and toddlers; relatively rare in the developing world and typically of low quality. This paper reports effects from a randomized trial of a center-based early care intervention on infants and toddlers in two communities in northern Colombia. Just eight months into the program results indicate large positive effects on language, cognitive development and overall development, with girls benefitting the most. No effects were observed for nutritional outcomes, socio-emotional development or the home environment.
I20|¿Quiénes son los docentes en Colombia? Características generales y brechas regionales|Este documento presenta una descripción detallada de los docentes del sector oficial en Colombia, haciendo especial énfasis en las marcadas brechas regionales. El análisis se basa en registros oficiales del Ministerio de Educación Nacional, que incluyen información detallada de todos los docentes oficiales del país. Además, se miden las habilidades académicas de los docentes a través de los puntajes que estos obtuvieron en las pruebas SABER 11, cuando eran estudiantes de bachillerato. Los resultados indican que, así como hay importantes diferencias entre instituciones educativas urbanas y rurales, aquellas ubicadas en municipios pequeños (no certificados) y regiones periféricas también enfrentan grandes dificultades para atraer y retener buenos docentes. Esto se ve reflejado tanto en la menor formación y las bajas habilidades académicas de los docentes como en la alta provisionalidad de la planta. Estas características están, a su vez, fuertemente correlacionadas con el desempeño de los alumnos en todos los niveles. **** ABSTRACT: This paper presents a comprehensive description of public school teachers in Colombia, with a particular emphasis on regional gaps. Our analysis is based on administrative records from the Ministry of Education, which contain detailed information on all public school teachers in the country. Additionally, we match teachers' records to the high school national exit exam (SABER 11) to obtain a measure of their academic skills. Results indicate that, while urbanrural gaps are important, they are not the only sources of regional inequality. Schools located in small (uncertified) municipalities and peripheral regions also face great difficulties to attract and retain highly skilled teachers. This is reflected in the teachers' educational attainment and test scores, and also in the share of provisional appointments. These characteristics are, in turn, strongly correlated with students' performance at all levels.
I20|Do paid teacher trainee programs lead to additional teachers in secondary education? A Regression Discontinuity Analysis|This paper evaluates the quantitative effects of two teacher traineeships that were implemented in the Netherlands to address shortages of fully qualified teachers in secondary education. Applying a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we estimate the effects of being selected to participate in one of the traineeships. We find no significant local average treatment effects of being selected on the probabilities of enrolling into academic teacher training, obtaining a full teaching qualification, and on working in education, although the point estimates are positive for the first two outcome variables. The lack of significant results may partially be due to our small sample size. However, t he specific design of the traineeship programs, that required candidates to find a school by themselves, may also contribute to these findings.
I20|Teacher effectiveness and classroom composition|This paper studies how the effectiveness of teachers varies by classroom composition. We combine random assignment of teachers to classrooms with rich measures of teacher effectiveness based on a popular observational protocol, Framework for Teaching, to overcome key endogeneity concerns related to measurement and matching. We find that complementarities between classroom composition and teaching practice play a significant role in student achievement. We identify two main mechanisms that are driving this result: 1) negative interactions between challenging and/or student-centered practices and heterogeneity in classroom prior achievement, and 2) positive interactions between classroom management skills and average classroom prior achievement. Our findings illustrate the multidimensional nature of teacher effectiveness and have important implications for prescribing teaching practice and evaluating teachers. Simulations show that teacher rankings change substantially simply from within-school classroom reallocations, suggesting the need for caution when using popular teaching evaluation rubrics in high-stakes settings.
I20|The effect of immigrant peers in vocational schools|This paper provides new evidence on how the presence of immigrant peers in the classroom affects native student achievement. The analysis is based on longitudinal administrative data on two cohorts of vocational training students in Italy's largest region. Vocational training institutions provide the ideal setting for studying these effects because they attract not only disproportionately high shares of immigrants but also the lowest ability native students. We adopt a value added model, and exploit within-school variation both within and across cohorts for identification. Our results show small negative average effects on maths test scores that are larger for low ability native students, strongly non-linear and only observable in classes with a high (top 20%) immigrant concentration. These outcomes are driven by classes with a high average linguistic distance between immigrants and natives, with no apparent additional role played by ethnic diversity.
I20|Le système d’enseignement algérien, entre passé et présent|"The functioning of the Algerian educational system today cannot be understood without taking into account its most distant history and especially the effects of the imposition of the French system during the colonial period. It is indeed less in the numerical weight of the local populations that have been taken over by the French system than in the process of its institutionalization, that the impact of the French school in Algeria is best captured. The history of this imposition was that of a contradictory process of adaptation of the teaching to the specific mode of colonization – this adaptation having always oscillated between assimilationist inclinations and segregationist convictions; this is reflected in the continual search for a type of “apart” education that would have allowed both to control the ""civil society"" and to establish the conditions for not questioning the colonial model. The forms of the implementation process in this respect were many and varied. The national system of education set up with the independence was achieved, in a certain continuity of the French system until the decade 1970-80, at the same time as started a policy of voluntarist Arabization doubled by all-out schooling. Under the effect of rapid and sloppy massification and a policy of Arabization not at all rigorous – answering more to political vested interests than rationally thought and applied – the malfunctions that are emerging show the contradictions and the conflicts between the old and the new brought through the reforms that will take place from the mid-1970s to the years 2000. The issues of teaching languages, such as content and transmitted values, the place of religion, teacher training, pedagogy, will be subject to a more open conflict that is radicalized around the more general purposes and functions of the educational system. This translates into a certain anomie of the education system, which will be bypassed by certain social groups seeking other ways for their children, particularly in private education or in institutions dependent on foreign countries."
I20|Accessing IRS Form 990 Data with Excel|Form990.xlsm is a freely available, standalone, macro-enabled Excel workbook that allows users to easily download and analyze IRS Form 990 tax data for nonprofits. This information is extremely difficult to access in machine-readable format, but the IRS recently made the data available as XML files. Form990.xlsm directly imports data in separate sheets for each institution. This paper demonstrates how to use this tool by analyzing a small sample of private, selective liberal arts colleges. We compare Form 990 data with IPEDS and find substantial agreement, but important differences. Endowments were different by more than 5% in 7 of 46 observations. Student FTEs had a greater than 5% difference in 22 out 46 schools (several were over 20%). Form 990 data offer researchers an alternative to IPEDS that is arguably of higher quality.
I20|Growth, Employment, Poverty and Inequality in Tanzania|This paper shows that in Tanzania, economic growth contributes to job creation and employment opportunities, however, it does very little to curb income inequality. Using official data from various local sources compiled by the National Bureau of Statistics, the paper provides an explanation as to why the creation of wealth and employment opportunities in Tanzania fails to bring the level of poverty to a level roughly comparable to what is found in the region and to reduce inequality between the richer and the poorer segments of society.
I20|Education, Lifelong learning, Inequality and Financial access: Evidence from African countries|This study investigates the role of financial access in modulating the effect of education and lifelong learning on inequality in 48 African countries for the period 1996 to 2014. Lifelong learning is conceived and measured as the combined knowledge gained from primary through tertiary education while the three educational indicators are: primary school enrolment; secondary school enrolment and tertiary school enrolment. Financial development dynamics are measured with financial system deposits (liquid liabilities), financial system activity (credit) and financial system efficiency (deposits/credit). Three measures of inequality are employed notably: the Gini coefficient; the Atkinson index and the Palma ratio. The estimation strategy is based on Generalised Method of Moments. The following findings are established. First, primary school enrolment interacts with all financial channels to exert negative effects on the Gini index. Second, lifelong learning has negative net effects on the Gini index through financial deposit and efficiency channels. Third, for the most part, the other educational levels do not significantly influence inequality through financial access channels. Policy implications are discussed.
I20|Poverty and development in Tanzania|The paper investigates the relationship between development, as measured by the GNI per capita and lived poverty in Tanzania which is measured on the basis of whether and how often respondents go, in the course of one year, without food, water, medical care, cooking fuel and cash income. By using the data collected by Afrobarometer in Tanzania, we are able to create one set of indicators that capture the extension of lived poverty, that is what percentage of the respondents, experiences deprivation, but we also develop a series of indicators that capture the severity of lived poverty, that is how frequently respondents experience this problem. Our statistical analyses reveal that while Tanzanian progress along the developmental path did not have a significant impact on the extension of lived poverty, it made a large and significant contribution to reduce its severity.
I20|Human development thresholds for inclusive mobile banking in developing countries|This study assesses human development thresholds at which mobile banking mitigates poverty and inequality in 93 developing countries for the year 2011. Mobile banking entails: ‘mobile used to pay bills’ and ‘mobile used to receive/send money’, while the modifying policy indicator is the human development index (HDI). The empirical evidence is based on interactive quantile regressions. A summary of the findings shows that with increasing human development: (i) ‘mobiles used to pay bills’ contribute to reducing inequality in countries at the bottom and top ends of the inequality distribution, while (ii) ‘mobiles used to receive/send money’ have an appealing role in promoting inclusive development in all poverty distributions, with the exception of the top-end or 90th decile. The modifying thresholds of the HDI vary from 0.542 to 0.632 and 0.333 to 0.705 in inequality and poverty specifications, respectively. The relevance of the findings is discussed in light of the current transition from Millennium Development Goals to Sustainable Development Goals.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
I20|Recent finance advances in information technology for inclusive development: a systematic review|Abstract The overarching question tackled in this paper is: to what degree has financial development contributed to providing opportunities of human development for those on low-incomes and by which information technology mechanisms? We systematically review about 180 recently published papers to provide recent information technology advances in finance for inclusive development. Retained financial innovations are structured along three themes. They are: (i) the rural-urban divide, (ii) women empowerment and (iii) human capital in terms of skills and training. The financial instruments are articulated with case studies, innovations and investment strategies with particular emphasis, inter alia on: informal finance, microfinance, mobile banking, crowdfunding, microinsurance, Islamic finance, remittances, Payment for Environmental Services (PES) and the Diaspora Investment in Agriculture (DIA) initiative.
I20|â€œThis one is 400 Libyan dinars, this one is 500â€ : Insights from Cognitive Human Capital and Slave Trade|One of the most disturbing contemporary episodes in human history that has been decried globally is the recent Libyan experience of slave trade, where migrants captured end-up being sold as slaves. We contribute to the understanding of this phenomenon by investigating the role of cognitive human capital in slave trade. To this end, we use the historic intelligence and slave trade variables respectively, as the independent and outcome variables of interest. Our findings show a negative relationship between slave trade and cognitive human capital. Hence, slave trade is more apparent when cognitive human capital is low. The Ordinary Least Squares findings are robust to the control for outliers, uncertainty about the model and Tobit regressions. We substantiate why from the perspective of massive sensitisation and education, the non-contemporary relationship between cognitive ability and slave trade established in this study has contemporary practical policy relevance in efforts to stem the tide of clandestine travel to Europe through countries in which clandestine migrants are captured and sold as slaves.

I20|Career expectations of undergraduate and graduate students at agricultural universities in Uzbekistan| Since national independence, the government of Uzbekistan has been paying attention to developing its education system, including agriculture. A number of regulations have been adopted in order to address the problems in education. Among these, the Law on Education (1997) and the National Training Programme (1997) are the main two regulations adopted to address issues related to the national educational system of Uzbekistan. Nevertheless, a problem of a lack of qualified agricultural personnel in rural areas still exists, and the majority of young cadres try to find jobs in cities. This analytical study aims to analyze the motivation, aspirations, and career expectations of undergraduate and graduate students of Samarkand Agricultural Institute. In the first part of the analytical study, we review the agricultural education system and underlying policies in Uzbekistan by dividing them into pre- and post-independence periods. In the second part, we discuss the survey results of 400 undergraduate and 50 graduate students from Samarkand Agricultural Institute. The results reveal that half of observed students did not make a career choice yet and face uncertainties in employment decisions. Compared with undergraduate students, the share of graduate students wishing to continue their education (doing a PhD) was higher. The following recommendations are given: (i) agricultural vocational/professional colleges and agricultural universities should collaborate in teaching students. Also, college and university staff members should cooperate with industries and farmers to develop employment opportunities for graduates in rural areas. (ii) Economic incentives based on higher ages/salaries are very important to attract more qualified specialists to rural areas, hence policymakers should consider this issue in a broader way. Developing extension service organizations can be an option where qualified staff will be needed. Availability of good rural infrastructure for graduates from agricultural universities can encourage students to stay in rural areas.
I20|Quality of Politicians and Electoral System. Evidence from a Quasi-experimental Design for Italian Cities|We study the effect of the electoral system on the quality of politicians, measured by the average educational attainment, at the local level in Italy over the period 1994-2017. Since 1993, municipalities below 15,000 inhabitants vote with a single-ballot system, whereas cities above 15,000 inhabitants threshold are subject to a double ballot.Exploiting the discontinuous policy change nearby the population cut-off we have implemented a RDD and found that runoff elections lead to a decrease in the educational attainment of local politicians by about 2% compared to years of schooling of politicians in municipalities voting with a single-ballot scheme.We speculate that the negative effect is driven by the different selection process of candidates adopted by political parties between runoff and single-ballot system. Findings are similar when we use alternative measures of quality of politicians related both to the previous occupation and to previous political experience, and when we control for different measures of political closeness.

I20|Measuring the financial literacy of the adult population: the experience of Banca d’Italia|At the beginning of 2017, Banca d’Italia conducted a survey to investigate financial literacy and inclusion among Italian adults. The survey is part of an OECD project to create an internationally comparable dataset on this important topic. The questionnaire was developed by the OECD International Network on Financial Education (INFE). The Italian sample consists of about 2,500 persons interviewed using two different methods: 40 per cent of them had a face-to-face interview while the others used a tablet to record their responses. Our findings show the existence of a substantial financial literacy gap between Italy and the other G20 countries, which is most evident among less educated respondents, among the elderly and among women. Compared with other countries, Italians are more aware of their limits or at least more cautious when assessing their level of financial knowledge. We also discuss some critical aspects of the OECD’s methodology that should be addressed in order to improve the measurement of financial literacy and to increase cross-country comparability.
I20|¿Quiénes son los docentes en Colombia? Características generales y brechas regionales|Este documento presenta una descripción detallada de los docentes del sector oficial en Colombia, haciendo especial énfasis en las marcadas brechas regionales. El análisis se basa en registros oficiales del Ministerio de Educación Nacional, que incluyen información detallada de todos los docentes oficiales del país. Además, se miden las habilidades académicas de los docentes a través de los puntajes que estos obtuvieron en las pruebas SABER 11, cuando eran estudiantes de bachillerato. Los resultados indican que, así como hay importantes diferencias entre instituciones educativas urbanas y rurales, aquellas ubicadas en municipios pequeños (no certificados) y regiones periféricas también enfrentan grandes dificultades para atraer y retener buenos docentes. Esto se ve reflejado tanto en la menor formación y las bajas habilidades académicas de los docentes como en la alta provisionalidad de la planta. Estas características están, a su vez, fuertemente correlacionadas con el desempeño de los alumnos en todos los niveles. **** ABSTRACT: This paper presents a comprehensive description of public school teachers in Colombia, with a particular emphasis on regional gaps. Our analysis is based on administrative records from the Ministry of Education, which contain detailed information on all public school teachers in the country. Additionally, we match teachers' records to the high school national exit exam (SABER 11) to obtain a measure of their academic skills. Results indicate that, while urbanrural gaps are important, they are not the only sources of regional inequality. Schools located in small (uncertified) municipalities and peripheral regions also face great difficulties to attract and retain highly skilled teachers. This is reflected in the teachers' educational attainment and test scores, and also in the share of provisional appointments. These characteristics are, in turn, strongly correlated with students' performance at all levels.
I20|The Impact of a Conditional Cash Transfer Program on Households' Well-Being|We evaluate the impact of a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program that we designed on family well-being among low-income families with young children. Although most CCTs have been implemented in low-income countries, our research is in the context of a high-income country, Italy, where the recent economic crises have worsened the conditions of families with children, especially among immigrants. Our objective is to evaluate the introduction of conditionality (attendance of courses) into a pre-existing unconditional cash transfer program. Using a randomized controlled trial, we find that CCT families search more actively for work, and they work more hours and more regularity than the cash transfer and control groups. CCT families also are able to save more money and eat healthier foods. The CCT intervention appears to be more effective than cash transfer alone in changing households' behavior in several dimensions of well-being. Our findings add to the accumulating evidence on the impact of conditional cash transfers versus unconditional ones and to the literature concerning multidimensional incentive programs.
I20|Drivers of Student Performance: Evidence from Higher Secondary Public Schools in Delhi|We examine the role of teachers and students in the formation of grade 12 test scores in public schools in Delhi. There is substantial variation in teacher and student quality within schools. Over the period spanning grades 11 and 12, being taught by a standard deviation better than average teacher raises test scores by 0.373 standard deviation; being a standard deviation better than average student raises it by 0.799 standard deviation. Being tenured positively predicts teacher effectiveness, while educational qualifications, training, experience and personality traits have no predictive power. Relative to families where only fathers earn, those where both parents earn negatively predict student effectiveness, while religion, caste and parents’ education have no predictive power. There is some evidence that principals’ rating of teachers and value added measures of teacher quality are positively correlated. We recommend teacher compensation be based in-part on ex-post evaluation of value-added measures and principal ratings.
I20|Costs of just failing high-stakes exams|School students who narrowly fail to achieve a grade C in their GCSE English exam at age 16 pay a high price, according to research by Jenifer Ruiz-Valenzuela and colleagues. Their study concludes that young people are not getting the support they need if they fail to make the grade, even narrowly.
I20|Autonomous Schools and Strategic Pupil Exclusion|This paper studies whether pupil performance gains in autonomous schools in England can be attributed to the strategic exclusion of poorly performing pupils. In England there were two phases of academy school introduction, the first in the 2000s being a school improvement programme for poorly per-forming schools, the second a mass academisation programme from 2010 for better-performing schools. Overall, exclusion rates are higher in academies, with the earlier programme featuring a much higher increase in the exclusion rates. However, rather than a means of test score manipulation, the higher exclusion rate reflects the rigorous discipline enforced by the pre-2010 academies.
I20|Gender Segregation in Education and Its Implications for Labour Market Outcomes: Evidence from India|This paper investigates gender-based segregation across different fields of study at the post-secondary level of schooling, and how that affects subsequent labour market outcomes of men and women. Using a nationally representative longitudinal data-set from India, we provide evidence that there is substantial intra-household gender disparity in the choice of study stream at the higher-secondary level of education. A household fixed effects regression shows that girls are 20 percentage points less likely than boys to study in technical streams, namely science (STEM) and commerce, vis-à-vis arts or humanities. This gender disparity is not driven by gender specific differences in mathematical ability, as the gap remains large and significant even after controlling for individuals' past test scores. Our further analysis on working-age individuals suggests that technical stream choice at higher-secondary level significantly affects the gender gap in labour market outcomes in adult life, including labour force participation, nature of employment, and earnings. Thus our findings reveal how gender disparity in economic outcomes at a later stage in the life-course is affected by gendered trajectories set earlier in life, especially at the school level.
I20|Developing a Service Quality Model for Private Higher Education Institutions in Lebanon|Objective –The objective of this study is to identify and implement the most suitable and prominent dimensions for service quality, which is key for the development of a successful model. Within a competitive academic environment, Lebanese higher education institutions are forced to develop their own dimensions of service quality and offer higher quality services than their competitors. Therefore, identifying the key dimensions of service quality in the Lebanese higher education sector is a priority for universities, to improve their overall services and maintain high levels of retention. The foremost condition to success is a well-developed service quality assessment process to evaluate university services. This paper aims to investigate the most effective service quality assessment tool for Lebanese universities, in addition to the corresponding dimensions of service quality and their impact on the satisfaction of the students. Methodology/Technique – This study undertakes a comprehensive review of recent studies dealing with different aspects of service quality models and the corresponding service quality dimensions are presented and discussed. Considering the proved and established qualities and capabilities of the SERVQUAL model and the urgent need for service quality assessment for private higher education institutions in Lebanon, a modified SERVQUAL model with seven dimensions is proposed and highlighted as a potential model for assessing service quality in the Lebanese higher education sector. Findings – Based on the comprehensive literature review carried out, it was noted that the SERVQUAL instrument is the most prominent model used in recent investigations to assess service quality in the higher education sector. Novelty – Choosing the proper and the most influential service quality model is one of the crucial challenges faced in higher education
I20|Education and Military Rivalry|Using data from the last 150 years in a small set of countries, and from the postwar period in a large set of countries, we show that large investments in state primary education systems tend to occur when countries face military rivals or threats from their neighbors. By contrast, we find that democratic transitions are negatively associated with education investments, while the presence of democratic political institutions magnifies the positive effect of military rivalries. These empirical results are robust to a number of statistical concerns and continue to hold when we instrument military rivalries with commodity prices or rivalries in a certain country's immediate neighborhood. We also present historical case studies, as well as a simple model, that are consistent with the econometric evidence.
I20|The geographical efficiency of education and research: The ranking of U.S. universities|This paper proposes to study the American efficiency of educational diffusion and research productivity following two distinctions: urban vs. rural areas and public vs. private universities. Following this geographical consideration, knowledge diffusion seems to be homogeneous over the American territory, whereas research productivity is more heterogeneous: American research efficiency decreased of 7% points, due to some rural university localizations. Universities in urban areas favor educational quality through high student selection criteria, contrary to those located in more rural areas. Third, public universities present higher educational efficiency, in favoring educational quality over research productivity: the lesser research efficiency of public institutions comes from difficulties in the management of several campuses, by comparison with the private institutions which are all single-campus.
I20|Le marché du travail en Haïti après le séisme : quelle place pour les jeunes ?|"(english) In January 2010, Haiti has been hit by the worst earthquake in its dramatic history. It was followed by an unprecedented international mobilization. Since then, a succession of natural disasters has struck the country (floods, epidemics, etc.). At the commemoration of the fourth anniversary of the seism, we examine the place and the role played by the Youth in this context of exception. This paper focuses on the insertion of the Youth on the labour market. Labour markets are the transmission belt between the macroeconomic dynamics and household living conditions, as the job earnings constitute the main households resources in developing countries, especially the poor. The thorough analysis of their situation is guided by a key thread: have they been spared, compared to their elders, whether through family solidarity or through international assistance; or conversely, have the Youth been sacrificed as the generational ""weak link"". Our analysis is based on the first socioeconomic survey post-earthquake. Conducted at the national level the last quarter of 2012 by the National Statistics Office of Haiti with the scientific support of the authors, the results are available for the first time. To study the dynamics, they are compared with those from a comparable survey conducted in 2007 by the same partners. Our results show that young people, and those from disadvantaged social origin in the first place, were the main victims of the downward adjustment caused by the earthquake. The sharp deterioration of their labour market conditions is not only iniquitous but it also compromises the development of Haiti in the medium term. _________________________________ (français) En janvier 2010, Haïti était touché par le plus terrible tremblement de terre de son histoire tourmentée, suivi d’une mobilisation internationale sans précédent. Depuis lors, une succession de catastrophes naturelles se sont abattues sur le pays (inondations, épidémies, etc.). A l'heure de la commémoration du 4ème anniversaire du séisme, nous nous interrogerons sur la place et le rôle joués par les jeunes dans ce contexte d'exception. L'accent porte sur l'insertion de ces derniers sur le marché du travail, étant entendu que l'emploi est de loin la principale source de revenu des populations, permettant en particulier la survie des plus pauvres. La description fouillée de leur situation sera guidée par un fil rouge : les jeunes ont-ils été épargnés, relativement à leurs aînés, que ce soit grâce aux solidarités familiales ou via l'aide internationale, ou au contraire, ont-ils été sacrifiés en tant que ""maillon faible"" générationnel. Pour étayer nos analyses, nous mobiliserons la première enquête socio-économique post-séisme à couverture nationale, réalisée fin 2012 par l'Institut Haïtien de Statistique avec l'appui scientifique des auteurs, et dont les résultats sont encore inédits. Pour étudier la dynamique, ces derniers seront confrontés à ceux issus d'une enquête similaire conduite en 2007 par les mêmes partenaires. Nos résultats montrent que les jeunes, et ceux d'origine modeste au premier chef, ont été les principales victimes de l'ajustement à la baisse provoqué par le séisme. La dégradation brutale du sort qui leur est fait est non seulement inique mais elle comprend le développement d’Haïti à moyen terme."
I20|Universal preschool programs and long-term child outcomes: A systematic review|What are the long-term effects of universal preschool programs on child outcomes? We review 26 studies using natural experiments to estimate the effects of universal preschool programs for children aged 0-6 years on child outcomes measured from third grade to adulthood. Studies comparing preschool with parental, family, or other informal modes of care show mixed effects on test scores, and on measures related to health, well-being, and behavior. However, all estimates for outcomes related to adequate primary and secondary school progression, years of schooling, highest degree completed, employment, and earnings indicate beneficial average effects of universal preschool programs. Three of the included studies calculate benefits-to-costs ratios and find ratios clearly above one. Universal preschool tends to be more beneficial for children with low socioeconomic status, and there are not consistently different effects for boys or girls. Only three studies compare two alternative types of universal preschool programs in terms of long-term outcomes.
I20|Strengthening teachers in disadvantaged schools: Evidence from an intervention in Sweden’s poorest city districts|Children growing up in disadvantaged neighborhoods tend to perform significantly worse in school compared to children growing up under more favorable circumstances. We examine the impact of a three-year program (“Coaching for Teaching”) targeted at ten poorly performing lower secondary schools in Sweden’s most disadvantaged city districts. The aim of the intervention was to strengthen the teachers’ professional development, e.g. through coaching and further training, and thereby enhance student performance. We use a difference-in-differences design and rich register data to estimate effects on several educational outcomes. Our results show a large and statistically significant positive impact on student performance on standardized tests in English language. Estimates for test results in math are also positive and large, but not statistically significant; the same applies to GPA and admission to upper secondary school. For test scores in Swedish language there is no indication of improvement. An analysis of a survey of pupils supports the idea that the teaching as well as the classroom climate improved due to the intervention. Taken together, the program seems to have generated rather promising results in the short run.
I20|Secondary education and international labor mobility: Evidence from the free secondary education reform in the Philippines|International labor mobility is a key factor for a well-functioning labor market. Although educational attainment is known to affect regional labor mobility within a country, evidence of a relationship between schooling and international labor mobility is limited, particularly in developing countries. This study uses the across-cohort variation in the exposure to the 1988 free secondary education reform in the Philippines to examine the impact of years of education on the propensity of working abroad. The results suggest that attaining another year of schooling increases the likelihood of working abroad by 3 and 8 percentage points for men and women, respectively. These results suggest that education improves the ability to deal with negative economic shocks by allowing individuals to find employment in the international labor market.
I20|Entry Through the Narrow Door: The Costs of Just Failing High Stakes Exams|In many countries, important thresholds in examinations act as a gateway to higher levels of education and/or good employment prospects. This paper examines the consequences of just failing a key high stakes national examination in English taken at the end of compulsory schooling in England. It uses unique administrative data to show that students of the same ability have significantly different educational trajectories depending on whether or not they just pass or fail this exam. Three years later, students who just fail to achieve the required threshold have a lower probability of entering an upper-secondary high-level academic or vocational track and of starting tertiary education. Those who fail to pass the threshold are also more likely to drop out of education by age 18, without some form of employment. The moderately high effects of just passing or failing to pass the threshold in this high stakes exam are therefore a source of educational inequality with high potential long-term consequences for those affected.
I20|Survey Item-Response Behavior as an Imperfect Proxy for Unobserved Ability: Theory and Application|We develop and test an economic model of the cognitive and non-cognitive foundations of survey item-response behavior. We show that a summary measure of response behaviour - the survey item-response rate (SIRR) - varies with cognitive and less so with non-cognitive abilities, has a strong individual fixed component and is predictive of economic outcomes because of its relationship with ability. We demonstrate the usefulness of SIRR, although an imperfect proxy for cognitive ability, to reduce omitted-variable biases in estimated wage returns. We derive both necessary and sufficient conditions under which the use of an imperfect proxy reduces such biases, providing a general guideline for researchers.
I20|Early Stimulation and Nutrition: The Impacts of a Scalable Intervention|This paper evaluates the effects of the implementation of a structured early stimulation curriculum combined with a nutritional intervention through public large-scale parenting support services for vulnerable families in rural Colombia, known as FAMI, using a clustered randomized controlled trial. We randomly assigned 87 towns in rural areas to treatment and control and 1,460 children younger than 1 year of age were assessed at baseline. The interventions were also complemented with training, supervision and coaching of FAMI program facilitators. We assessed program effects on children’s nutritional status, and on cognitive and socio-emotional development; as well as on parental practices. The interventions had a positive and significant effect on a cognitive development factor based on the Bayley-III of 0.15 standard deviations. We also report a reduction of 5.8 percentage points in the fraction of children whose height-for-age is below -1 standard deviation. We do not find any effects on socio-emotional development. We report positive and statistically significant effects on the quality of the home environment (0.34 SD).
I20|The Bilingual Gap in Children's Language and Emotional Development|In this paper we examine whether – conditional on other family inputs – bilingual children achieve different outcomes in language and emotional development. Our data come from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) which allows us to analyze children's language and emotional development in depth. We relax the usual assumption that the production function underpinning child development is not itself a function of the age of the child and estimate the bilingual gap in children's language and emotional development as a cumulative process that depends on current and past endowments of cognitive and non-cognitive capacity. We find that the language development of bilingual children is not significantly different to that of their monolingual peers; however, there is evidence of a positive effect of bilingualism on emotional development.
I20|The Impact of a Conditional Cash Transfer Program on Households' Well-Being|We evaluate the impact of a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program that we designed on family well-being among low-income families with young chil- dren. Although most CCTs have been implemented in low-income countries, our research is in the context of a high-income country, Italy, where the recent economic crises have worsened the conditions of families with children, especially among immigrants. Our objective is to evaluate the introduction of conditionality (attendance of courses) into a pre-existing unconditional cash transfer program. Using a randomized controlled trial, we find that CCT families search more ac- tively for work, and they work more hours and more regularity than the cash transfer and control groups. CCT families also are able to save more money and eat healthier foods. The CCT intervention appears to be more effective than cash transfer alone in changing households' behavior in several dimensions of well-being. Our findings add to the accumulating evidence on the impact of con- ditional cash transfers versus unconditional ones and to the literature concerning multidimensional incentive programs.
I20|What is a Good School, and Can Parents Tell? Evidence on the Multidimensionality of School Output|Is a school’s impact on high-stakes test scores a good measure of its overall impact on students? Do parents value school impacts on high-stakes tests, longer-run outcomes, or both? To answer the first question, we apply quasi-experimental methods to data from Trinidad and Tobago and estimate the causal impacts of individual schools on several outcomes. Schools' impacts on high-stakes tests are weakly related to impacts on low-stakes tests, dropout, crime, teen motherhood, and formal labor market participation. To answer the second question, we link estimated school impacts to parents’ ranked lists of schools and employ discrete choice models to estimate parental preferences. Parents value schools that causally improve high-stakes test scores conditional on average outcomes, proximity, and peer quality. Consistent with parents valuing the multidimensional output of schools, parents of high-achieving girls prefer schools that increase formal labor market participation, and parents of high-achieving boys prefer schools that reduce crime.
I20|Do Parents Know Best?: The Short and Long-Run Effects of Attending The Schools that Parents Prefer|Recent studies document that, in many cases, the schools that parents prefer over others do not improve student test scores. This could be because (a) parents cannot discern schools causal impacts, and/or (b) parents value schools that improve outcomes not well-measured by test scores. To shed light on this, we employ administrative and survey data from Barbados. Using discrete choice models, we document that most parents have strong preferences for the same schools. Using a regression-discontinuity design, we estimate the causal impact of attending a preferred school on a broad array of outcomes. As found in other settings, more preferred schools have better peers, but do not improve short-run test scores. However, for females, these schools confer long-run benefits including reduced teen pregnancy, more educational attainment, increased employment, higher earnings, and improved health. In contrast, for males, the effects are mixed. The pattern for females is consistent with parents valuing school impacts on outcomes not well-measured by test scores, while the pattern for males is consistent with parents being unable to identify schools’ causal impacts.
I20|Do information and communication technologies (ICT) improve educational outcomes? Evidence for Spain in PISA 2015|With the world becoming increasingly digitalized, determining the relationship between the use of ICT in the learning process and educational outcomes takes on special relevance for guiding educational policy decisions in a reasoned way. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect on academic performance of the use and availability of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) at school and at home. For this purpose, we apply a hierarchical lineal regression model approach with data from the Programme for International Student assessment survey (PISA) 2015. PISA 2015 contains a brief but specific questionnaire for ICT that is completed voluntarily in some of the countries participating in the survey, as is the case in Spain. The results show differences in the sign of the impact according to the ICT variable used. The positive impact of ICT use is associated with its use for entertainment at home and with the students’ interest in ICT. However, the use of ICT for schoolwork at home and the general use of ICT by students in schools have negative effects on the learning process. Another significant result is the magnitude of the coefficient for the relation between the starting age for using ICT on the scores in the three competences. The higher the age, the lower the score achieved. The results of the regressions by tertiles of performance show that ICT can also play an important role in improving the academic performance of the students with the worst results. Finally, some control variables related to students, home and location are also relevant in our models.

I20|The Impact of Self-Selection on Performance|In many natural environments, carefully chosen peers influence individual behavior. In this paper, we examine how self-selected peers affect performance in contrast to randomly assigned ones. We conduct a field experiment in physical education classes at secondary schools. Students participate in a running task twice: first, the students run alone, then with a peer. Before the second run,we elicit preferences for peers. We experimentally vary the matching in the second run and form pairs either randomly or based on elicited preferences. Self-selected peers improve individual performance by .14-.15 SD relative to randomly assigned peers. While self-selection leads to more social ties and lower performance differences within pairs, this altered peer composition does not explain performance improvements. Rather, we provide evidence that self-selection has a direct effect on performance and provide several markers that the social interaction has changed.
