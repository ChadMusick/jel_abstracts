A11|Why the Economics Profession Must Actively Participate in the Privacy Protection Debate|When Google or the US Census Bureau publishes detailed statistics on browsing habits or neighborhood characteristics, some privacy is lost for everybody while supplying public information. To date, economists have not focused on the privacy loss inherent in data publication. In their stead, these issues have been advanced almost exclusively by computer scientists who are primarily interested in technical problems associated with protecting privacy. Economists should join the discussion, first to determine where to balance privacy protection against data quality—a social choice problem. Furthermore, economists must ensure new privacy models preserve the validity of public data for economic research.
A11|Implementación de una evaluación por competencias académicas en el pregrado de Economía de la Universidad del Magdalena, Colombia|Resumen: El objetivo de este artículo es presentar los resultados de una evaluación piloto en el enfoque de competencias académicas en el pregrado de Economía de la Universidad del Magdalena, aplicada para los cursos de Macroeconomía I, Estadística II, Finanzas Públicas y Economía Regional en el segundo semestre de 2018. Se muestra que una evaluación de este tipo arroja una medida sobre lo que un estudiante puede hacer con lo que aprendió. Así mismo, la metodología que permite definir las competencias de cada curso se establece en coherencia con el perfil profesional del pregrado. Este artículo contribuye a la literatura sobre la renovación de los métodos de evaluación en la educación superior en Colombia. / Abstract : This paper presents the results of an experimental test on proficiency-based assessment in Economics at University of Magdalena (Colombia), in the second half of 2018. The evaluation was carried out for Macroeconomics I, Statistics II and Public Finance and Regional Economics courses. After defining the competencies foreseen for each course based on the undergraduate student’s profile, the paper shows that this type of tests allows determining what a student can do with what they have learned. This paper contributes to the literature regarding the renewal of evaluation methods in higher education in Colombia.
A11|Lies, damned lies, and RCT : une expérience de J-PAL sur le microcrédit rural au Maroc|"Comment expliquer le succès académique d’une étude randomisée dont la validité, tant interne qu’externe, est pourtant très problématique ? Prenant l’exemple d’une étude menée par le laboratoire J-PAL sur le microcrédit rural marocain, cet article mobilise les outils analytiques de la statistique, de l’économie politique et de la sociologie des sciences pour répondre à cette question. Il décrit l’ensemble de la chaîne de production de l’étude, depuis l’échantillonnage jusqu’à la publication et la dissémination des résultats, en passant par la collecte de données, la saisie et le recodage, les estimations et les interprétations. Il met en évidence une stratégie particulièrement offensive qui permet aux chercheurs de J-PAL de faire table rase du passé, y compris en s’affranchissant d’une « culture de la donnée », de refuser la critique et de contourner les règles de base de l’exercice scientifique tout au long du processus de recherche. Bien au-delà de J-PAL, nos analyses questionnent la supposée supériorité des méthodes randomisées tout en reflétant un malaise grandissant au sein du champ académique, qui parvient de moins en moins à faire respecter les règles de base de l’éthique et de la déontologie scientifique._______english_______How can we explain the academic success of a randomized study whose validity, both internal and external, is very problematic? Drawing on a study conducted on Moroccan rural microcredit by J-PAL, this article uses analytical tools from statistics, political economy and sociology of science to answer this question. It describes the entire study production chain, from sampling, data collection, data entry and recoding, estimates and interpretations to publication and dissemination of results. It highlights a particularly aggressive strategy carried out throughout the study process and in the field of research. This allows J-PAL researchers to put the past behind them, including by freeing themselves from a ""data culture"", rejecting criticism and bypassing the basic rules of scientific exercise throughout the research process. Well beyond J-PAL, our analyses question the supposed superiority of randomized methods while reflecting a growing unease within the academic field, which is less and less successful in enforcing the basic rules of ethics and scientific deontology."
A11|Eine Netzwerkanalyse von Ökonomen und Wissenschaftlern anderer Disziplinen auf Basis eines Surveys unter Abgeordneten und Ministerialbeamten|"Offen ausgetragenen Lagerdebatten zwischen Ökonomen sind in Deutschland eher selten. Was hingegen öfters in Diskussionen oder in der Berichterstattung über Ökonomen mitschwingt, ist eine Zuordnung in weltanschauliche Lager, etwa nach Schemata wie arbeitgeberarbeitnehmernah oder auch gelegentlich links-marktliberal. Da diese Zuordnung für die nicht an der Spitze der öffentlichen Bekanntheit stehenden Ökonomen eher selten explizit ausgesprochen wird, ist eine empirische Untersuchung der Lager-Theorie auf Basis der Medienberichterstattung schwierig. Der vorliegende Beitrag untersucht die Verortung von Ökonomen anhand der Nähe in den Netzwerken von Fachkollegen und von Wissenschaftlern anderer Disziplinen. Hierfür wird auf die Daten eines Surveys unter Ministerialbeamten und Parlamentariern, den Adressaten politikberatender Ökonomen, in den Jahren 2014 bis 2018 zurückgegriffen. Dabei wird davon ausgegangen, dass die Befragten, die bis zu fünf Ökonomen nennen konnten, mit höherer Wahrscheinlichkeit solche gemeinsam nennen, bei denen sie eine gewissen Nähe zueinander und wahrscheinlich auch zu sich selbst sehen. Die netzwerkanalytische Auswertung der Umfragedaten zeigt über die Jahre insbesondere zwei stabile zentrale Cluster um die Präsidenten zweier Leibniz-Institute: Eines rund um Clemens Fuest bzw. Hans-Werner Sinn vom ifo - Leibniz-Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung in München und eines rund um Marcel Fratzscher vom Deutschen Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung (DIW Berlin). Aufschlussreich sind auch die wichtigsten Wissenschaftler nicht-ökonomischen Disziplinen, die mit den Clustern assoziiert werden: mit Bezug auf das Cluster ""Fuest"" sind dies der Bedeutung nach vorrangig Rechts- und Politikwissenschaftler. Das Cluster ""Fratzscher"" wird in erster Linie mit Politikwissenschaftlern und Soziologen assoziiert."
A11|Cheat or Perish? A Theory of Scientific Customs|We develop a theory of the evolution of scientific misbehavior. Our empirical analysis of a survey of scientific misbehavior in economics suggests that researchers’ disutility from cheating varies with the expected fraction of colleagues who cheat. This observation is central to our theory. We develop a one-principal multi-agent framework in which a research institution aims to reward scientific productivity at minimum cost. As the social norm is determined endogenously, performance-related pay may not only increase cheating in the short run but can also make cheat-ing increasingly attractive in the long run. The optimal contract thus depends on the dynamics of scientific norms. The premium on scientific productivity should be higher when the transmission of scientific norms across generations is lower (low marginal peer pressure) or the principal cares little about the future (has a high discount rate). Under certain conditions, a greater probability of detection also increases the optimal productivity premium.
A11|All that Glitters is not Gold. The Political Economy of Randomized Evaluations in Development|Randomized control trials (RCTs) have a narrow scope, restricted to basic intervention schemes. Experimental designs also display specific biases and political uses when implemented in the real world. Despite these limitations, the method has been advertised as the gold standard to evaluate development policies. This article adopts a political economy approach to explore this paradox. It argues that the success of RCTs is driven mainly by a new scientific business model based on a mix of simplicity and mathematical rigour, media and donor appeal, and academic and financial returns. This in turn meets current interests and preferences in the academic world and the donor community.
A11|Humans in the perfectly competitive market|The perfectly competitive market – a hypothetical situation free of market failure – serves as a benchmark for economic theory, providing the basis for the two fundamental welfare theorems. The radical abstractions of this idea makes it hard to grasp its full implications, however. In this essay, I explore the perfectly competitive market using literary fiction. Part I discusses fiction as a tool for economic theory. Part II is a science fiction story about two economists travelling to the perfectly competitive market for their honeymoon. Part III develops main theoretical insights emerging from the story. First, to preclude market failure, complete social isolation must prevail. Second, the requirements of symmetric information and no external effects are extremely hard to reconcile, leading to an impossibility result: if trade is permitted anytime, and deliberate, welfare-relevant learning is feasible, no perfectly competitive market can exist.
A11|Inequality and Stagnation by Policy Design|"This paper argues the mainstream economics profession is threatened by theories of the financial crisis and ensuing stagnation that attribute those events to the policies recommended and justified by the profession. Such theories are existentially threatening to the dominant point of view. Consequently, mainstream economists resist engaging them as doing so would legitimize those theories. That resistance has contributed to blocking the politics and policies needed to address stagnation, thereby contributing to a political vacuum which is being filled by odious forces. Those ugly political consequences are unintended, but they are still there and show the dangerous consequences of the death of pluralism in economics. The critique of mainstream economists is not about ""values"" or lack of ""change"": it is about academic practice that suppresses ideas which are existentially threatening."
A11|The Third Theorem of Welfare Economics: Report from a Fictional Field Study|The perfectly competitive market – a hypothetical situation free of market failure – is the basis for the two fundamental welfare theorems, and an important benchmark for economic theory. The radical abstractions of this idea, however, make its full implications hard to grasp. I address this using literary fiction. Part I discusses fiction as a tool for economic theory. Part II is a story about a journey to the perfectly competitive market. Part III develops main theoretical insights based on the story: First, complete social isolation is needed to preclude market failure. Second, the requirements of symmetric information and no external effects are extremely hard to reconcile, leading to an impossibility theorem: if trade is permitted anytime, and deliberate, welfare-relevant learning is feasible, no perfectly competitive market can exist.
A11|Pay and Job Rank Amongst Academic Economists in the UK: Is Gender Relevant?|This article presents and explores a rich new data source to analyse the determinants of pay and job rank amongst academic Economists in the UK. Characteristics associated with individual productivity and workplace features are found to be important determinants of the relative wage and promotion structure in this sector. However, there is also a substantial unexplained gender pay gap. Men are considerably more likely to work in higher paid job ranks where there are also substantial within-rank gender pay gaps. We show that the nature of the gender pay gap has changed over the last two decades; but its size has not, suggesting a role for suitable policy intervention.
A11|Publication Bias and Editorial Statement on Negative Findings|"In February 2015, the editors of eight health economics journals sent out an editorial statement which aims to reduce the extent of specification searching and reminds referees to accept studies that: ""have potential scientific and publication merit regardless of whether such studies' empirical findings do or do not reject null hypotheses"". Guided by a pre-analysis, we test whether the editorial statement decreased the extent of publication bias. Our differences-in-differences estimates suggest that the statement decreased the proportion of tests rejecting the null hypothesis by 18 percentage points. Our findings suggest that incentives may be aligned to promote more transparent research."
A11|Variation in Women's Success across PhD Programs in Economics|"We document wide and persistent variation in women's representation and success across graduate programs in economics. Using new data on early career outcomes for recent graduates, including first job placement, publications, and promotion, we rank (anonymized) departments on outcomes for women relative to men graduating from the same program. We then conduct interviews with faculty and former students from five programs with better and worse relative outcomes. We find that departments with better outcomes for women also hire more women faculty, facilitate advisor-student contact, provide collegial research seminars, and are notable for senior faculty with awareness of gender issues. We offer our qualitative evidence as the first step in learning about ""what works"" in expanding women's representation in economics."
A11|How Research Affects Policy: Experimental Evidence from 2,150 Brazilian Municipalities|This paper investigates if research findings change political leaders’ beliefs and cause policy change. Collaborating with the National Confederation of Municipalities in Brazil, we work with 2,150 municipalities and the mayors who control their policies. We use experiments to measure mayors’ demand for research information and their response to learning research findings. In one experiment, we find that mayors and other municipal officials are willing to pay to learn the results of impact evaluations, and update their beliefs when informed of the findings. They value larger-sample studies more, while not distinguishing on average between studies conducted in rich and poor countries. In a second experiment, we find that informing mayors about research on a simple and effective policy (reminder letters for taxpayers) increases the probability that their municipality implements the policy by 10 percentage points. In sum, we provide direct evidence that providing research information to political leaders can lead to policy change. Information frictions may thus help explain failures to adopt effective policies.
A11|Conference Presentations and Academic Publishing|This paper aims to quantify the contribution of conferences to publication success of more than 4,000 papers presented at three leading economics conferences over the 2006- 2012 period. The results show a positive link between conference presentation and the publishing probability in high-quality journals. Participating in major conferences is also associated with improved metrics for other measures of academic success such as the number of citations or abstract views. We document that, while the results are broadly similar across fields, annual meetings of the American Economic Association are particularly valuable in these dimensions.
A11|The Effect of Responsive and Proactive Market Orientation on Product Innovation and Company Performance: A Case Study on MSMEs in the Culinary Field in D.I. Yogyakarta|This study aims to determine the effect of Responsive and Proactive Market Orientation on Product Innovation and Company Performance. The population in this study is the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise (MSME) in the Culinary Division at D.I. Yogyakarta and use 200 respondents as a sample. By using convenience sampling technique, the researchers have the freedom to choose any culinary MSME found around D.I. Yogyakarta to be the respondent. Hypothesis testing using Structural Equation Model (SEM) analysis. The findings show that there is a positive influence of responsive market orientation on product innovation performance, proactive market orientation on product innovation performance, product innovation performance on the company's market performance, and the company's market performance on the company's financial performance. The findings of this study contribute to MSMEs that information about market orientation adopted by business actors or companies can affect the performance of new product innovations in the market to improve the company's market performance which then affects the company's financial performance.
A11|Who Said or What Said? Estimating Ideological Bias in Views Among Economists|There exists a long-standing debate about the influence of ideology in economics. Surprisingly, however, there is no concrete empirical evidence to examine this critical issue. Using an online randomized controlled experiment involving economists in 19 countries, we examine the effect of ideological bias on views among economists. Participants were asked to evaluate statements from prominent economists on different topics, while source attribution for each statement was randomized without participants’ knowledge. For each statement, participants either received a mainstream source, an ideologically different less-/non-mainstream source, or no source. We find that changing source attributions from mainstream to less-/non-mainstream, or removing them, significantly reduces economists’ reported agreement with statements. Using a model of Bayesian updating we examine two competing hypotheses as potential explanations for these results: unbiased Bayesian updating versus ideologically-biased Bayesian updating. While we find no evidence in support of unbiased updating, our results are consistent with biased Bayesian updating. More specifically, we find that changing/removing sources (1) has no impact on economists’ reported confidence with their evaluations; (2) similarly affects experts/non-experts in relevant areas; and (3) affects those at the far right of the political spectrum much more significantly than those at the far left. Finally, we find significant heterogeneity in our results by gender, country, PhD completion country, research area, and undergraduate major, with patterns consistent with the existence of ideological bias.

A11|How to Break the Bandwagon Effect of Corruption|Corruption is considered as the most challenging issues of present economies of the world due to its impact on institutions, values and the sustainable development. It restricts almost all form of economic activities through redirecting the finance into unpredictable directions and weakens the economics system which locked as many countries continued to fail in controlling the corruption significantly. According to the World Corruption Perception Index (2018) India stands 78th rank out of 180 countries surveyed even after numerous policies adopted from the independence by the government of India to rectify it. Corruption is a behavioral aspect and the available literature on interlinking of corruption behavior and the Economics behind it are not well documented connecting various theories and their application of controlling corruption which triggers a call for integrated attempt to enquire into the behavioral Economics of corruption and to identify the relevant solution to rectify it. This paper is attempted to fill this gap in research by exploring the behavior of corruption in the light of the micro economic theory of consumer behavior called Bandwagon effect in the society. The paper identify the interlink age among corruption behavior, and bandwagon effect and the Economics of information and explored that how the (includes asymmetric) information can be fine tuned towards mitigating the bandwagon effect and corruption.
A11|Convergence or divergence in finance journal ranking?|In this paper, we apply the Phillips and Sul (2007; 2009) methodology to investigate the convergence pattern of finance journals across thirteen established academic journal lists. The results reveal that the majority of sample journals do converge across the academic lists. The estimated transition paths confirm the empirical analysis, revealing a “focal” point for the research institutions to minimize the discrepancies appeared by the journal lists proliferation.
A11|Solving the Grid-Connected Microgrid Operation by JAYA Algorithm|This paper aims to investigate the optimal operation of grid-connected microgrids (MG). In the grid-connected mode, the MG can connect to the main utility and also can exchange energy with the main grid. This potential can lead to higher reliability and less operation cost. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed model, it is tested on a modified IEEE 33 bus test system.
A11|Sharia banking standard law|Abstract The adoption of a standard agreement from the beginning of its birth has caused controversy both concerning the existence and validity of standard contracts. The Civil Code does not specifically regulate standard agreements. This writing focuses on two issues, namely the validity of the agreement with the standard clause related to sharia principles and the consequences of the law lacking the principle of freedom of contract. This research is normative research that refers to legislation and jurisprudence using legal materials both primary and secondary. The legal material was collected through library studies and then analyzed qualitatively. This study concludes: first, the agreement with conventional standard clauses is no longer questioned whether the agreement is valid or not, but more importantly, the fairness of the contents of the standard clause and in the standard sharia contract tend to result in injustice. Second, normatively there are no legal consequences due to the absence of freedom of contract in the agreement.
A11|Price Control in Islamic Economics|In economics, we often hear the word price and its scope. In this case, the relation is how the value that becomes the transaction between the seller and the buyer is the replacement of the goods or services exchanged. The economy is one of the teachers in the country's life. The strength and weakness of a country's economic system are determined by pricing so that price stability occurs. But it is not easy to create an economy at a stable price because sometimes the demand level is higher than the supply and vice versa.
A11|Prioritization of sustainability indicators for promoting the circular economy: The case of developing countries|The concept of the circular economy has gained well-recognition across the world for the past decades. With the heightening risk of the impact of climate change, resource scarcity to meet the increasing world population, the need to transition to a more sustainable development model is urgent. The circular economy is often cited as one of the best solutions to support sustainable development. However, the diffusion of this concept in the industrial arena is still relatively slow, particularly in the developing country, which collectively exerts high potential to be the world’s largest economies and workforce. It is crucial to make sure that the development of these nations is sustainable and not bearing on the cost of future generation. Thus, this work aims to provide a comprehensive review of the circular economy concept in developing country context. Furthermore, a novel model is proposed by adopting Fuzzy Analytics Network Process (FANP) to quantify the priority weights of the sustainability indicators to provide guidelines for the industry stakeholders at different stages of industry cycle to transition toward the circular economy. The results revealed that improvement in economic performance and public acceptance are they key triggers to encourage stakeholders for sustainable development. The outcomes serve as a reference to enhance the overall decision-making process of industry stakeholders. Local authorities can adopt the recommendations to design policy and incentive that encourage the adoption of circular economy in real industry operation to spur up economic development, without neglecting environmental well-being and jeopardizing social benefits.
A11|Ethics out of Economics: The Futile Attempt of Rendering Economics a Neutral Science|Over the last century, and several times until recently, mainstream economics has been criticized from different viewpoints. Most of the critiques highlighted the weakness of its methodological and logical structure, not to mention its inadequate capacity of tackling with the new problems posed by globalization. However, mainstream economics has always shown itself strong enough as to stand up victoriously most of the times, notwithstanding those critiques, which quite often turned out to be even devastating from the logical point of view. The object of my report will be mainly focused on highlighting one of the most important reason for which mainstream economics should be considered altogether inadequate for tackling with many problems of the real world. And that reason essentially lies in the very fact that mainstream economics has since long put any ethical aspect completely outside its basic framework. One the most important consequences of that operation has been that of rendering economic theory perilously free of any value-judgment and therefore uncontaminated by any possible social and political change in society, even by the most significant ones. The report will then briefly reconstruct the most significant steps through which that process was accomplished, by bringing about, at the same time, the severe drawbacks of that futile attempt of rendering economics neutral in its analysis and its policy prescriptions.
A11|Values of Economists Matter in the Art and Science of Economics|What role do personal values play in the practice of economists? By means of a survey among economists working inside and outside academia in the Netherlands, we present novel insights on their personal values, how these differ from the average citizen, and how values impact their economic views and their methodological choices. Three overarching values summarize the value structure of economists: achievement, serving the public interest, and conformity to rules. Subsequent tests are performed to see whether these values affect (1) their opinion on economic propositions and (2) their attitudes towards methodological principles in economics. For the majority of economic propositions, personal values matter. Especially the value of serving the public interest has a strong effect on their economic view. Furthermore, it seems that economists who value achievement are the ones who are more likely to embrace mainstream methodological principles: thinking predominantly in terms of efficiency, rationality, and competition, believing that economic knowledge is objective and transparently produced and in agreement with Milton Friedman's view on positive economics. Female economists are at some notable points less convinced of market solutions and have more trust in the government in serving the public interest.
A11|Macroeconomic Research, Present and Past|What is the state of macroeconomics? We answer this question by hand collecting information about the epistemological approaches, theoretical and empirical methods, and data sources used by macroeconomists in their research. During the past 40 years there has been an increasing reliance on mathematical theory, particularly DSGE models, with theory-based papers now occupying the majority of space in macro journals. This shift is mirrored by a decline in the use of empirical falsification methods testing theoretical predictions. Microeconometric techniques have displaced time series methods, and empirical papers increasingly rely on micro and proprietary data sources. We document a decline and subsequent resurgence of financial frictions appearing in macro theory. Finally, we find that topics outside of macroeconomics are studied in more than three fourths of macro field journal publications.
A11|The power of economic textbooks: A discourse analysis|"By conducting a discourse analysis (SKAD) in the field of academic economics textbooks, this paper aims at reconstructing frames and identity options offered to undergraduate students relating to the questions ""Why study economics?""and ""Who do I become by studying economics?"". The analysis showed three major frames and respective identity offerings, all of which are contextualized theoretically, with prominent reference to the Foucauldian reflection of the science of Political Economy. Surprisingly, none of them encourages the student to think critically, as could have been expected in a pedagogical context. Taken together, economics textbooks appear as a ""total structure of actions brought to bear upon possible action"" (Foucault), therefore, as a genuine example of Foucauldian power structures."
A11|Eine Netzwerkanalyse von Ökonomen und Wissenschaftlern anderer Disziplinen auf Basis eines Surveys unter Abgeordneten und Ministerialbeamten|"In Germany, public debates between economists are rather rare. However, in media cover-age on economists there is an implicit assignment to ideological camps, such as employer/employee-friendly or left/market liberal. Since for most of the economists this assignment is rarely explicitly pronounced, an empirical investigation based on the media coverage is difficult. Our contribution examines the assigned orientation of economists by proximity in networks of peers and scientists from other disciplines. For this purpose, we use data collected in a survey among ministry officials and parliamentarians about policy-advising scientists in the years 2014 to 2018. The respondents could name up to five economists and five scientists from other disciplines. It is assumed that respondents are more likely to name those together where they see a certain proximity to each other, and probably to them-selves as well. Over the years, the network analysis of the survey data shows two stable central clusters around the presidents of two Leibniz institutes: Clemens Fuest and Hans-Werner Sinn from the Ifo - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research in Munich and Marcel Fratzscher from the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin). The most important scientists of non-economic disciplines associated with the clusters are also revealing: with reference to the cluster ""Fuest"", these are primarily legal and political scientists. The cluster ""Fratzscher"" is primarily associated with political scientists and sociologists."
A11|flexpaneldid: A Stata command for causal analysis with varying treatment time and duration|The paper presents a modification of the matching and difference-in-differences approach of Heckman et al. (1998) and its Stata implementation, the command flexpaneldid. The approach is particularly useful for causal analysis of treatments with varying start dates and varying treatment durations (like investment grants or other subsidy schemes). Introducing more flexibility enables the user to consider individual treatment and outcome periods for the treated observations. The flexpaneldid command for panel data implements the developed flexible difference-in-differences approach and commonly used alternatives like CEM Matching and difference-in-differences models. The novelty of this tool is an extensive data preprocessing to include time information into the matching approach and the treatment effect estimation. The core of the paper gives two comprehensive examples to explain the use of flexpaneldid and its options on the basis of a publicly accessible data set.
A11|The Role of the Legislative and Regulatory Framework in Improving the Investment Climate in the Middle East and North Africa Countries (MENA), in the Reconstruction Phase - Descriptive Study|The importance of investment appears in the development and support of the country?s economy, where developing countries sought to attract investments, Which necessarily required a package of reforms, Which began with a set of laws that set the general investment policy in many developing countries, Which aimed at investment environment attractive to investment, But the conditions in the Eastern Mediterranean and North Africa region did not help achieve the desired vision that was planned.This study aims to identify and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the investment climate, In addition to studying the legal and regulatory environment related to investment, and its role in supporting the investment climate in the reconstruction phase.The importance of this study emerged in the positive role which played by the investment process in economic development in general, and determines the elements of the investment environment from the legislative and administrative aspects, It is, therefore, necessary, Intensify efforts to develop the investment climate in the next stage of reconstruction.The problem of the study is reflected in the importance of developing investment laws, Because it is the most important factor in attracting investments, and because the effectiveness of investment promotion laws have a positive and direct impact in creating the investment environment.The study confirmed, after reviewing previous studies, the need to amend the current investment promotion laws in most developing countries, simplify and standardize investment laws, add organize this lows under one investment umbrella,The study also found the volume of investment in the reconstruction phase will depend on the development that can happen in the investment laws.
A11|Evidence-based policymaking: promise, challenges and opportunities for accounting and financial markets research| The use of evidence and economic analysis in policymaking is on the rise, and accounting standard setting and financial regulation are no exception. This article discusses the promise of evidence-based policymaking in accounting and financial markets as well as the challenges and opportunities for research supporting this endeavour. In principle, using sound theory and robust empirical evidence should lead to better policies and regulations. But despite its obvious appeal and substantial promise, evidence-based policymaking is easier demanded than done. It faces many challenges related to the difficulty of providing relevant causal evidence, lack of data, the reliability of published research and the transmission of research findings. Overcoming these challenges requires substantial infrastructure investments for generating and disseminating relevant research. To illustrate this point, I draw parallels to the rise of evidence-based medicine. The article provides several concrete suggestions for the research process and the aggregation of research findings if scientific evidence is to inform policymaking. I discuss how policymakers can foster and support policy-relevant research, chiefly by providing and generating data. The article also points to potential pitfalls when research becomes increasingly policy-oriented.
A11|What economics education is missing: The real world|The global financial crisis (GFC) led to increasing distrust in economic research and the economics profession, in the process of which the current state of economics and economic education in particular were heavily criticized. Against this background we conducted a study with undergraduate students of economics in order to capture their view of economic education. The paper is based on the Documentary Method, a qualitative empirical method, which combines maximum openness with regard to the collection of empirical material coupled with maximum rigor in analysis. The empirical findings show that students enter economics curricula with (1) epistemic, (2) practical or (3) moral/political motivations for understanding and dealing with real-world problems but end up remarkably disappointed after going through the mathematical and methods-orientated introductory courses. The findings further indicate that students develop strategies to cope with their disappointment - all of them relating to their original motivation. The theoretical contextualization of the empirical findings is based on the psychological concept of cognitive dissonance.
A11|"""The market deals out profit and losses"": Wie ökonomische Standardlehrbücher das unreflektierte Denken in Metaphern fördern"|"Das Paper analysiert den bisher kaum beachteten Gebrauch von Metaphern in ökonomischen Standardlehrbüchern am Beispiel der Lehrtexte von Paul A. Samuelson und N. Gregory Mankiw. Dabei steht die metaphorische Semantik des abstrakten Konzeptes ""des Marktes"" im Zentrum der Untersuchungen. Mittels textanalytischer Methoden und mit Rückgriff auf die Conceptual Metaphor Theory verfolgen die Autorinnen die Einführung des Konzeptes ""der Markt"" als abstraktes und weitestgehend inhaltsleeres Konzept, die (Um-)Deutungen des Konzepts mithilfe von Entitätsmetaphern, Personifizierungen und Orientierungsmetaphern und die Verbindung des Begriffes mit politisch-ideologischen Wertungen. Hauptergebnisse sind: (1) Ökonomische Standardlehrbücher weisen einen massiven und stillschweigenden Gebrauch von Metaphern auf. (2) Dieser Gebrauch kann das kognitive Unbewusste der Leser_innen beeinflussen, und (3) Reflexive ökonomische Bildung kann zu einem verantwortungsvollen Umgang mit Metaphern befähigen."
A11|Der vergessene Lippmann: Politik, Propaganda und Markt|"Das Paper gibt einen Überblick über das Leben und die Bedeutung von Walter Lippmann, der in der ersten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts einer der bedeutendsten Journalisten der USA war. Lippmann hat sich auch an Propagandaaktivitäten im Ersten Weltkrieg beteiligt und aufgrund dieser Erfahrung u.a. 1922 das Buch Public Opinion publiziert. Dieses Buch wird hier zusammenfassend beschrieben und in seiner Bedeutung eingeschätzt. Dies wird dann einem weiteren Buch von Lippmann Buch, nämlich The Good Society aus dem Jahre 1937, gegenübergestellt - das letztere Buch gab Anlass zum so genannten Walter Lippmann Colloque 1938 in Paris, das als die erste internationale Veranstaltung des Neoliberalismus gilt. Lippmanns Manipulationsideen werden verglichen mit denen, die Friedrich August von Hayek aus Anlass der Gründung der Mont Pèlerin Society , die als Nachfolgeorganisation des Walter Lippmann Colloque gilt: Lippmann hat vor Manipulation gewarnt, die Demokratie sei damit gefährdet. Demgegenüber wollte sich Hayek der Manipulation ""der Massen"" bedienen, nur so könne ""die Zivilisation"" gerettet werden."
A11|Economics: A Science of Meaning|In this paper I will define economics following a different general approach to economic problems, an approach that, because of its emphasis on meaning, has been called ‘radical subjectivism’ (Storr, 2017). In the light of this approach, it is possible to develop a general theory for the economic system, with the possibility of globally responding to economic questions within a broad paradigm. Moreover, such a paradigm has to incorporate two fundamental elements disregarded by mainstream economics: real people and real time.
A11|Die Verantwortung von Wirtschaftswissenschaftlern für Wirtschaftskrisen und die Wirtschaft allgemein|Die jüngste globale Wirtschafts- und Finanzkrise sowie die Eurokrise werden kurz skizziert und analysiert. Wirtschaftswissenschaftler waren an diesen Krisen und ihrer Überwindung beteiligt. Ihr Anteil sollte jedoch nicht überschätzt werden. Mehr Forschung zu relevanten Problemen und eine bessere Vermittlung der Forschungsergebnisse wären wünschenswert, wozu jedoch die Anreizstrukturen in den Wirtschaftswissenschaften verbessert werden sollten.
A11|Apologia Pro Vita Sua:The Vanishing of the White Whale in the Mists|There are many analogies among fortune hunting in business, politics, and science. The prime task of the gold digger was to go to the Klondikes, find the right mine and mine the richest veins. This task requires motivation, sense of purpose and ability. Techniques and equipment must be developed. Fortune hunting in New England was provided at one time by hunting for whales. One went to a great whalers’ station such as New Bedford and joined the whale hunters. The hunt in academic research is similar. A single-minded passion is called for.

We associate this production indicator with the level of collaboration established with other authors, using Complex Networks techniques applied to the co-authorship networks. We study both individual and collaborative behaviours, and how the professional output, in terms of publications, is related to the Nobel Prize. The study encompasses a total of 2,150 papers published between 1935 and the end of 2015 by the laureates in Economics awarded between 1969 and 2016. Our results indicate that direct collaborations among laureates are, in general, rare, but when we add all the co-authors of the laureates, the network becomes more dense, and appears as a giant component containing 70% of the nodes, which means that more than two thirds of the laureates can be connected through only two steps. We have been able to measure that, in general, a higher level of collaboration leads to a larger production. Finally, when looking at the evolution of the research output of the laureates, we find that, for most of those awarded up to the mid-1990s, the production is more stable, with a gradual decrease after the awarding of the Prize, and those awarded later experience a sharp growth in the IF before the Prize, a decrease during the years immediately following, and a new increase afterwards, returning to high levels of impact.
A11|Leadership in Scholarship: Editors' Influence on the Profession's Narrative|Academic journals disseminate new knowledge, and therefore can influence the direction and composition of ongoing research by choosing what to publish. We study the influence of editors and coeditors of the American Economic Review (AER) on the topic structure of papers published in the AER between 1976 and 2013 using a textual analysis of manuscripts. We compare AER's topic structure to that of the other top general interest journals. The appointment of new AER editors, while accompanied by a minor comovement of AER topics towards topics of editor's post-appointment publications, serves more to premediate trends in the other Top 5 journals.
A11|Postales de la economía argentina 2017|Esta es una selección de comentarios periodísticos escritos durante 2017 con la finalidad de explicar algunas situaciones de la economía. Fueron publicados por diferentes medios, y siempre respondieron a un evento particular o discusión pública, como una oportunidad para rescatar los grandes principios rectores de la economía política. Como tenían una finalidad de difusión y no académica, fueron publicados sin las referencias a autores ni las notas de pié de página que acompañan esta recopilación con fines didácticos.
A11|Place-specific Determinants of Income Gaps: New Sub-National Evidence from Chiapas, Mexico|The literature on income gaps between Chiapas and the rest of Mexico revolves around individual factors, such as education and ethnicity. Yet, twenty years after the Zapatista rebellion, the schooling gap between Chiapas and the other Mexican entities has shrunk while the income gap has widened, and we find no evidence indicating that Chiapas indigenes are worse-off than their likes elsewhere in Mexico. We explore a different hypothesis. Based on census data, we calculate the economic complexity index, a measure of the knowledge agglomeration embedded in the economic activities at a municipal level in Mexico. Economic complexity explains a larger fraction of the income gap than any individual factor. Our results suggest that chiapanecos are not the problem, the problem is Chiapas. These results hold when we extend our analysis to Mexico’s thirty-one federal entities, suggesting that place-specific determinants that have been overlooked in both the literature and policy, have a key role in the determination of income gaps.
A11|L. Currie and A. O. Hirschman on Development as a Problem of Decision Making|This work analyzes the contributions of L. Currie and A. O. Hirschman to development theories. We show that traditional approaches to the divergence between these authors have overlooked some common views in their development strategies. For both, the catalyst role played by the experts —being facilitators of decision-making processes— is crucial for triggering economic transformation. Using evidence from both their published works and archival documents little exploited in the literature, we show that their experiences as experts in Colombia led them to refine their ideas on development and to appraise the importance of the political economy of expertise.

A11|Apologia Pro Vita Sua: The Vanishing of the White Whale in the Mists|There are many analogies among fortune hunting in business, politics, and science. The prime task of the gold digger was to go to the Klondikes, find the right mine and mine the richest veins. This task requires motivation, sense of purpose and ability. Techniques and equipment must be developed. Fortune hunting in New England was provided at one time by hunting for whales. One went to a great whalers' station such as New Bedford and joined the whale hunters. The hunt in academic research is similar. A single-minded passion is called for. These notes here are the wrap-up comments containing some terminal observations of mine on a hunt for a theory money and financial institutions.

A11|The Sound of Silence: A Review Essay of Nancy MacLean's Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right's Stealth Plan for America|This essay reviews Nancy MacLean's Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right's Stealth Plan for America, which triggered a huge controversy that virally spread on the internet and in various journals. We will evaluate MacLean's almost biographical account of James Buchanan, which portrays the 1986 Nobel Prize laureate as the mastermind behind today's attacks, by the foot soldiers of the radical right, on American democracy. This essay develops three main points. One, MacLean's general narrative puts too much emphasis on Buchanan and largely neglects the many other important characters who contributed to the intellectual criticism of government intervention. Two, MacLean's account is marred by many misunderstandings about public choice theory, for instance about the role that simple majority rule plays in constitutional economics. Third, in the midst of abundant archival material, her historical narrative is, at best sketchy, and is replete with significantly flawed arguments, misplaced citations, and dubious conjectures. Overall, MacLean tends to overinterpret certain aspects in Buchanan's life and thought, while she overlooks others that are equally important in understanding his work and influence. In particular, we stress that Buchanan was, first and foremost, a scholar, not a political activist, who gave significant attention to ethical considerations in his analysis of markets.
A11|Paul van Zeeland and the First Decade of the US Federal Reserve System: the Analysis from a European Central Banker who was a Student of Kemmerer|The establishment of a central bank occurred at very different moments in the process of economic integration in the United States and the European Union. In this paper, we go into the first years of the Federal Reserve System through the lens of Paul van Zeeland’s PhD dissertation. Paul van Zeeland (1893-1973) became the first Head of the Economics Service of the National Bank of Belgium in 1921, after his studies in Princeton with Edwin Walter Kemmerer. There are clear similarities in their analyses of the Federal Reserve System, for instance in their adherence to the gold standard and the real bills doctrine as well as in their emphasis on the elasticity of the money supply. Moreover, they shared a view - with hindsight a rather naïve view - that with the Fed in place, financial crises would be a distant memory. However, there were also important differences. So, van Zeeland, like several other economists as Warburg, accorded greater significance to the discount market (a key factor for the international role of the dollar) and to a stronger centralization of the Fed (which would be taken up in the 1935 Banking Act). Moreover, very specific for van Zeeland is the importance given to the Fed’s independence from the State (an element related to van Zeeland’s continental European background and Belgium’s experience of monetary financing during the war).
A11|The Possibility of Ideological Bias in Structural Macroeconomic Models|An ideologically biased expert faces trade-offs in model design. The perceived model must be autocoherent—its use by all agents delivers a self-confirming equilibrium. Policy may be influenced by manipulating the Keynesian multiplier or the Phillips curve parameters. Ideological bias may arise in a way that resembles well-known historical controversies. A larger reported Keynesian multiplier is favored by more left-wing economists, as is a flatter inflation output trade-off. Some combinations of parameters must be truthfully revealed, illustrating the tight link between parameter identification and the scope for bias that is implied by the autocoherence conditions.
A11|The gold standard for randomized evaluations: from discussion of method to political economy|(english) This last decade has seen the emergence of a new field of research in development economics: randomised control trials. This paper explores the contrast between the (many) limitations and (very narrow) real scope of these methods and their success in sheer number and media coverage. Our analysis suggests that the paradox is due to a particular economic and political mix driven by the innovative strategies used by this new school’s researchers and by specific interests and preferences in the academic world and the donor community. _________________________________ (français) La dernière décennie a vu l'émergence d'un nouveau champ de recherche en économie du développement : les méthodes expérimentales d'évaluation d'impacts par assignation aléatoire. Cet article explore le contraste entre d’une part les limites (nombreuses) et la circonscription (très étroite) du champ réel d'application de ces méthodes et d’autre part leur succès, attesté à la fois par leur nombre et leur forte médiatisation. L’analyse suggère que ce contraste est le fruit d’une conjonction économique et politique particulière, émanant de stratégies novatrices de la part des chercheurs de cette nouvelle école, et d’intérêts et de préférences spécifiques provenant à la fois du monde académique et de la communauté des donateurs.
A11|The Geography and Concentration of Authorship in the Top Five: Implications For European Economics|We study to what degree authors who publish in the five most prestigious journals in economics have previously published there and in which world region they are based. Although still high, the concentration of United States‐based and previously published top‐five authors has decreased. This trend is driven by increased co‐authorship between USA and non‐USA scholars and between scholars with and without previous top‐five articles. Only around 5% of all articles each year are written solely by first‐time authors from outside the United States, and this share has not increased since the mid‐1990s. Against this background, we argue that European institutions should be wary of putting too much emphasis on publishing in these five journals. Both the advancement and diversity of the economics discipline may otherwise suffer.
A11|Methods Matter: P-Hacking and Causal Inference in Economics|The economics 'credibility revolution' has promoted the identification of causal relationships using difference-in-differences (DID), instrumental variables (IV), randomized control trials (RCT) and regression discontinuity design (RDD) methods. The extent to which a reader should trust claims about the statistical significance of results proves very sensitive to method. Applying multiple methods to 13,440 hypothesis tests reported in 25 top economics journals in 2015, we show that selective publication and p-hacking is a substantial problem in research employing DID and (in particular) IV. RCT and RDD are much less problematic. Almost 25% of claims of marginally significant results in IV papers are misleading.
A11|Early Career Research Production in Economics: Does Mentoring Matter?|We assess the role played by advisory supervision on the early stage productivity of recent PhDs in economics using a tailor-made data set based on RePEc. After allowing for the potential effects of other relevant determinants, including gender and field of specialisation, we find as expected that both advisory quality and rank of the graduation institution are positively related to the academic productivity of graduates. However, students in top institutions do not benefit from working with the most productive academics, unless they become co-authors. For students in non-top institutions, being advised by the best academics is always associated with a higher research output. Possible explanations for this difference can be advising styles, with advisors in top-institutions devoting less time to their advisees unless they are co-authors, or a larger role of learning from peers, relative to advisors, in top-institutions.
A11|The Lure of Incredible Certitude|"Forthright characterization of scientific uncertainty is important in principle and serves important practical purposes. Nevertheless, economists and other researchers commonly report findings with incredible certitude, reporting point predictions and estimates. To motivate expression of incredible certitude, economists often suggest that researchers respond to incentives that make the practice tempting. This temptation is the ""lure"" of incredible certitude. I flesh out and appraise some of the rationales that observers may have in mind when they state that incredible certitude responds to incentives. I conclude that scientific expression of incredible certitude at most has appeal in certain limited contexts. It should not be a general practice."
A11|Economists (and Economics) in Tech Companies|As technology platforms have created new markets and new ways of acquiring information, economists have come to play an increasingly central role in tech companies – tackling problems such as platform design, strategy, pricing, and policy. Over the past five years, hundreds of PhD economists have accepted positions in the technology sector. In this paper, we explore the skills that PhD economists apply in tech companies, the companies that hire them, the types of problems that economists are currently working on, and the areas of academic research that have emerged in relation to these problems.
A11|Shackling the Identification Police?|This article examines potential tradeoffs between research methods in answering important questions versus providing more cleanly identified estimates on problems that are potentially of lesser interest. The strengths and limitations of experimental and quasi‐experimental methods are discussed and it is postulated that confidence in the results obtained may sometimes be overvalued compared to the importance of the topics addressed. The consequences of this are modeled and several suggestions are provided regarding possible steps to encourage greater focus on questions of fundamental importance.

A11|Bank Loan Loss Provisions, Investor Protection and the Macroeconomy|This study investigates the non-discretionary determinants of bank loan loss provisions in Africa after controlling for macroeconomic fluctuation, financial development and investor protection. We find that non-performing loans, loan-to-asset ratio and loan growth are significant non-discretionary drivers of bank provisions in the African region. We observe that bank provision is a positive function of non-performing loans up to a threshold beyond which bank provisions will no longer increase as non-performing loans increases. Also, bank loan-to-asset ratio is a significant driver of bank provisions when African banks have higher loan-to-asset ratios. Also, larger banks in financially developed African countries have fewer loan loss provisions while increase in bank lending leads to fewer bank provisions in countries with strong investor protection. Finally, higher bank lending is associated with higher bank provisions during economic boom. The findings have implications.
A11|Impact of Digital Finance on Financial Inclusion and Stability|This article provides a discussion on some issues associated with digital finance – an area which has not been critically addressed in the literature. Digital finance and financial inclusion has several benefits to financial services users, digital finance providers, governments and the economy; notwithstanding, a number of issues still persist which if addressed can make digital finance work better for individuals, businesses and governments. The digital finance issues discussed in this article are relevant for the on-going debate and country-level projects directed at greater financial inclusion via digital finance in developing and emerging economies.
A11|Market Mechanism in the View of Ibn Taymiyyah|The advancement of the economy is heavily dependent on market conditions. The market brings together the sellers and buyers, to conduct transactions on goods and services (supply and demand). Balance in supply and demand is needed to maintain economic stability. Market urgency attracts the characters to put forward their theories of both Islamic and western thinkers. Islam is a divine religion that brings the benefit of the afterlife. Islam has different views and thoughts about market mechanisms. This thinking precedes what western thinkers have expressed. Ibn Taymiyya reveals five concepts in the development of market mechanisms, namely fair prices, fair markets, fair profit concepts, the concept of fair wages and aims for society. The essence of Ibn Taimiyyah's thought is about the justice of the ummah. Broadly speaking Ibn Khaldun thought of concept on justice.

A11|The concept of economic thought Ibn Khaldun|This article describes the economic thinking of Ibn Khaldun. This study uses the historical approach of Islamic economic thinking through textual exegesis (text analysis). The results of this study indicate that the economic thought of Ibn Khaldun explains the concept of multidimensional economy involving various social aspects. Ibn Khaldun's economic concept implies an economic system that requires five components, namely sharia, government, society, ownership, free and fair economic activity.

A11|Hukum Baku Perbankan Syariah<BR>[Islamic Banking standard law]|Abstract The adoption of standard agreements from the beginning of their birth up to now raises controversy both regarding the existence and validity of the standard contract. The Civil Code does not specifically set up standard agreements. This writing is focused on two issues, namely the validity of the agreement with the standard clause connected with the principles of sharia and the legal consequences of the lack of freedom of contract. This research is a normative research that refers to legislation and jurisprudence by using both primary and secondary legal materials. The legal material is collected through literature study and then analyzed qualitatively. This study concludes: first, agreement with conventional standard clause is no longer question whether or not the agreement is valid, but more important is the fairness of the contents of the standard clause and in the corner of sharia standard contract tends to lead to injustice. Secondly, normatively there is no legal effect due to the lack of freedom of contract in the agreement.
A11|The Market Power of Global Scientific Publishing Companies in the Age of Globalization. An Analysis Based on the OCLC Worldcat|This article evaluates tendencies and trends of the global academic publishing industry, vital for any reasonable long-term publication strategy planning in research. Such analyses are made possible today by the OCLC Worldcat. Our multivariate attempt, combining Worldcat global library circulation figures of publisher companies with results from earlier publisher ranking studies, is based on factor analysis of 32 variables, and our promax factor analytical model establishes that there are eight factors of global publisher impact, explaining almost 86% of total variance: 1. overall global standing of the company 2. company as a factor on the market 3. company impact on the global political and economic debate 4. successfully distributing best-sellers 5. impact on the scholarly community 6. successfully distributing production to more than 50 global Worldcat libraries 7. output during the last 5 years 8. outstanding academic quality Of the 51 companies with complete data under investigation here, the following companies are classified in the upper half: Oxford University Press; Springer; Cambridge University Press; Routledge; World Bank; Princeton University Press; Elsevier; CRC Press; University of Chicago Press; University of California Press; Palgrave Macmillan; MIT Press; Yale University Press; University of North Carolina Press; De Gruyter; Wiley-Blackwell; Kluwer Academic Publishers; University of Pennsylvania Press; Johns Hopkins University Press; Brill; Nova Science Publishers; University of Illinois Press; Duke University Press; University of Washington Press; and Edward Elgar. Scientists, wanting to get global audiences, are well advised to publish with those companies; and journal editors, wanting to get a global distribution for their journals, are equally well advised to cooperate with them.
A11|Kebijakan ekonomi khalifah Umar bin Khattab<BR>[Khalifah ccaliph's Economic Policy]|Umar bin Khattab is a close friend of Rasulullah SAW who conducts policies in Islamic economics, especially macroeconomics, and finds wise ways of managing property (wealth of country) and makes people benefit in three ways, first: take it the right way, second: given in accordance with their rights, and thirdly; avoid the bad. This shows that the management of Umar bin Khattab neatly in taking the country's financial management policy, the state will not take the property of people the wrong way.
A11|Teori uang dan inflasi dalam analisis pemikiran Al Maqrizi<BR>[Theory of money and inflation in the analysis of Al Maqrizi thought]|This article describes the concept of monetary theory and inflation according to Al Maqrizi's thought. In simple terms, inflation means the rising prices of goods from the prevailing circumstances. Taqiyuddin Abul Abbas Al-Husaini from Maqarizah, Cairo. Or better known as Al-Maqrizi. He said in some parts of his book that inflation is generally divided into two, namely Natural Inflation and Human Error Inflation. This paper will try to compile some of his thoughts - more specifically the problem of monetary theory and inflation - with conventional positivistic opinions and concepts in the same field.

IRMO: Zagreb<BR>[The Significance of the European Semester for Economic Policy Reforms in Croatia and Selected New EU Member States. In: Višnja Samardžija (ed.). The Challenges of European Policies Implementation in Croatia. IRMO: Zagreb]|This paper analyses the significance of the European Semester for carrying out economic reforms in Croatia with the comparisons to the experiences of selected new European Union Member States. The purpose of the paper is to contribute to wider understanding of the European Semester. The starting points of the analytical approach are as follows: to investigate the aspects of the functioning of the European Semester at the EU level and its significance for the Member States, to analyse experiences of selected new Member States (including Croatia) and provide recommendations for the implementation of the European Semester in Croatia. In accordance with the POLO-Cro28 project methodology, new EU Member States in Croatia’s neighbourhood were selected for the purpose of the comparative analysis, namely the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia. Croatia shares similar economic challenges regarding economic and social issues with these countries. A further selection criterion was the equal representation of the euro-area countries (Slovakia and Slovenia) and countries that are not part of the euro-area (Czech Republic and Hungary). This paper is based on available comparative studies and academic articles, official EU documents and progress evaluations on reaching the country-specific recommendations within the European Semester (country reports), national reports (National Reform Programs and Stability or Convergence Programs) and other sources.
A11|Tweeting Economists: Antisocial in the socials?|Economists have often been accused of adopting superior and distant attitudes (Fourcade, Ollion and Algan, 2015). This attributed stance has been variously linked to both poor understanding and traction of economics with the general public, the failure to generate realistic predictions and prescriptions (Coyle, 2012; Bresser-Pereira, 2014), and the lack of diversity in the profession (Crawford et al., 2018; Stevenson and Zlotnick, 2018; Bayer and Rouse, 2016). In this piece we focus specifically on Twitter communications by economists to investigate the ability of economists to fruitfully engage with the public in these networks and the attitudes their language use betrays. We compare economists to scientists, gathering data from the Twitter accounts of both the top 25 economists and 25 scientists as identified by IDEAS and sciencemag, who account for the lion’s share of the Twitter following, collecting a total of 127,593 tweets written between December 2008 and April 2017. Using both network and language analysis our paper finds that although both groups communicate mostly with people outside their profession, economists tweet less, mention fewer people and have fewer Twitter conversations with strangers than a comparable group of experts in the sciences, and sentiment analysis shows they are also more distant. The language analysis of differences in register (a higher register is generally less accessible and thus more distanced) finds that economists use a higher number of complex words, specific names and abbreviations than scientists, and differences in pronoun use reveal they are also less inclusive, all of which adds to distancing.
A11|A Modest Proposal For Augmenting The Gross Domestic Product Of Italy, Allowing Greater Public Spending, Employment, And Graft|Italy’s economy is stagnating, but a fiscal stimulus is ruled out by the Maastricht-limited deficit/GDP ratio. This paper presents a modest proposal for loosening the constraint on public spending by augmenting Italy’s female labor-force participation rate and therewith Italy’s GDP. Additional public spending would be popular, as it would increase employment; it would also be politically viable, as Italy’s elected and appointed officials would welcome the opportunity for increased graft.
A11|Les sciences sociales au service du débat démocratique au Sud:enjeux, supports, retombées. Résultats d'expériences dans le champ de l'économie et de la statistique|"(english) While researchers are increasingly encouraged to refocus their publishing activities towards so called “excellence” academic journals, the question of knowledge dissemination and its role in developing countries becomes more acute. This dilemma, whereby any scientist is confronted, affects even more social sciences since they bear directly on topics and social issues where social demand is huge and unsatisfied, especially in the South. This contribution proposes to make explicit the foundations of this contradiction and discuss the potential role of communication strategies of research results and practical consequences which they generate. It addresses, inter alia, the question of media, targeted audiences, communication language, its effects and risks for the researcher when it deals with politically sensitive issues (corruption, discrimination, evaluation of public policies, etc.). This contribution feed on author’s experiences over the past 20 years in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Asia. _________________________________ (français) A l'heure où les chercheurs sont de plus en plus incités à recentrer leurs activités de publication sur les revues académiques dites ""d'excellence"", la question de la diffusion des savoirs et de son rôle dans les pays en développement se pose avec une acuité accrue. Ce dilemme, auquel tout scientifique est confronté, affecte d'autant plus les sciences sociales que ces dernières portent directement sur des sujets et des enjeux de société où la demande sociale est immense et insatisfaite, tout spécialement au Sud. Cette contribution se propose d'expliciter les fondements de cette contradiction, de s'interroger sur le rôle potentiel des stratégies de communication des résultats de la recherche et des effets pratiques qu'elles engendrent. Elle aborde, entre autres, la question des supports, des publics visés, de la langue de communication, de ses effets et des risques pour le chercheur lorsqu'il aborde des sujets politiquement sensibles (corruption, discriminations, évaluation des politiques publiques, etc.). Elle se nourrit des expériences menées par les auteurs en Afrique sub-saharienne, en Amérique latine et en Asie depuis une vingtaine d'années."
A11|Measuring Influence in Science: Standing on the Shoulders of Which Giants?|I study the measurement of the influence of scientists based on bibliographic data. I propose a new measure that accounts for indirect influence and allows to compare scientists across different fields of science. By contrast, common measures of influence that “count citations”, such as the h-index, are unable to satisfy either of these two properties. I use the axiomatic method in two opposite ways: to highlight the two limitations of citation- counting schemes and their independence, and to carefully justify the assumptions made in the construction of the proposed measure.
A11|Gender Representation in Economics Across Topics and Time: Evidence from the NBER Summer Institute|We document the representation of female economists on the conference programs at the NBER Summer Institute from 2001-2016. Over the period from 2013-2016, women made up 20.6 percent of all authors on scheduled papers. However, there was large dispersion across programs, with the share of female authors ranging from 7.3 percent to 47.7 percent. While the average share of women rose slightly from 18.5% since 2001-2004, a persistent gap between finance, macroeconomics and microeconomics subfields remains, with women consisting of 14.4 percent of authors in finance, 16.3 percent of authors in macroeconomics, and 25.9 percent of authors in microeconomics. We examine three channels potentially affecting female representation. First, using anonymized data on submissions, we show that the rate of paper acceptance for women is statistically indistinguishable to that of men. Second, we find that the share of female authors is comparable to the share of women amongst all tenure-track professors, but is ten percentage points lower than the share of women among assistant professors. Finally, within conference program, we find that when a woman organizes the program, the share of female authors and discussants is higher.
A11|Social-scienciation of Economics and its Consequences: On a Relative Convergence between Economics and Sociology|We are currently in times in which an increased discussion on interdisciplinarity is on the agenda. Economics tends to go into directions of sociology, history, and psychology, taking on topics of their domains. Questions of convergencies and divergencies between the academic subjects are a result. This observation goes parallel with sociological debate on the status of sociology. Major questions remaining are: (1.) Has the field of sociology changed since Emilé Durkheim or Max Weber? (2.) Which domain can sociology claim as being its exclusive ground? Answers to these questions have to identify a broader landscape of academic division: Economics is moving increasingly in the direction of social topics and sociological ground. The “imperialism of economics” (Granovetter) is increasingly approaching traditional academic fields of history, psychology, and sociology. However, at least two psychologists (H. Simon, D. Kahneman) and an economic historian (R. Fogel) have received Nobel prizes in economics. How can sociology map with this trend, how can this challenge be converted into an academic opportunity? The paper will explore observed trends in detail in order to conclude that the public image of sociology may have declined during recent decades, but the strategic use and importance of (economic) sociology has never been greater. Economic sociology seems to have become an upgraded discipline since social networks, communication processes, institutions and culture are increasingly considered as core dimensions. Of course, the conclusion follows exactly the script of earlier instructions provided by Max Weber or Joseph Schumpeter.
A11|The Neoclassicals' Conundrum: If Adam Smith Is the Father of Economics, It Is a Bastard Child|Neoclassical economists of the current era frequently pay lip service to Adam Smith's theories to certify the validity of natural-laws-based, laissez-faire policies. However, neoclassical theories are fundamentally disconnected from Adam Smith's notion of value, his understanding of the economic individual and their interactions in society, his methodology, and the field of study he afforded to political economy. Instead, early neoclassical economists parted ways with the theories of Adam Smith in an effort to construct economic laws that would validate the existing capitalist order as universal, natural, and harmonious.
A11|What do Editors Maximize? Evidence from Four Leading Economics Journals|We study editorial decision-making using anonymized submission data for four leading economics journals: the Journal of the European Economics Association, the Quarterly Journal of Economics, the Review of Economic Studies, and the Review of Economics and Statistics. We match papers to the publication records of authors at the time of submission and to subsequent Google Scholar citations. To guide our analysis we develop a benchmark model in which editors maximize the expected quality of accepted papers and citations are unbiased measures of quality. We then generalize the model to allow different quality thresholds for different papers, and systematic gaps between citations and quality. Empirically, we find that referee recommendations are strong predictors of citations, and that editors follow the recommendations quite closely. Holding constant the referees' evaluations, however, papers by highly-published authors get more citations, suggesting that referees impose a higher bar for these authors, or that prolific authors are over-cited. Editors only partially offset the referees' opinions, effectively discounting the citations of more prolific authors in their revise and resubmit decisions by up to 80%. To disentangle the two explanations for this discounting, we conduct a survey of specialists, asking them for their preferred relative citation counts for matched pairs of papers. The responses show no indication that prolific authors are over-cited and thus suggest that referees and editors seek to support less prolific authors.
A11|An Economic Approach to Alleviate the Crisis of Confidence in Science: With an Application to the Public Goods Game|Novel empirical insights by their very nature tend to be unanticipated, and in some cases at odds with the current state of knowledge on the topic. The mechanics of statistical inference suggest that such initial findings, even when robust and statistically significant within the study, should not appreciably move priors about the phenomenon under investigation. Yet, a few well-conceived independent replications dramatically improve the reliability of novel findings. Nevertheless, the incentives to replicate are seldom in place in the sciences, especially within the social sciences. We propose a simple incentive-compatible mechanism to promote replications, and use experimental economics to highlight our approach. We begin by reporting results from an experiment in which we investigate how cooperation in allocation games is affected by the presence of Knightian uncertainty (ambiguity), a pervasive and yet unexplored characteristic of most public goods. Unexpectedly, we find that adding uncertainty enhances cooperation. This surprising result serves as a test case for our mechanism: instead of sending this paper to a peer-reviewed journal, we make it available online as a working paper, but we commit never to submit it to a journal for publication. We instead offered co-authorship for a second, yet to be written, paper to other scholars willing to independently replicate our study. That second paper will reference this working paper, will include all replications, and will be submitted to a peer- reviewed journal for publication. Our mechanism allows mutually-beneficial gains from trade between the original investigators and other scholars, alleviates the publication bias problem that often surrounds novel experimental results, and accelerates the advancement of economic science by leveraging the mechanics of statistical inference.
A11|Inside Job or Deep Impact? Using Extramural Citations to Assess Economic Scholarship|Does academic economic research produce material of scientific value, or are academic economists writing only for clients and peers? Is economics scholarship uniquely insular? We address these questions by quantifying interactions between economics and other disciplines. Changes in the impact of economic scholarship are measured here by the way other disciplines cite us. We document a clear rise in the extramural influence of economic research, while also showing that economics is increasingly likely to reference other social sciences. A breakdown of extramural citations by economics fields shows broad field impact. Differentiating between theoretical and empirical papers classified using machine learning, we see that much of the rise in economics’ extramural influence reflects growth in citations to empirical work. This parallels a growing share of empirical cites within economics. At the same time, the disciplines of computer science and operations research are mostly influenced by economic theory.
A11|Gender Representation in Economics Across Topics and Time: Evidence from the NBER Summer Institute|We document the representation of female economists on the conference programs at the NBER Summer Institute from 2001-2016. Over the period from 2013-2016, women made up 20.6 percent of all authors on scheduled papers. However, there was large dispersion across programs, with the share of female authors ranging from 7.3 percent to 47.7 percent. While the average share of women rose slightly from 18.5% since 2001-2004, a persistent gap between finance, macroeconomics and microeconomics subfields remains, with women consisting of 14.4 percent of authors in finance, 16.3 percent of authors in macroeconomics, and 25.9 percent of authors in microeconomics. We examine three channels potentially affecting female representation. First, using anonymized data on submissions, we show that the rate of paper acceptance for women is statistically indistinguish- able to that of men. Second, we find that the share of female authors is comparable to the share of women amongst all tenure-track professors, but is ten percentage points lower than the share of women among assistant professors. Finally, within conference program, we find that when a woman organizes the program, the share of female authors and discussants is higher.
A11|"A ""gung-ho"" Approach Towards Sophic Economy"|"The object of this study has been the Sophic Economy of Sergei Bulgakov ï¿½ an alternative and valuable philosophical-economic doctrine. At the beginning, facts-examples have been identified in a contemporary, social and purposely localized context (contemporary Italian society), demonstrating a certain potential sensibility towards the idea of Sophic Economy. Then, Bulgakovï¿½s thought has been expounded with a purposeful tone instead of the critical-purposeful frame originally used by Bulgakov himself in the volume Philosophy of Economy: the world as household. The quality of the examined content has raised the simple question, What about the dynamics of the diffusion of ideas like these? Employing what I call the ""gung-ho"" approach ï¿½ the researcherï¿½s imagination as a historical technique method that does not integrate the facts of the past but places them in a sort of laboratory-simulative environment model ï¿½ the idea of Sophic Economy has been inserted in NetLogoï¿½s Spreading Utopian Ideas Model. The popularization of an alternative philosophical doctrine and the proposal-experiment of an original method of historical research in Economics have been the main results of the present study."
A11|Application of the PROperty FITting Method (PROFIT) to Classification of EU Countries Based on Their Innovation Level|As it is known, innovativeness can be measured by using many known indices, such as the Global Innovation Index, the Summary Innovation Index, etc. and often these indices are based on different methodologies and take into consideration different sets of diagnostic variables. As a consequence, the final evaluation of innovativeness may strongly depend on the innovation index used. Obviously, some groups of indices lead to similar ranks of the EU countries. Nevertheless, if there are at least two groups of indices which provide different ranks of these countries, a problem with the proper evaluation of their real innovativeness arises. One of the solutions is to select the most valuable indices by observing the impact of all indices on forming distances between innovativeness levels of the EU countries. Following this option, the main aim of this paper is classification of the EU countries with respect to their innovativeness and the evaluation of international index influences on the classification obtained. The aim of the paper is to conduct the research on differences in innovation intensity across the EU member countries. For the purpose of the article, the PROFIT (PROperty FITting) method, an extension of multidimensional scaling (MDS), was applied. The ultimate goal of MDS techniques is to produce a geometric map that illustrates the underlying structure of complex phenomena, for instance, innovativeness of the EU countries. It is a widely used method which collects attribute ratings for each object (country) and then finds the best correspondence of each attribute to the derived perceptual space. Applying the PROFIT method needs linear regression techniques and provides some additional information, i.e. the impact of the considered set of diagnostic variables on the shape of the perception map. The final result is a two-dimensional map of the EU countries which reflects distances among their innovativeness levels along with vectors presenting the influence of international indices of innovativeness on the structure of this map. The nature of the results and the ways in which they are interpreted are subsequently reviewed. The main conclusion drawn from the perception map created concerns the interpretation of the above-mentioned vectors, i.e. the information about the role of each international innovation index in clustering the EU countries with respect to their innovation intensity is obtained.
A11|The Importance Of Quality In Customer Service On The Example Of The Banking Sector|Competitive counts the provider that rendered by the customer service better than the other and through the quality strategy overcomes the competitors and reaches a commercial success. In view of the particular attention should be paid to the quality of the service which significantly affect the customer loyalty. The aim of this study was to investigate the importance of quality in customer service individual commercial banks. For this purpose a SERVQUAL using the questionnaire especially by which was calculated difference between expectations and insight from the consumers on the areas being audited quality customer service. Research background: Cooperative Bank in Kalisz Pomorski (Pomeranian province), Bank of Environmental Protection in Bydgoszcz (Kujawsko - Pomorskie), and a third bank, who reserved to publish their data in research. Purpose of the article: The aim of this study was to investigate the importance of quality in customer service individual commercial banks. Methodology/methods: The method used in the work to analyze the results of the survey method was SERVQL. Findings & Value added: Each subject area of service quality in the assessment of customers' needs some improvements, because in each of them there is a discrepancy between expectations and insights. Banks as service companies must be aware that the quality of service, appropriate communication with the client, contributes not only to improve their image, but primarily becomes a factor distinguishing them from competitors.
A11|Overeducation In The Labour Market|During the transition period in Poland, its labour market changed dynamically. Many new phenomena which the Polish economy had never seen before manifested themselves. The society showed greater interest in higher education and the market for education services expanded, increasing the number of colleges and universities, especially private ones. This helped the spread of higher education, which for years determined the level of human capital represented by the supply of labour. Today’s labour market in Poland is showing signs of imbalance. One of the reasons involves overeducation. The phenomenon has been known since the 1970s. It was then described for the first time in pertinent literature, with the US where overeducation occurred on a large scale and where it had a number of adverse effects across the entire economy having been used as an example. It seems important to understand and analyse the reasons for the emergence and perpetuation of this phenomenon on the Polish labour market and to indicate its implication. The paper aims to present and discuss overeducation in terms of selected economic theories, identify its causes in Poland and further to determine the economic and social implications of the persistence of the phenomenon in the long run. The paper consists of a theoretical part developed based on selected Polish and English-language literature. The empirical material used in the paper comes from latent data originating in domestic and EU statistical databases, and is further partly sourced out from the author’s own research, and data collected by other researchers. Based on the author’s analysis, it can be concluded that overeducation is a complex phenomenon. It is possible to identify several reasons for its occurrence and long-drawn persistence on the Polish labour market. Some of the reasons have to do with the dynamic growth of the labour market and the educational services sector, society’s desire to gain higher education, structural mismatches in the labour market and a common education policy at the EU level. Overedutaion has far-reaching consequences, both for the entire economy and the single participant of the labour market alike. The fact of its occurrence determines the processes taking place in the labour market, especially those related to employment.
A11|Influence of Group Purchasing Organizations On Financial Situation Of SMEs|Research background: SMEs often operate in markets where they compete with large companies. A fight for the customer, payment backlogs, problems with debt collection and new branches make management seek solutions that will influence positively on the situation of financial companies. Maintaining liquidity and generating income are the primary steps to build a competitive position and a progressive development of enterprises. One of the most popular methods that allows companies to do profitable business and increase their chances for safety is operation within group purchasing organizations. Currently in the market there are many different types of GPOs (Group Purchasing Organizations). The choice of the right one is a chance to improve their financial situation. Purpose of the article: This article presents functioning of enterprises within group purchasing organizations and their impact on financial situation of enterprises. In the article the classification of groups is done and there are shown the benefits that commercial enterprises operating in them gain. The article presents some obstacles to join specific group purchasing organizations and difficulties faced by companies operating in them. Methodology/methods: The studies will be carried out on the basis of 60 SMEs. These companies operate in five Polish GPOs. The groups were divided into branch and multi-branch ones. The study period covered the years 2013-2015. In order to analyze the impact of purchasing groups on the financial situation of enterprises there were used selected groups of financial ratios and a preliminary analysis of financial balance sheets and profit and loss account was conducted Findings: The analysis showed that the choice of an appropriate group purchasing organization has a large impact on financial situation of companies. Different opportunities can be offered by a sectoral purchasing group than the multi-sectoral one. Research has shown that better results relate to dynamics of revenues, costs, liquidity, profitability that gives the operation within the sectoral purchasing groups.
A11|Comparative Analysis of the Influence of FDI Inflows on Economic Development Between Serbia and Poland|The aim of this paper is to measure the impact of the FDI on the economic growth in Poland and on the economic growth in Serbia and further to make comparative analysis of the impact between these two countries. Empirical studies showed that FDIs can make crowding-out effect, i.e. FDIs can out crowd domestic investments which further have more impact on the economic growth. Because this effect depends on the specific level of the development of the country, the aim is to compare the influence of the FDI on economic growths on both of them as long as Poland is classified as a developed country and Serbia is a country which belongs to the group - countries in transition. Panel data includes variable values from 1999-2007, until global economic crisis period and 2008-2015, period after crisis in order to see flows and make comparison between these two periods. GDP is the main indicator which represents economic growth. According to that, using regression analysis, the aim is to measure influence of FDIs as the independent variable on real GDP growth, as dependent variables. Besides, a group of control variables are included in the method. As long as GDP is enhanced by lower inflation, inflation will be used as independent variable. Our model also includes determinants of monetary and government sectors such as official exchange rate, inflation and government consumption. Using two multiple linear regression models we found the significant influence of FDI inflows on economic growth in Poland. Using the same models for observations in Serbia we haven’t found significant effects of FDI Inflows on economic growth.
A11|Problems of young people on the labour market in Podlaskie province in the opinion of employers|"In this article, chosen results of the study regarding the opinions of employers in the Podlaskie province (Poland) on their perception of young people entering the labour market are presented. In particular, efforts have been made to answer the following questions: what are the reasons for not recruiting young people and what are the largest competency gaps that employers notice within this group of employees? The unemployment rate of young people in Poland in the age range 15-29, reached 14.2% in 2015. For comparison, at that time the average for the EU was higher by almost two percentage points, and the decline compared to the year 2013 was lower than in Poland. In all provinces in Poland, the unemployment rate in 2015 was in the double-digits, and the Podlaskie province had the worst indicator of all regions with an unemployment rate of 13.8% among youth. It turns out that higher education in Poland has lost its importance in the process of hiring staff. Employers are increasingly less likely to look at the educational background of candidates, as they focus more on their experience and specific skills. The purpose of this article is to present the chosen results of research regarding the diagnosis of the situation of young people on the labour market in the Podlaskie province from the perspective of employers. In particular competency gaps were identified and other reasons for not recruiting young people. this article includes analyses of desk research and results of quantitative research, which was carried out on a sample of 346 respondents among 16 companies registered in the Podlaskie province. Among the reasons for not employing young people which were most often mentioned by the entrepreneurs from the Podlaskie province in quantitative research were financial reasons. During the interviews, employers indicated the reasons for not employing young people such as ""lack of appropriate qualifications,"" ""specific skills"" or simply ""practical preparation for work."" Employers when asked about the competence gaps of young people pointed out that they have a lack of experience, initiative and entrepreneurship, as well as learning skills."
A11|Methodological Problems With Evaluating Change Efficiency|Research background: Changes result from a turbulent environment and internal situation of an organization. Rarely do changes happen spontaneously, usually they stem from decisions consciously shaped and taken by the management. Both the reasons as well as consequences of changes appear on multiple grounds and areas, often strongly interrelated. This leads to far-reaching consequences, mainly difficulties in practical operations as well as consequences for studies, analyses and related scientific generalizations and the conclusion-drawing process in both domains. Purpose of the article: Purpose of this article is to present and make a critical analysis of the existing achievements in the area of evaluating change efficiency, and indicate opportunities and difficulties in formulating new, in particular synthetic, indicators of change efficiency. Methodology/methods: Methodology applied in this paper is hypothetical and deductive. Findings & Value added: Managers need synthetic measures that are hard to develop. Various methods may be used in order to do it, starting from simple and complex point scales and ending up with methods applied in other sciences, e.g. the Geneva method or its variations applied to evaluate the standard of living and development. Still this requires the isolation of main analytical measures, their upper and lower thresholds, in subsequent change or process areas, and the application of statistical methods to calculate change status or effect. Such action requires longer change planning and preparation, readiness on the part of the managerial staff, and continuous monitoring with active participation of leaders and change managers.

A11|Utopian Left-Wing Expectations and the Social Consequences of the 3rd Memorandum in Greece|In January 2015 the radical left SYRIZA has won the Greek national elections and formed a coalition government with Independent Greeks (ANEL), a right-wing populist party. After a seven-month negotiation with Greece’s creditors and the agreement for the implementation of a third memorandum of fiscal adjustment, SYRIZA announced the conduction of a second round of national elections in September 2015. After a second electoral victory, SYRIZA formed again a coalition government with ANEL. The main characteristic of SYRIZA’s pre-electoral campaign was that it has primarily focused on the commitment for austerity measures termination and on the implementation of tax alleviation. Even during the second electoral campaign in September 2015, after the agreement for the implementation of the third memorandum of fiscal adjustment, SYRIZA was promising that its implementation will be socially endued in order to reduce negative social consequences, such as those created by the previous memoranda. Practically though, after the first months of the new memorandum implementation, it is obvious that the government has introduced an unprecedented tax policy. Interestingly, this policy is not different from a traditional left logic of tax enforcement but actually leads to the implementation of horizontal austerity policies which firstly affect the socially vulnerable groups. From this point of view, while SYRIZA emphatically declare that it aims at resolving the crisis, its policies seem to deepen the depression. For instance, its inability to find alternative options to finance the social security system, leads to the implementation of restrictive policies which dismantle the welfare state. This paper aims at analyzing the policies of the first left government in Greece by focusing on the tentative social consequences of the third memorandum and at the same time, studying some of the basic factors for its electoral victory, such as populism.
A11|Normalisation of citation impact in economics|Abstract This study is intended to facilitate fair research evaluations in economics. Field- and time-normalisation of citation impact is the standard method in bibliometrics. Since citation rates for journal papers differ substantially across publication years and Journal of Economic Literature classification codes, citation rates should be normalised for the comparison of papers across different time periods and economic subfields. Without normalisation, both factors that are independent of research quality might lead to misleading results of citation analyses. We apply two normalised indicators in economics, which are the most important indicators in bibliometrics: (1) the mean normalised citation score (MNCS) compares the citation impact of a focal paper with the mean impact of similar papers published in the same economic subfield and publication year. (2) PPtop 10 % is the share of papers that belong to the 10% most cited papers in a certain subfield and time period. Since the MNCS is based on arithmetic averages despite skewed citation distributions, we recommend using PPtop 10 % for fair comparisons of entities in economics. In this study, we apply the normalisation methods to 294 journals (including normalised scores for 192,524 papers). We used the PPtop 10 % results for assigning the journals to four citation impact classes. Seventeen journals have been identified as outstandingly cited. Two journals, Quarterly Journal of Economics and Journal of Economic Literature, perform statistically significantly better than all other journals. Thus, only two journals can be clearly separated from the rest in economics.
A11|Разработка стратегий социально-экономического развития: наука vs идеология<BR>[Designing the Strategies for Socio-Economic Development: Science vs. Ideology]|"Strategies for socio-economic development in ""catching-up"" countries are designed on the basis of ideologies dominated in the society and, as a rule, fail. Until recently, economic science could not offer an alternative basis for designing strategies, but over the past twenty years the situation has changed. Nevertheless, scientific results are still weakly demanded by society. In this paper, the conflict between economics and dominant ideology is explored. On the one hand, ideology restrains the development of scientific research, and on the other hand it is changing under their influence. However, these changes are very slow for a number of reasons, analyzed in the paper. Ideology is inevitably connected with the interests of economic agents. The old elite prevents the emergence of a new ideology, since new concepts reveal the mistakes of past projects. In addition, the implementation of new ideas may require institutional changes that weaken the power of existing high-ranking officials. Meanwhile, in modern societies there are no regular mechanisms providing such transformations, and the probability of rational volitional decisions, which confront the dominant ideology, is small."
A11|Society case study: Why formal education is the common goal of human progress|The case study discusses the importance of formal education not only as a means to economic empowerment but also its application in intra cultural harmony that may solve for many intra national and international conflicts. Education for women is emphasised as useful economic strategy whereby women participation in skilled labour force may improve the trading capacity of developing countries in international markets.
A11|Hegemoni Pemerintah Terhadap Pedagang Pasar: (Analisis Dominasi Pemerintah Pasca Revitalisasi Pasar Kite Sungailiat Menurut Antonio Gramsci)<BR>[Government Hegemony Against Market Traders: (Analysis of Government Domination After Revitalization of Sungailiat Kite Market According to Antonio Gramsci)]|Hegemony is the dominance of one class against another class due to ideological and political reasons. Hegemony is done through a consensus mechanism not by suppression of other social classes. There is a government hegemony towards market traders at Sungailiat Kite Market. The intellectual power used by the government is able to influence traders' awareness to follow government policies. Traders who feel disadvantaged by policies are unable to fight. The resistance of traders can be overcome by the government by forming a consensus between the government and traders. Consensus was carried out to influence traders' thinking to follow the rules made by the government.
A11|Alma Mat(t)er(s): Determinants of Early Career Success in Economics|We study 6000 author-publication observations to investigate predictors of early career success in six fields of Economics. To minimise the effects of ability heterogeneity on publication success chance, we concentrate on top researchers and focus on the start of their careers to minimise distortions from reputation feedback. The rank of an author’s Alma Mater turns out to be significant in 4 out of 6 subfields of Economics; first placement is significant only in one subfield. Numerically, our insights suggest that a counterfactual descent in the Alma Mater of a star author who graduated from a top 10 university by as little as 10 to 20 ranks, significantly reduces by 13 percentage points his probability of getting a top 5 publication. Lowering the ranking of his Alma Mater by another 80 ranks reduces his chances of getting a top publication by a factor of three.
A11|Three decades of publishing research in population economics|Abstract The Journal of Population Economics is celebrating its 30th birthday. When the first issue was published, population economics was non-existent as a field. Hence, the aim has been to provide a high-quality outlet to publishing excellent theoretical and applied research in all areas of population economics. The article summarizes key developments in the Journal’s editorial process, thematic orientation, international reach, and successes. Furthermore, we discuss the benefits of working papers in economics and investigate the impacts of the current working paper culture on journal citations. Finally, we try to identify the citation impacts in the Journal itself. The Journal of Population Economics has established itself as the leader in its field. Publishing in working papers and in the Journal seem to be complementary activities.
A11|Catching up or falling behind? Promising changes and persistent patterns across cohorts of economics PhDs in German-speaking countries from 1991 to 2008|Abstract We investigate economics PhDs minted at German, Austrian, and Swiss universities from 1991 to 2008. We find that cohort sizes increased overall, and the share of PhDs who publish in a peer-reviewed journal within 6 years after graduation increased from 18% in 1991 to 46% in 2008. Publishing rates are heterogeneous across departments. Younger cohorts publish slightly more compared to older cohorts, but these publications are not significantly better in terms of quality. Publication productivity is highly skewed within and between departments. A key difference between PhDs of the German-speaking area and North America lies in their patterns of collaboration.

A11|Pay, Rank and Job Satisfaction amongst Academic Economists in the UK|We use new data to explore the determinants of pay, rank, and job satisfaction for academic economists in the UK. After allowing for a broad range of characteristics, including measures of individual productivity and workplace features, we find a raw (unconditional) gender salary difference of 15 log percentage points (lpp) and a conditional gender pay gap of 9 lpp. This aggregate pay gap is strongly influenced by the relative concentration of men in higher paid job ranks where there are also within-rank gender pay gaps. Nevertheless, the majority of academic economists (male and female) are satisfied with their job.
A11|Argumentationsstrategien einer neoliberalen Reformagenda: Zum Diskursprofil der Agenda Austria in medialen Debatten|Am Beispiel der Agenda Austria wird analysiert, wie wirtschaftsliberale Think Tanks Macht durch politische Reformdebatten ausüben können. Theoretisch fundieren wir dies in der Analyse von diskursiver Machtausübung bei Foucault: Think Tanks verfügen über Macht, wenn sie durch Medien bestimmte Denkstile, Denkmuster und Normvorstellungen vermitteln, welche mit der Übernahme in den Wissensbestand der Gesellschaftsmitglieder handlungsrelevant werden. Mithilfe einer Diskurs- und Metaphernanalyse untersuchen wir Zeitungsartikel in österreichischen Qualitätsmedien und erstellen ein Diskursprofil der Agenda Austria. Wir kommen zu dem Ergebnis, dass sie über alle untersuchten Themenbereiche hinweg für Reformen argumentiert, welche die marktförmige Organisation der Gesellschaft fördern sollen. Weiters zeigt sich eine dichotome metaphorische Gegenüberstellung eines positiv bewerteten Marktes und eines negativ bewerteten Staates.
A11|"From the ""planning euphoria"" to the ""bitter economic truth"": The transmission of economic ideas into German labour market policies in the 1960s and 2000s"|This paper compares the interconnections between dominant economic thought and processes of policy-making in the area of labour market reforms in Germany in the late 1960s and the early 2000s. The transition in labour market policies in this period could be described as a change from an active to an activating approach. At the level of economic discourse these policy changes correspond to a paradigm shift from Keynesian to neoclassical/neoliberal economic thought. We investigated these changes by focussing on two distinct reforms of labour market policies and carried out a critical discourse analysis of the relevant public and academic discourse of economists. We find that the paradigm shift in economic thought was accompanied by a shift in economists' discourses on labour market policy issues.

A11|Adaptation assessment and analysis of economic growth since the market reform in China|China has experienced extraordinary institutional and socio-economic changes after 1978, and its deepening reform to market-oriented economy since 1990s was also recognized as one the most significant factors to drive China's rise in the contemporary world. Although many aspects of China's market reform have been extensively analysed in the literature, specific attention on the adaptation of economic growth to this reform has been relatively ignored. To fill this gap, this research adopts the extenics assessment method to assess this adaptation and applies the membership function coordination degree model to analyse the sustainability of such adaptation. In conclusion, China has demonstrated a significantly enhanced adaptation capacity at the expense of coordination, which requires to be further emphasised in its economic growth adaptation strategies.
A11|Who benefits from GRW? Heterogeneous employment effects of investment subsidies in Saxony Anhalt|The paper estimates the plant level employment effects of investment subsidies in one of the most strongly subsidized German Federal States. We analyze the treated plants as a whole, as well as the influence of heterogeneity in plant characteristics and the economic environment. Modifying the standard matching and difference-in-difference approach, we develop a new procedure that is particularly useful for the evaluation of funding programs with individual treatment phases within the funding period. Our data base combines treatment, employment and regional information from different sources. So, we can relate the absolute effects to the amount of the subsidy paid. The results suggest that investment subsidies have a positive influence on the employment development in absolute and standardized figures - with considerable effect heterogeneity.

A11|Who benefits from GRW? Heterogeneous effects of investment subsidies in Saxony Anhalt|We estimate causal employment effects of investment subsidies for treated firms as a whole as well as heterogeneous effects depending on firm characteristics and economic environment. We modify the standard matching and difference-in-difference approach by introducing a combined statistical distance function for matching and flexible durations for outcome differences. We find positive effects of the subsidies on the employment development. We also observe considerable effect heterogeneity.
A11|Comments on Economic Models, Economics, and Economists: Remarks on Economics Rules by Dani Rodrik|"This essay reviews Dani Rodrik's superb book Economics Rules and argues that it can serve as an ideal platform for discussing what economists can and should accomplish. The essay comments on some of the major issues in contemporary economics examined in the book: whether economics is a science, the meaning of economic models, the nature of ""facts"" in economics, and others. It also touches on issues that the book overlooks, such as the sociology of the profession, the teaching curriculum in economics, and the dismal situation of publishing in economics."
A11|How to Write an Effective Referee Report and Improve the Scientific Review Process|The review process for academic journals in economics has grown vastly more extensive over time. Journals demand more revisions, and papers have become bloated with numerous robustness checks and extensions. Even if the extra resulting revisions do on average lead to improved papers--a claim that is debatable--the cost is enormous. We argue that much of the time involved in these revisions is a waste of research effort. Another cause for concern is the level of disagreement amongst referees, a pattern that suggests a high level of arbitrariness in the review process. To identify and highlight what is going right and what is going wrong in the reviewing process, we wrote to a sample of former editors of the American Economic Review, the Journal of Political Economy, the Quarterly Journal of Economics, Econometrica, the Review of Economic Studies, and the Journal of Financial Economics, and asked them for their thoughts about what might improve the process. We found a rough consensus that referees for top journals in economics tend to make similar, correctable mistakes. The italicized quotations throughout this paper are drawn from our correspondence with these editors and our own experience. Their insights are consistent with our own experiences as editors at the Journal of Finance and the Review of Financial Studies. Our objective is to highlight these mistakes and provide a roadmap for how to avoid them.
A11|Measuring Influence in Science: Standing on the Shoulders of Which Giants?|"I study the measurement of the influence of scientists based on bibliographic data. I propose a new measure that accounts for indirect influence and allows to compare scientists across different fields of science. By contrast, common measures of influence that ""count citations"", such as the h-index, are unable to satisfy either of these two properties. I use the axiomatic method in two opposite ways: to highlight the two limitations of citation- counting schemes and their independence, and to carefully justify the assumptions made in the construction of the proposed measure."
A11|The Production Economics of The Economics Production|The arrival of the internet age forces academic journals to adjust their output margins: journal length, article length, and number of published articles. Using data from 41 major economics journals spanning 21 years (1994-2014), we find that both journals and articles are getting longer, but the page share of an individual article within its journal is shrinking. This pattern is consistent with a monopolistic competition model that features within-firm (journal) specialization. As predicted by the model, the share of an individual article shrinks less in general-interest journals and better ranked journals, where expertise is less substitutable across topics. In this discipline that emphasizes the benefits of specialization, the expertise underpinning its publications is indeed divided in a specialized fashion.
A11|Murmurer à l’oreille... de l’industriel ? L’économie expérimentale comme outil d’aide à la décision en entreprise|The use of experimental economics in business is a recent development that remains little discussed in the literature. Drawing from three examples, respectively from the agri-food, the automotive and the electricity industries, this article discusses the use of this method in the private sector, identifies its contributions and limits, and considers future prospects. Despite the recognized limitations of this method, in first line parallelism, experimental economics has significant potential for the private sector, to better understand individual decisions and market mechanisms, by complementing traditional approaches or through multidisciplinary opening.

A11|What Crisis? Taking Stock of Management Researchers' Experiences with and Views of Scholarly Misconduct|This research presents the results of a survey regarding scientific misconduct elicited from a sample of 1,215 management researchers. We find that misconduct (research that was either fabricated or falsified) is not encountered often by reviewers nor editors. Yet, there is a strong prevalence of misrepresentations (method inadequacy, omission or withholding of contradictory results, dropping of unsupported hypotheses). Despite these findings, respondents put a fair deal of trust in the replicability and robustness of findings being published. A sizeable majority of editors and authors eschew open data policies but sees value in replication studies to ensure credibility in empirical research.
A11|The Quarrel of Development Experts: Lauchlin Currie and Albert O. Hirschman in Colombia|Lauchlin Currie y Albert O. Hirschman trabajaron juntos en Colombia durante los años cincuenta como asesores del Consejo Nacional de Planificación. A su llegada, contaban con poca experiencia en desarrollo económico y nunca concordaron en las recomendaciones de política del Consejo ni en su funcionamiento. Rastrear estos debates en asuntos internos y públicos permite mostrar cómo la experiencia colombiana marcó sus posiciones sobre el papel del asesor de políticas, las políticas y los obstáculos del proceso de desarrollo. Nuestra principal contribución es mostrar cómo esta experiencia enriqueció sus teorías sobre el desarrollo, las cuales evolucionaron de discusiones técnicas sobre la mecánica del crecimiento a la adopción de una estrategia de desarrollo capaz de lidiar con problemas de economía política.
A11|An Economic Approach to Alleviate the Crises of Confidence in Science: With an Application to the Public Goods Game|Novel empirical insights by their very nature tend to be unanticipated, and in some cases at odds with the current state of knowledge on the topic. The mechanics of statistical inference suggest that such initial findings, even when robust and statistically significant within the study, should not appreciably move priors about the phenomenon under investigation. Yet, a few well-conceived independent replications dramatically improve the reliability of novel findings. Nevertheless, the incentives to replicate are seldom in place in the sciences, especially within the social sciences. We propose a simple incentive-compatible mechanism to promote replications, and use experimental economics to highlight our approach. We begin by reporting results from an experiment in which we investigate how cooperation in allocation games is affected by the presence of Knightian uncertainty, a pervasive and yet unexplored characteristic of most public goods. Unexpectedly, we find that adding uncertainty enhances cooperation. This surprising result serves as a test case for our mechanism: instead of sending this paper to a peer-reviewed journal, we make it available online as a working paper, but we commit never to submit it to a journal for publication. We instead offered co-authorship for a second, yet to be written, paper to other scholars willing to replicate our study. That second paper will reference this working paper, will include all replications, and will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. Our mechanism allows mutually-beneficial gains from trade between the original investigators and other scholars, alleviates the publication bias problem that often surrounds novel experimental results, and accelerates the advancement of economic science by leveraging the mechanics of statistical inference.
A11|Gender representation in economics across topics and time: evidence from the NBER|We document the representation of female economists on the conference programs at the NBER Summer Institute from 2001 to 2016. Over the 2013-16 period, women made up 20.6 percent of all authors on scheduled papers. However, there was large dispersion across programs, with the share of female authors ranging from 7.3 percent to 47.7 percent. While the average share of women rose slightly—from 18.5 percent in 2001-04—a persistent gap between the finance, macroeconomics, and microeconomics subfields remains, with women representing 14.4 percent of authors in finance, 16.3 percent of authors in macroeconomics, and 25.9 percent of authors in microeconomics. We examine three channels potentially affecting female representation. First, using anonymized data on submissions, we show that the rate of paper acceptance for women is statistically indistinguishable from that of men. Second, we find that the share of female authors is comparable to the share of women among all tenure-track professors, but is 10 percentage points lower than the share of women among assistant professors. Finally, within conference programs, we find that when a woman organizes the program, the share of female authors and discussants is higher.

A11|Star Wars: The Empirics Strike Back|"Using 50,000 tests published in the AER, JPE, and QJE, we identify a residual in the distribution of tests that cannot be explained solely by journals favoring rejection of the null hypothesis. We observe a two-humped camel shape with missing p-values between 0.25 and 0.10 that can be retrieved just after the 0.05 threshold and represent 10-20 percent of marginally rejected tests. Our interpretation is that researchers inflate the value of just-rejected tests by choosing ""significant"" specifications. We propose a method to measure this residual and describe how it varies by article and author characteristics. (JEL A11, C13)"
A11|The Crisis in Economic Theory: A Review Essay|The Great Recession and the financial crisis of 2007-09 prompted calls for fundamental reforms of economic theory. The role of theory in economics and in recent economic events is considered in light of two recent books: the sociologist Richard Swedberg's The Art of Social Theory and the economist André Orléan's The Empire of Value: A New Foundation for Economics.
A11|Male Is a Gender, Too: A Review of Why Gender Matters in Economics by Mukesh Eswaran|Mukesh Eswaran's Why Gender Matters in Economics presents a generally well-researched review of the literature on women and economics, and admirably attempts take a global perspective. Eswaran's analysis is compromised, however, by an unreflective use of perspectives and methods that themselves, when seen in a broader perspective, reflect gendered biases. With particular reference to Eswaran's discussions of gender differences in preferences, the preferential treatment of groups, and work/family issues, this essay outlines how these biases arise, and how economic analysis must change if it is to become more rigorous.
A11|A Skeptical View of the National Science Foundation's Role in Economic Research|We can imagine a plausible case for government support of science based on traditional economic reasons of externalities and public goods. Yet when it comes to government support of grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for economic research, our sense is that many economists avoid critical questions, skimp on analysis, and move straight to advocacy. In this essay, we take a more skeptical attitude toward the efforts of the NSF to subsidize economic research. We offer two main sets of arguments. First, a key question is not whether NSF funding is justified relative to laissez-faire, but rather, what is the marginal value of NSF funding given already existing government and nongovernment support for economic research? Second, we consider whether NSF funding might more productively be shifted in various directions that remain within the legal and traditional purview of the NSF. Such alternative focuses might include data availability, prizes rather than grants, broader dissemination of economic insights, and more. Given these critiques, we suggest some possible ways in which the pattern of NSF funding, and the arguments for such funding, might be improved.
A11|The Economic History of Alexander the Great Expedition|The philosophy of Economics and economic policy were developed by Xenophon in Ancient Greece. Alexander the Great was living a little later in the 4th century B.C. and we know him as a great Hellen king, civilizer, and “forerunner”; but, he was, an excellent economist because he had to manage the economy of his enormous campaign from Greece to India and to exercise an efficient and effective public policy for his vast Empire. Also, “he desired not pleasure or wealth, but only excellence and glory”, which was the moral and ethical Greek philosophy of his time. Alexander had said that “…I am grateful to gods that I was borne Hellen…” and had all these Hellenic values, which made him one of the most important person in human history. He had shown outstanding management capabilities, with rates of salaries, health and welfare, building projects, supplies, transports, reforms of the tax system, indirect taxes and donations, loans, minting of coins, even controlling financial scandals and other information useful for our policy makers, today. We measure his budgets by using the weights of gold and silver coins and determine and compare prices by taking these information from different historians of his time. Alexander economic policy with its surpluses is very useful for our current leaders and scholars. Also, the history and the role of this extraordinary man and the contribution of the Greek civilization and language in God’s plan, for His revolted and deluded creation and humanity to be in a position to understand and accept His revelation, which Greeks were expecting since the Golden Century of Athens, is discussed.

Kritikuju se forsirana, dominantna, orkestrirana i selektivna teorijska modeliranja ekonomske stvarnosti, koja su monističkog (kvazi-neoliberalnog) i matematičko-statističkog karaktera. S tim u vezi, objašnjava se i paralelna kriza visokog obrazovanja u državama Jugoistočne Evrope (JIE), koja se pokušava neuspješno fingirati palijativnim reformama. Ukazuje se na pad akademskih etičkih standarda i manipulativna univerzitetska prilagođavanja svjetskim naučnim standardima. Polazi se od hipoteze da dugoročna istraživačka marginalizacija osnovnih ekonomskih problema i metodološka improvizacija vode ekonomsku nauku u ćorsokak. Zaključuje se da su mitologizacija nauke i fingiranje reformi visokog obrazovanja rezultat malih ulaganja u nju i institucionalne nebrige za društveni razvoj.

Academic Economics Research And Public Policy Measures|" type=""main"" xml:id=""coep12117-abs-0001""> This paper investigates whether academic research attention to certain policy-related measures (including gross domestic product, unemployment, and inflation) is correlated with empirical measurements of the measures themselves. In other words, when unemployment rises, does research attention to the matter increase? Or do economists pursue research (in the short run) relatively uninfluenced by policy shocks on the ground? Text analysis implies that economic attention to key policy terms does correlate with empirical movements of the terms in most instances; however, the stronger and more consistent correlation is between use of policy terms in the literature and discussion of them by the broader public.

Contrary to the common assumption that couples who do not live together break up, we find that living apart is a viable solution to location problems in the first year after graduate school. Surprisingly, PhDs facing moderate location problems are more likely than those facing severe location problems to make career sacrifices on behalf of their relationship; PhDs facing severe location problems are more likely to live apart.

A11|Co-authorship and Academic Productivity in Economics: Interaction Maps from the Complex Networks Approach|We explore the relationship between collaborations in writing papers and the academic productivity of economists and, particularly, we describe the magnitude and intensity of co-authorship among economists. To that end, we employ interaction maps from Complex Systems methods to study the global properties of specific networks. We use 8,253 JCR papers from ISI-WOK, published by 5,188 economists from Spanish institutions, and their co-authors, up to 8,202 researchers, from 2002 to 2014, to identify and determine the collaborative structure of economics research in Spain, with its primary communities and figures of influence. Our results indicate that centrality and productivity are correlated, particularly with respect to a local estimator of centrality (page rank), and we provide certain recommendations, such as promoting interactions among highly productive authors who have few co-authors with other researchers in their environment, or recommending that authors who may be well-positioned but minimally productive strive to improve their productivity.
A11|Identifying the Effects of Place-based Policies – Causal Evidence from Germany|The German government provides discretionary investment grants to structurally weak regions to reduce regional disparities. We use a regression discontinuity design that exploits an exogenous discrete jump in the probability of receiving investment grants to identify the causal effects of the investment grant on regional outcomes. We find positive effects for regional gross value-added and productivity growth, but no effects for employment and gross wage growth.
A11|Academic exclusion: some experiences|Abstract We describe and compare the experiences of academic exclusion of Alexander Del Mar, J.A. Hobson, and Gordon Tullock. While aspects of the circumstances differed, a common element was academic exclusion because of challenges to mainstream views. Alexander Del Mar, J.A. Hobson, and Gordon Tullock were in due course recognized for the originality and merit of their contributions, although each incurred personal costs because of the exclusion by the academic elites of their time. Our study takes us into the role of ideologically based prejudice in judgment of the worthiness of economic ideas.
A11|Dynamic entry in vertically differentiated markets|We develop a model of vertical innovation in which firms incur a market entry cost and choose a unique level of quality. Once established, firms compete for market shares, selling to consumers with heterogeneous tastes for quality. The equilibrium of the pricing game exists and is unique within our setup. Exogenous productivity growth induces firms to enter the market sequentially at the top end of the quality spectrum. A central feature of the model is that optimization problems of consecutive entrants are self-similar so that new firms enter in constant time-intervals and choose qualities that are a constant fraction higher than incumbent qualities. The asymmetries of quality choice, which inevitably arise because the quality spectrum has top and a bottom, are thus overcome by sequential entry. Our main contribution lies in handling these asymmetries.
A11|Academic Publication Uncertainty and Publishing Behavior: A Game-Theoretic Perspective|This paper incorporates publication uncertainty in a game between researchers and journal editors and examines its effects on quantity and quality of published research. A stylized differential Stackelberg game between journal editors and academic authors is considered, where authors seek to maximize satisfaction from publications, while journal editors try to enhance reputations of their journals. Publication probability depends on the number of academic journals. Results show that greater journal competition, generally leading to reduced publication uncertainty, would increase author payoffs by increasing citations and publications. However, it is not clear whether the quality of published research is enhanced. Thus, changes in competition in publishing markets have the potential to exacerbate the quantity-quantity trade offs in research markets.

A11|The Choice of Valuation Techniques in Practice: Education versus Profession|We use a survey approach to learn about valuation professionals' choices and implementations of valuation techniques in practice. The survey design allows us to control for a respondent's professional subgroup (e.g., consulting), education, experience, and valuation purpose characteristics. We find support for the 'sociological hypothesis' that profession matters more than education; different professions have different valuation cultures. Other factors are less important. There are also many commonalities across respondents. Most use both multiples and DCF, but implement DCF in a way that almost turns it into a multiples exercise. Confusion reigns with respect to interest tax shields and the WACC. Higher educational levels do not reduce the confusion. Our overall findings matter because valuation professionals function as intermediaries in the capital allocation process. The relative unimportance of education raises questions about the role and benefit of higher level finance education.
A11|Institutional conditioning of the German labour market in the face of the global economic crisis 2008–2009|Aim: The scientific objective of this study is an attempt to clarify the institutional aspects of the functioning of the labour market in Germany that are relevant to the response to the global economic crisis of 2008–2009. Motivation: The reaction of German labour market was totally different than during previous recessions and the explanation of the sources of this response constitutes the main motivation to undertake this study. The considerations rely on the thesis that it could be attributed to the institutional infrastructure combined with clever economic policy of the state and responsible behaviour of social partners. The economic theory suggests how an isolated institution functions, but in the real world they works in the whole institutional network. Therefore the broader context and some linkages are mentioned. Results: After a brief review of the main macroeconomic indicators and selected labour market institutions in Germany in comparison to the OECD countries, the labour market reforms undertaken in the period between 2002 and 2007 will be discussed. Then, selected on the basis of literature studies, institutional buffers of the labour market mitigating shocks are examined with particular emphasis on the instruments of internal flexibility, social partners’ behaviour and institutional connections of labour markets with other domains of economic order. The elements of institutional framework are subject to qualitative analysis backed up by available official statistical data.

We measure performance on the basis of a publishing productivity index which allows to account for differences in research inputs among departments. The measurement of publishing productivity index is based on counts of quality-adjusted articles per faculty using journal-weights computed over the same period with our study. Based on publishing productivity performance, comprehensive rankings are constructed at both department and country level.
A11|Mentalism Versus Behaviourism In Economics: A Philosophy-Of-Science Perspective|Behaviourism is the view that preferences, beliefs, and other mental states in social-scientific theories are nothing but constructs re-describing people’s behaviour. Mentalism is the view that they capture real phenomena, on a par with the unobservables in science, such as electrons and electromagnetic fields. While behaviourism has gone out of fashion in psychology, it remains influential in economics, especially in ‘revealed preference’ theory. We defend mentalism in economics, construed as a positive science, and show that it fits best scientific practice. We distinguish mentalism from, and reject, the radical neuroeconomic view that behaviour should be explained in terms of brain processes, as distinct from mental states.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
A11|Selected Index And Selected Journals Of Economics: Spain And Western Europe In Scopus, 2011-2015|One of the most interesting lists of selected journals of Economics research is the prestigious index SCOPUS of Elsevier, which includes a good overview at World level. We analyse some of the interesting features of this index, particularly regarding Economics research in Spain and other Western European countries. We find that, by the number of journals published and selected in the index, the most outstanding countries are the United Kingdom (165) and the Netherlands (75). This agrees with the main role of the English language and the important activity of academic publishers of English journals in those countries. There is also an interesting number of selected journals published in Germany(33), Spain(14) and France (7) and a few ones published in other countries: Ireland, Italy, Switzerland, Greece, Belgium, Austria, Finland and Cyprus. We list the selected journals of Spain, accordingly to the ranking SJR of Scimago, based on citations in this prestigious index. We find 5 Spanish journals which, fortunately, have reached the Q3 level and 9 the Q4 level of Western Europe. Belonging to any of both groups is important, as a very positive sign of distinction, because this index is highly selective including only around 20% of academic journals of Economics research published in Spain. We also analyse the important role that selected Economics journals have to foster better economic policies, in order to reach higher levels of economic development and quality of life, and we call for improvements in institutional and social support to Economics research in Spain as well as in the European Union.
A11|Economics: An elite subject soon only available in elite universities?|There are some alarming stories coming out of the UK about the state of academic economics there. It appears that “economics” is becoming an elite subject for elite UK universities. This paper examines the Australian situation to see if similar patterns exist. This paper considers the trends in the availability of economics degrees across the nations and looks at the implications of these trends in Australia in terms of research outcomes, teaching and learning and the impacts on socio-economic opportunity. The similarities between the UK and Australian situation are disturbing and present a challenge to economists, and to the economics community and society as a whole.
A11|Could the Icelandic banking collapse of 2008 have been prevented? The role of economists prior to the crisis|In 2008, the three main banks in Iceland collapsed. There is strong evidence that the banks would have become insolvent even without the subprime crisis. Yet there was a marked difference in opinion at the time about the viability of the Icelandic banks. A clean bill of health was given by the commissioned reports of Mishkin in 2007 and Portes in 2008, just prior to the collapse, whereas severe reservations about the Icelandic financial system were expressed by Wade, inter alios. These contrasting views were widely debated and may well have influenced both potential and actual foreign depositors in the banks. This paper analyses the disparate arguments put forward and contrasts it with the actual outcome. It considers the influence of economists in public policy debates and draws some methodological conclusions.

A number of economists have noted recent problems with overestimates of actual GDP in recent years in Greece, and the IMF’s own research has found that the multipliers associated with fiscal tightening had been underestimated. But the policy and political implications of potential GDP estimates, which are not only forecasts but also continuously revised for past estimates, may be even more important.
A11|How to Attract an Audience at a Conference: Paper, Person or Place?|We analyze the drivers of the size of the audience and number of questions asked in parallel sessions at the annual conference of the German Economics Association. We find that the location of the presentation is at least as important for the number of academics attending a talk as the combined effect of the person presenting and the paper presented. Being a presenter in a late morning session on the second day of a conference, close to the place where coffee is served, significantly increases the size of the audience. When it comes to asking questions, location becomes less important, but smaller rooms lead to more questions being asked (by women). Younger researchers as well as very senior researchers attract more questions and comments. There are also interesting gender effects. Women attend research sessions more diligently than men, but seem to ask fewer questions than men. Men are less likely to attend presentations on health, education, welfare, and development economics than women. Our findings suggest that strategic scheduling of sessions could ensure better participation at conferences. Moreover, different behaviors of men and women at conferences might also contribute to the lack of women in senior scientist positions.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

Looking at the success of China and other countries, India has tried to replicate the â€˜zoneâ€™ concept by enacting special economic zones (SEZs) policy in 2005. The present article attempts to study different types of fiscal incentives given to the firms in SEZs and their impact on the performance through survey-cum-interview method. The research reveals that there is a need to modify the structure of present incentives to tap its full benefit.
A11|Trade Openness, Size of Economy and the Savingâ€“Investment Relationship: A Dynamic Analysis for Pakistan|The main objective of this study is to examine the savingâ€“investment relationship with the size of economy and trade openness in Pakistan during the period 1960â€“2011. For this purpose, the study employed vector auto-regression (VAR) to check simultaneity among trade openness, economic growth and savingâ€“investment. Findings of the study confirm a significant positive relationship among trade openness, economic growth, saving and investment of Pakistan in the long run, but these do not establish a significant short-run relationship among trade openness, economic growth, savings and investment. In light of empirical results, the present study suggests that external sector development should be given due importance. For this purpose, the availability of credit should be enhanced properly. This will not only increase the saving rate in the country but also enhance domestic investment. JEL Classification: A11, B12, C13, D14

Albania as it is often characterized as a country with an unstable economic situation, it is faced with serious issues as unemployment rate increase. Employment rate increase for a country is stated as the region?s indicator of prosperity and development. The region of Vlora is one of the biggest in Albania and as such has given its share on natural and human resources contributing to constant evolution and growth in the employment market, but unfortunately not all is done to utilize what?s necessary. The aim of this article is to highlight the extent of unemployment as a growing occurrence, based its statistical analysis. A thorough analysis of the unemployment by age, gender and professional structure will be outlined. The purpose of this study will be accomplished following the statistical methods, analysis, and synthesis of the labour market for the region of Vlora.

The feeling is one of lack of vision on the part of Governments, of improvisation, of passive reaction, such as seeing and doing. One feels that the economic context is worn out , dysfunctional because of deep recovery problems. The perception, not far from the taugh reality, is that of a national competition meant to minimize losses caused by the financial crisis and to use beggar thy neighbor types of policies, similar to finding the way out of the crisis on the expense of others.
A11|The Superiority of Economists|In this essay, we analyze the dominant position of economics within the network of the social sciences in the United States. We begin by documenting the relative insularity of economics, using bibliometric data. Next we analyze the tight management of the field from the top down, which gives economics its characteristic hierarchical structure. Economists also distinguish themselves from other social scientists through their much better material situation (many teach in business schools, have external consulting activities), their more individualist worldviews, and their confidence in their discipline’s ability to fix the world’s problems. Taken together, these traits constitute what we call the superiority of economists, where economists’ objective supremacy is intimately linked with their subjective sense of authority and entitlement. While this superiority has certainly fueled economists’ practical involvement and their considerable influence over the economy, it has also exposed them more to conflicts of interests, political critique, even derision.

A11|Welchen Einfluss haben Wissenschaftler in Medien und auf die Wirtschaftspolitik?|The “FAZ Economists Ranking”, which considers not only economists’ research output but also their political and public influence, shows that there are very few economists currently doing research that has been taken up widely in the research community, in the media and by policy makers. The paper presents sensitivity analyses and evidence about the influence of non-economists. One could argue that the quality of research output does not significantly determine the impact of research on policy, media and decision makers. However, even if one reduces the weight of the quality of research output in the overall indicator, the rankings change only minimally. Furthermore, compared to economists, the influence of non-economists on economic policy is marginal. Copyright ZBW and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015
A11|Sachverständigenrat — Wie politiknah sollte die Beratung sein?|The German Council of Economic Experts (GCEE) has the legal mandate to independently assess the state of the German economy, to formulate its expert opinion regarding issues of economic policy and to alert readers to any undesirable developments which threaten to arise in this context. While this might not always be easily palatable for representatives from the political realm, the GCEE bases its analyses transparently on the current state of the economic literature and on empirical evidence to contribute to the formation of an informed judgement regarding economic policy issues among policy makers, economic actors and the general public. The GCEE’s function is to offer advice to the government and provide information to the public. A survey of politicians and ministry officials shows that this advice is valued by the respondents. However, the members of the council are barely visible in the media and therefore contribute only minimally to the effective information of the broader public. One reason for this shortcoming is that fulfilling both duties is hardly possible from an institutional economics perspective. A useful comparison can be made with the the Netherlands, where the CPB, the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis — a government-financed but independent institution — has played a central role in forecasting economic developments and in analysing the consequences of policy changes in the Netherlands.

A11|Happiness of economists| We study the importance of economists' professional situation towards their life satisfaction based on a unique survey of mostly academic economists. On average, economists report to be highly happy with life. Satisfaction is positively related to spending more time on doing research. The lack of a tenured position decreases satisfaction. However, the extent to which the uncertainty created by the tenure system affects satisfaction varies with the contract terms. The effect is stronger if the contract expires in the near future or cannot be extended. Publication success has no effect if it is controlled for academic rank and the contract duration. The finding suggests that publications are rather a means to an end, for example, to acquire a tenured position. While the perceived level of external pressure also has no impact, the perceived change of pressure in recent years is positively related to economists' life satisfaction. An explanation is that economists have accepted a high level of pressure when entering academia but are not willing to cope with the recent increase.
A11|What Did We Learn from the Financial Crisis, the Great Recession, and the Pathetic Recovery?| This article comes in three parts. Part 1 reviews a few pertinent facts about the stunning economic events that have occurred in the United States (and elsewhere) since 2007. The author chose these particular facts from among many for their relevance to the rest of the article. The next two parts take up, first, some of the key lessons that professional economists should have learned from the crisis and its aftermath and second, some important lessons for teaching economics (especially but not exclusively macroeconomics). The two categories of lessons overlap a bit, but it is perhaps surprising how different they are.

A11|Teorie economiche e scelte di politica economica: un approccio storicistico|"The principal objective of the article is to show how the economic theory is not an exact science. It does no't have universal value and it is not just link to mathematics, because it does not make itself as a scientific discipline. For this economics has not to use too much mathematics to imitate the exact sciences, The approach that we would like to propose in this article is a "" historicist "" vision of the economic theories. It wants to be more pragmaticas and less dogmatic to the advantage to deliver unassailable theories from economists, but simply ideas with solid scientific bases and supported by some statistic bases. It represents exactly what a policy maker needs to make decision in a right historical moment."
A11|Wissenschaftliches Fehlverhalten und der Ethikkodex des Vereins für Socialpolitik|In response to recent negative publicity within and outside the economics profession, the Verein für Socialpolitik instituted a Code of Ethics for its members in 2012. The Code is based on central three principles of transparency, objectivity, and fairness. This essay presents a rationalization of these principles and points to a number of practical aspects of ethical behavior in economics addressed by the Code, which relies more on social norms and common sense rather than on adjudicable rules. The behavior of institutions, however, is only indirectly addressed; given recent trends in corporate sponsoring of academic activities, there may be good reasons to adapt and further refine the scope of its provisions. The ultimate impact of the Verein’s new Code of Ethics on its members’ behavior remains to be seen.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
A11|Norms and Team Formation: Evidence from Research Partnerships|Scientific, artistic, and professional work is increasingly performed in groups. In this study, we seek to understand the extent to which norms influence the composition of such groups. In particular, we analyze the effect of the alphabetical norm in academic citations on the composition of research teams in economics. First, we present a model of endogenous team formation given the alphabetical norm and analyze the effect of the norm on the desirability of any two individuals to conduct a joint project. We then examine the last names of co-authors from nearly 100 academic journals and find a significant difference between the matching behavior of authors who obey the alphabetical norm relative to authors who violate the norm. We interpret this finding as evidence that the alphabetical norm results in distortion of the composition of research teams.
A11|Public Revenues And Social Polarization In Romania|Romania's public revenues to GDP are among the lowest in the EU, 34% of GDP in 2014 due to tax evasion, and the structure of GDP, some components which are not subject of taxation or taxed less. A low percentage of government revenue in GDP can be a positive factor for a functional market economy that allow more financing sources for investments in private sector. However, tax evasion is very dangerous for the economy because the tax burden is borne only by the fair of economic agents which may go in bankrupt or cannot develop. GDP per capita in Romania is less than a quarter of the EU average. Social polarization is high in Romania, the Gini coefficient is quite high for Romania, 34% in 2013, which demonstrates the high degree of poverty for some social categories. Aligning EU prices for electricity and gas can generate lower standard of living and serious social tensions.
A11|Approach To The Structural Institutionalism|The reality today highlights the need for state intervention in the economy agent, but supported and in collaboration with academia and private economic environments in order to prevent and mitigate structural imbalances, and the flattening effects of a fluctuating economic cyclicality. This complies with the spirit logic of economic organization, to reduce the vulnerability of the entire business environment and finding answers point for maintaining and enhancing the performance of the national economy and, consequently, the business environment under current conditions they pervades humanity.
A11|Budget Elaboration In Austria|The classic annual budget should pass the floor to a multi-annual budget to accommodate the financial perspective of the EU budget because annual budget is currently used unresponsive for multiannual financing of European projects. Multiannual budget should be designed both the commitment and payment appropriations to be able to have a cash flow that does not lead to cash shortages. A modern budget consistent with the requirements of deepening European integration should meet the following conditions: a) applying generalized budgetary classification ESA (European Standard of Accounts) or GFS; b) an orderly progression of budgetary expenditure, the monthly budget deficit; c) balance the budget should be made cyclically in the recession have made higher expenses and budget deficits within 3% of GDP, while in periods of economic boom, the budget should have surplus or in balance ; d) a multiannual budget programs should be implemented based on ceilings and margins in commitment appropriations and budget appropriations; e) use of objective methods for ranking projects budget; f) Macroeconomic indicators on which it is built are often inflated budget on the revenue side in order to cover some sensitive expenditure; g) institution that assess these macroeconomic indicators should be independent of government, preferably from specialists or experts from Academy or foreigners as in Austria.
A11|English Proficiency And Labor Market Performance: Evidence From The Economics Profession|This paper investigates whether the global spread of the English language provides an inherent advantage to native English speakers. This question is studied within the context of the economics profession, where the impact of being a native English speaker on future publishing success is examined. English speakers may have an advantage since they are writing in their native language, the quality of writing is a crucial determinant of publishing success, and all the top economics journals are published in English. Using a ranking of the world's top 2.5% of economists, this paper confirms that native English speakers are ranked 100 spots higher (better) than similar non-native English speakers. A variety of extensions examine and dispel other potential explanations.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
A11|Teaching the economic way of thinking through Op-eds|There are many goals an instructor may wish to accomplish in a course on economic principles. For us one goal should be the education of a generation of sensible and active members of civil society. This is an ambitious goal: it requires that students internalize the economic way of thinking and learn to exercise active citizenry. After experimenting with a variety of methods, we have concluded that requiring students to write an op-ed is the most conducive to the development of the economic way of thinking. Here we share what we have learned in the process, hoping that the pedagogical capability of writing an op-ed will encourage others to adopt the assignment into their classrooms.
A11|Attracting Attentive Academics. Paper, Person or Place?|We examine the determinants of the number of attendees and questions and comments in parallel sessions at a large economics conference. We use the annual meeting of the German economics association in 2012 in G ttingen as an empirical case study. We find that the place (close to the coffee and before lunch) of the presentation is most important for attendance, whereas the person and the paper presented has a minor effect on other academics attending the presentation. However, papers with long titles as well as those by junior researchers attract significantly fewer attendees. There are also interesting and sizable gender effects. Sessions by female presenters are frequented more, but mainly because more women attend sessions in general, and sessions with female presenters in particular. Female researchers are also interested in different topics than male researchers. When it comes to asking questions, location becomes less important, but smaller rooms lead to more questions asked. Younger researchers attract more questions. Women ask fewer questions, but a large share of women increases the likelihood of a woman to ask a question. Our findings suggest that scheduling sessions should be taken more seriously to ensure better participation at conferences, and to take into account differences in preferences between men and female researchers.
A11|What happened to heterodox economics in Germany after the 1970s|In the context of ongoing criticisms of the lack of pluralism in economics, the present article aims to discuss the development of 'heterodox' economics since the 1970s. Following Lakatos's concept of scientific research programs (srp), and concentrating on the situation in Germany, the article will discuss classifications of economics, and will specify the understanding of diversity in the light of 'axiomatic variations' of the economic mainstream. This will form the basis for the subsequent description of the development of heterodoxy in Germany, with special reference to the founding of new universities and the reform movements in the 1970s. It can be shown that the heterodox scene flourished in this period, but that this pluralization remained fragmented and short-lived; by the 1980s at the latest heterodoxy was again on its way to marginalization. The history of heterodoxy in Germany thus presents itself as an unequal 'battle of the paradigms', and can only be told as the story of a failure.
A11|Bildung für verantwortungsbewusstes Unternehmertum: Das Beispiel der Cusanus Hochschule|Trotz aller Härte des ökonomischen, politischen und gesellschaftlichen Wettbewerbs realisieren viele Unternehmer auch heute noch selbstverständlich eine sozial und ökologisch orientierte Unternehmens- und Mitarbeiterführung auf einer soliden wirtschaftlichen Basis. Sie gestalten Unternehmenskulturen, die etwa auf Kooperation, Fairness und Verantwortung beruhen - sei dies in Familienunternehmen, kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen oder in Großunternehmen. In diesem Beitrag zeige ich, wie Bildung zu einer wesentlichen Quelle für eine solche Gestaltung werden kann. Damit beziehe ich mich insbesondere auf die höhere Bildung, also das Studium an Hochschulen und Universitäten und wende mich exemplarisch den Anliegen und Aktivitäten der Cusanus Hochschule zu.

Sie liegt in vier Bereichen: (1) seinem prägenden Einfluss auf Milton Friedman und auf die Chicagoer Schule, (2) der Errichtung internationaler Netzwerke, die das Ziel verfolgten, die Gesellschaft als ganzes zu verändern; auch seine theoretischen Schriften folgten diesem Anliegen. (3) Daraus resultieren globale Netzwerke, die über beachtlichen und wachsenden Einfluss verfügten und immer noch verfügen sowie (4): Die Etablierung einer Rhetorik ""des Marktes"" (in der Einzahl), die heute mit großer Selbstverständlichkeit sowohl in der ökonomischen Theorie als auch in der Politik und im Alltag Verwendung findet."

A11|Zu wenig Einfluss des ökonomischen Sachverstands? Empirische Befunde zum Einfluss von Ökonomen und anderen Wissenschaftlern auf die Wirtschaftspolitik|Das Papier zeigt, dass die seit Jahrzehnten andauernde Klagen wissenschaftlich tätiger Ökonomen,dass Öffentlichkeit und Politik nicht genug auf Ergebnisse der ökonomischen Forschung hören,zumindest für Deutschland im Quervergleich zu anderen Wissenschaften in Bezug auf das medialeInteressen an ökonomischen Erkenntnissen nicht gerechtfertigt sind. Es wird in bemerkenswerterWeise von der Resonanz kontrastiert, die Ökonomen in Deutschland im Vergleich zu anderenWissenschaftlern in den Medien genießen. Auch in Kreisen wirtschaftspolitischerEntscheidungsträger finden Ökonomen deutlich mehr Gehör als Nicht-Ökonomen. Keine andereWissenschaft erreicht in den Medien und bei Wirtschaftspolitikern auch nur annährend die gleicheAufmerksamkeit wie die Ökonomie. Die empirische Evidenz zeigt zugleich aber auch, dass Aussagenwissenschaftlicher Experten in den Medien in der Regel nur etwa ein bis zwei Prozent aller Aussagenausmachen. Damit bleiben nahezu alle Experten unterhalb der Wahrnehmungsschwelle für dasbreitere Publikum und entfalten so kaum öffentliche Wirkung.
A11|Quo Vadis German Scholarly Communication in Economics?|In this paper we study the situation of scholarly communication in Economics and Business Studies in Germany. We combine findings from an online survey, focus group interviews and a panel discussion. Some of the results of the survey are that economists at German universities and research institutes most frequently use the online encyclopedia Wikipedia, content sharing services, video and image hosting services as well as video conferencing systems. In a professional context, economists primarily use highly specialized tools such as learning management and reference management systems. Almost one in three German economists is active in academic and professional networks such as ResearchGate or Xing (Siegfried et al. 2015). Focus group interviews and panel discussion reveal that social media content and platforms are mainly used passively but acknowledged for serendipitously finding interesting research papers. They are also valuable for staying up-to-date on the discussion of current economic issues. Scholarly communication and scientific discourse with colleagues from Economics and Business Studies does, however, not yet take place essentially on social media platforms.

Hauptsatz der Thermodynamik, die Philosophie und die gesellschaftliche Praxis: Eine Neubetrachtung|"Der Autor registriert, dass die Menge der verantwortungsbewusst denkenden Menschen in zunehmendem Maße fühlt, dass offenbar in der menschlichen Gesellschaft - weltweit wie auch in Deutschland - ""vieles klemmt"", ohne schlüssige Änderungsvorschläge unterbreiten zu können, was übrigens auch für die Wissenschaft gilt. Und auch die Grundlagenwissenschaft Philosophie hat mit Blick auf die Grundlagen mehr offene Fragen, als der Normalbürger vermutet. Im Beitrag wird gezeigt, wie eine neuartige Betrachtung naturgesetzlicher Zusammenhänge - speziell des II. Hauptsatzes der Thermodynamik - zu einem Naturprinzip führt, das das evolutionäre Verhalten der Natur plausibel werden lässt und - bei bewusster Anwendung - für eine menschgerechte Evolution der Gesellschaft wichtige Hinweise abzuleiten gestattet. Dass das beim heutigen Entwicklungsstand der Gesellschaft vorwiegend den Bereich Technik/Wirtschaft betrifft und die Politik fordert, versteht sich von selbst."
A11|What have economists been doing for the last 50 years? A text analysis of published academic research from 1960-2010|"This paper presents the results of a text based exploratory study of over 20,000 academic articles published in seven top research journals from 1960 - 2010. The goal is to investigate the general research foci of economists over the last fifty years, how (if at all) they have changed over time, and what trends (if any) can be discerned from a broad body of the top academic research in the field. Of the 19 JEL-code based fields studied in the literature, most have retained a constant level of attention over the time period of this study, however, a notable exception is that of macroeconomics which has undergone a significantly diminishing level of research attention in the last couple of decades, across all the journals under study; at the same time, the ""microfoundations"" of macroeconomic papers appears to be increasing. Other results on co-authorship trends and depth of research articles are also presented."
A11|Die Analyse kausaler Effekte wirtschaftspolitischer Maßnahmen – Das Zentrum für evidenzbasierte Politikberatung am IWH (IWH-CEP)|In Deutschland besteht ein enormer Bedarf an evidenzbasierter Politikberatung. Viele wirtschaftspolitische Interventionen werden bislang nicht umfassend evaluiert, und falls doch, wenden die wenigsten Untersuchungen geeignete Verfahren der Kausalanalyse an, um einen ursächlichen Zusammenhang zwischen der Intervention und dem Erreichen von wirtschaftspolitischen Zielen zu identifizieren. Das Leibniz-Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung Halle hat für diese Aufgabe das Zentrum für evidenzbasierte Politikberatung (IWH-CEP) eingerichtet. Eine Pilotstudie zu den Wirkungen der betrieblichen Investitionsförderung ist bereits angelaufen.
A11|How to apply as a doctoral student in Germany?|There are some peculiarities for applying as a doctoral student in Germany. The aim of this paper is to explain the most important ones for foreign graduates considering doctoral studies in Germany. Doctoral studies are free in Germany and one can get even a paid job at the university or a stipend while writing one's dissertation. There are some formal requirements for doctoral students but it is most important to convince a professor to accept one. For this end and in one's own interest it is decisive to look for a good match, particularly similar research interests.
A11|Mathiness in the Theory of Economic Growth|Mathiness lets academic politics masquerade as science. Like mathematical theory, mathiness uses a mixture of words and symbols, but instead of making tight links, it leaves ample room for slippage between statements in the languages of words as opposed to symbols, and between statements with theoretical as opposed to empirical content. Because it is difficult to distinguish machines from mathematical theory, the market for lemons tells us that the market for mathematical theory might collapse, leaving only machines as entertainment that is worth little but cheap to produce.
A11|A Review of William Easterly's The Tyranny of Experts: Economists, Dictators, and the Forgotten Rights of the Poor|William Easterly marshals yet another brilliant critique of established development policies, with a focus on the experts' excessive focus on state-led policies and goals (à la Myrdal) and ignorance of bottom-up solutions, including technology and individual rights (à la Hayek). It suggests a world where success occurs in spite of nation-states. Yet not all bottom-up leads to success, and the worst disasters, as in civil violence, occur where states fail. Easterly highlights the important links between success and individual freedom and opportunity. He fails to note that myriad impoverished individuals cannot exercise these freedoms due to low expectations or compromised rights. ( JEL A11, D82, E61, I23, O10, O40)
A11|Learning from Failure: A Review of Peter Schuck's Why Government Fails So Often: And How It Can Do Better|"Peter Schuck catalogs an overwhelming list of US government failures. He points to both structural problems (culture and institutions) and incentives. Despairing of cultural change, Schuck focuses on incentives. He relies on Charles Wolf's theory of nonmarket failures in which ""internalities"" replace the heavily-studied market failure from externalities (Wolf 1979). Internalities are evidence of a discord between the public goals by which a program is defended and the private goals of its administrators. What might economists contribute? We suggest that economists have neglected internalities because they take group goals as exogenously determined and we defend an alternative tradition in which group goals are endogenously determined.

A11|Online publishing and citation success in the accounting, business and economic history of Spain, 1997–2011|This paper examines the factors determining the citation success of authors who have published via the Internet on the economic and business history of Spain. It departs from the dominant cross-sectional approach to the quantitative assessment of citation success by using a 15-year time series analysis of peer-reviewed Spanish and Latin American outlets. Moreover, it considers working papers published online, and assesses the role of Spanish as a medium to communicate with an international audience. Our results suggest a high concentration of publications and citations for a small number of authors (including non-residents) and the importance of local journals in citation success. Besides offering suggestions on how to improve scientific impact, our citation analysis also sheds light on the state of the field of economic and business history in Spanish economic circles and attests the role of Spain as an intermediate country in the production and diffusion of scientific knowledge.

A11|Is Economics A House Divided? Analysis Of Citation Networks| We investigate divisions within the citation network in economics using citation data between 1990 and 2010. We consider all partitions of top institutions into two equal-sized clusters and pick the one that minimizes cross-cluster citations. The strongest division is much stronger than could be expected to be found under idiosyncratic citation patterns and is consistent with the reputed freshwater/saltwater division in macroeconomics. The division is stable over time but varies across the fields of economics . ( JEL A11, D85, I23)

A11|Economics and Its Discontents|In contrast to its historical origins as a part of moral philosophy, and subsequent evolution as “political economy”, economics in recent decades has self-defined its scope of inquiry increasingly narrowly. And, as is well known, over time the field has imposed on itself ever more rigorous standards of analytical formalization. Both trends are understandable, but each comes at high cost. Moreover, the formalization requirement is often imposed arbitrarily, excluding some dimensions from the analysis because they are hard to formalize while admitting others without question. As a result, the field has been largely unable to address some of the first-magnitude problems the Western economies now face. / Im Gegensatz zu seinen historischen Ursprüngen zunächst als Teil der Moralphilosophie und dann in ihrer Entwicklung zur ,Politischen Ökonomie‘ hat die Wirtschaftswissenschaft ihr selbstdefiniertes Erkenntnisfeld zunehmend eingeengt. Auch hat sie sich, wie allgemein bekannt, immer rigorosere formal-analytische Standards gegeben. Beide Entwicklungen sind nachvollziehbar, aber mit Kosten verbunden. Außerdem werden die formalen Anforderungen häufig willkürlich aufgezwungen, womit einige Analysedimensionen nur deshalb ausgeschlossen werden, weil sie schwer zu formalisieren sind, während andere Dimensionen ohne weiteres Hinterfragen akzeptiert werden. Das Ergebnis ist, dass die Wirtschaftswissenschaften sich als weitgehend unfähig erwiesen haben, einige der drängendsten Probleme westlicher Volkswirtschaften zu adressieren.

A11|Chinese universities economic research output 2000–2010|This study analyses the publishing output of Chinese authors in a group of leading economics journals over the period 2000–2010. We find that the output distribution across institutions is unevenly distributed, but within institutions there is a relatively more even spread. Research output has more than doubled over the period and is comparable with South Korean and Japanese output. Authors associated with US institutions have been an important source of research output growth. However, domestic output has also been increasing. Econometrics is the main field of output growth.
A11|Journal impact factors and month of publication|A growing literature examines the reliability of commonly used metrics for journal quality, such as journal impact factors. The present paper shows that month of publication can have a significant impact on the number of times an article is cited in the two years following publication. Combined with existing research, this finding suggests economics departments should rely less on these commonly used measures of journal quality when making tenure and promotion decisions and focus more effort on direct assessments of the faculty member’s work. Given the shift towards online dissemination, the findings also suggest publishers should consider moving to a more frequent publication schedule in order to disseminate the research in a more timely fashion.
A11|Divided opinion on the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2013: Random or systematic differences?|This paper analyses economists’ support for the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2013.

A11|Do scholars in Economics and Finance react to alphabetical discrimination?|Prior literature has documented that the academic success of scholars in Economics partially depends on their surname initials’ position in the alphabet. This alphabetical discrimination is said to be mainly triggered by the alphabetical name-ordering rule prevalent in scholarly journals. We test whether scholars react to alphabetical discrimination for Economics as well as for Finance, where such discrimination has hitherto not been analyzed. We show that Economics scholars late in the alphabet seem to react to alphabetical discrimination as they refrain from publishing articles with three or more authors. In Finance, however, we do not find evidence of strategic co-authoring.
A11|What added value do estate agents offer compared to FSBO transactions? Explanation from a perceived advantages model|This paper aims to explain the determinants of using an estate agent vs. conducting a private sale on the French housing market. A survey that collected 3992 responses relating to completed transactions showed that the decision of whether or not to use an estate agent is not explained by the physical or spatial features of the property or socio-demographic variables, but rather by buyers’ and sellers’ perceptions, i.e. perceived advantages of brokerage services in terms of expected relevant outcome, efficient process, psychological security and social facilitation. These results may help brokers to differentiate from FSBO in a context of freely-available information.
A11|Which factors drive the decision to opt out of individual research rankings? An empirical study of academic resistance to change|Quantitative measures of research output, especially bibliometric measures, have not only been introduced within research funding systems in many countries, but they are also increasingly used in the media to construct rankings of universities, faculties and even individual scientists. In almost all countries, in which significant attempts have been made to quantify research output, parts of the scientific community have criticized the specific procedures used or even protested against them. In 2012, a significant fraction of German business scholars has even opted out of the most important German research ranking for business and economics which is conducted by the Germany's leading business daily Handelsblatt. Using this example, we show that observed resistance to change can consistently be explained by observable factors related to individual cost and benefits of the concerned researchers. We present empirical evidence consistent with the hypothesis that those scholars for whom the costs of a change in evaluation methods exceed the expected benefits are more likely to boycott the ranking exercise.
