G40|Cash in Hand and Savings Decisions|Cash is an important means of transaction, generally assumed to be fungible. However, behavioral economics and consumer research show that \'cash in hand\', physically holding on to cash and then handing it away, affects purchasing decisions. I study how cash in hand influences decisions in a different but very important domain: savings. Savings accounts are a promising tool for reducing poverty, but the use of savings accounts is often puzzlingly low. Holding on to cash that needs to be physically deposited into a savings account may increase the psychological costs of saving. This study experimentally identifies the causal effect of cash in hand on savings deposits of microfinance clients in the Philippines. In contrast to many laboratory and several field studies with similar interventions, I do not find reduced savings deposits due to cash in hand. I discuss reasons for and consequence of this surprising finding, in particular for developing economics where lots of transactions are still cash-based.
G40|Who Is Successful in Foreign Exchange Margin Trading? New Survey Evidence from Japan|We use a 2018 survey of FX margin traders in Japan to investigate which key factors influence their performance: socio-demographic and economic situation, investment strategy and trading behaviour, and/or financial literacy. First, the data show that variables from all three groups are significant predictors of traders’ performance. Second, we find that older traders and those without a specific trading strategy demonstrate lower performance. Performance is higher for those who trade greater amounts, rely more on fundamental analysis, and report having profitable FX trade skills. Third, respondents’ subjectively stated claim of having FX trade skills is based on a more advanced understanding of FX trading and a reliance on professional advice. Neither objective financial knowledge nor over/underconfidence play a noteworthy role in the performance of margin traders.
G40|Herding behaviour in an emerging market: Evidence from the Moscow Exchange|This study investigates the extent to which herding towards the market consensus for Russian stocks is driven by fundamental and non-fundamental factors. We find evidence that investors on the Moscow Exchange herd without any reference to fundamentals during unanticipated financial crises coupled with high uncertainty, in falling markets, and during days with extreme upward oil price movements. The results indicate that companies with less transparent information environment, proxied by company size and the number of analysts following the company, are more prone to herding driven by non-fundamental factors. This herding behaviour temporarily impedes the incorporation of all relevant fundamental information into stock prices and diverts the market from its efficient state. In contrast, in periods of high liquidity and on days of international sanction announcements during the Ukrainian crisis herding behaviour is merely driven by fundamentals. In Russia, macroeconomic news releases induce both information-related herding and herding without any reference to fundamentals. These results suggest that motives of investors herding behaviour vary under specific market conditions and share characteristics.
G40|Costs of Natural Disasters in Public Financing|We document the dynamics of primary municipal bond (muni) markets after severe natural disasters. We find that yields of muni issuance increase significantly in the first three months after disasters. Disasters have little effect on issuersâ€™ credit risk but can temporarily reduce investorsâ€™ demand, which is consistent with the salience theory of choice (Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer, 2012). Natural disasters significantly increase the proceeds from muni issuances. Reacting to the larger financing costs, muni issuers use shorter maturity and a less complex structure to offset the larger financing costs. The higher yields after disasters provide speculation opportunities.

Methodology/Technique - The population of this research consist of manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX) from 2014 to 2016. This research uses 3 recent years and adds variables that have not been used in prior research. The sample of this research is chosen using a purposive sampling method. Finding - The hypothesis is tested by multiple regressions using an Eviews program to investigate the influence between each independent variable to earnings management. Novelty - The hypothesis is tested by multiple regressions using an Eviews program to investigate the influence between each independent variable to earnings management. Type of Paper - Empirical
G40|Gain/Loss Asymmetric Stochastic Differential Utility|This study examines a gain/loss asymmetric utility in continuous time in which the investor discounts their utility gain by more than the utility loss. By employing the theory of stochastic di erential utility, the model allows a time-variable sub- jective discount rate. In addition, the model can express various forms of utility functions including a version of the Epstein{Zin utility. Under the model, the opti- mal consumption/wealth ratio and portfolio weight have di erent functional forms depending on whether the state variables stay in some region.

G40|Factor Momentum and the Momentum Factor|Momentum in individual stock returns emanates from momentum in factor returns. Most factors are positively autocorrelated: the average factor earns a monthly return of 1 basis point following a year of losses and 53 basis points following a positive year. Factor momentum explains all forms of individual stock momentum. Stock momentum strategies indirectly time factors: they profit when the factors remain autocorrelated, and crash when these autocorrelations break down. Our key result is that momentum is not a distinct risk factor; it aggregates the autocorrelations found in all other factors.
G40|Reflexivity in Credit Markets|"Reflexivity is the idea that investors' biased beliefs affect market outcomes, and that market outcomes in turn affect investors' beliefs. We develop a behavioral model of the credit cycle featuring such a two-way feedback loop. In our model, investors form beliefs about firms' creditworthiness, in part, by extrapolating past default rates. Investor beliefs influence firms' actual creditworthiness because firms that can refinance maturing debt on favorable terms are less likely to default in the short-run—even if fundamentals do not justify investors' generosity. Our model is able to match many features of credit booms and busts, including the imperfect synchronization of credit cycles with the real economy, the negative relationship between past credit growth and the future return on risky bonds, and ""calm before the storm"" periods in which firm fundamentals have deteriorated but the credit market has not yet turned."
G40|Earn More Tomorrow: Overconfident Income Expectations and Consumer Indebtedness|This paper examines whether biased income expectations due to overconfidence lead to higher levels of debt-taking. In a lab experiment, participants can purchase goods by borrowing against their future income. We exogenously manipulate income expectations by letting income depend on relative performance in hard and easy quiz tasks. We successfully generate biased income expectations and show that participants with higher income expectations initially borrow more. Overconfident participants scale back their consumption after feedback. However, at the end of the experiment they remain with higher debt levels, which represent real financial losses. To assess the external validity, we nd further evidence for the link between overcondence and borrowing behavior in a representative survey (GSOEP-IS).

G40|Credit Default Swap Regulation in Experimental Bond Markets|Credit default swaps (CDS) played an important role in the financial crisis of 2008. While CDS can be used to hedge risks, they can also be used for speculative purposes (as occurred during the financial crisis) and regulations have been proposed to limit such speculative use. Here, we provide the first controlled experiment analyzing the pricing of credit default swaps in a bond market subject to default risk. We further use the laboratory as a testbed to analyze CDS regulation. Our results show that the regulation achieves the goal of increasing the use of CDS for hedging purposes while reducing the use of CDS for speculation. This success does not come at the expense of lower bond IPO revenues and does not negatively affect CDS prices or bond prices in the secondary market.
G40|A Social Norm Nudge to Save More: A Field Experiment at a Retail Bank|A large fraction of households have very little savings buffer and are therefore vulnerable to financial shocks. We examine whether a social norm nudge can stimulate such households to save more by running a small-scale survey experiment and a large-scale field experiment at a retail bank in the Netherlands. The survey experiment shows that a social norm nudge increases intended savings. In line with this, we find in our field experiment that households who are exposed to the social norm nudge click more often on a link to a personal webpage where they can start or adjust an automatic savings plan. However, analyzing detailed bank data, we find no treatment effect on actual savings, neither in the short run nor in the long run. Our null findings are quite precisely estimated.
G40| Does sentiment harm market efficiency? An empirical analysis using a betting exchange setting| This paper investigates whether the sentimental preferences of investors influence market efficiency. We use a betting exchange market environment to analyze the influence of sentimental bettors on market efficiency in 2,333 soccer matches played between 2006-2014 during the last three hours of the pre-play period. Contrary to bookmaker markets, there is no intermediary in a betting exchange and, thus, the market prices solely reflect the beliefs of person to person betting. We use three different proxy variables to measure the bettor sentiment and find that price changes are more likely to be inefficient for betting events that are more prone to sentiment. Based on that finding, we propose a trading strategy that generates positive returns before considering the transaction costs and commission fees. Although the returns turn negative after considering the transaction costs and commission fees, the proposed trading strategy still outperforms a random betting strategy.
G40|Family first? Nepotism and corporate investment|Nepotism emerges in a multiplicity of contexts from political assignments to firm hiring decisions, but what are its real effects on the economy? This paper explores how nepotism affects corporate investment. To measure nepotism, we build a unique dataset of family connections among individuals employed in strategic positions by the same firm. We address endogeneity concerns by exploiting the heterogeneity in ancestries across U.S. counties to construct a measure of inherited family values. We find that firms headquartered in counties where locals inherited strong family values exhibit more nepotism. Using this measure and the percentage of family households in the county as instrumental variables, we provide evidence that nepotism hinders investment. Overall, our results suggest that underinvestment in these firms is driven by both lower quality of hired workers and lower incentive to exert effort.
G40|How do bonus cap and malus affect risk and effort choice Insight from a lab experiment|We conducted a lab experiment to examine how bonus caps and malus affect individuals’ choices of risk and effort. We find that a bonus structure that rewards individuals proportionally to realised investment returns, but does not penalise negative returns, encourages risk-taking; while a bonus cap and malus mitigate risk-taking. However, the difference in risk-taking between the bonus cap and malus treatment groups and the proportional bonus group weakened significantly when the participants’ bonus was conditional on hitting an absolute or relative performance target. We also find some evidence that the bonus cap discourages project search effort relative to the proportional bonus, whereas the difference in the levels of effort between the malus treatment group and the proportional bonus group was not statistically significant.
G40|Paralyzed by Shock: The Portfolio Formation Behavior of Peer-to-Business Lending Investors|We study the investor behavior on a leading peer-to-business lending platform and identify a new investment mistake – a default shock bias. First, we find that investors stop investing in new loans and cease from diversifying their portfolio after experiencing a loan default. The default shock significantly worsens the risk-return profile of investors’ loan portfolios. The defaults investors experience are often not beyond what could have been expected based on the information that was provided by the platform ex-ante. Second, investment experience on the platform is related to better investment decisions in general, but does not reduce the default shock bias. These findings have important implications not only for the behavioral finance literature, but also more generally for new forms of Internet-based finance.
G40|Crash-o-phobia in Currency Carry Trade Returns|Currency carry trade returns are on average large and non-normally distributed. While the literature has found different explanations for the existence of carry trade returns, the higher order moments of their return distribution still pose a puzzle. We propose a new model to explain these non-normal properties of currency carry trade returns, by assuming that agents are loss averse and overweight states with low probabilities. This combination of loss aversion and probability weighting is called crash-o-phobia. Using non-linear least squares and risk-neutral state prices implied by currency options, we estimate this crash-o-phobia model to price developed and emerging market currencies. The parameter estimates reveal crash-o-phobic beliefs and preferences with significant differences across currencies. Compared to a model with rational beliefs and CRRA utility, our crash-o-phobia model performs significantly better at explaining the whole distribution of currency carry trade returns.

G40|Do the Rich Get Richer in the Stock Market? Evidence from India|We use data on Indian stock portfolios to show that return heterogeneity is the primary contributor to increasing inequality of wealth held in risky assets by Indian individual investors. Return heterogeneity increases equity wealth inequality through two main channels, both of which are related to the prevalence of undiversified accounts that own relatively few stocks. First, some undiversified portfolios randomly do well, while others randomly do poorly. Second, larger accounts diversify more effectively and thereby earn higher average log returns even though their average simple returns are no higher than those of smaller accounts.
G40|Delegation Uncertainty|Delegation bears an intrinsic form of uncertainty. Investors hire managers for their superior models of asset markets, but delegation outcome is uncertain precisely because managers' model is unknown to investors. We model investors' delegation decision as a trade-off between asset return uncertainty and delegation uncertainty. Our theory explains several puzzles on fund performances. It also delivers asset pricing implications supported by our empirical analysis: (1) because investors partially delegate and hedge against delegation uncertainty, CAPM alpha arises; (2) the cross-section dispersion of alpha increases in uncertainty; (3) managers bet on alpha, engaging in factor timing, but factors' alpha is immune to the rise of their arbitrage capital--when investors delegate more, delegation hedging becomes stronger. Finally, we offer a novel approach to extract model uncertainty from asset returns, delegation, and survey expectations.
G40|Redefault Risk in the Aftermath of the Mortgage Crisis: Why Did Modifications Improve More Than Self-Cures?|This paper examines changes in the redefault rate of mortgages that were selected for modification during 2008–2011, compared with that of similarly situated self-cured mortgages. We find a large decline in the redefault rate of both modified and self-cured mortgages over this period, but the improvement was greatest for modifications. Our analysis has identified several important factors contributing to the greater improvement for modified loans, including an increasing share of principal-reduction modifications, which appear to be more effective than other types of modification and increasingly generous modification terms (larger payment reductions). The favorable impacts of principal and payment reductions on household finances were enhanced by improving economic conditions, resulting in more effective modifications. Even after accounting for these factors, we still observe a larger decline in the redefault rate for modifications compared with similarly situated self-cured loans. This residual effect may reflect servicer “learning-by-doing”; that is, servicers gained knowledge as modification activity ramped up, resulting in more successful modification programs for later cohorts.
G40|Redefault Risk in the Aftermath of the Mortgage Crisis: Why Did Modifications Improve More Than Self-Cures?|This paper examines changes in the redefault rate of mortgages that were selected for modification during 2008–2011, compared with that of similarly situated self-cured mortgages during the same period. We find that while the performance of both modified and self-cured loans improved dramatically over this period, the decline in the redefault rate for modified loans was substantially larger, and we attribute this difference to a few key factors. First, the modification terms regarding repayments have become increasingly more generous, including more principal reduction, resulting in greater financial relief to the borrowers. Second, modifications in later vintages also benefited from improving economic conditions. Modifications became more effective as unemployment rates declined and home prices recovered. Third, we find that the difference between redefault rate improvement between modified loans and self-cured loans continue to persist even after controlling for all the relevant risk and economic factors. We attribute this difference to the servicers’ learning process — such as data collection and information sharing among industry participants — known as “learning-by doing.” Early in the mortgage crisis, many servicers had limited experience selecting the best borrowers for modification. As modification activity increased, lenders became more adept at screening borrowers for modification eligibility and in selecting appropriate modification terms. Our empirical findings suggest that mortgage modification effectiveness could be enhanced through the industry’s “learning-by-doing” process.
G40|The impact of world government indicators on market investment behavior|Although the behavioral finance sector has recently developed considerably, investors have irrational issues while taking the investment decisions on the capital market. We aim to empirically analyze the way in which aspects such as asymmetric information, emotional state, public policy and organizational culture affect their behavior. In the present paper we used quantitative data, building a database of 30 countries divided into two categories: socio-mature economies andrespectively emerging and border economies.Using global governance indicators and calculating the Hurst exponent, the symmetry coefficient, the Kurtosis coefficient and the fractal dimension, we applied the Bayesian estimate methodin order to establish the link between the dimensions of the global governance indicators and the dependent variables. The results of the linear regression have been disseminated, while the long-term and short-term effects were observed taking into account issues related to the quality of regulations, public policy, governance effectiveness, the rule of law, corruption control, stability policy and lack of violence/terrorism and participation and accountability.The purpose of the paper is to studythe impact of macroeconomic factors such as world government indicators, by analysing their impact over the efficiency of financial markets.
G40|Från ett lokalt hantverk till en global profession – En analys av transaktionsrådgivarrollen och den kommersiella fastighetsmarknadens utveckling i Sverige|Förord Författaren till denna rapport vill utsträcka ett stort tack till de personer som generöst ställde upp med sin tid för att förmedla sina erfarenheter och insikter kring ett ur samhällsbyggnadsperspektiv mycket viktigt område, nämligen fastighetsförmedling och transaktionsrådgivning. Jag har under våren och sommaren fått möjlighet att samtala med ett stort antal erfarna och kunniga personer, som var för sig, lämnat viktiga bidrag till denna rapports tillblivelse. Ett speciellt stort tack till Jan Wejdmark vid RICS som satte författaren på spåret genom att väcka frågan kring de legala ramverkens betydelse, vilka omger såväl transaktionsrådgivarnas som fastighetsmäklarnas arbete. Ett tack också till Emil Lilja som assisterade vid intervjuer och analyser av det insamlade materialet. Ett stort tack till Datscha som generöst ställde upp med information kring branschens storlek och utveckling under senare år. Trots de insikter som jag erhållit under resan gång kan det inte uteslutas att det i rapporten förekommer felaktigheter och feltolkningar. För dessa och rapportens analyser är ansvaret helt författarens.
G40|Psychology-based Models of Asset Prices and Trading Volume|Behavioral finance tries to make sense of financial data using models that are based on psychologically accurate assumptions about people's beliefs, preferences, and cognitive limits. I review behavioral finance approaches to understanding asset prices and trading volume, with particular emphasis on three types of models: extrapolation-based models, models of overconfident beliefs, and models of gain-loss utility inspired by prospect theory. The research to date shows that a few simple assumptions about investor psychology capture a wide range of facts about prices and volume and lead to concrete new predictions. I end by speculating about the form that a unified psychology-based model of investor behavior might take.

G40|Belief Disagreement and Portfolio Choice|Using a proprietary dataset of the portfolio holdings of millions of US households, we document how agents who believe in different models of the world update their beliefs heterogeneously in response to a public signal. We identify households ex ante that hold different models of the world using political party affiliation (probabilistically inferred from zip code), and our public signal is the unexpected outcome of the US national election of 2016. Relative to Democrats, Republican investors actively increase the equity share and market beta of their portfolios following the election. The rebalancing is due to a small share of investors making large adjustments. We conclude that this behavior is driven by belief heterogeneity because of extensive controls for differential hedging needs or preferences, including detailed controls for age, wealth, income, state, and even county-employer fixed effects.
G40|Investor Sentiment Connectedness: Evidence from Linear and Nonlinear Causality Approaches|This paper provides a novel perspective in determining the causality of sentiment across US, Latin America, Eurozone, Japan and Asia (excluding Japan), based on monthly data covering the period of January 2003 to November 2017. Using a survey-based sentiment index of ‘sentix’, our results tend to suggest strong evidence of nonlinearity and structural breaks making the results from linear causality models unreliable. Using a kernel-based multivariate nonlinear causality test, we find that causality runs from Eurozone to US, Asia, and Japan, with Japan also causing the Eurozone sentiment, and Latin-America causing Japanese sentiment. Interestingly, when we applied rolling estimations to detect time-varying causality for the cases of Eurozone and US, Eurozone and Asia, Eurozone and Japan, and Latin-America and Japan, we found evidence of bi-directional spillovers during certain months of the recent global financial crisis, and thereafter. Overall, our findings indicate that the sentiments of Japan, Asia, and US are related quite strongly with that of the Eurozone, as is Japan and Latin America.
G40|Long-Run Saving Dynamics: Evidence from Unexpected Inheritances|Long-run saving dynamics are a crucial component of consumption-saving behavior. This paper makes two contributions to the consumption literature. First, we exploit inheritance episodes to provide novel causal evidence on the long-run effects of a large financial windfall on saving behavior. For identification, we combine a longitudinal panel of administrative wealth reports with variation in the timing of sudden, unexpected parental deaths. We show that after inheritance net worth converges towards the path established before parental death, with only a third of the initial windfall remaining after a decade. These dynamics are qualitatively consistent with convergence to a buffer-stock target. Second, we analyze our findings through the lens of a generalized consumption-saving framework, and show that life-cycle consumption models can replicate this behavior, but only if the precautionary saving motive is stronger than usually assumed. This result also holds for two-asset models, which imply a high marginal propensity to consume.
G40|Cutting Through the Fog: Financial Literacy and the Subjective Value of Financial Assets|We examine the impact of financial literacy on investors’ subjective valuation of financial assets. In a laboratory experiment, we study how the certainty equivalent of a risky lottery changes when varying the framing of the lottery – a financial asset vs. a coin toss – and participants’ level of financial literacy – via teaching basic financial notions. Enhancing financial literacy improves the understanding of the lottery’s structure and increases its certainty equivalent, thus offsetting the negative effects of the financial framing. Our results – which can be rationalized by ambiguity aversion – highlight the importance of promoting financial education to stimulate households’ financial market participation.
G40|Individual Investors Look at Price Tags|We show that a stock price fall, in itself, induces individual investors to buy the stock. Our identification strategy uses two distinct events which generate â€œfictitious price falls.â€ The first is the mechanical stock price adjustment on ex-dividend dates. The second explores the so-called left-digit effect, the well-documented empirical fact that individuals disproportionally focus on left digits. Buying after price falls with no further analysis is harmful to investors since price falls tend to be followed by further price falls
G40|Measuring Biases in Expectation Formation|We develop a general framework for measuring biases in expectation formation. The method is based on the insight that biases can be inferred from the response of forecast errors to past news. Empirically, biases are measured by flexibly estimating the impulse response function of forecast errors. The framework does not require precise knowledge of the true data-generating process, and it nests all major existing models of expectations. Monte Carlo simulations show that the method is able to detect biases in empirically relevant settings. We illustrate the methodology using data on inflation forecasts. Our framework can guide future models of expectations.
G40|Experience Does not Eliminate Bubbles: Experimental Evidence|We study the role of experience in the formation of asset price bubbles. Therefore, we conduct two related experiments. One is a call market experiment in which participants trade assets with each other. The other is a learning-to-forecast experiment in which participants only forecast future prices, while the trade, which is based on these forecasts, is computerized. Each experiment comprises three treatments that vary the amount of information about the fundamental value that participants receive. Each market is repeated three times. In both experiments and in all treatments, we observe sizable bubbles. These bubbles do not disappear with experience. Our findings in the call market experiment stand in contrast to the literature. Our findings in the learningto-forecast experiment are novel. Interestingly, the shape of the bubbles is different between the two experiments. We observe flat bubbles in the call market experiment and boom-and-bust cycles in the learning-to-forecast experiment.

G40|The corporate equity puzzle|Why don't non-financial companies in Europe issue more equity? Using experimental data on firms from Europe, this paper analyses how firms trade-off between debt and external equity financing. It finds that firms are willing to pay a substantial premium on debt when presented with an equity participation as an alternative. Companies are willing to pay an interest rate that is about 8.8pp higher than the cost of equity to obtain a loan instead of external equity. This preference for debt can be explained only partially by the more favourable tax treatment of debt, fear of loss of corporate control and positive growth expectations. This paper discusses what else may explain this striking aspect of firm behaviour in the EU.
G40|What's the Story? A New Perspective on the Value of Economic Forecasts|We apply textual analysis tools to measure the degree of optimism versus pessimism of the text that describes Federal Reserve Board forecasts published in the Greenbook. The resulting measure of Greenbook text sentiment, “Tonality,” is found to be strongly correlated, in the intuitive direction, with the Greenbook point forecast for key economic variables such as unemployment and inflation. We then examine whether Tonality has incremental power for predicting unemployment, GDP growth, and inflation up to four quarters ahead. We find it to have significant and substantive predictive power for both GDP growth and unemployment, particularly since 1991: higher (more optimistic) Tonality presages higher GDP growth and lower unemployment, relative to the Greenbook point forecasts. We then test whether Tonality helps predict monetary policy and stock returns. Higher Tonality has some power to predict tighter than forecasted monetary policy, while it has substantial power fo r predicting higher 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month stock market returns.
G40|Éducation financière et comportements patrimoniaux : mauvaise éducation et zéro de conduite ?|Financial Literacy is a specific component of human capital which allows individual to deal with fundamental financial issues so as to take adequate financial decisions. After presenting the theoretical foundations of this notion, establishing its definition and reviewing the empirical literature, this paper presents recent studies about the link between financial literacy and financial decisions of the population in France using an original survey. The results suggest that financial literacy varies across the population. It is correlated with education but also with gender, age and political affiliation. This last point could reflect differences in opinion regarding the role of welfare state and individual responsibility. Finally, the link between financial literacy and some financial behaviors (the propensity to formulate a specific financial plan in the long run on the one hand and the propensity to own stocks on the other hand) is evaluated: in both cases positive correlations with financial literacy variables are found. We conclude with a reflection on the relative status of financial education to explain the investments of households and judge the effectiveness of training programs in the economic culture.

G40|Financial shocks and the erosion of interpersonal trust: Evidence from longitudinal data|This paper evaluates the effect of financial shocks on interpersonal trust levels, exploiting longitudinal survey data from 22,112 Australians. Using within-individual level variation, we find that trust does not change meaningfully following a positive financial shock (e.g., winning the lottery or receiving an inheritance). However, trust falls sharply following a negative financial shock (e.g., bankruptcy). In terms of magnitude, this effect is approximately equivalent to the effect observed after one reports being the victim of physical violence or a property crime, but significantly larger than effects from a range of other individual-level shocks (e.g., being fired or getting divorced). We then explore locus of control, which relates to the extent to which people believe they are in control of their circumstances, as a potential explanation for our core results. Indeed, we find evidence consistent with this hypothesis as locus of control tends to change, and become less internal, following a negative financial shock. In turn, locus of control is closely associated with interpersonal trust levels.

But we humans behave in complex ways. Although we try to make rational decisions, we have limited cognitive abilities and limited willpower.

Moreover cognitive abilities, self-control, and motivation can vary significantly across different individuals.

G40|Changes in Temporal Patterns of the Momentum Effect in Times of Turmoil: Evidence from the Bulgarian Stock|This paper studies the momentum effect at the Bulgarian stock exchange in terms of its temporal structure for a period spanning from Jan-2004 to Jul-2017. Our aim is to reveal insights on the changes that took place with the beginning of the 2008 Financial crisis. The application of continuous wavelet analysis allows us to gain an in-depth knowledge on the cyclical patterns of the times series of raw profits on momentum trading strategy. This enables us to carry on further analysis aimed at identifying the drivers behind the phenomenon of significant momentum raw profits and the observed breaks during and after the crisis. Our findings contribute mainly to the process of delivering thorough understanding of the momentum effect from an empirical as well as from a behavioral perspective.
G40|The Price Tag Illusion|We find that a stock price fall in itself induces more individuals to buy the stock. Used to temporary sales in the goods market, individuals have the illusion that buying a stock at a lower price is also a better deal, ignoring the fact that a price fall usually reflects negative news. We call this illusion the “Price Tag Illusion” (PTI). To identify the PTI, we use two distinct events which generate “fictitious price falls”. The first is the mechanical stock price adjustment on ex-dividend dates. The second is the fluctuation of stock prices around integer numbers. The PTI can cause severe losses to individuals in the stock market
G40|Paradigm shifts|The author studies the evolution of the number of coexisting beliefs in a financial market in a framework where the paradigm driving the agents' behavior is left unspecified. The overreaching aim is to gain insights regarding the dynamic of the variety of beliefs in an auction based financial market independently of any assumptions on agents' behaviors. The resulting framework may be seen as an abstract agent based model. In a computer experiment he exhibits a cycle between two states, so that either all agents act according to the same belief, or there is no leading belief; i.e., there is one dominating belief, or none. Further, he finds that the frequency of this cycle is positively linked to the quality of the information available to the agents.
G40|Oil Price Volatility and Real Effective Exchange Rate: The Case of Thailand|The main objective of this study is to directly examine the relation between real oil price and real effective exchange rate in Thailand during July 1997 to December 2013. Under the floating exchange rate regime, bilateral exchange rates are expected to fluctuate more than under the fixed exchange rate regime. The monthly data of real effective exchange rate index and real oil price are used. The results from this study reveal that there is no cointegration and causality in levels of the two series. However, an increase in oil price volatility causes real exchange rate volatility to increase. This main finding gives some policy implications to policy makers.
G40|Financial Development and Income in North Africa|We explore the short-run dynamics and long-run relationship between income and financial development in Algeria, Egypt, and Morocco. We use co-integration and VECM models and four indicators of financial development. The empirical results indicate that there is a long-run relationship between income and each financial development indicator, except credit to the private sector in Algeria. On the other hand, Granger-causality test results indicate that the evidence on the direction of causality is mixed. Copyright International Atlantic Economic Society 2008

G40|Determinants of the Interest Rate Margins of Austrian Banks|Bank interest rate margins have been declining in most EU Member States over the last decade. Drawing on a unique sample of supervisory data for the Austrian banking system from 1996 to 2005, this paper investigates the determinants of bank interest rate margins. The main factors driving the reduction of Austrian banks’ interest rate margins are decreasing operating costs, the growing importance of foreign currency lending combined with a rising share of non interest revenues as well as increasing competition. In contrast to findings in the literature we document a positive effect of relationship banking on margins, with the erosion of relationship banking being another reason for the decline in interest margins.
