C59|Economy-wide analysis of food waste reductions and related costs|Reducing food waste has become a policy priority in recent years as many studies show that a significant amount of food is wasted at various stages of the food supply chain. However, the economic impacts of food waste reduction have not been studied in depth as most of the studies in the literature ignore the cost and feedback effects. The aim of this report is to develop a general framework to analyse the economic impacts of reducing food waste in EU28 in both a global and a regional context in support of the EU policy making process on food waste reduction. For the purposes of this study, we employ the CGEBox toolbox which is a flexible, extendable, and modular code basis for CGE modelling. The default configuration of CGEBox used in this study covers the global economy with a detailed representation of the agriculture and food production sector whereas the EU28 is modelled at NUTS-II level. The impact of a food waste reduction equal to 5% of the intermediate input use of food processing sectors under two different cost assumptions is analysed in the scenarios. Firstly, in the cost neutral scenario, we assume that the cost of reducing food waste is equal to the monetary savings for the food processing industry. Secondly, in the pessimistic scenario, we assume that the cost of reducing food waste is twice as much as the cost savings made by reducing food waste. The results suggest that a unilateral commitment by the EU to reducing food loss and waste would most likely decrease the competitiveness of the EUâ€™s food processing. Reduced demand for primary agricultural inputs would shrink the EUâ€™s agricultural sectors, putting pressure on farm incomes and land prices. The contribution to global food security would be very minor. The impact on emissions relevant to climate change at global level is also minor, with a very limited contribution within the EU.
C59|A Review on Variable Selection in Regression Analysis|"In this paper, we investigate on 39 Variable Selection procedures to give an overview of the existing literature for practitioners. ""Let the data speak for themselves"" has become the motto of many applied researchers since the amount of data has significantly grew. Automatic model selection have been raised by the search for data-driven theories for quite a long time now. However while great extensions have been made on the theoretical side still basic procedures are used in most empirical work, eg. Stepwise Regression. Some reviews are already available in the literature for variable selection, but always focus on a specific topic like linear regression, groups of variables or smoothly varying coefficients. Here we provide a review of main methods and state-of-the art extensions as well as a topology of them over a wide range of model structures (linear, grouped, additive, partially linear and non-parametric). We provide explanations for which methods to use for different model purposes and what are key differences among them. We also review two methods for improving variable selection in the general sense."
C59|Investigating The Relation Between Technology and Economic Growth with AK Model: An application Swamy?s Random Coefficient Model (RCM)|This study aims to investigate effect of technology on economic growth in thirthty-OECD countries using random coefficient model (RCM) with AK model. We applied cross-sectional dependence test, panel unit-root test and co-integration test. As a result of estimated RCM model, in Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland and Poland, researcher and Business enterprise expenditure on R&D (BERD) as a percentage of GDP have positive and statistically significant effect on economic growth. In Estonia, Iceland and Latvia, researcher variable has positive and statistically significant effect on economic growth. In Turkey, BERD as a percentage of GDP variable has positively impacted on economic growth.
C59|Natural Resources from Curse to a Blessing : conjuring the curse|"Many countries are blessed with natural resources which logically have the power to transform their economies, so that the development of the natural resource could produce wealth for that nation, but actually it leads to become overly dependent on one resource, to the detriment of the rest of the economy. In fact, the discovery of natural resources is very often followed by economic instability in many of those countries. Moreover, the volatile resource prices have especially negative impacts on weak-state economies and cause growth to be unstable, so the resource-rich countries often do not pursue sustainable growth strategies. They fail to recognize that if they do not reinvest their resource wealth into productive investments above ground, they are actually becoming poorer. Given this very sad picture, one can ask if the curse of natural resources is a fatality, can anything be done? The main point for our purpose is to explore if the improvement of the governance, education sector , and high institutional quality with more transparency can be the antidotes and will help to conjure the spell and turn to ""resource blessing"".Using the L S method we estimated the regression whose dependent on GDP variable for the period from 1986 to 2017, which is a function of a vector of explanatory variables, including the variable that measures the abundance of natural resources, those measuring institutional quality, as well as other control variables. We chose two ways to measure the abundance of natural resources to ensure that our results are unbiased: The first measure is the percentage of oil, gas and ores rent from GDP. The second measure is the logarithm of one plus the value of per capita oil production. We used as measure of institutional quality : Rule of law that represents the credibility rate of the population in state institutions , regulatory quality which reflects the ability of the public authorities to put in place sound policies and regulations that allow the development of the private sector. Government Effectiveness which reflects the perception of the quality of public services, the quality of the public service and its degree of independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and credibility of the government?s commitment to these policies. And we used: degree of openness, gross fixed capital formation, life expectancy at birth, and number average years of schooling at the age of 15 as control variables."
C59|Optimization of Inventory Management Logistic Model of the Machine-Building Enterprises|"The aim of this study is to develop the inventory management model based on Economic Order Quantity model using asymptotic perturbation methods. The simple asymptotic formulas for the ""perturbed"" order quantity has been obtained when cost per order, storage cost and product demand change slightly. As the results show, the total costs, which correspond to ""perturbed"" order quantities, are less than ones at economic order quantity. Decrease of logistics costs can improve the market competitiveness of the machine-building enterprises' products. Modeling the nature of cost increase and demand fluctuation using asymptotic formulas the machine-building enterprises will be able to make prompt adjustments to optimize logistics processes."
C59|The Implicit Value of Arts Experts: the Case of Klaus Ertz and Pieter Brueghel the Younger|Pieter Brueghel the Younger (c. 1564/65 – 1637/38) is a well-known painter who reproduced the works of his celebrated father Pieter Bruegel the Elder (c. 1525/30-1569). We collected the sales of his original works as well as those from his atelier and followers over the period 1972-2015 and compare the prices of two categories of works: his autograph works, and all others, whether partly autograph or untouched by him. Confusion among the types was floating around, since the same compositions exist in many versions and dimensions, and were probably even executed by different painters. In 1997-1998, the German independent art historian Klaus Ertz curated a large itinerant exhibition in four European countries dedicated to Pieter the Younger. At the time, it was known that he was working on a catalogue raisonné (CR) of the painter to which he referred substantially, though it came out in 2000 only. We use difference-in-differences estimation to establish that the exhibitions and the information concerning the catalogue had a significant effect on the prices of autograph works. Though we cannot judge whether Ertz’s attributions are right or not, it seems that buyers started feeling more confident, since they were ready to pay roughly 60 percent more for works considered autograph after the late 1990s.

C59|Approaches and Techniques to Validate Internal Model Results|The development of risk model for managing portfolio of financial institutions and insurance companies require both from the regulatory and management points of view a strong validation of the quality of the results provided by internal risk models. In Solvency II for instance, regulators ask for independent validation reports from companies who apply for the approval of their internal models. Unfortunately, the usual statistical techniques do not work for the validation of risk models as we lack enough data to significantly test the results of the models. We will certainly never have enough data to statistically estimate the significance of the VaR at a probability of 1 over 200 years, which is the risk measure required by Solvency II. Instead, we need to develop various strategies to test the reasonableness of the model. In this paper, we review various ways, management and regulators can gain confidence in the quality of models. It all starts by ensuring a good calibration of the risk models and the dependencies between the various risk drivers. Then applying stress tests to the model and various empirical analysis, in particular the probability integral transform, we build a full and credible framework to validate risk models.
C59|Interpreting sufficiency in fsQCA: A reply to Marques and Salavisa (2017)|Marques and Salavisa (2017) use fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to analyze age-based labour market dualization in Southern European, Anglo-Saxon and a few Nordic countries. They argue that segmentation at the expense of young outsiders is driven by several factors in non-linear ways: different configurations of deindustrialization, labour market coordination, employment protection, and liberalization can lead to youth outsiderness. We question the validity of their empirical analysis and argue that a more complete interpretation of fsQCA measures of fit does not confirm their conclusions. We use the occasion for a hands-on discussion of how the consistency and PRI scores of the sufficiency solution terms are calculated. A good understanding of these allows the researcher to understand which cases and configurations drive high or low scores, and thus facilitates a better understanding of the results.
C59|Currency demand and MIMIC models: towards a structured hybrid method of measuring the shadow economy|Abstract Model-based econometric techniques of the shadow economy estimation have been increasingly popular, but a systematic approach to getting the best of their complementarities has so far been missing. We review the dominant approaches in the literature—currency demand analysis and MIMIC model—and propose a hybrid procedure that addresses their previous critique, in particular the misspecification issues in CDA equations and the vague transformation of the latent variable obtained via MIMIC model into interpretable levels and paths of the shadow economy. We propose a new identification scheme for the MIMIC model, referred to as ‘reverse standarization’. It supplies the MIMIC model with the panel-structured information on the latent variable’s mean and variance obtained from the CDA estimates, treating this information as given in the restricted full information maximum likelihood function. This approach allows avoiding some controversial steps, such as choosing an externally estimated reference point for benchmarking or adopting other ad hoc identifying assumptions. We estimate the shadow economy for up to 43 countries, with the results obtained in the range of 2.8–29.9% of GDP. Various versions of our models remain robust as regards changes in the level of the shadow economy over time and the relative position of the analysed countries. We also find that the contribution of (a correctly specified) MIMIC model to the measurement of trends in the shadow economy is marginal as compared to the contribution of the CDA model, confirming the scepticism of some previous literature towards this method.
C59|Measuring the Strength of the Theories of Government Size|Existing theoretical and empirical evidence on the determinants of government expenditure is inconclusive. We posit that the main cause of this problem is theory uncertainty, which arises due to the fact that the different theories imply different mutually compatible and interrelated mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel model averaging method to perform model averaging in linear regression systems that allows for endogeneity. Using data for more than 90 countries we assess the evidentiary support for nine different theories. Our results suggest that the government size and its components are explained by multiple mechanisms that work simultaneously but differ in their impact and importance. In particular, for general government total expenditure we find decisive evidence for the demography theory and a strong evidence for the globalization and political institution theory. In the case of central government total expenditure, we find that income inequality and macroeconomic policy play a decisive role in addition to demography.
C59|International Trade in Western Balkan Countries: Analysis Based on the Gravity Model|Abstract We adopt the gravity model to analyse the international trade relations of Western Balkan (WB) countries and of the WB region as a whole, using WIIW and World Bank data, over a period of 20 years (1995-2014). Data show a tendency toward better integration of WB countries with the world economy, increased openness of their economies, persistence of their trade deficits, and, for most of them, an improvement of the coverage ratio. For the region as a whole, the volume of international trade outpaced that of intra-regional trade reaching, in 2014, a difference of nearly 5 times. The main partner for the region remains the European Union, particularly Germany and Italy. The gravity model of exports of the WB region shows that its exports are positively impacted by the common language and common borders with third countries, by trade with European Union, and large and highly industrialized countries, while distance and region’s level of per capita Gross Domestic Product both have a negative impact. Considering the imports, the model shows that they are positively impacted by existence of common borders and language with the region, and by region’s and partner countries’ level of economic development, while the distance has again a negative impact.
C59|Disparities, Discrepancies and Specific Concentration – Diversification Trends in the Group of Central and East European Ex-Socialist Countries|The paper identifies some major disparities and quantifies some discrepancies and gaps, as well as specific trends of concentration-diversification in today’s group of the 11 former socialist economies of Central and Eastern Europe (CEEC). After a brief introduction describing the approach based on multiplied research focused on the ex-socialist economies in CEEC that have already acceded to the European Union (EU), a special section is devoted to the statistical concepts that are measurable and applied in this paper, i.e. disparity and gap or discrepancy, finally detailing an original research method that capitalizes on these statistical tools with matrices and econometric models (including those focused on associations, correlations and concentration-diversification coefficients). A set of major variables are analyse and discussed in parallel with some trends that have already been presented in the international literature, outlining the specifics of CEEC economies in the context of their real convergence to the EU average level (EU-28 and EU-16). A few final remarks identify some paradoxes of the economies analysed.
C59|Demanda de Internet: El sector mayorista de telecomunicaciones Colombiano|A raíz de la necesidad de conocer las diferentes variables que inciden en los servicios de transporte de datos, la escasez de artículos académicos que describan el comportamiento de la demanda en el sector mayorista y tomando como referencia los trabajos realizados, tanto por Madden & Coble-Neal (2004) como por Karacuka, Haucap & Heimeshoff (2011), se presenta, tanto un modelo de demanda, como un modelo de formación de precios, estimados a través de técnicas de panel de datos a nivel de firmas, con el objetivo de comprender el comportamiento de estas en el mercado Colombiano y cuyos resultados fundamentales son una elasticidad precio de la demanda de 1.1102, una elasticidad inversa de la demanda de 0.2215 y una elasticidad ingreso de 0.0569, para las firmas proveedoras del servicio de internet a usuarios finales.
C59|‘Nonlinear causality between crude oil price and exchange rate: A comparative study of China and India’ — A failed replication (negative Type 1 and Type 2)|Evidence published in this journal by Bal and Rath (2015) purports a bidirectional nonlinear causality between oil price and India's exchange rate and, for China, unidirectional nonlinear causality running from exchange rate to oil price. Their entire testing protocol and ensuing results rest upon claims that all the variables contain a unit root. We raise several critical issues and revisit the order of integration of the series as well as their cointegration and Granger causality properties through a ‘pure replication’ and a ‘reanalysis’. Contrary to Bal and Rath (2015), when we repeat their estimated model with their specification of the Ng and Perron (2001) unit root test on their data, we find that their oil price series (ROL) is level stationary (negative replication Type 1), a result which makes all their subsequent results biased and misleading. Our reanalysis confirms that ROL is I(0), linearly as well as nonlinearly. We also find that the basic bivariate model proposed by Bal and Rath (2015) fails to produce statistically robust and stable cointegrating patterns. Nonlinear causality tests confirm the absence of any nonlinear causality for both countries (negative replication Type 2).
C59|The modelling of networks using Exponential Random Graph Models: an introduction|Networks are representations of relational data. Whether the data used represents social interactions, cooperations or inter-bank dependencies, the structure of the network reflect a decision-making process based on many factors (common friends, technological proximity, geographical proximity). One of the objectives of network analysis is to identify these factors. The analysis of the structure using Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM) can help in the identification of these factors by answering why two particular agents interact with one another, or why a specific agent has a particular position inside a network. In other words ERGMs allow us to perform an econometric analysis on network data. In the case of networks it is possible that a link depends upon the structure of the network. Usual econometric methods cannot be used because the dependence violates the hypothesis of independence of observations. ERGMs take into account this particularity of network data. \r\nThe aim of this paper is to present the statistical theory behind ERGM models and present an application using R-Project.
C59|Safety perception in transport demand modeling for the bike-metro integration in Bogota, Colombia|It is hypothesized that safety perception produces a significant effect on predicting demand for the bike-metro integration. Two models were calibrated in order to test this hypothesis: a mixed logit model and an integrated choice latent variable model, which were estimated simultaneously using simulated maximum likelihood. Data used in the estimation were taken in the locality of Kennedy, which is not only the most populous of Bogotá but also will be the starting point of the first metro line. The empirical evidence supported the hypothesis; in particular, it was found that the mixed model overestimates demand, especially in the scenarios for which provision of exclusive bicycle lanes was not considered. Also, significant differences in safety perception were found for users of motorcycle, taxis and public service, and generally for individuals according to income levels.
C59|Analysis of average value of a Fourier series using z-transform: comparison with Hodrick-Prescott filter|This paper develops a method of analyzing average value of a complex-valued function that can be represented as a Fourier series satisfying a few realistic restrictions. This method may be useful when Discrete Fourier transform is highly inefficient, and comparison with Hodrick-Prescott filter is made.
C59|A three-pole filter understanding of the average value of a Fourier series|This paper extends the idea in ``Analysis of average value of a Fourier series using z-transform'' by the author. The main difference is that a three-pole filter is used instead of a two-pole filter. This paper reaches qualitatively the same conclusion.
C59|Crisis-Contingent Dynamics of Connectedness: An SVAR-Spatial-Network “Tripod” Model with Thresholds|In recent years a growing number of methodologies have been proposed to empirically measure the connectedness among financial entities. However, few of them capture the dynamics of the financial connectedness. This paper aims to fill this gap and proposes a novel and systematic model to portray not only the connectedness in a given regime but also its transitions across different regimes. The model is based on an improved version of a “tripod” model, which unifies structural vector auto-regressions (SVARs), spatial models, and network models under one framework. I introduce a transition mechanism into my model, thus making it possible to observe how the interconnections among financial entities vary with certain threshold variables. My model may be applied to various issues regarding the financial and non-financial interconnections among certain entities. As an illustration, I show how my model can shed some new light on the modeling of the recent Eurozone contagions. I reveal a clear causal map of the propagation of shocks among the stock markets in five selected Eurozone countries in both contagion and non-contagion periods, which are determined automatically. The unique roles played by each selected market under both the contagion and non-contagion regimes are efficiently summarized.
C59|Bubbles in US regional house prices: evidence from house price–income ratios at the State level| We investigate the presence of bubbles in the US house price-income ratio at the State level by applying the recent time series-based econometric test to data from January 1975 to December 2014. We find evidence of bubbles in several States in the 1980s (i.e. California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, etc.), which coincides with some existing studies that investigate housing bubbles or booms and busts using a range of alternative approaches. Our results show the existence of a housing bubble that originates in the early 2000s and collapses in the mid-2000s in more than 20 States and the District of Columbia concluding that the bubbles of the 2000s were more widespread than the 1980s, which is of special interest and importance. Our results seem to be in agreement with the talk given by Alan Greenspan in 2005, who suggest no sign of a nationwide housing bubble but a lot of local bubbles. We also study the importance of the regression model specification with/without an intercept and the regression model with an intercept could lead to false-positive identification of bubbles.
C59|La percepción de seguridad en la demanda de transporte de la integración bicicletametro en Bogotá, Colombia|Resumen: Se plantea como hipótesis que la percepción de seguridad tiene un efecto significativo en la predicción de la demanda por la integración bicicleta-metro. Para demostrar dicha hipótesis, se calibraron dos modelos: un modelo logit mixto y un modelo integrado de elección y variable latente, cuya estimación se hizo en forma simultánea por máxima verosimilitud simulada. La estimación empleó datos de una muestra tomada en la localidad de Kennedy, que no solo es la más poblada de Bogotá sino que será el punto de partida de la primera línea del metro. La evidencia empírica respaldó la hipótesis planteada, encontrándose que el modelo mixto sobreestima la demanda, especialmente en los escenarios que no consideraron la provisión de carriles exclusivos para bicicleta. Se encontraron, además, diferencias significativas en la percepción de seguridad de la bicicleta para usuarios de motocicletas, taxis y servicio público, y en general para los individuos según el nivel de ingreso.
C59|The stochastic effects on the Brazilian Electrical Sector|The size and characteristics of the Brazilian Electrical Sector (BES) are unique. The system includes a large-scale hydrothermal power system with many hydroelectric plants and multiple owners. Due to the historical harnessing of natural resources, the National Interconnected System (NIS) was developed outside of the economic scale of the BES. The central components of the NIS enable energy generated in any part of Brazil to be consumed in distant regions, considering certain technical configurations. This interconnection results in a large-scale complex system and is controlled by robust computational models, used to support the planning and operation of the NIS. This study presents a different vision of the SEB, demonstrating the intrinsic relationship between hydrological stochasticity and the activities executed by the system, which is an important sector of the infrastructure in Brazil. The simulation of energy scenarios is crucial to the optimal manner to operate the sector and to supporting decisions about whether expansion is necessary, thus, avoiding unnecessary costs and/or losses. These scenarios are an imposing factor in the determination of the spot cost of electrical energy, given that the simulated quantities of water in the reservoirs are one of the determinants for the short-term energy price.
C59|Neighborhood effects and social behavior: The case of irrigated and rainfed farmers in Bohol, the Philippines|Artifactual field experiments, spatial econometrics, and household surveys are combined in a single study to investigate the neighborhood effects of social behaviors. The dictator and public goods games are conducted among rice farmers in irrigated and non-irrigated areas in the Philippines. We find the neighborhood effects but the magnitude and statistical significance of endogenous social effects vary with the irrigation availability, type of social behavior, and type of neighborhood. Altruistic and cooperative behaviors are significantly influenced by the behaviors of neighbors only in the irrigated area, where social ties are strengthened through collective irrigation management. Through this effect, irrigated farmers’ social behaviors become similar to those of one another. Neighborhood effects for cooperative behavior are stronger among farm plot neighbors than among residential neighbors, which may reflect their interactions in irrigation management. Although non-dynamic, these findings are consistent with the theory of social norm evolution through common pool resource management.
C59|What Broke First? Characterizing Sources of Structural Change Prior to the Great Recession|This paper identifies and characterizes episodes of structural change in the 27 years that preceded the Great Recession. This is done by performing Bai-Perron (2003a, 2003b) tests on 61,843 time series that span 34 countries, which collectively accounted for 81% of Gross World Product in 2013. Three major stylized facts are established. First, the rate of structural change increased throughout the early 1990s, stabilized in 2003, and then decreased slowly until 2007. Second, there were three large spikes in the pace of structural change after the 1990-1991 recession: 1993-1994, 2001-2003, and 2007-2009. The latter two overlap with recessions in the U.S. and many other major economies, but the first does not. This spike is associated with structural change in residential investment, consumption, exchange rates, and real estate. Across countries, the degree of structural change is highest in China during this episode. Third, the periods 1993-1994 and 1997-2000 contain heavy structural change in real estate and lending; however, the rate of structural change in house price and construction series was more pronounced in and after 2001.
C59|The Relationship between Labour Market Conditions and Welfare Receipt in Australia: A Stock-Flow Analysis| Understanding the determinants of changes in welfare caseloads is an important, but little studied, topic in Australia. This paper evaluates the role of labour market conditions in explaining the changes in the Australian welfare caseload since the late 1990s. The paper employs a stock-flow approach to better control for persistence in welfare receipt and includes different specifications to deal with measurement error in labour market data. The results suggest that the labour market is an important determinant of movements on and off welfare, accounting for the majority of the caseload decline during 1997–2005. The results also highlight the importance of robustness checks when data are measured with error.
C59|Adaptive forecasting in the presence of recent and ongoing structural change|We consider time series forecasting in the presence of ongoing structural change where both the time series dependence and the nature of the structural change are unknown. Methods that downweight older data, such as rolling regressions, forecast averaging over different windows and exponentially weighted moving averages, known to be robust to historical structural change, are found also to be useful in the presence of ongoing structural change in the forecast period. A crucial issue is how to select the degree of downweighting, usually defined by an arbitrary tuning parameter. We make this choice data-dependent by minimising the forecast mean square error, and provide a detailed theoretical analysis of our proposal. Monte Carlo results illustrate the methods. We examine their performance on 97 US macro series. Forecasts using data-based tuning of the data discount rate are shown to perform well.

Recent years have seen much focus on how innovation can lead to improvements in productivity assisting in economic development The article present the big difference between making culture in a particular field and practicing it. Innovation is the instrument of entrepreneurship. It invests resources with a new capacity to produce prosperity.
C59|Expatriates Performance And Permanence: Analysis By Gender Of 124 Spanish Managers|Despite the importance of International Assignments for companies competing in global economy, research to date has not clearly identified what effectiveness means in this context. In this paper it is analyzed the possible relationship between indicators traditionally considered evidence of expatriate success: adjustment, performance and permanence; introducing the situation of the home country as potential influencer. Possible influence of gender is also explored, in order to determine if low performance of female expatriate explains its sub representation in allocations. Data from 124 Spanish expatriate managers suggest that permanence depends on adjustment and results in host country, but not the situation in Spain. Gender does not introduce significant differences in our results.
C59|Long Memory Analysis: An Empirical Investigation|This study is an attempt to review the theory and applications of autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) and fractionally integrated generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (FIGARCH) models, mainly for the purpose of the description of the observed persistence in the mean and volatility of a time series. The long memory feature in FIGARCH models makes them a better candidate than other conditional heteroskedasticity models for modeling volatility in financial series. ARFIMA model also has a considerable capacity for modeling the return behavior of these time series. The daily data related to Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) index was used for the purpose of this study. Considering the fact that the existence of conditional heteroskedasticity effects were confirmed in the stock return series, robust regression technique was used for estimation of different ARFIMA models. Furthermore, different GARCH-type models were also compared. The results of ARFIMA model are indicative of the absence of long memory in return series of the TSE index and the results from FIGARCH model show evidence of long memory in conditional variance of this series.
C59|Estimating the price elasticity of beer: Meta-analysis of data with heterogeneity, dependence, and publication bias|Precise estimates of price elasticities are important for alcohol tax policy. Using meta-analysis, this paper corrects average beer elasticities for heterogeneity, dependence, and publication selection bias. A sample of 191 estimates is obtained from 114 primary studies. Simple and weighted means are reported. Dependence is addressed by restricting number of estimates per study, author-restricted samples, and author-specific variables. Publication bias is addressed using funnel graph, trim-and-fill, and Egger's intercept model. Heterogeneity and selection bias are examined jointly in meta-regressions containing moderator variables for econometric methodology, primary data, and precision of estimates. Results for fixed- and random-effects regressions are reported. Country-specific effects and sample time periods are unimportant, but several methodology variables help explain the dispersion of estimates. In models that correct for selection bias and heterogeneity, the average beer price elasticity is about −0.20, which is less elastic by 50% compared to values commonly used in alcohol tax policy simulations.
C59|An Investigation Of Cointegration And Causality Between Investments, Exports, Openness, Industrial Production And Economic Growth: A Comparative Study For The East European Countries|The study of the economic growth has old implications. An analysis of relevant literature shows that there is a series of empirical studies that have analysed, tested and explained the correlation between the dynamics of exports, investments, the openness of economies and the process of economic growth. This paper examines the role of investments, export and openness in relation to economic growth for 10 East European countries using quarterly data between 2000 and 2013. Unit root tests were used in order to analyse the stationarity of variables. We have then employed the Johansen Cointegration test in order to identify the existence of a long-run relationship between the variables as well as the Granger causality test in order to test the hypotheses about the presence of causality between selected variables. At the same time VAR and VECM models were estimated for each of the 10 East European Countries; a comparative analysis of the results shows the presence, direction and intensity of the correlation and causality between investments, exports, openness and economic growth.
C59|Robust Multiple Regimes in Growth Volatility|In this paper we uncover growth volatility regimes and identify their robust determinants using a large international panel of countries. In doing so we propose a novel empirical methodology that allows us to simultaneously deal with two key elements of model uncertainty, namely theory uncertainty and parameter heterogeneity, by unifying two recent econometric techniques: Bayesian Model Averaging and Threshold Regression. We find ample evidence of parameter heterogeneity and model uncertainty. Our results highlight the role of Macroeconomic Policy, Institutional variables, and Neoclassical growth variables in generating multiple volatility regimes.

Analysis of factors of primary nickel prices dynamics |Рассматривается влияние группы факторов – внутренних и внешних для рынка первичного никеля, относящихся к реальной и фиктивной экономике, – на цену металла. Анализируется взаимосвязь динамики цен группы основных цветных металлов. Колебания баланса производства и потребления никеля, изменение издержек производства металлов стали играть меньшую роль в формировании цены, чем несколько десятилетий назад: на первый план выходят другие факторы, характеризующие в первую очередь спекулятивную составляющую цены. С середины нулевых годов основное влияние на цены основных цветных металлов оказывают уже глобальные макро-экономические факторы, характеризующие фиктивную экономику, а также изменения, касающиеся процедуры проведения торгов на Лондонской бирже металлов. Рассматриваются различные модельные подходы к анализу динамики основных показателей рынков цветных металлов. Приводятся результаты моделирования мировых объемов производства первичного никеля и рынка никеля (потребления и импорта) США. The influence of a group of factors – internal and external for the primary nickel market and related to the real and fictitious economy – on the price of the metal is scrutinized in the article. The dependence between the prices dynamics of the basic non-ferrous metals was analyzed. Fluctuations in the balance of nickel consumption and production, changes in production costs of metals started to play a less important role; while other factors, which most of all characterize the speculative component of the price, came to the fore. From the mid 2000’s it is global macroeconomic factors, which characterize the fictitious economy and changes connected with bidding on the London Metal Exchange, that impact the prices of non-ferrous metals. Different modeling approaches for analyzing dynamics of the primary indexes are examined in the article. The results of the modeling of the volumes of the world production and the nickel market (consumption and import) in the USA are presented.
C59|Public spending on education and Economic Growth in Algeria: Causality Test|In this article, we seek to study the relationship between education and economic growth.For this purpose, we studied multipleentrances(dimension ) information relating education and Economic Growth on theoretical and empirical background in the first, as the second part of study to analysis and examine the effect of Public spendingon education on economic growth in Algeria over the period 1974-2012. with the use of endogenous growth model. In this model, gross domestic product(GDP) is based on the Cobb Douglas form which is the function was adoptedwith five variables: Real Gross National Product (GDP), Capital (K), Labor (L), Expenditure on Education (SEDU). Two unit root tests (Philips-Perron Test) have been employed to test the integration order of the variables.study uses Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Johansen Co-integration test and Causality Test is as analytical techniques for this purpose. The empirical results support the main hypothesis of this study that Public spending on education affects positively economic growth in Algeria. Even though that the most important effect on economic growth is for education, the other three explanatory variables affect also, positively, the economic growth; yet their effect is relatively less important than the effect of education.
C59|Estimating the rebound effect of technological improvement in Iran?s industry sector|Rebound effect refers to the phenomenon that energy savings from improvement in energy efficiency are lower than expected due to unintended second-order effects. The main reason of improving energy efficiency is Technological improvement. According to Khazzoom formula, the rebound effect of improving technology is equal to price elasticity of demand so in this research natural gas demand function is estimated. In addition to the economic drivers (natural gas price, price of substituted energy factors, industry value added), there are number of exogenous factors that drive energy demand. This research therefore uses Structural Time Series Model to estimate natural gas demand in Iran`s industry sector during 1988 to 2009 and then Khazzoom rebound effect is calculated. Estimated short run and long run rebound effect in Iran`s industry sector are 63 percent and 133 percent respectively, with a generally increasing UEDT in a decreasing rate. UEDT has upward sloping but level of UEDT is fixed during the period of research so the model is ?smooth trend model?. Relating to the research findings improving technology in Iran`s industry sector reduces Natural gas consumption up to 37 percent in short run. But in long time period increases Natural gas consumption up to 133 percent. So in short run technological improvement can reduce consumption approximately but in long run price policy reform should be used simultaneously.
C59|Heterogeneity of Saving-Investment Causality and Fiscal Coordination Implication: The Case of an African Monetary Union|Monetary unions are characterized by contemporary institutional arrangements that entrust monetary policy to a supranational entity while fiscal policies are framed by rules imposed on the budget deficit. Limits on public deficits are usually justified by the idea that government deficits reduce national savings, which ultimately reduces domestic investment and economic growth. However, this idea that domestic savings must necessarily increase if investment increases cannot be taken for granted. Moreover, it is possible that within the union, countries reveal different saving-investment causality, which is capable of rendering considerable credibility and effectiveness of budgetary rules of government deficits systematic prohibition as a means to revitalize investment. This study raises the question of domestic savings-investment causality in an African monetary union with a focus on the WAEMU zone. It has been determined in each country from a methodology based on co integration vector representations analysis leading to error correction. The existence of a causality heterogeneity between savings-investment in this African monetary union leads to consider a new model of fiscal coordination in Africa incorporating this heterogeneity, including the adoption of a new budget rule more flexible based on a structural balance without public investment.
C59|Noncausality and asset pricing|Misspecification of agents’ information sets or expectation formation mechanisms may lead to noncausal autoregressive representations of asset prices. Within the class of linear (vector) autoregressions, annual US stock prices are found to be best described by noncausal models, implying that agents’ expectations are not revealed to an outside observer such as an econometrician observing only realized market data. A simulation study shows that noncausal asset prices are observed when the data are generated by asset-pricing models featuring heterogeneous expectations.
C59|Disposición a pagar por reducir el tiempo de viaje en Tunja (Colombia): Comparación entre estudiantes y trabajadores con un modelo logit mixto|RESUMEN: El estudio analiza la diferencia en la disposición a pagar de estudiantes y trabajadores por reducir el tiempo de viaje, en un contexto de elección de modo de transporte para la ciudad de Tunja (Colombia). Se utilizó un modelo logit mixto, calibrado con datos provenientes de una encuesta de preferencias declaradas. La especificación del modelo supuso la variación aleatoria de los coeficientes del tiempo de acceso, tiempo de espera y tiempo de viaje. Se encontró que la disposición a pagar por reducir el tiempo de viaje es de 38.14 $/min para estudiantes, siendo 23% mayor para trabajadores de menor ingreso y 73% mayor para los trabajadores de mayor ingreso. Se determinó que el valor del tiempo de espera es 1.95 veces mayor que el tiempo viaje, en tanto que el tiempo de acceso mantiene una relación de 1 a 2.57 con respecto al tiempo de viaje, la cual se considera válida únicamente para el contexto estudiado.
C59|China’s economic growth and rebalancing|In this paper we provide an overview of the growth model in China and its prospects, taking a medium-run to long-run perspective. Our main conclusions are as follows. First, the still prevailing producer-biased model of managed capitalism in China tends to engender, as an inherent byproduct, serious imbalances which cannot be unwound without a fundamental overhaul of the model itself. Second, given the lack of a critical mass of economic reforms thus far, imbalances may (re-)escalate once global and domestic economic conditions normalise. Third, the fundamental factors underpinning growth in China are likely to remain supportive, at least over the medium run. Although this could help mitigate the economic costs of imbalances for some time to come, it could also reduce the incentives for policymakers to enact much needed reforms. Fourth, delayed policy action and the persistence of the model of growth cum imbalances would increase the risk of China getting caught in the middle-income trap in the long run. Greater political will to redirect China’s growth model towards a more sustainable path is therefore needed.
C59|Modelling the daily banknotes in circulation in the context of the liquidity management of the European Central Bank| The main focus of this paper is to model the daily series of banknotes in circulation. The series of banknotes in circulation displays very marked seasonal patterns. To the best of our knowledge the empirical performance of two competing approaches to model seasonality in daily time series, namely the ARIMA-based approach and the Structural Time Series approach, has never been put to the test. The application presented in this paper provides valid intuition on the merits of each approach. The forecasting performance of the models is also assessed in the context of their impact on the liquidity management of the Eurosystem. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
C59|Failure to launch? The role of land inequality in transition delays|This paper provides empirical support for one theory of transition delays: initial land inequality. Using a new historical dataset for land inequality (Frankema, 2009) we employ duration analysis to investigate whether higher levels of land inequality lead to longer delays in the extension of primary schooling. Our findings suggest that land inequality is a key determinant of delays in schooling.
C59|The effect of public debt on growth in multiple regimes|We employ a structural threshold regression methodology to investigate the heterogeneous effects of debt on growth using public debt as a threshold variable as well as several other plausible variables. Our methodology allows us to address parameter heterogeneity that characterizes cross-country growth data and at the same time account for endogeneity. We find strong evidence for threshold effects based on democracy, which implies that higher public debt results in lower growth for countries in the Low-Democracy regime. Our results are consistent with the presence of parameter heterogeneity in the cross-country growth process due to fundamental determinants of economic growth proposed by the new growth theories.
C59|Ten Things You Should Know about the Dynamic Conditional Correlation Representation|The purpose of the paper is to discuss ten things potential users should know about the limits of the Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) representation for estimating and forecasting time-varying conditional correlations. The reasons given for caution about the use of DCC include the following: DCC represents the dynamic conditional covariances of the standardized residuals, and hence does not yield dynamic conditional correlations; DCC is stated rather than derived; DCC has no moments; DCC does not have testable regularity conditions; DCC yields inconsistent two step estimators; DCC has no asymptotic properties; DCC is not a special case of Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Correlation (GARCC), which has testable regularity conditions and standard asymptotic properties; DCC is not dynamic empirically as the effect of news is typically extremely small; DCC cannot be distinguished empirically from diagonal Baba, Engle, Kraft and Kroner (BEKK) in small systems; and DCC may be a useful filter or a diagnostic check, but it is not a model.
C59|Bankruptcy Prediction Models in Galician companies. Application of Parametric Methodologies and Artificial Intelligence|This paper provides empirical evidence on the prediction of non-financial companiesâ€™ failure. We develop several models to evaluate failure risk in companies from Galicia. We check the predictive ability of parametric models (multivariate discriminant, logit) compared with auditorâ€™s report. Models are based on relevant financial variables and ratios, in financial logic and a in financial distress situations. We examine a random sample of companies in cross-sectional perspective, checking the predictive capacity at any given time, also verifying is models give reliable signals to anticipate future events of financial distress. Findings suggest that our models are extremely effective when applied in medium and long term, and that they offer higher predictive capabilities than external audit.
C59|The Assessment Of Parameter Uncertainty In A Vector Error Correction Model For Romania|The assessment of uncertainty that characterizes the econometric model parameters is an important input for policymakers that have to establish more alternative policies to protect against persistent shocks of the economy. The objective of this useful research for policymakers is to evaluate the parameter uncertainty in the behavioural equations of a vector error correction model for Romania. A positive impact of the foreign direct investment and exports on GDP real rate was measured on the horizon Q1:2000-Q4:2012. A permanent shock was observed in parameters. The error correction vector explains quarterly around 10.6% of the desequilibrium. The necessary period for reducing the gap between the value of GDP in the last quarter of 2012 and that in the steady-state is 14 quarters, till the second quarter of 2016.
C59|Conditional versus unconditional industrial agglomeration: disentangling spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity in the analysis of ICT firms’ distribution in Milan|A series of recent papers have introduced some explorative methods based on Ripley’s K-function (Ripley in J R Stat Soc B 39(2):172–212, 1977 ) analyzing the micro-geographical patterns of firms. Often the spatial heterogeneity of an area is handled by referring to a case–control design, in which spatial clusters occur as over-concentrations of firms belonging to a specific industry as opposed to the distribution of firms in the whole economy. Therefore, positive, or negative, spatial dependence between firms occurs when a specific sector of industry is seen to present a more aggregated pattern (or more dispersed) than is common in the economy as a whole. This approach has led to the development of relative measures of spatial concentration which, as a consequence, are not straightforwardly comparable across different economies. In this article, we explore a parametric approach based on the inhomogeneous K-function (Baddeley et al. in Statistica Nederlandica 54(3):329–350, 2000 ) that makes it possible to obtain an absolute measure of the industrial agglomeration that is also able to capture spatial heterogeneity. We provide an empirical application of the approach taken with regard to the spatial distribution of high-tech industries in Milan (Italy) in 2001. Copyright Springer-Verlag 2013
C59|We study whether financial analysts' concern for preserving good relationships with firms' managers motivates them to issue pessimistic or optimistic forecasts. Based on a dataset of one-yearahead EPS forecasts issued by 4 648 analysts concerning 241 French firms (1997-2007), we regress the analysts' forecast accuracy on its unintentional determinants. We then decompose the fixed effect of the regression and we use the firm-analyst pair effect as a measure of the intensity of the firm-analyst relationship. We find that a low (high) firm-analyst pair effect is associated with a low (high) forecast error. This observation suggests that pessimism and optimism result from the analysts' concern for cultivating their relationship with the firm's management|No abstract is available for this item.
C59|Willingness to pay for reducing travel time in Tunja (Colombia): A comparison between students and workers with a mixed logit model|The difference in willingness to pay to reduce travel time between students and workers was analyzed in a context of transportation mode choice in the city of Tunja (Colombia). A mixed logit model was used to this end. The model was calibrated with data collected in a stated preference survey applied in the city. The model assumed random coefficients for access time, waiting time and travel time. With this specification, the willingness to pay to reduce travel time was valued at COP 38.14/min for students. Lower income workers exhibited a 23% increase in the value of time, while higher-income workers showed an increase of 73% compared to the assessment made for students. Finally, it was found that the ratio between the value of waiting time and the value of travel time is 1.95, while the ratio between the value of access time and the value of travel time is 2.57, which is considered valid only for this context.
C59|Neighbourhood effects and social behaviour: the case of irrigated and rainfed farmeres in Bohol, the Philippines|Artefactual field experiments, spatial econometrics, and household survey are blended in a single study to investigate how the experience of collective irrigation management in the real world facilitates the spillover of social behaviour among neighbours. The dictator and public goods games are conducted among irrigated and non-irrigated rice farmers in the Philippines. The spillover effect is found only among irrigated farmers. In the public goods game, punishment through social disapproval reduces free-riding more effectively among irrigated farmers. These indicate that strengthened ties among neighbours are likely to induce the spillover of social norms together with an effective punishment mechanism.

C59|International diversification and dependence structure of equity portfolios during market crashes: the Archimedean copula approach|This paper analyzes the effect of the recent market crash on the international diversification of equity portfolios from the perspective of dependence structure. We use the generalized Pareto distribution to fit the left and the right tail of each return distribution in order to evaluate the upside and the downside risk measures separately after removing both autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity in the historical returns. We thereafter build a multivariate generalized Pareto distribution and draw one million simulated returns for each time series using three Archimedean copulas – Gumbel, Clayton and Frank. Using the data from emerging and developed countries; we find that the Clayton copula exhibits strong left tail dependence structure with higher Sharpe ratio and relatively weak right tail dependence after the subprime crisis. We also find that the Clayton copula is ultimately useful in modelling the left tail dependence structure in bear markets only. In addition; our empirical results show that both the Gumbel and Frank copulas produce the same magnitude of Sharpe ratio in bull and bear markets. The Frank copula is found to be useful in modelling returns with strong positive or negative dependence; while the Gumbel copula is found to be useful in modelling the upper tail of the return distribution in bull markets only.
C59|Multivariate Methods For Monitoring Structural Change| Detection of structural change is a critical empirical activity, but continuous 'monitoring' of series, for structural changes in real time, raises well-known econometric issues that have been explored in a single series context. If multiple series co-break then it is possible that simultaneous examination of a set of series helps identify changes with higher probability or more rapidly than when series are examined on a case-by-case basis. Some asymptotic theory is developed for maximum and average CUSUM detection tests. Monte Carlo experiments suggest that these both provide an improvement in detection relative to a univariate detector over a wide range of experimental parameters, given a sufficiently large number of co-breaking series. This is robust to a cross-sectional correlation in the errors (a factor structure) and heterogeneity in the break dates. We apply the test to a panel of UK price indices<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
C59|Attributes Determining Condominium Prices in Bangkok (in Thai)|The housing market, particularly the condominium sector in Bangkok has been rapidly expanding. In this paper, the hedonic price model is used to analyze the housing attributes that determine the price of condominiums in Bangkok. The Box-Cox technique is used to find an appropriate functional form of the model. The data of condominium prices and 20 attributes of 146 condominium units were collected from 42 sales offices during 1-31 January 2011. The results indicate that the attributes determining the price of condominium in Bangkok were: project location, proximity to sky train and subway, unit location, unit size, furniture, total number of units in a project, land size, waiting duration before construction is completed, reputation of developers, parking space, common fee for maintenance and services, and number of bedrooms. The estimated coefficients indicate relative prices of the attributes which can be used as reference prices for buyers, developers and banks.
C59|Ex Ante Impact Assessment of a Drought Tolerant Rice Variety in the Presence of Climate Change| Rice productivity and sustainability are continually threatened by abiotic stresses, particularly in the era of global climate change. In severe cases, 100% yield loss can be experienced due solely to abiotic stresses, such as drought. The situation may become worse due to climate change that may multiply the frequency and severity of such abiotic stresses. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop improved varieties that are more resilient to abiotic stresses. This study examines the net economic benefit and potential economic impacts of developing and disseminating a drought tolerant rice variety in South Asia. Drought is one of the most destructive abiotic stresses that not only causes major rice yield losses in South Asia, but also in other parts of Asia and Africa. Using the ORYZA2000 crop simulation model, we demonstrate that the new variety can provide yield gains in South Asia both when there is no change in the climate and also under the different climate scenarios projected by CGCM climate model. Moreover, our economic surplus analysis shows that the economic benefits from the successful development and dissemination of a drought tolerant variety more than outweigh the research investments needed to develop the variety. The partial equilibrium models we used also indicate that rice production is higher and rice prices are lower when a drought tolerant variety is adopted in South Asia (as compared to the case without this new variety). This in turn can lead to more sustainable rice production, improved food security, and better nutritional outcomes for the poor.
C59|Combinación de pronósticos.Una aplicación a la inflación de Bolivia|Hasta la actualidad los métodos utilizados en el Banco Central de Bolivia para el pronóstico de inflación y otras variables importantes para decisiones de política monetaria han consistido en modelos individuales, principalmente estadísticos y econométricos. En los últimos años, en la literatura de pronósticos han cobrado una marcada importancia los métodos de combinación de pronósticos y modelos de factores debido a su superioridad en términos de menor varianza de errores de pronóstico. En este artículo se aplican estos métodos al pronóstico de inflación utilizando una muestra que comprende el periodo 1993 – 2010, con periodicidad mensual. Entre los resultados importantes se encontró que los pronósticos mediante la combinación de pronósticos son superiores a los modelos individuales, aunque los modelos de factores no muestran una clara ventaja sobre los modelos individuales. Sin embargo, mediante una prueba de englobamiento se constató que ninguna de estas metodologías resulta superior.

Los modelos se fundamentan en las técnicas de análisis de supervivencia.
C59|Clusters of firms in an inhomogeneous space: The high-tech industries in Milan|Why do industrial clusters occur in space? Is it because industries need to stay close together to interact or, conversely, because they concentrate in certain portions of space to exploit favourable conditions like public incentives, proximity to communication networks, to big population concentrations or to reduce transport costs? This is a fundamental question and the attempt to answer to it using empirical data is a challenging statistical task. In economic geography scientists refer to this dichotomy using the two categories of spatial interaction and spatial reaction to common factors. In economics we can refer to a distinction between exogenous causes and endogenous effects. In spatial econometrics and statistics we use the terms of spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity. A series of recent papers introduced explorative methods to analyse the spatial patterns of firms using micro data and characterizing each firm by its spatial coordinates. In such a setting a spatial distribution of firms is seen as a point pattern and an industrial cluster as the phenomenon of extra-concentration of one industry with respect to the concentration of a benchmarking spatial distribution. Often the benchmarking distribution is that of the whole economy on the ground that exogenous factors affect in the same way all branches. Using such an approach a positive (or negative) spatial dependence between firms is detected when the pattern of a specific sector is more aggregated (or more dispersed) than the one of the whole economy. In this paper we suggest a parametric approach to the analysis of spatial heterogeneity, based on the so-called inhomogeneous K-function (Baddeley et al., 2000). We present an empirical application of the method to the spatial distribution of high-tech industries in Milan (Italy) in 2001. We consider the economic space to be non homogenous, we estimate the pattern of inhomogeneity and we use it to separate spatial heterogeneity from spatial dependence.
C59|A comparison of the Lee–Carter model and AR–ARCH model for forecasting mortality rates|With the decline in the mortality level of populations, national social security systems and insurance companies of most developed countries are reconsidering their mortality tables taking into account the longevity risk. The Lee and Carter model is the first discrete-time stochastic model to consider the increased life expectancy trends in mortality rates and is still broadly used today. In this paper, we propose an alternative to the Lee–Carter model: an AR(1)–ARCH(1) model. More specifically, we compare the performance of these two models with respect to forecasting age-specific mortality in Italy. We fit the two models, with Gaussian and t-student innovations, for the matrix of Italian death rates from 1960 to 2003. We compare the forecast ability of the two approaches in out-of-sample analysis for the period 2004–2006 and find that the AR(1)–ARCH(1) model with t-student innovations provides the best fit among the models studied in this paper.

C59|Futures basis, inventory and commodity price volatility: An empirical analysis|We employ a large dataset of physical inventory data on 21 different commodities for the period 1993–2011 to empirically analyze the behavior of commodity prices and their volatility as predicted by the theory of storage. We examine two main issues. First, we analyze the relationship between inventory and the shape of the forward curve. Low (high) inventory is associated with forward curves in backwardation (contango), as the theory of storage predicts. Second, we show that price volatility is a decreasing function of inventory for the majority of commodities in our sample. This effect is more pronounced in backwardated markets. Our findings are robust with respect to alternative inventory measures and over the recent commodity price boom.
C59|GDP Growth and the Interdependency of Volatility Spillovers|This paper examines the dynamics of cross-country GDP volatility transmission and their conditional correlations. We use quarterly data (1961-2008) for Australia, Canada, the UK and the US to construct and estimate a multivariate generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (MGARCH) model. According to the results from the mean growth equations, we identified significant cross-country GDP growth spillover among these countries. Furthermore, the growth volatility between the US and Canada indicates the highest conditional correlation. As expected, we also found that the shock influences are mainly exerted by the larger economies onto the smaller economies.
C59|Directional forecasting in financial time series using support vector machines: The USD/Euro exchange rate|In this paper, we present a novel machine learning based forecasting system of the EU/USD exchange rate directional changes. Specifically, we feed an overcomplete variable set to a Support Vector Machines (SVM) model and refine it through a Sensitivity Analysis process. The dataset spans from 1/1/1999 to 30/11/2011; the data of the last 7 months are reserved for out-of-sample testing. Results show that the proposed scheme outperforms various other machine learning methods treating similar scenarios.
C59|More random or more deterministic choices? The effects of information on preferences for biodiversity conservation|For many years, stated preference researchers have been interested in the effects of information on willingness to pay for environmental goods. Within the random utility model, information about an environmental good might impact on preferences and on scale (error variance), both between and within samples of choices. In this paper, we extend the G-MNL model to investigate the effects of different information sets on choices over the management of biodiversity in the UK, looking specifically at moorlands managed for red grouse shooting. Specifically, we make the individual scale parameter a function of observable (dataset-specific) characteristics. Our results show that changing information sets results in significant differences in the mean scale between datasets, and in the variance of scale. Respondents are more deterministic in their choices and show lower within-sample scale heterogeneity in the alternative information treatment. Changes in information provision also effect willingness to pay estimates, reducing the value people place on the conservation of two iconic birds of prey. The methods used will also be of interest to researchers who need to combine choice experiment data sets.

A reexamination of the role of religion in economic growth|Barro and McCleary (2003) is a key research contribution in the new literature exploring the macroeconomic effects of religious beliefs. This paper represents an effort to evaluate the strength of their claims. We evaluate their results in terms of replicability and robustness. While we find that their analysis meets the standard of statistical replicability, we do not find that the results are robust to changes in their baseline statistical specification. Taken together, we conclude that their analysis cannot be taken to provide useable evidence on how religion might affect aggregate outcomes.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
C59|Impacts of Crisis Events on International Tourism Demand in Thailand (in Thai)|This study assesses the impacts of nine major crisis events during 2001-2009 on the declining number of foreign tourists in Thailand. The SARIMA with intervention models and X-12-ARIMA are applied. The results show that each of the crises gave different effects on the number of tourists depending on the duration of situation, type of crisis, and country of origin. The impacts from the disease outbreaks were greater than those from other crises, but the degrees of impacts are likely to decrease if the similar outbreaks occur. In contrast, the impact from the internal political chaos was relatively small for its first time crisis, but it will be greater if it happens again. The Tsunami gave a big impact but the recovery rate was faster than that of other crises. The 9/11 event had made a minimal impact on Thai tourism. Based on the results, it is suggested that solving the internal politics should be the first priority if it aims to enhance Thailand’s tourism industry. In addition, the measures used for solving crises should be designed to fit with each of foreign tourist markets’ diverse responsiveness.
C59|Forecasting in the presence of recent structural change|We examine how to forecast after a recent break. We consider monitoring for change and then combining forecasts from models that do and do not use data before the change; and robust methods, namely rolling regressions, forecast averaging over different windows and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) forecasting. We derive analytical results for the performance of the robust methods relative to a full-sample recursive benchmark. For a location model subject to stochastic breaks the relative mean square forecast error ranking is EWMA
C59|A Structural Approach for Testing Causality|"The ever present possibility of confounding factors creates difficulties in identifying causal effects on the basis of observational data. A large number of approaches to resolve this difficulty have been proposed; see Zaman (2010) for a recent survey. One involves using a ""natural experiment"" where nature acts like an experimenter in changing the setting of a key variable, allowing us to differentiate between ""treatment"" and ""control"" observations. This idea has been used by Hendry and Ericsson (1991), Hoover (2001), and Keane (2010) in rather complex settings. This paper presents an elementary version of this structural approach for detecting causality in the simplest possible setting. The structural method is able to detect contemporaneous causality. We illustrate the uses of this technique on a simulated data set, and also apply it to the export-led growth hypothesis for India and energy-growth data for Shanghai."
C59|Performance Evaluation of Zero Net-Investment Strategies|This paper introduces new nonparametric statistical methods to evaluate zero-cost investment strategies. We focus on directional trading strategies, risk-adjusted returns, and the investor's decisions under uncertainty as the core of our analysis. By relying on classification tools with a long tradition in the sciences and biostatistics, we can provide a tighter connection between model-based risk characteristics and the no-arbitrage conditions for market efficiency. Moreover, we extend the methods to multicategorical settings, such as when the investor can sometimes take a neutral position. A variety of inferential procedures are provided, many of which are illustrated with applications to excess equity returns and to currency carry trades.
C59|Robust Value at Risk Prediction| This paper proposes a robust semiparametric bootstrap method to estimate predictive distributions of GARCH-type models. The method is based on a robust estimation of parametric GARCH models and a robustified resampling scheme for GARCH residuals that controls bootstrap instability due to outlying observations. A Monte Carlo simulation shows that our robust method provides more accurate Value at Risk (VaR) forecasts than classical methods, often by a large extent, especially for several days ahead horizons and/or in presence of outlying observations. An empirical application confirms the simulation results. The robust procedure outperforms in backtesting several other VaR prediction methods, such as RiskMetrics, CAViaR, historical simulation, and classical filtered historical simulation methods. We show empirically that robust estimation reduces tail estimation risk, providing more accurate and more stable VaR prediction intervals over time. Copyright The Author 2011.

C59|Desarrollo local en Isla Grande: un modelo probabilístico para la pobreza|El objetivo del presente documento es evaluar el estado actual del desarrollo local en Orika, principal asentamiento humano localizado en Isla Grande, la mayor de las 27 islas que componen el archipiélago de las Islas del Rosario en Cartagena, Colombia. Utilizando la racionalidad del concepto de desarrollo local, un modelo probabilístico para determinar la probabilidad de pobreza y la información proveniente del Censo Poblacional 2007 y la Encuesta de Hogares 2009 implementados por la Fundación Surtigas, se confirma la presunción teórica de que la exclusión y la vulnerabilidad de la población afro-descendiente, en cuanto al mercado laboral y la generación de ingresos, están asociadas a incrementos importantes en la probabilidad de ocurrencia de la pobreza.

Partiendo de larevisión del concepto de desarrollo institucional se examinan algunas experiencias de asociaciónentre diferentes actores de la región como evidencias de avances en la transformación institucional.Adicionalmente, para obtener evidencias de las posibilidades futuras de desarrollo institucional seanaliza la coherencia entre objetivos y estrategias del Plan Integral de Desarrollo Metropolitano(PIDM): Metrópoli 2008-2020. La principal conclusión que arroja este análisis es que el territorio delValle de Aburrá ha sido objeto de iniciativas de desarrollo local, así como de prácticas de cooperación,asociación y concertación de los actores públicos y privados en el diseño de estrategias locales parael desarrollo de la región. Sin embargo, la principal debilidad que se evidencia es que no existe hastael momento una acción estructurada y planeada para el desarrollo o fortalecimiento institucional."""
C59|Nonnegative factorization and the maximum edge biclique problem|Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a data analysis technique which allows compression and interpretation of nonnegative data. NMF became widely studied after the publication of the seminal paper by Lee and Seung (Learning the Parts of Objects by Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, Nature, 1999, vol. 401, pp. 788--791), which introduced an algorithm based on Multiplicative Updates (MU). More recently, another class of methods called Hierarchical Alternating Least Squares (HALS) was introduced that seems to be much more efficient in practice. In this paper, we consider the problem of approximating a not necessarily nonnegative matrix with the product of two nonnegative matrices, which we refer to as Nonnegative Factorization~(NF)~; this is the subproblem that HALS methods implicitly try to solve at each iteration. We prove that NF is NP-hard for any fixed factorization rank, using a reduction to the maximum edge biclique problem. We also generalize the multiplicative updates to NF, which allows us to shed some light on the differences between the MU and HALS algorithms for NMF and give an explanation for the better performance of HALS. Finally, we link stationary points of NF with feasible solutions of the biclique problem to obtain a new type of biclique finding algorithm (based on MU) whose iterations have an algorithmic complexity proportional to the number of edges in the graph, and show that it performs better than comparable existing methods.
C59|Causal Relations via Econometrics|Applied econometric work takes a superficial approach to causality. Understanding economic affairs, making good policy decisions, and progress in the economic discipline depend on our ability to infer causal relations from data. We review the dominant approaches to causality in econometrics, and suggest why they fail to give good results. We feel the problem cannot be solved by traditional tools, and requires some out-of-the-box thinking. Potentially promising approaches to solutions are discussed.
C59|Yonetim Fonksiyonlarinin Uygulandýgý Alanlarda Ortaya Cýkan Hata Degerlerinin Olusturduðu Yeni Iliskilerin Panel Veri Modelleri ile Irdelenmesi|Since the results of the decisions made in the companies could be different, this causes loss for the company or problems for them. The reverse of this happens as well. The decisions made could bring the company in a positive area or in a very profitable position. The results of the decisions about management, coordination, organise, control and supervision which are considered as management function are not investigated in the companies. In this study the relationship between realizations and expectations about management function is tested. The area composed of errors are considered as management areas. Since the data belonging to the companies operating under the holding are a component of a whole, panel data of the companies are used. Panel regression analysis is undertaken using the financial variables of 8 companies between 1999 and 2008 in the research. In our analyses made in order to investigate the determinants of net sales it is found that personal expenses have a great impact whereas cost of material variable has a limited effect on net sales. Also, the profitability of the companies is investigated. According to research results sales it is found that personal expenses have a small coefficient whereas cost of material variable has a relatively greater effect on net sales than the other variables. Finally, it is found that there is a positive and significant relationship between the net sales and the profitability of the companies. It shows us that bigger companies have a higher probability of obtaining more profits. This finding shows us that companies could increase their profitability in case companies grow due to mergers.

C59|Development of Supply and Demand Functions of Pakistan’s Wheat Crop|A simultaneous-equations model was used to capture the supply and demand functions for Pakistan’s wheat sector at the national level. This model reflects the fact that Pakistan’s domestic wheat supply is priceresponsive and positively affected by the use of nutrient fertilizers. While price appears to be a statistically significant factor on the supply side, it is statistically insignificant on the demand side. Population size appears to be very significant in determining wheat demand. The wheat import supply seems to be influenced by the current world wheat price, current world wheat supplies, Pakistan’s domestic consumption in previous years, and domestic supply in previous years. We recommend that policymakers allow market forces to play a role in the wheat economy in a way that protects producers from adverse market conditions. The availability of various nutrient fertilizers should be central to policies on future inputs use. Work is also needed on wheat alternatives so that the country’s dependence on wheat is eased as much as possible.
C59|A Framework For The Treatment Of Financial Contagion Effects In The Context Of The Actual European Turbulences|There is still a debate regarding a possible restoring of the confidence in European financial markets because there are still underlying problems from the super-sized finance that actually worsened. Anti crisis strategy efficiency and future costs of real reform make analysts more prudent in forecasts. In addition, a possible reduction risk appetite and the loss of confidence will fuel a negative perspective regarding the recovery of emerging economies, extreme fragile to regional or global contagion effects. In modern financial crises, the events spiral out of control, panic and contagion come very fast. Greek debt crisis is the most serious extreme financial event in the Eurozone, with severe contagion features. An analysis of Eurocontagion effects in the context of Greece crisis by using a dynamic version of the Hawkes jump-diffusion model is suggested.
C59|Measuring industrial agglomeration with inhomogeneous K-function: the case of ICT firms in Milan (Italy)|Why do industrial clusters occur in space? Is it because industries need to stay close together to interact or, conversely, because they concentrate in certain portions of space to exploit favourable conditions like public incentives, proximity to communication networks, to big population concentrations or to reduce transport costs? This is a fundamental question and the attempt to answer to it using empirical data is a challenging statistical task. In economic geography scientists refer to this dichotomy using the two categories of spatial interaction and spatial reaction to common factors. In economics we can refer to a distinction between exogenous causes and endogenous effects. In spatial econometrics and statistics we use the terms of spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity. A series of recent papers introduced explorative methods to analyses the spatial patterns of firms using micro data and characterizing each firm by its spatial coordinates. In such a setting a spatial distribution of firms is seen as a point pattern and an industrial cluster as the phenomenon of extra-concentration of one industry with respect to the concentration of a benchmarking spatial distribution. Often the benchmarking distribution is that of the whole economy on the ground that exogenous factors affect in the same way all branches. Using such an approach a positive (or negative) spatial dependence between firms is detected when the pattern of a specific sector is more aggregated (or more dispersed) than the one of the whole economy. In this paper we suggest a parametric approach to the analysis of spatial heterogeneity, based on the socalled inhomogeneous K-function (Baddeley et al., 2000). We present an empirical application of the method to the spatial distribution of high-tech industries in Milan (Italy) in 2001. We consider the economic space to be non homogenous, we estimate the pattern of inhomogeneity and we use it to separate spatial heterogeneity from spatial dependence.
C59|Análisis de la volatibilidad del IGBC en época de crisis (2005-2006)|Este trabajo investiga el comportamiento de la volatilidad del mercado accionario colombiano en el periodo de crisis evidenciado en el segundo trimestre de 2006. Para medir esa volatilidad se utilizaron modelos de heterocedasticidad condicional autorregresivos y sus extensiones, como el modelo exponencial y Threshold. Los resultados del estudio mostraron que en los momentos de mayor crisis, la volatilidad aumentó y se concentró, disminuyendo el rendimiento del mercado. A su vez, se observa la presencia de efecto Leverage en los rendimientos del IGBC y por último se evidencia la presencia de asimetrías en la volatilidad de los rendimientos ante impactos negativos y positivos, produciéndose una mayor dependencia del mercado ante impactos negativos. Al comparar los valores de máxima verosimilitud en los modelos, se observó que los modelos asimétricos EGARCH (1,1) y TGARCH (1,1) capturaron mejor los impactos en los rendimientos que el modelo simétrico GARCH (1,1).
C59|Causas do desmatamento da Amazônia: uma aplicação do teste de causalidade de Granger acerca das principais fontes de desmatamento nos municípios da Amazônia Legal brasileira [Causes of deforestation in the Amazon]|Many are the factors indicated by the pertinent literature concerning the causes of deforestation in Brazilian Legal Amazon. From endogenous aspects as the edafo-climatic conditions to aspects related to anthropic action, like the population movements, urban growth, and especially, the independent or induced actions of the different public and private economic agents who have acted in the region, historically configuring the processes of occupation of the land and economic exploitation of the Amazonian region. The objective of this article is to perform a causality test, in the Granger sense, in the main variables suggested as important that explain the deforestation of the Legal Amazon, in the period from 1997 to 2006. The methodology to be used is based on dynamic models for the panel data, developed by Holtz-Eakin et al. (1988) and Arellano-Bond (1991) who developed a causality test based on the seminal article of Granger (1969). Among the main results found is the empirical evidence that there is a bidirectional causality between deforestation and the areas of permanent and temporary cultures, as well as the size of the cattle herd.
C59|R/S analysis and DFA: finite sample properties and confidence intervals|We focus on finite sample properties of two mostly used methods of Hurst exponent H estimation – R/S analysis and DFA. Even though both methods have been widely applied on different types of financial assets, only several papers have dealt with finite sample properties which are crucial as the properties differ significantly from the asymptotic ones. Recently, R/S analysis has been shown to overestimate H when compared with DFA. However, we show on the random time series with lengths from 2^9 to 2^17 that even though the estimates of R/S are truly significantly higher than an asymptotic limit of 0.5, they remain very close to the estimates proposed by Anis & Lloyd and the estimated standard deviations are lower than the ones of DFA. On the other hand, DFA estimates are very close to 0.5. The results propose that R/S still remains useful and robust method even when compared to newer method of DFA which is usually preferred in recent literature.
C59|The role of the portfolio measurement in actual economic crisis|The main banking operation is lending. Indeed, between banks investments at the first place are credits. For good credits bank have to be visible, especially at stock exchange. In the study of capital markets, the temptation of yield is a forecast great. Many studies and models have tried to discover which is the future trend of banking activity on stock exchange and the interest rates, starting from a set of information from the past that many behavior often includes prices, the PER, capitalization, etc. An interesting theory in this field theory is walking randomly (the random walk hypothesis). The most dificile to manage is the portofolio in crisis conditions. In this sense we propose ARCH models to manage the portofolio quality in crisis conditions for some banks at BSE (Bucharest Stock Exchange).
C59|Verification of selected market microstructure hypotheses for a Warsaw Stock Exchange traded stock| This paper uses a restricted factor model to estimate the HICP index excluding relative prices changes. The index thus obtained, hereinafter referred to as pure inflation, demonstrates stronger relationship to This paper analyses the properties of the transaction process for the most liquid stock traded at the Warsaw Stock Exchange, namely Bioton (ISIN: PLBIOTN00029), in the light of market microstructure theory. The Autoregressive Conditional Duration and Autoregressive Conditional Multinomial models are estimated for the transaction process. Estimation results are interpreted in favour or against market microstructure hypotheses. Tests are conducted for the ACD models in order to assess their fit to the data and in order to search for ways of improving fit. The article is a follow-up of research by Bien [1].
C59|Skilled Immigration and Wages in Australia| This paper investigates the impact of the relative growth of skilled migration on the structure of Australian wages. Unlike conventional approaches, the present study uses macro data to examine the response of wages to immigration flows. We use instrumental variable techniques to control for the potential endogeneity of immigration. The results, using alternative estimation strategies, are consistent with the dominant findings from existing empirical work. There is no robust evidence that a relative increase in skilled immigrants exerts any discernible adverse consequences on the wage structure in Australia.

C59|Are Any Growth Theories Robust?| This article investigates the strength of empirical evidence for various growth theories when there is model uncertainty with respect to the correct growth model. Using model averaging methods, we find little evidence that so-called fundamental growth theories play an important role in explaining aggregate growth. In contrast, we find strong evidence for macroeconomic policy effects and a role for unexplained regional heterogeneity, as well as some evidence of parameter heterogeneity in the aggregate production function. We conclude that the ability of cross-country growth regressions to adjudicate the relative importance of alternative growth theories is limited. Copyright © 2008 The Author(s).
C59|The Market for Lemmas: Evidence That Complex Models Rarely Operate in Our World|The market for models whose mathematical proofs are so lengthy and complex as to call for the delineation of intermediate steps with lemmas (Lemma 1, Lemma 2, etc.) expanded remarkably in prominent economic journals during the final four decades of the 20th century. However, Alfred Marshall, Paul Samuelson, and Donald Gordon explained that the worthiness of long chains of analytic reasoning depends critically on the stability or durability of the relations involved; in economic relations, the soundness of long chains are subject to â€œradioactive decay,â€ to use Samuelsonâ€™s phrase. Here we draw on this insight and provide evidence that: (1) there has been remarkable growth in the frequency of articles with lemmas published in some top general-interest journals; (2) a sample of 12 lemma-heavy articles in Journal of Economic Theory have resulted in very few operational statements; (3) articles that cited the lemma-heavy articles have generated few operational statements; (4) lemmas are rare among the most-cited articles that appeared in the top general interest journals; and (5) true to the point about â€œradioactive decay,â€ most-cited articles with lemmas are more likely to be on statistical/econometric analytics than economic analytics.
C59|Market Valuation, Pension Fund Policy and Contribution Volatility|Market valuation is becoming more and more popular, both in accounting and regulation, as well as in academic circles. For pension funds and their participants, the knowledge that market-valued pension liabilities can indeed be transferred to a third party, if necessary, is a great virtue. Using a simulation model, this paper demonstrates the implicit costs and benefits of using market valuation for a typical Dutch pension fund, which offers a guaranteed average pay nominal pension with conditional indexation. The impact turns out to be fairly small, if fixed discount rates are still used for conditional rights. However, if market valuation is used for both unconditional and conditional rights, contribution volatility increases significantly. A remedy is to increase the duration of assets considerably. It is not clear, though, whether this option is available for large pension funds given the limited supply of long-term bonds.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
C59|An Investigation of the Effectiveness of Financial Development in Pakistan|This study attempts to discern the relationship between economic and financial development in Pakistan for the period 1973 - 2006. Vector error-correction modeling is used toidentify the causality between economic and financial development and the exogeneity of the variable(s) in the model. These error correction terms have been derived from Johansen’s multivariate cointegrating procedure. Results indicate that, in the long run, economic development causes financial development. Furthermore, the real output variable is found to beexogenous. Thus, financial development is seen to be ineffective in terms of economic development determination in Pakistan.
C59|Impact of Intellectual Capital Efficiency on Profitability (A Case Study of LSE25 Companies)|The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between intellectual capital efficiency and the firm's profitability. The importance of intellectual capital (IC) and the related philosophy of the knowledge economy have captured the attention of researchers and business enterprises in the World Trade Organization (WTO) era. IC is widely recognized as a tool that is critical to running a successful business in a highly competitive environment. Various models have been introduced to measure the numerous facets of IC, including the Skandia navigator, Tobin's Q, and value added intellectual coefficient (VAIC). This article examines the role of IC efficiency in the firm’s net profit using the VAIC developed by Ante Pulic (1998). It also investigates its correlation with the firm’s profitability, using regression models. A five-year data set for Lahore Stock Exchange Index companies (LSE-25) was obtained from audited financial reports, and used to calculate human capital, structural capital, and capital-employed efficiency of companies in different industrial sectors. The results obtained using multiple regression analysis supports the argument that IC efficiency contributes significantly to the firm's profitability. Practically, IC efficiency can be used as a benchmark and strategicindicator to direct financial and intellectual resources in the right direction, i.e., to enhance the firm’s ultimate corporate value. It can also be developed as a management tool to create a sustainable comparative advantage in the competitive global knowledge economy. The study is a pioneering attempt to measure the impact of IC efficiency on net profit using cross sectional time series data.
C59|Using sentiment to predict GDP growth and stock returns|This study sheds new light on the question of whether or not sentiment surveys, and the expectations derived from them, are relevant to forecasting economic growth and stock returns, and whether they contain information that is orthogonal to macroeconomic and financial data. I examine 16 sentiment surveys of distinct respondent universes and employ the technique of principal components analysis to extract the common signals from the surveys. I show that the ability of different population groups to anticipate correctly economic growth and excess stock returns is not identical, implying that not all sentiment is the same, although there exist some common components. I demonstrate that sentiment surveys have significant predictive power for both GDP growth and excess stock returns, and that the results are robust to the inclusion of information pertaining to the macroeconomic environment and momentum. Furthermore, the findings reject the conventional wisdom that the effect of sentiment is apparent exclusively in small-capitalization stocks.
C59|Impact Of Globalisation On The Evolution Of The Demographic Phenomenon|Globalisation is manifest under the form of some globalising processes, respectively the basic operational-action assembly for successive achievement of the purposes and objectives proposed within each stage. Globalisation and demography are the two main forces that model the development of contemporary societies and implicitly of the European one. Both provide for opportunities but also raise issues. Based on the Bosco Model we highlight the interdependency between the decision to migrate and the migratory balance between similar countries, with the exception of labour market, under the conditions in which wages are endogenously determined. The existence of some differences was assumed also between the semi-elasticity of wages in relation to unemployment rates.
C59|Virtual Worlds as Petri Dishes for the Social and Behavioral Sciences|The next tool for social science experimentation should allow for macro level, generalizable, scientific research. In the past devices such as rat mazes, Petri dishes and supercolliders have been developed when scientists needed new tools to do research. We believe that Virtual Worlds are the modern equivalent to supercolliders for social scientists, and feel they should be the next area to receive significant attention and funding. The advantages provided by virtual worlds research outweigh the costs. Virtual worlds allow for societal level research with no harm to humans, la rge numbers of experiments and participants, and make long term and panel studies possible. Virtual worlds do have some drawbacks, in that they are expensive and time consuming to build. These obstacles can be overcome, however, by adopting the models of revenue and maintenance practiced by the current game industry. The returns from virtual worlds being used as scientific tools could reach levels that would self fund future search for decades to come. However, at the beginning an investment of funding agencies seems to be necessary.
C59|Expansionary Fiscal Contraction Hypothesis: The Case Of Turkey|Recently both empiricial and theoretical studies focus on expansionary fiscal contraction hypothesis (EFC), according to which fiscal contractions stimulate consumption and also lead to an increase in aggregate demand and output. In this paper the validity of the EFC hypothesis is tested for Turkey from 1987 to 2006 by means of structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models. Impulse response analysis is carried out by imposing long-run restrictions on Vector Error-correction Models (VECM). Structural shocks in government expenditure, terms of trade and income are decomposed into permanent and transitory components. Long-run identifying restrictions are imposed on the effects of permanent shocks. Empirical analysis indicates that fiscal contractions are not expansionary in Turkey. Based on the findings, terms of trade and supply shocks seem to have more explanatory effect on consumption expenditure.
C59|Viewpoint: Replication in economics|This examination of the role and potential for replication in economics points out the paucity of both pure replication - checking on others' published papers using their data - and scientific replication - using data representing different populations in one's own work or in a comment. Several controversies in empirical economics are used to illustrate how and how not to behave when replicating others' work. The incentives for replication are examined, and proposals aimed at journal editors and authors are advanced that might stimulate an activity that most economists applaud but few perform.

C59|Does Sending Farmers Back to School Have An Impact? A Spatial Econometric Approach| The Farmer Field School (FFS) is an intensive training program providing farmers with science based knowledge and practices, including the integrated pesticide management (IPM). Recently there has been intensive debates as to whether or not this kind of training has any significant impact. Most case studies argue that the impact, in terms of a farmers ability to reduce the use or pesticides while increasing yields, is significant. However, studies conducted by Feder et al., using a household panel data set for Indonesia, could not confirm that this is the case. This paper utilises Feder et al.s data set and applies a spatial econometric technique to re-evaluate whether or not the FFS induces better performances among farmers enrolled in the program and also among their neighbours, who are expected to receive some spillover knowledge from the FFS alumna.
C59|Estimating The Tourism Potential In Namibia|This paper investigates the determinants of tourism in Namibia for the period 1996 to 2005. The results indicate that an increase in trading partners’ income, depreciation of the exchange rate, improvement in Namibia’s infrastructure, sharing a border with Namibia are associated with an increase in tourist arrivals. The results show that there is unexploited tourism potential from Angola, Austria, Botswana, Germany, South Africa and the United States of America. This suggests that it is important to exploit the tourism potential as this would help to accelerate economic growth and generate the much needed employment.

C59|Measurement and Inference in Wine Tasting|The paper has three basic objectives: (1) to discuss and analyze the subtleties of ranking wines in blind tastings, (2) to analyze the degree of agreement or disagreement among the tasters (judges) and (3) to shed some light on the problem of identifying the wines and to determine when the identifications of the judges might be called statistically significant. The first issue utilizes the rank sums or the related measure, “votes against,” and discusses the appropriateness of a statistical test introduced by Kramer. The second introduces Kendall's W coefficient of concordance and discusses some other, related measures. The third derives the finite sample distribution of the number of correct identifications under the null hypothesis of random identifications, from which critical values can be obtained, both for the case in which each wine has to be identified exactly and the case in which there is a small number of different types of wine that have to be identified.

C59|Foreign Direct Investment in Brazil and Home Country Risk|This study looks into the factors that explain foreign direct investment in Brazil by country of origin of investment. Based on a sample of more than 100 countries that invested and have not yet invested in Brazil, multiple estimation techniques, such as the Tobit, Heckit and Probit, are used to isolate the effect of country risk on outward foreign direct investment. In sharp contrast to the findings of previous studies on the effect of home country risk on foreign investment in the United States, the findings in this paper reveal that less risky countries invest more in Brazil. These results are controlled for size of the home country, distance, trade intensity and previous investments abroad. A simple out of sample check shows that the model correctly predicts probability of investing for a large number of countries. The existing literature does not document these results.
C59|Influence Of Income And Education On Household Health Expenditure: The Case Of Tribal Orissa|Most of the health economics researches dealt with macro aspects of it. Little attention has been given to the micro aspects of Health Economics by the researchers, government, policy makers and development planners. In this context the present study examines the effect of income and education of the household on its health expenditure based on primary data. The descriptive statistics for tribal area shows that per head income (PHI) is Rs. 5143.75 per annum with 2555.27 and 0.5 as standard deviation and coefficient variation respectively where as per head health expenditure (PHE) is Rs. 108.13 per annum with 91.36 and 0.84 as standard deviation and coefficient variation respectively. The mean education is 0.22 with 0.41 and 1.91 as standard deviation and coefficient variation respectively. To find out the impact of household income (PHI) and education of the head of the household (EDN) on the pattern of health expenditure (PHE) a linear regression model is found to be fitted as PHET = 31.37 + 0.43PHI + 0.06EDN with R2 value 0.18, which indicates that, ceteris paribus, a rupee increase income brings about forty-three paise increase health expenditure and an educated person on an average spends six paise more in a rupee than the uneducated person on health expenditure in tribal area.
C59|Nonlinear Bivariate Comovements of Asset Prices: Theory and Tests|Comovements among asset prices have received a lot of attention for several reasons. For example, comovements are important in cross-hedging and cross-speculation; they determine capital allocation both domestically and in international meanÐvariance portfolios and also, they are useful in investigating the extent of integration among financial markets. In this paper we propose a new methodology for the nonÐlinear modelling of bivariate comovements. Our approach extends the ones presented in the recent literature. In fact, our methodology outlined in three steps, allows the evaluation and the statistical testing of non-linearly driven comovements between two given random variables. Moreover, when such a bivariate dependence relationship is detected, our approach solves for a polynomial approximation. We illustrate our threeÐsteps methodology to the time series of energy related asset prices. Finally, we exploit this dependence relationship and its polynomial approximation to obtain analytical approximations of the Greeks for the European call and put options in terms of an asset whose price comoves with the price of the underlying asset.
C59|Firm's R & D Behavior Under Rational Expectations|This paper reports results from a forecasting study for inflation, industrial output and exchange rates for India. We cannot reject the null hypothesis for linearity for all series used except for the growth rate of the foreign exchange series and our analysis is based on linear models, ARIMA and bivariate transfer functions and restricted VAR. Forecasting performance is evaluated using the models’ root mean-squared error differences and Theil’s inequality coefficients from recursive origin static, fixed origin dynamic and rolling origin dynamic forecasts. For models based on weekly data, based on RMSEs, we find that the bivariate models improve upon the forecasts of the ARIMA model while for models based on monthly data the ARIMA model has almost always better performance. In choosing between the two bivariate models on the basis of RMSEs, our overall results tend to support the use of a restricted VAR, as this model had the best forecasting performance more frequently than the transfer function model.

C59|How Robust Are the Linkages Between Religiosity and Economic Growth|Do variations in the degree of religiosity across countries translate into predictable differences in cross-country growth experiences? We apply a model averaging procedure to investigate the empirical robustness of linkages between religiosity and growth when other fundamental growth determinants, such as institutions, fractionalization, and geography, are simultaneously considered. Our results suggest that while religiosity variables such as belief in hell, belief in heaven, and monthly church attendance are potentially relevant to growth there is no evidence to suggest that they are either quantitatively significant or important.
C59|Palmnet: A pension asset and liability model for the Netherlands|This study presents a pension model geared to the typical pension contract in the Netherlands. It is based on a defined benefit/average earnings pension system. Nominal benefits are guaranteed and indexation is intended. The model provides a framework for analysing adjustments to such factors as the asset mix, retirement age, returns and the method of discounting, premium setting and indexation. The importance of uncertainty over interest rate movements and returns on shares is made explicit by means of stochastic and historical simulations. In this, PALMNET differs from existing, often deterministic pension models. The main findings are, first, a wage -indexed defined benefit pension is still affordable despite the current shortfall of wealth of pension funds. Second, fair value accounting considerably increases the volatility of pension premiums. Third, reducing risks by adjusting the asset mix towards more bonds is costly in terms of average premiums, but reduces the volatility. These conclusions are based on realistic to conservative assumptions regarding returns and risks.
C59|Structural changes in volatility and stock market development: Evidence for Spain|In this paper we review the factors that may lead to structural changes in stock market volatility and present an analysis that assesses whether Spanish stock market volatility has changed significantly over the period 1941-2001. This period corresponds to the years of more profound development of both the financial and the productive sides of the economy in this country. We use alternative methodologies of endogenous breakpoint detection that estimate the dates at which the behavior of stock market volatility changed. The analysis of the Spanish stock market suggests that volatility has behaved in a different manner over the period 1941-2001: From 1972 to 2001, the years of more intense development of the stock market, the Spanish stock market has been characterized by a higher level of volatility and a lower persistence. This effect is partly attributable to the increased growth of trading volume brought about by the economic development process<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

A functional method of analysis is derived, and the arguments for the employed application are presented. In addition, logarithmic and functional methods of pyramidal analysis are compared.
C59|A market model for inflation|The various macro econometrics models for inflation are helpless when it comes to the pricing of inflation derivatives. The only article targeting inflation option pricing, the Jarrow Yildirim model (2000), relies on non observable data. This makes the estimation of the model parameters a non trivial problem. In addition, their framework does not examine any relationship between the most liquid inflation derivatives instruments : the year to year and zero coupon swap. To fill this gap, we see how to derive a model on inflation, based on traded and liquid market instrument. Applying the same strategy as the one for a market model on interest rates, we derive no-arbitrage relationship between zero coupon and year to year swaps. We explain how to compute the convexity adjustment and what relationship the volatility surface should satisfy. Within this framework, it becomes much easier to estimate model parameters and to price inflation derivatives in a consistent way.
C59|Financial incentives to work for married mothers under a new tax system|The introduction of A New Tax System in July 2000 included substantial changes to social security payments, including family assistance and child care subsidies. Most of these payments are income tested, so that as a family’s income increases the amount of government assistance it receives is reduced. This article analyses the impact of increasing income and child care costs on the financial incentives for women with children to increase their participation in paid work. The results show that for some families increasing the mother’s hours of work has a very small impact on the family’s disposable income.
C59|Using systems engineering software to build a model of the monetary circuit| The Circuitists are a largely European school of economic thought that argue that a monetary economy is fundamentally different to a barter system, and that therefore money cannot be simply modelled as the n+1th good in a Walrasian general equilibrium system. However, while the School has made major contributions to the theory of endogenous money, it has not yet succeeded in constructing a model of the monetary circuit, which is its alternative to general equilibrium modelling. Starting from the first principles by which the School derives its powerful insights into a monetary economy, I construct a simple closed dynamic model of the circuit using systems engineering software (Mathcad). The model's behavior contradicts several propositions previously derived by Circuitists using either equilibrium conditions or unclosed dynamic models
C59|Mathematical models for planning support|In this paper we describe how computer systems can provide planners with active planning support, when these planners are carrying out their daily planning activities. This means that computer systems actively participate in the planning process by automatically generating plans or partial plans. Active planning support by computer systems requires the application of mathematical models and solution techniques. In this paper we describe the modeling process in general terms, as well as several modeling and solution techniques. We also present some background information on computational complexity theory, since most practical planning problems are hard to solve. We also describe how several objective functions can be handled, since it is rare that solutions can be evaluated by just one single objective. Furthermore, we give an introduction into the use of mathematical modeling systems, which are useful tools in a modeling context, especially during the development phases of a mathematical model. We finish the paper with a real life example related to the planning process of the rolling stock circulation of a railway operator.
C59|Medicion De La Eficiencia Bancaria En Chile A Traves De Fronteras Estocasticas (1990-1999)|We estimate inefficiency for the Chilean banking system in the period 1990-1999 through a sample of 24 national and foreign banks. Estimations indicate that the large banks are closer to their efficient frontiers (or display less x-inefficiency) as compared to the group of very small, small and medium-sized banks, which is consistent with international studies. National and large banks appear to be more efficient. It is exactly the latter group which has reported greater levels of risk and book returns. Also, the group of foreign bank branches displays the greatest levels of inefficiency, practically six times the level detected for national banks. Finally, inefficiency in the national banking system appears more clearly related to book returns that to risk.

C59|Determining The Optimal Order Picking Batch Size In Single Aisle Warehouses|This work aims at investigating the influence of picking batch size to average time in system of orders in a one-aisle warehouse under the assumption that order arrivals follow a Poisson process and items are uniformly distributed over the aisle's length. We model this problem as an M/G[k]/1 queue in which orders are served in batches of exactly orders. The average time in system of the M/G[k]/1 queue is difficult to obtain for general service times. To circumvent this obstacle, we perform an extensive numerical experiment on the average time in system of the model when the service time is deterministic (M/D[k]/1) or exponentially distributed (M/M[k]/1). These results are then compared with the corresponding times in system of the actual model taken from simulation runs. A variance analysis is carried out and its result elicits that the M/D/[k]/1 queue is a very good approximation for the average time in system of orders. Correspondingly, the optimal picking batch size of the real system can be approximated by the optimal batch size when service time is deterministic.

C59|History Dependence in the Economy. A review of the Literature|This paper presents a review on the concept of history dependence and time irreversibility in the economic literature. It presents an inventory of artificial examples where random events affect final outcomes and history cannot be reduced to the deliverer of the inevitable. It focuses mainly on recent examples and applications that, although not necessarily better than their predecessors, allow a better understanding of the mechanisms whereby history leaves its imprint. The paper reviews deterministic and stochastic models, presents some empirical illustrations and draws a few general conclusions.
C59|An Equilibrium-Correction Model for Dynamic Network Data|We propose a two-stage MRQAP to analyze dynamic network data, within the framework of an equilibrium-correction (EC) model. Extensive simulation results indicate practical relevance of our method and its improvement over standard OLS. An empirical illustration additionally shows that the EC model yields interpretable parameters, in contrast to an unrestricted dynamic model.
C59|Interest Rates Time Structure and Domestic Bond Prices|This paper considers and provides estimates of the term structure of interest rates based on observable bond prices. The paper opens with an account of the usefulness of the so-called zero-coupon yield curve as a tool for term structure modelling. Toward this, three methods are considered ? the Canadian model, the Nelson-Siegel model and its extension in the Svensson model. The author thereupon presents n both the estimation technique and the possible model restrictions. This theoretical background is applied to an estimation of the zero-coupon yield curve estimation derived from data from the Czech coupon bond market. Because of the relatively small number of coupon bonds currently available on the Czech market, the best results are produced by the Nelson-Siegel model. The growing number of state bond issues on the market, however, should increases the relevance of the Svensson model accordingly.
C59|An inquiry into the multiplier process in IS-LM model|"The multiplier theory is still an important analytical tool in many macroeconomic textbooks. For example, a number of textbook authors use the theory to explain the process of growth in goods market by expanding the multiplier process into a geometric series, and thus obtain the route of economic growth. Then some students raise an interesting question: Can we induce the dynamics of the monetary and fiscal transmission mechanism of IS-LM model through the multiplier process? (None of the textbooks involve this problem; alternative solutions are available in economics journals, but go beyond the scope of our students¡¯ knowledge.) If not, what is the problem in the analysis of the multiplier process? Here I first show some professor¡¯s deduction of the ""monetary transmission mechanism"", and then analyze the main problems and discuss the multiplier theory. Finally, I propose a generalization of the monetary transmission mechanism approach. I trace the change of demand and output in the process of increase respectively, and use a stochastic series of variables to reflect regularity in the their relationship, and obtain another two curves in IS-LM model representing their relationship In conclusion, I demonstrate theoretically that the economy will ultimately reach its equilibrium point, following the route of LM curve between one static equilibrium point to another."
C59|An Empirical Analysis of a Reaction-Function Approach to Policymaking in Greece during 1975-1993|"This paper examines the extent to which the policy instruments of money supply and budget deficit were endoigenous in Greece over the period 1975-1993. It is assumed that the policymaker's objectives are the growth rate of GNP and the balance of payments. The so-called ""reaction-function approach"" to the interdependence of economy and policy is utilised for this purpose. The empirical analysis is made in terms of a maximum likelihood methodology that reconciles co integration with optimal control techniques. It suggests that only the money-supply instrument has been endogenous in an effort to promote growth and prevent balance-of-trade deterioration."
C59|Evaluating the Rationality of Fixed-Event Forecasts|A Test of forecasts rationality based on the weak efficiency of fixed-event forecasts has recently been proposed by Nordhauss (1987). This paper considers the scope for pooling fixed-event forecasts across 'events' to deliver more powerful tests of the weak-efficiency hypothesis. In an empirial illustration we demonstrate the usefulness of this approach when only a small number of forecasts are available.
C59|Forecasting Using First-Available Versus Fully Revised Economic Time-Series Data|"First-reported monthly and quarterly time-series data on nine macroeconomic variables from 1960-1993 are given. Features of this so-called ""unrevised"" or ""first-reported data"" are discussed, and the data is compared with standard ""fully revised"" data using Granger causality tests. For the purposes of real-time forecasting, as well as comparing professional forecasts with traditional econometric forecasts, the use of unrevised (or, even better, ""real-time"") data has a number of advantages over the use of fully revised data."
C59|The Social Costs of Rent Control Revisited|The textbook graphical analysis of price control (see Figure 1) is inappropriate any time there is substantial consumer heterogeneity. In cases such as rental apartments, where one unit is usually the maximum bought per customer, and the downward slope of the demand function comes exclusively from consumer heterogeneity, this analysis misses a primary source of welfare loss. A major social cost of rent control is that without a fully operational price mechanism the 'wrong' consumers end up using apartments. When prices are set below market price, many consumers want to rent apartments even though they receive little utility from those apartments. Unless apartments are somehow allocated perfectly across consumers, rental units will be allocated to consumers who gain little utility from renting and rental units will not go to individuals who desire them greatly. The social costs of this misallocation are first order when the social costs from underprovision of housing are second order. Thus for a sufficiently marginal implementation of rent control, these costs will always be more important than the undersupply of housing. Figure 2 shows the losses graphically.

C59|The Analysis of Inter-Firm Worker Mobility|I use a sample of over fourteen thousand full-time jobs held by workers in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to examine mobility patterns and to evaluate theories of inter-firm worker mobility. The roles of both heterogeneity and state dependence in determining mobility rates for young workers are investigated, and both are found to be very important. There are three main findings. First, mobility is strongly positively related to the frequency of job change prior to the start of the Job. Second, job change in the most recent year prior to the start of the job is more strongly related than earlier job change to mobility on the current job. Third, the monthly hazard of job ending is not monotonically decreasing in tenure as most earlier work using annual data has found, but it increases to a maximum at three months and declines thereafter. The first two findings suggest that there is important heterogeneity in mobility but that this heterogeneity is not fixed over time (workers might mature). The third finding is consistent with models of heterogeneous match quality that cannot be observed ex ante. I also find that females hold fewer Jobs per year in the labor force than males and that this result is driven by a lower exit rate for females from the first job after entry.
