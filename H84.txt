H84|Expected Costs of Damage From Hurricane Winds and Storm-Related Flooding|Damage from hurricane winds, storm surges, and heavy rain imposes costs on private entities, such as households and businesses, and on all levels of government. By CBOâ€™s estimate, the expected economic losses (average losses over the long run) from most types of such damage total $54 billion per year: $34 billion to the residential sector, $9 billion to commercial businesses, and $12 billion to the public sector.
H84|Home bias in humanitarian aid: The role of regional favoritism in the allocation of international disaster relief|Natural disasters represent a major challenge for human welfare across the globe. Given the prominent role of international humanitarian aid in alleviating human suffering, the investigation of its determinants is of paramount importance. While existing studies show its allocation to be influenced by donors' foreign policy considerations, domestic political factors within recipient countries have not been systematically explored. This paper addresses this important research gap by investigating whether regional favoritism shapes humanitarian aid flows. Using a rich and unique dataset derived from reports of the Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), we show that substantially larger amounts of aid are disbursed when natural disasters hit the birth region of the recipient countries' political leader. While we find no evidence that US commercial or political interests affect the size of this home bias, the bias is stronger in countries with a weaker bureaucracy and governance, suggesting the absence of effective safeguards in the allocation of aid.
H84|Beyond Okun's Law: Output Growth and Labor Market Flows|This paper studies the relationship between the change in the unemployment rate and output growth using an approach based on labour market flows. The framework shows why the Okun coefficient may be constant/time-varying and/or symmetric/asymmetric and that the outcome lies with the behaviour of the labour flows in response to growth. The encompassing framework nests the conditions to determine the properties of the Okun coefficient without the need to rely on retrospective arbitrary dating of recessions. The framework also highlights the potential mispecification in conventional models of Okun's Law unless stringent conditions are assumed about the behavior of labour flows. The empirical analysis is based on the stock-consistent labour market flows data developed by the BLS for the period 1990:2-2017:3.
H84|Amenities, Risk, and Flood Insurance Reform|This paper provides the first, comprehensive evidence on the question of whether the subsidized flood insurance rates are needed to meet the affordability goal of the National Flood Insurance Program. We use IRS records at the zip code level from 2009 to 2016 to compare the real median incomes of homeowners in areas subject to flooding risks to those homeowners in neighboring zip codes. Our analysis includes all of the Gulf Coast states and over 1000 other communities around the United States containing FEMA designated Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA). There are clear patterns of positive income stratification for coastal locations in Florida, New Jersey, and New York. We also find lower income for coastal locations in California, North Carolina, as well as the shoreline along rivers identified as in SFHA in Delaware, and Virginia fit this pattern.
H84|Distortions in aid allocation of United Nations flash appeals: Evidence from the 2015 Nepal earthquake|We examine the role of local need and various distortions in the design and implementation of United Nations flash appeal triggered in response to the destructive 2015 Nepal earthquake. Specifically, we investigate the extent to which the allocation of this humanitarian assistance follows municipalities' affectedness and their physical and socio-economic vulnerabilities, as rapidly reducing suffering is the intended goal of flash appeals. We then analyze potential ethnic, religious, and political distortions. We alternatively consider the proposed project number, the proposed financial amount, and the subsequent funding decision by aid donors. Our results show that aid allocation is associated with geophysical estimates of the disaster's destructiveness, but shows little regard for the specific socio-economic and physical vulnerabilities conditional on destruction. It is worrisome that the allocation of the flash appeal commitments favors municipalities dominated by higher castes and disadvantages those with a greater distance to the Nepali capital Kathmandu.
H84|Does private aid follow the flag? An empirical analysis of humanitarian assistance|"Little is known about foreign aid provided by private donors. This paper contributes to closing this research gap by comparing the allocation of private humanitarian aid to that of official humanitarian aid awarded to 140 recipient countries over the 2000-2016 period. We construct a new database that offers information on the country in which the headquarters of private donors are located to test whether private donors follow the aid allocation pattern of their home country. Our empirical results confirm that private aid ""follows the flag."" This finding is robust against the inclusion of various fixed effects, estimating instrumental variables models, and disaggregating private aid into corporate aid and NGO aid. Donor country-specific estimations reveal that private aid from China, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States ""follow the flag""."
H84|Funding for International Affairs Activities, Within and Outside Agenciesâ€™ Base Budgets|The Congress provides the State Department, the Agency for International Development (USAID), and other agencies a â€œbase budgetâ€ each year to fund ongoing activities related to international affairs. The agencies have received other â€œnonbaseâ€ funding in recent years, in the form of supplemental appropriations, emergency appropriations, and funding for overseas contingency operations. In this report, CBO analyzes the recent use of such nonbase appropriations for international affairs activities.
H84|The effects of foreign aid on refugee flows|We investigate whether foreign aid affects refugee flows from recipient countries. Combining refugee data on 141 origin countries over the 1976–2013 period with bilateral Official Development Assistance data, we estimate the causal effects of a country’s aid receipts on both total refugee flows to the world and flows to donor countries. The interaction of donor-government fractionalization and a recipient country’s probability of receiving aid provides a powerful and excludable instrumental variable (IV) when we control for country- and time-fixed effects that capture the levels of the interacted variables. Though our IV results suggest that aid induces recipient governments to encourage the return of their citizens, we find no evidence that aid reduces worldwide refugee outflows or flows to donor countries in the short term. However, we observe long-run effects after four three-year periods, which appear to be driven by lagged positive effects of aid on growth.
H84|Voters sometimes provide the wrong incentives. The lesson of the Brazilian drought industry|Citizen assessment of government performance is a cornerstone of the successful functioning of democracy. However, accountability is a double-edged sword. When voters misunderstand the stakes and provide the wrong incentives to elected officials, political accountability leads to an implementation of suboptimal welfare policies. This paper reveals that an electorate can demand clientelism. I find evidence that after a drought, voters increase the vote share of local incumbent parties that are politically aligned with the central government to ensure the inflow of partisan government aid relief. Such behavior reinforces the central government’s incentives to bias policies in favor of politically aligned municipalities to influence elections. Consequently, the circle of distortion of aid relief allocation is perpetuated. The data cover the Brazilian democratic elections from 1998 to 2012. I use fixed effects models with panel data and a regression discontinuity design with heterogeneous treatment effects. The results resemble a long-run patronage equilibrium.
H84|Coordination of Humanitarian Aid|We examine a setup where two agents allocate a fixed budget of humanitarian aid between two equally needy areas. The agents may be biased to one area which is their private information. Without communication aid is allocated inefficiently resulting in gaps and overlaps in response. Direct communication between the agents is ineffective and cannot resolve the coordination failure. We show that coordination can be improved by a mediator, such as an information management system, which filters the information communicated by the agents. Our results can throw light on how to improve the current disaster management systems.
H84|Flood Risk Mitigation: Pressing Issues and Challenges|The increase number of natural disasters that struck the world gives damaging impacts to the people and properties. This paper attempts to examine crucial pressing issues and challenges in mitigating flood losses and loss of lives in Malaysia. Only qualitative approach is used to address these pressing issues and challenges of natural disaster. Kelantan is one the states in the east coast of Malaysia that experienced the highest loss of properties and infrastructure in 2014 massive flood. Semi-structured interview was designed and used to collect data from six government agencies in the state of Kelantan. These agencies were, Kelantan State Education Department, Kelantan State Department of Rescue and Fire Brigade, Kelantan State Health Department, Local Authority of Kuala Krai, Kelantan State Social and Welfare Department and Kelantan State Police Contingent. The finding of the study revealed that were eight pressing issues and four challenges. The eight pressing issues are flood preparations, lack of rescuers, lack of awareness, communication difficulty, lack of assets for rescue, transportation issues, the absence of food supply, and other constraints. On the other hand, the challenges are lack of provisions, redevelopment, the social and economic situation, and trauma. These pressing issues and challenges need to be seriously addressed by the State and Federal level of Government of Malaysia so that future natural disaster like the 2014 flood can be managed in a much more prepared way or manner.
H84|The effects of adaptation measures on hurricane induced property losses: Which FEMA investments have the highest returns?|This paper evaluates the relative effectiveness of FEMA expenditures on hurricane induced property losses. We find that spending on FEMA ex-ante mitigation and planning projects leads to greater reductions in property losses than spending on ex-post adaptation programs – specifically, a one percent increase in annual spending on ex-ante risk reduction and warning projects reduces damages by 0.21 percent while a one percent increase in ex-post recovery and clean-up spending reduces damages by 0.12. Although both types of program spending are effective, we find the marginal return from spending on programs that target long-term mitigation and risk management to be almost twice that of spending on ex-post recovery programs. With the predicted increases in the frequency and severity of North Atlantic hurricanes in the future, our findings suggest there are important potential gains that could be realized from the further diversification of FEMA spending across project categories.
H84|Disaster (over-)insurance: the long-term financial and socioeconomic consequences of Hurricane Katrina|Federal disaster insurance–in the form of national flood insurance, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and other programs–is designed to nationally-distribute large geography-specific shocks like earthquakes and hurricanes. This study examines the local longrun net impact of Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent policy response on impacted residents. Using a unique fifteen-year panel of five percent of adult Americans’ credit reports, we find higher rates of insolvency and lower homeownership among inundated residents of New Orleans ten years after the storm, relative to their non-flooded neighbors. Residents of mostly-white and mostly-black neighborhoods obtain similar short- and long-term outcomes, though residents of white neighborhoods are more likely to migrate out of the city. Inundated New Orleans residents appear more likely to have migrated to neighboring states, but substantially less likely than nonflooded residents to have migrated north. However, we find that residents of the large Gulf Opportunity Zone surrounding New Orleans, who were also eligible for various federal programs, obtained net financial benefits in the years after Katrina; a decade later, those residents have higher rates of consumption and homeownership and lower rates of bankruptcy and foreclosure than residents outside the GO Zone. These net gains are found to be progressive–favoring young and low-income residents–and are broadly similar across black and white neighborhoods.
H84|Vulnerability and Willingness to Pay for Coping with Flood in Klaten Regency, Central Java, Indonesia|"""Objective – The focus of this research is the analysis of vulnerability and factors that influence willingness to pay (WTP) to cope with flood. Other result of this research is economic valuation of flood impact on paddy field in particular. Methodology/Technique – This research used the descriptive and quantitative method. Its data were collected through direct interviews with 380 respondents. Its samples were scattered in 11 sub-districts and 94 villages. The representatives of each village were 4 respondents, by adding two respondents from Wedi Sub-district and 2 respondents from Cawas Sub-district. Proportional sampling technique was employed to determine the research samples with criteria: very close ( 100 m) from the river. Its data were analyzed by using contingent valuation methods (CVM). Findings – The results of the research are as follows. Many activities have been implemented to mitigate flood in Klaten Regency, but many problems have been encountered due to the limitations of Government Budget (APBD). The variables of income of family/household, water level, distance, and loss have a significant effect on the WTP. In majority, the respondents (72.27%) have the WTP for flood mitigation activities with the average WTP of 15,391 IDR. Novelty – Economic valuation of flood mitigation programs and activities is required as to further enhance the role of the community, taking into account factors affecting the WTP. The local government should take advantage of the public's WTP to support flood mitigation activities among neighbourhood, village, sub-district and regency."""
H84|Building resilience to natural disasters: An application to small developing states|We present a dynamic small open economy model to explore the macroeconomic impact of a major natural disaster. In addition to permanent damages to public and private capital, the disaster causes temporary losses of productivity, inefficiencies during the reconstruction process, and damages to the sovereign's creditworthiness. We use the model to study the debt sustainability concerns that arise from the need to fully rebuild public infrastructure over the medium term and analyze the feasibility of ex ante policies, such as building adaptation infrastructure and fiscal buffers, and contrast these policies with the post-disaster support provided by donors. Investing in resilient infrastructure may prove useful, in particular if it is viewed as complementary to standard infrastructure, because it raises the marginal product of private capital, crowding in private investment, while helping withstand the impact of the natural disaster. In an application to Vanuatu, we find that donors should provide an additional 50% of pre-cyclone GDP in grants to be spent over the following 15 years to ensure public debt remains sustainable following Cyclone Pam. Helping the government build resilience on the other hand, reduces the risk of debt distress and at lower cost for donors.
H84|Climate Change, Floods, and Municipal Risk Sharing in Canada|Canadian municipalities are vulnerable to climate change risks, particularly in the form of extreme weather. Risk management demands public policies that share both the responsibility for risk reduction and the burden of costs with other levels of government and with non-governmental actors. What tools are available to municipalities seeking to share the growing risks associated with a changing climate? To what extent and how have these tools been employed in Canadian cities? With a focus on urban flooding, this paper systematically identifies and explains ways in which governments can share climate-related risks. It then evaluates whether and how these tools have been used in two major Canadian cities â€“ Calgary, Alberta, and Toronto, Ontario â€“ which have recently faced severe flooding, and are likely to experience more in the coming years. From this analysis, conclusions are drawn about the state of local climate risk management and how it might be improved.
H84|Climate Change Adaptation and Financial Protection: Synthesis of Key Findings from Colombia and Senegal|Developing countries are disproportionately affected by the rising trend of losses from climate-related extreme events. These losses are projected to continue to increase in future, driven by climate change and the accumulation of people and assets in high-risk areas. Effective climate change policies are needed to reduce the accumulation of risk, combined with instruments and tools to help retain, share or transfer financial losses if an extreme event occurs. These tools and instruments, collectively known as financial protection, can help people cope with the impacts of climate-related disasters, reduce costs of recovery and reconstruction, and encourage risk reduction. Linking financial protection and climate adaptation in development planning and policy has the potential to increase the resilience of affected communities.This paper uses case studies of Colombia and Senegal to examine how countries are using financial protection as part of their approaches to managing climate risks. The paper identifies emerging
H84|Managing disaster-related contingent liabilities in public finance frameworks|Natural disasters have caused, and continue to cause, a significant amount of economic costs. The costs of disasters are often, and to a large extent, shouldered by governments, especially in economies where private insurance markets are not well developed. Governments are asked to provide financing for explicit commitments made prior to a disaster, and are often under pressure to make payments for which no such commitments were made earlier. Ex-post costs to governments take the form of contingent liabilities within national budgeting and government balance sheet frameworks. Disasters can thereby cause both downside risks to government revenue as well as to expenditure. There is little evidence, and hence limited policy advice, on how disaster-related contingent liabilities are managed by governments. This paper sets out to clarify the concept of contingent liabilities and the channels through which they can impact government balance sheets, including fiscal risks. It provides a framework for identifying and quantifying disaster-related contingent liabilities with a view to inform country case studies for comparative policy analysis.
H84|Market Response to Flood Risk: An Empirical Study of Housing Values Using Boundary Discontinuities|This paper presents one of the first studies on flood risk evaluation in the US Northeast - a region where we are likely going to see increasing precipitation variability and associated risk of flood in the coming decades. In the paper, a spatial difference-in-differences framework based on floodplain boundary discontinuities is proposed to control for unobserved heterogeneities. Using parcel-level data from Juniata County and Perry County in Pennsylvania, the paper finds that on average there is a 5-6 percent housing value reduction due to exposure to 1 percent annual chance of flooding within the FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) 100-year flood zone. For Juniata County, it shows that on average there is a $3.28/sqft (in 2015 USD) discount for a full-time SFR (single family residential) property located within the flood zone. For an average housing unit of 1430 sqft living space in the sample, the estimate translates to a $4690 housing value reduction. For Perry County, the corresponding estimates are $4.00/sqft (in 2015 USD) and $6320 for an average housing unit of 1580 sqft. The paper also shows that with similar specifications, a standard hedonic price model underestimates the flood risk impact on housing value by a substantial amount as a result of failing to control for unobserved heterogeneities.
H84|Climate Econometrics|Identifying the effect of climate on societies is central to understanding historical economic development, designing modern policies that react to climatic events, and managing future global climate change. Here, I review, synthesize, and interpret recent advances in methods used to measure effects of climate on social and economic outcomes. Because weather variation plays a large role in recent progress, I formalize the relationship between climate and weather from an econometric perspective and discuss the use of these two factors as identifying variation, highlighting trade-offs between key assumptions in different research designs and deriving conditions when weather variation exactly identifies the effects of climate. I then describe recent advances, such as the parameterization of climate variables from a social perspective, use of nonlinear models with spatial and temporal displacement, characterization of uncertainty, measurement of adaptation, cross-study comparison, and use of empirical estimates to project the impact of future climate change. I conclude by discussing remaining methodological challenges.
H84|Budget for protection of the population in case of disasters|Due to the more frequent occurrence of disasters in the last few decades and the increasing severity of their consequences, more financial and material resources should be provided to help victims and to restore damaged facilities. In this regard specific measures were discussed about preparing a budget for disaster protection in the private and public sectors, as well as activities in this field in various countries.
H84|CBOâ€™s Approach to Estimating Expected Hurricane Damage: Working Paper 2016-02|This working paper describes how the Congressional Budget Office estimates the effects of climate change and coastal development on hurricane damage. The estimates themselves are presented in a separate reportâ€”Potential Increases in Hurricane Damage in the United States: Implications for the Federal Budgetâ€”for three selected future years: 2025, 2050, and 2075. Climate change is projected to increase damage in two ways. First, climate change is projected to result in more frequent high-intensity hurricanes. Second, for any given storm, rising sea levels
H84|Media, Demonstrations, and Public Good Delivery: Evidence from World Bank Projects during Natural Disasters|Media can affect governments and public policy by promoting anti-government demonstrations. Under media pressure, a multitasking government might reallocate effort across tasks, rather than increase the total aggregate, resulting in ambiguous welfare effects. In this paper, I test such a hypothesis using a database of World Bank project indicators, which measures government performance in implementing capital projects. Disasters offer an ideal case study because citizens and the government can differ particularly in their preferences between public capital (reconstruction) and consumption (relief). Therefore, at times of disasters, media might be especially effective in shaping public policy by promoting anti-government demonstrations. Joining capital project indicators with data on disasters, media, and demonstrations,I present the following: (1) within-state variation in floods and media activity for Indian states; (2) within-country variation in disasters and media freedom for 135 countries; (3) a case study using anecdotal and archival evidence on flood response in Ghana, Togo, and Ivory Coast in 2007/2008. In all cases, media activity during disasters is associated with lower capital project performance, higher relief/anti-poverty efforts, and more anti-government demonstrations.
H84|Incumbents' Performance and Political Polarization|This paper studies the relationship between incumbents’ performance and political polarization, both with theory and data. The theory is based on a spatial model of political competition in which the voters use the incumbent’s performance in office to update their beliefs about his competence. A better performance leads to the incumbent’s electoral advantage and so allows him to announce a more extreme platform closer to his bliss point. Therefore, conditioned on reelection, a better incumbent’s performance leads to higher political polarization. We use the data on the incumbents’ performance in natural disaster relief and the ideological positions they take in the U.S. House of representatives in 1953-2010. The empirical evidence shows that a better performance in post-disaster recovery is associated with more extreme ideological positions of the corresponding incumbents. These and other empirical results are in line with the model predictions.
H84|Voter reaction to government incompetence and corruption related to the 1999 earthquakes in Turkey|Purpose - – Two major earthquakes which struck Northwestern Turkey in 1999 exposed rampant corruption involving construction and zoning code violations. The government’s relief efforts were tainted by corruption as well, and exhibited a great deal of incompetence. How voters responded to these in the next election held in 2002 is investigated. The fact that different group of parties were responsible for the construction of the shoddy buildings, and for the corruption and mismanagement related to relief, provided us with a unique opportunity to determine whether and how the electorate punished the culprits for each of these. The purpose of this paper is to shed light also on the new party system which emerged in Turkey after 2002. Design/methodology/approach - – Vote equations are estimated for the seven major political parties. These are fitted to cross-provincial data individually, using ordinary least squares and robust regression methods, and as a system, using seemingly unrelated regressions procedures. The same picture emerges from each of these methods. Findings - – Not just those ruling at the time of the earthquakes, but also other parties which were in power when the substandard buildings, were built were held accountable by the electorate. Furthermore, the Turkish voters appear to have allocated the blame rationally, taking into consideration the division of labor in the central government, and the relative influences the parties had on local administrations. Reaction of the voters to government incompetence and corruption was one of the factors which resulted in the emergence of a new party system. In 2002, the AKP, established only a year before, captured almost all of the far-right Islamist, about half of the far-right nationalist, and more than half of the center-right votes in 2002. Originality/value - – Corruption usually makes little difference in the fortunes of politicians. Some recent studies suggest that it takes more than just exposure of corruption to get the voters to react. Politicians pay a significant price only when the corruption touches all political parties across the board, is not accompanied by good governance, and competent non-corrupt alternatives are available. The results provide support for this assertion from the natural experiment that has taken place in Turkey.
H84|Charitable Donations by China's Private Enterprises|The number of private enterprises in China has grown rapidly, and donations from them are an important source of philanthropy in China today. This paper investigates donations given in 2011 by private enterprises using a survey of data covering all 31 provincial-level units of China. The data show that philanthropy practised by Chinese private enterprises is widespread, but the amounts of donations are unequally distributed. Furthermore, donations are positively related to a company's profit and in most cases also to the owner's political participation as expressed in membership in the People's Congress (PC) as well as the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) at different levels. Donating is also positively related to the presence of a branch of the Communist Party of China and a trade union within the firm. In contrast, there is little support for donations being related to the characteristics of the major owner in the business, such as their gender, age, previous employment experience, party membership or to the governance structure or location of the private firms.
H84|An Imperfect Storm: Fat-Tailed Hurricane Damages, Insurance and Climate Policy|We perform two tests that estimate the thickness of the tails of the distribution of aggregate US hurricane damages. Both tests reject the hypothesis that the distribution of damages is thin tailed at the 95% confidence level, even after correcting for inflation, population, and per capita income growth. Our point estimates of the shape parameter of the damage distribution indicate that the distribution has finite mean, but infinite variance. In the second part of the paper, we develop a microfoundations model of insurance and storm size that generates fat tails in aggregate hurricane damages. In the model, the distribution of the number properties within a random geographical area that lies in the path of a hurricane drives fat tails in hurricane damages, and we confirm that the distribution of coastal city population is fat tailed in the US. We show empirically and theoretically that other random variation, such as the distribution of hurricane strength and the distribution of damages across individual properties do not generate fat tails. We consider policy options such as climate change mitigation, policies which encourage adaptation, reducing subsidies for coastal development, and disaster relief policies, which distort insurance markets. Such policies can reduce the thickness of the tail, but do not affect the shape parameter or the existence of the fat tail.
H84|Uncovering the determinants of corruption|Identifying the real causes of corruption has proven difficult because of limited data availability, lack of a unifying theoretical framework, and endogeneity concerns. Combining data for a comprehensive list of 36 potential determinants of corruption across 123 countries (including 87 percent of the world population), we use Instrumental Variable Bayesian Model Averaging to account for model uncertainty and endogeneity. In addition to income levels, the extent of primary schooling emerges as a powerful predictor of lower corruption levels. Rule of law and FDI matter particularly in developing countries. Finally, we find some evidence for trade freedom, political rights, government size, and religious fractionalization to contain corruption. These findings offer feasible avenues for policymakers, as corruption does not seem to be driven by deeply rooted cultural attributes.

H84|The Fiscal Cost of Hurricanes: Disaster Aid versus Social Insurance|Little is known about the fiscal costs of natural disasters, especially regarding social safety nets that do not specifically target extreme weather events. This paper shows that US hurricanes lead to substantial increases in non-disaster government transfers, such as unemployment insurance and public medical payments, in affected counties in the decade after a hurricane. The present value of this increase significantly exceeds that of direct disaster aid. This implies, among other things, that the fiscal costs of natural disasters have been significantly underestimated and that victims in developed countries are better insured against them than previously thought.
H84|Does The Samaritan'S Dilemma Matter? Evidence From U.S. Agriculture|The Samaritan's dilemma posits a downside to charity: recipients may rely on free aid instead of their own efforts. Anecdotally, the expectation of free assistance is thought to be important for decisions about insurance and risky behavior in numerous settings, but reliable empirical evidence is scarce. We estimate whether the Samaritan's dilemma exists in U.S. agriculture, where both private crop insurance and frequent federal disaster assistance are present. We find that bailout expectations are qualitatively and quantitatively important for the insurance decision. Furthermore, aid expectations reduce both expenditure on farm inputs and subsequent crop revenue. (JEL D72, H84, Q18)
H84|Loans Provided By Chinese Government: Opportunities And Risks For The Republic Of Moldova|As external development partners have put on hold their financial support for Moldova, contracting loans from China sparks an increasing interest. Because debates on this topic take place with very little information available, in this article we have made a synthesis of official data disseminated by the Chinese authorities, estimations made by the OECD and other organizations, records from the archive of the National Bank of Moldova, documents from the state register of legal acts, as well as of data published by the press. The results show that, although loans provided by the Chinese government are not an alternative to the loans offered by the IMF and other traditional creditors for budget and balance of payments support, they have a range of peculiar advantages and can be a convenient means of financing projects in the area of energy, industry, and agriculture.
H84|Financial instruments for managing disaster risks related to climate change|This article provides an overview of the potential implications of climate change for the financial management of disaster risks. It outlines the contribution of insurance to reducing the economic disruption of disaster events and policy approaches to supporting the penetration of disaster insurance coverage and the capacity of insurance markets to absorb disaster risks, including through the use of capital markets instruments and international co-operation in risk pooling. It concludes with a number of recommendations for improving the financial management of disaster risks in the context of climate change and some areas of further work.

H84|Disaster and political trust: The Japan Tsunami and Earthquake of 2011|We show how disasters influence subjective political trust by testing the effect of the 2011 Great East Japan. For this test, we used the individual level data of 7 Asian covering the period before and after the disaster. The key findings are: the disaster lead to sharp drops in trust of the national government, trust in the Prime Minister, trust in political parties, and trust in the parliament. However, we do not find a loss of support in local governments.
H84|People?s Awareness of Natural Disaster Risks: Differences across Regions and Generations|Abstract: Natural disasters have profound impacts on the sustainability of societies. Japan is a nation surrounded by the sea, and some regions are prone to suffer from natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis due to geographical characteristics. To develop and maintain a sustainable society, appropriate preventive measures should be incorporated into the social system, taking into consideration the people?s awareness of natural disaster risks. For this purpose, the present study investigated people?s sensitivity to risks induced by natural disasters, specifically focusing on a tsunami disaster. The investigation focused on the 2011 East Japan Earthquake off the Pacific Coast, and included five different participant groups: a group of residents (approximately 40 to70 years old) who directly suffered from the tsunami damage, two student groups (university and high school) located at the damaged regions, and two university student groups that were located in unaffected regions in Japan. The investigation was conducted by a questionnaire asking the participants to evaluate the safety or dangerousness of five different tsunami heights by using a five-point rating scale. The obtained data were subjected to a psychometric analysis calculating tsunami height thresholds regarded as safe. As a result, the lowest threshold of tsunami height regarded as safe was 0.94 meters for the group of residents in the damaged region. In contrast, the group of high school students in the damaged region revealed the highest threshold for the safe tsunami height, indicating that they do not feel danger until the tsunami height rises over 2.7 meters. Therefore, the residents in the damaged regions have the highest sensitivity to the risks posed by a tsunami, while the high school students in the damaged region have the lowest cautiousness despite the fact that they experienced the same disaster. Among the groups of university students, those who lived in the unaffected areas located furthest from the damaged region showed the highest threshold value of 2.56 meters, suggesting that they have very low risk sensitivity to tsunamis. These results clearly indicate that younger people and those who have not experienced a tsunami disaster are less conscious of the risks involved.Based on these differences in people?s risk awareness for natural disasters, appropriate preventive measures and educational programs should be incorporated into the social system in order to develop and maintain a sustainable society, and these should consider generational and environmental differences of residents.
H84|Federal Reinsurance for Terrorism Risk in 2015 and Beyond: Working Paper 2015-04|CBO analyzed a variety of options for federal insurance against the risk of terrorism before the program was reauthorized in January 2015. This paper examines in more detail some options that might be considered in the future.
H84|Do Natural Disasters Stimulate Individual Saving? Evidence from a Natural Experiment in a Highly Developed Country|While various empirical studies have found negative growth-effects of natural disasters, little is yet known about the microeconomic channels through which disasters might affect short- and especially long-term growth. This paper contributes to filling this gap in the literature by studying how natural disasters affect individual saving decisions. This study makes use of a natural experiment created by the European Flood of August 2002. Using micro data from the German Socio-Economic Panel that we combine with geographic flood data, we compare the savings behavior of affected and non-affected individuals by using a difference-in-differences approach. Our empirical results indicate that natural disasters depress individual saving decisions, which might be the consequence of a Samaritan`s Dilemma.
H84|Long-term Growth Effects of Natural Disasters - Empirical Evidence for Droughts|The ongoing process of climate change goes along with a higher frequency and/or severity of droughts. While the short-term growth consequences of droughts are comparatively well examined, little research has yet been devoted to the question whether and how droughts affect medium and long-term growth. However, knowledge on the growth dynamics triggered by natural disasters is an influential input factor for integrated assessment models which are used to evaluate climate policy measures. In this paper we deliver empirical support for the hypothesis of the existence of long-run growth effects of droughts. Based on a panel of 153 countries over the period of 1960 to 2002 and employing a truly exogenous drought indicator derived from rainfall data we find significantly negative long-term growth effects of droughts in both highly and less developed countries. We also deliver first empirical evidence on the channels through which droughts affect economic growth.
H84|Natural Disasters and Clientelism: the Case of Floods and Landslides in Colombia|Abstract What are the e ects of natural disasters on electoral results? Some authors claim that catastrophes have a negative e ect on the survival of leaders in a democracy because voters have a propensity to punish politicians for not preventing or poorly handling a crisis. In contrast, this paper nds that these events might be bene cial for leaders. Disasters are linked to leader survival through clientelism: they generate an in- ow of resources in the form of aid, which increase money for buying votes. Analyzing the rainy season of 2010-2011 in Colombia, considered its worst disaster in history, I use a di erence-in-di erences strategy to show that in the local election incumbent parties bene ted from the disaster. The result is robust to di erent speci cations and alternative explanations. Moreover, places receiving more aid and those with judicial evidence of vote-buying irregularities, are more likely to reelect the incumbent, supporting the mechanism proposed by this paper.
H84|Budgetary Dilemmas Related to Climate Change|ABSTRACT The global warming –either it is true or false hypothesis– has been built into the policy making both in national and international level. Public finances are recommended to be involved into the funding of mitigation and adaptation. The purpose of the paper is to gather the challenges and dilemmas implied by the climate change on fiscal spending and revenues, responsibilities and opportunities, balance and debt.******El calentamiento global, bien se trate de una hipótesis verdadera o falsa, ha sido incorporado en la elaboración de políticas tanto en el ámbito nacional como internacional. Se recomienda que las finanzas públicas participen en la financiación de la mitigación y la adaptación. La investigación explica los retos y dilemas que implica el cambio climático sobre el gasto fiscal y los ingresos, las responsabilidades y las oportunidades, el equilibrio y la deuda.
H84|Do Natural Disasters Stimulate Individual Saving? Evidence from a Natural Experiment in a Highly Developed Country|While various empirical studies have found negative growth-effects of natural disasters, little is yet known about the microeconomic channels through which disasters might affect short- and especially long-term growth. This paper contributes to filling this gap in the literature by studying how natural disasters affect individual saving decisions. This study makes use of a natural experiment created by the European Flood of August 2002. Using micro data from the German Socio-Economic Panel that we combine with geographic flood data, we compare the savings behavior of affected and non-affected individuals by using a difference-in-differences approach. Our empirical results indicate that natural disasters depress individual saving decisions, which might be the consequence of a Samaritan's Dilemma.
H84|Disasters, donations, and tax law changes: Disentangling effects on subjective well-being by exploiting a natural experiment|This study investigates (i) whether an increase in donations in the aftermath of disasters can mitigate the negative effects on subjective well-being (SWB), and if so, (ii) whether policy measures, such as tax law changes, can amplify this mitigating effect by providing further incentives for donations. To analyze these questions, we use data on the recent, impactful triple disaster on March 11, 2011 in Japan (3–11). Coincidentally, only three months after the disaster, a long-planned change in tax law was put into effect that allows higher tax deductions for charitable donations. Applying a moderated mediation analysis to a unique dataset, we are able to disentangle the total rise of donations into positive effects that are caused by the disaster itself and positive effects that are caused by the recent change in the Japanese tax law. The results of our study are as follows: First, we show that about 30% of the direct negative effect of 3–11 on SWB is mediated and mitigated by donations. Second, we show that the change in taxation law could have further mitigated the negative SWB effects of 3–11, if more people had been aware of it. However, since a large majority of the Japanese public had not even been aware of the tax law change, potential mitigating effects by increased donations have not been realized. As for policy implications, our results show that governments can create incentives for donations that not only support disaster reconstruction, but also mitigate the negative SWB effects of disasters.
H84|What Methods May Be Used in Impact Evaluations of Humanitarian Assistance?|Despite the widespread occurrence of humanitarian emergencies such as epidemics, earthquakes, droughts, floods and violent conflict and despite the significant financial resources devoted to humanitarian assistance, systematic learning from such interventions using rigorous theory-based impact evaluations is very rare. The objective of this paper is to examine the extent to which scientific impact evaluation methods can provide evidence to improve the effectiveness and efficiency in humanitarian action. This paper explores the methodological options and challenges associated with generating high quality evidence needed to answer key questions about the performance of humanitarian assistance, including whether assistance is reaching the right people, at the right time, is bringing about the desired changes in their lives (effectiveness) and is being delivered in the right doses, ways and with manageable costs (efficiency). With the help of six case studies and drawing on real-life examples from the small but growing academic literature, we demonstrate how impact evaluation methods can be used successfully and in an ethical manner to improve humanitarian assistance. A key lesson from our review is that it pays to be prepared. Much information is being collected these days about the risks of various emergencies unfolding, be they sudden onset or slow onset emergencies. Hence national actors and international donors can prepare for these events and for conducting meaningful impact evaluations. Given the overwhelming needs and the lack of funds, doing more with limited resources is a key challenge for humanitarian assistance and impact evaluation is one way of achieving this.
H84|Natural disasters and university enrolment: evidence from L’Aquila earthquake| Although there are several studies looking at the effect of natural disasters on economic growth, less attention has been dedicated to their impact on educational outcomes, especially in more developed countries. We use the synthetic control method to examine how the L’Aquila earthquake affected subsequent enrolment at the local university. This issue has wide economic implications as the University of L’Aquila made a large contribution to the local economy before the earthquake. Our results indicate that the earthquake had no statistically significant effect on first-year enrolment at the University of L’Aquila in the three academic years after the disaster. This natural disaster, however, caused a compositional change in the first-year student population, with a substantial increase in the number of students aged 21 or above. This is likely to have been driven by post-disaster measures adopted in order to mitigate the expected negative effects on enrolment triggered by the earthquake.
H84|Improving Logistics Processes in Humanitarian Assistance in Emergency Situations on the Territory of Bulgaria|Logistics and supply chain management in providing humanitarian assistance in times of emergency (disasters, breakdowns, catastrophes and military conflicts) comprise a topical theoretical and practical issue related to handling humanitarian crises. The paper presents an evaluation of logistics practices implemented during humanitarian crises on the territory of Bulgaria. Research has been carried out on the opportunities for response to crises in the area of planning, evaluation of the scale and aftermath of crises, the request for providing support, the pooling up of resources, supply, transportation, tracking and tracing systems, inventory management, distribution and aid provision. The results from the study help identify the potential weaknesses and problems related to conducting logistics activities needed to handle potential humanitarian crises on the territory of Bulgaria, as well as defining the respective measures to be taken with regard to improving the efficiency of these actions
H84|Pouring oil over the Balearic tourism industry|This study aims to predict the possible negative effects on the Balearic tourism economy of the exploitation of marine oil fields near its coastline. We describe the current business structure of the islands’ tourism industry and then focus on the various kinds of spills that might affect it. Our conclusion is that the exploitation of the oil fields will significantly damage the tourism industry: a series of small-scale accidents followed by a large spill could destroy the complex structure of Balearic tourism, and would have severe repercussions for the economy of the archipelago.
H84|Availability and Expenditure of Drought Relief Funds in Rajasthan: an exploratory study from 1990-91 to 2014-15|The problem of funding relief expenditure has been recognized by every finance commission since the second because of which each of the successive finance commission has made recommendations with regard to provision for relief expenditure out of the revenues of the states and the extent of support to be extended by the Central Government to the State Government (GoI, 2004). The centre and the states contribute to the Calamity Relief Fund (CRF) to the extent of 75 percent and 25 percent respectively. However, the Twelfth Finance Commission mentions that the states have suggested reducing the contribution of the states to the CRF which shows that the states are trying to reduce their responsibility by reducing their contribution. Rajasthan has demanded successively increased funding from centre (GoR, 2014) as it is situated at most peculiar geographical conditions in term of drought vulnerability. The present study shows that Rajasthan Government largely depended on the Centre for relief related expenditure which has increased over the years while the sacrosanct aim of ‘drought proofing’ is still elusive. In the period of study from 1990-91 to 2014-15, Rajasthan experienced drought two times in 2002-03 and 2009-10 while the scarcity conditions prevailed in the state in one or another area all the time for which state demanded help from centre on regular basis. Mostly the relief works get financed through the help received from the centre and state allocation. However, the present study shows that the amount received for relief remains largely unused and is getting accumulated in the state budget instead of being used to manage the prevailing scarcity and achieving the coveted goals of drought proofing.
H84|Organization of Disaster Aid Delivery: Spending Your Donations|This article examines how different organizational structures in disaster aid delivery affect house aid quality. We analyze three waves of survey data on fishermen and fishing villages in Aceh, Indonesia, following the 2004 tsunami. We categorize four organizational structures based on whether and to whom donors contract aid implementation. Compared to bilateral contracting between donors and implementers, donors that vertically integrate and do their own implementation offer the highest-quality housing as rated by village heads and have fewer counts of faults, such as leaky roofs and cracked walls, as reported by fishermen. However, they shade in quality as they lose dominance as the leading aid agency in a village. Domestic implementers and the government agency that was responsible for significant portions of aid delivery provide significantly lower-quality aid. We also examine how the imposition of shared ownership, the primary social agenda for boat aid agencies, affects boat aid quality. We find that village and fishing leaders steer poor-quality boats toward those whom shared ownership was imposed upon, often lower-status fishermen.
H84|Substituting Existing Federal/State/Local control and managed Homeland Security Services with Regional Governance: A Public Choice Approach|This paper suggests how to improve both the governing, and managing of natural and terrorist caused disasters, including ordinary homeland security services, by a regional competitive structure. It presents disaster experiences of failed such services, analyzes the reasons for such failures and suggests how a competitive system that relies on private and volunteer leaders, personnel and capital can improve response and recovery efforts over the existing monopolistic government system. Public Choice model is utilized to explain the reasons for failed experiences and how regional governance is socially more efficient than existing Federal and state control and locally managed disaster system. The paper suggests that the federal role changes from both funding and supplying aid to disasters to merely funding for damaged public goods. Regionally available businesses and government resources can be utilized under a competitive system instead of federal and state inventories and emergency personnel. A regionally controlled and managed entity which which develops its own financial resources is a major key for success.
H84|Social Capital and Disaster Recovery: Evidence from Sichuan Earthquake in 2008| Social capital helps reduce adverse shocks by facilitating access to transfers. This study examines how various measures of social capital are associated with disaster recovery from 2008 Sichuan earthquake. We find that households having a larger Spring Festival network in 2008 do better in housing reconstruction. A larger network significantly increases the amount of government aid received for housing reconstruction. With regards to how Spring Festival network channels more government aid to the household, the results show that a larger network increases the number of people showing up to offer monetary and material support, which is linked to more government aid received. This suggests that Spring Festival network members assist the quake-affected households to apply for and obtain government aid. As for other measures of social capital, connections with government officials and communist party membership do not significantly contribute to disaster recovery. Human capital, measured by the years of schooling of household head, is also not positively correlated with housing reconstruction.
H84|Natural disasters, growth and institutions: A tale of two earthquakes|We examine the impact of natural disasters on GDP per capita by applying the synthetic control approach and using a within-country perspective. Our analysis encompasses two large-scale earthquakes that occurred in two different Italian regions in 1976 and 1980. We show that the short-term effects are negligible in both regions, though they become negative if we simulate the GDP that would have been observed in absence of financial aid. In the long-term, our findings indicate a positive effect in one case and a negative effect in the other, largely reflecting divergent patterns of the TFP. Consistent with these findings, we offer further evidence suggesting that a quake and related financial aid might either increase technical efficiency via a disruptive creation mechanism or reduce it by stimulating corruption, distorting the markets and deteriorating social capital. Finally, we show that the bad outcome is more likely to occur in regions with lower pre-quake institutional quality. As a result, our evidence suggests that unanticipated local shocks are likely to change long run growth rates, exacerbating territorial disparities.
H84|Climate Change Vulnerability in Agriculture Sector: Indexing and Mapping of Four Southern Indian States|Agriculture is the sector most vulnerable to climate change due to its high dependence on climate and weather conditions. Climate change is a main challenge for agriculture, food security and rural livelihoods for millions of people in India. Among India’s population of more than one billion people, about 68% are directly or indirectly involved in the agricultural sector. This sector is particularly vulnerable to present-day climate variability. In this paper an attempt is made to map and analyze the vulnerability to climate change in different districts of four south Indian states: Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. We have taken five sources of vulnerability indicators: socio-demographic, climatic, agricultural, occupational and common property resources vulnerabilities to compute the composite vulnerability index. The composite vulnerability index suggests that, Adilabad, Chamarajanagar, Thiruvarur and Kasaragod are the most vulnerable districts of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala respectively, whereas Hyderabad, Belgaum, Thoothukkudi, Kottayam are the least vulnerable districts.
H84|L'action publique relative aux risques majeurs: diagnostics et recommandations|Les risques majeurs sont associés à des événements dont les conséquences défavorables, pour l’humanité ou pour l’environnement, sont d'une gravité exceptionnelle, sans qu’ils soient eux-mêmes nécessairement, comme on le dit souvent, d'une intensité physique extrême ou d’une fréquence très faible. Il en existe de multiples sortes: les risques naturels, comme ceux d’inondation et de submersion marine; les risques technologiques; les risques nucléaires, que l'on traite séparément parce qu’ils mettent en jeu le phénomène de radioactivité; les risques sanitaires; les risques alimentaires, parfois liés aux précédents; enfin, des catégories plus récentes telles que le risque climatique et le terrorisme, auxquels il faudrait ajouter les risques militaires pour être complet. Dans un rapport récent, le Conseil d’analyse économique [Grislain-Letrémy, Lahidji et Mongin, 2013] s’est penché sur le concept général de risque majeur et a étudié de façon plus spécifique le cas des risques naturels, technologiques et nucléaires présents sur le territoire français. Le rapport a abordé les trois risques transversalement, à travers les prismes de la géographie et de la technologie, de l'histoire institutionnelle et juridique, enfin d'un bilan normatif et de recommandations relatifs à l’action publique. Cet article présentera successivement les diagnostics du rapport et ses recommandations.
H84|Natural catastrophe insurance: How should the government intervene?|This paper develops a theoretical framework for analyzing the decision to provide or buy insurance against the risk of natural catastrophes. In contrast to conventional models of insurance, the insurer has a non-zero probability of insolvency which depends on the distribution of the risks, the premium rate, and the amount of capital in the company. When the insurer is insolvent, each loss reduces the indemnity available to the victims, thus generating negative pecuniary externalities. Our model shows that government-provided insurance will be more attractive in terms of expected utility, as it allows these negative pecuniary externalities to be spread equally among policyholders. However, when heterogeneous risks are introduced, a government program may be less attractive in safer areas, which could yield inefficiency if insurance ratings are not chosen appropriately.
H84|Disaster Management in ASEAN|While the Asian countries have been successful in achieving economic growth and poverty reduction, the region cannot avoid exposure to a variety of disasters. Indeed, Asia, particularly the area of the ASEAN Member States (AMSs), is the most prone region to disasters in the world. The paper examines the experience of ASEAN and other countries and regions in the world on disaster management, and looks at the research literature, in order to provide insights, lessons and recommendations for the way forward for strengthened disaster management in AMSs and ASEAN beyond 2015. Particularly, we will summarize different approaches towards effective disaster risk coping strategy and regional cooperation on disaster management. By doing so, we aim at providing a clue to answer the question of how we should protect ourselves and the people of the region and the entire world from catastrophes.
H84|Household Finance after a Natural Disaster: The Case of Hurricane Katrina|Little is known about how affected residents are able to cope with the financial shock of a natural disaster. This paper investigates the impact of flooding on household finance. Spikes in credit card borrowing and overall delinquency rates for the most flooded residents are modest in size and short-lived. Greater flooding results in larger reductions in total debt. Lower debt levels are driven by homeowners using flood insurance to repay their mortgages rather than to rebuild. Mortgage reductions are larger in areas where reconstruction costs exceeded pre-Katrina home values and where mortgages were likely to be originated by nonlocal lenders.
H84|Can rigorous impact evaluations improve humanitarian assistance?| Each year billions of US-dollars of humanitarian assistance are mobilised in response to man-made emergencies and natural disasters. Yet, rigorous evidence for how best to intervene remains scant. This dearth reflects that rigorous impact evaluations of humanitarian assistance pose major methodological, practical and ethical challenges. While theory-based impact evaluations can crucially inform humanitarian programming, popular methods, such as orthodox RCTs, are less suitable. Instead, factorial designs and quasi-experimental designs can be ethical and robust, answering questions about how to improve the delivery of assistance. We argue that it helps to be prepared, planning impact evaluations before the onset of emergencies.
H84|Exploitation, Mutual Advantage and The Myth of the Samaritan's Dilemma|The objective of this paper is to illustrate a potential problem in Samaritan's dilemmas: that Samaritans have a vested interest in encouraging parasitism. In effect, they gain from their altruism. To demonstrate this result, we show that the Nash equilibrium in a Samaritan's dilemma is a Pareto superior outcome.
H84|Is Disaster Risk Reduction Spending Driven by the Occurrence of Natural Disasters? Evidence from Peru|This paper studies the allocation of total disaster risk reduction public spending among regions in Peru. The main objective of this work is to identify the main determinants of the distribution of these resources, and for this purpose an index of historical physical impacts of natural disasters, social vulnerability, and institutional capacity was created. It is found that historical impacts of climatological disasters are positively correlated with the per capita amount received by region in order to prevent future natural disasters. Impacts of geological disaster, on the other hand, affect the amount of executed and budgeted resources used to cope with the effects of past disasters. The prevention expenditure is mainly driven by climatological effects on the agriculture sector. Additionally, results confirm that higher social vulnerability is a main determinant of the distribution of prevention spending but conditioned on being affected by climatological disasters. Institutional capacity seems to define only the amount of recovery expenditure, positively for regions more seriously affected by geological disasters and negatively for regions devastated by climatological disasters.
H84|The Chicago Fire of 1871: a bottom-up approach to disaster relief|Can bottom-up relief efforts lead to recovery after disasters? Conventional wisdom and contemporary public policy suggest that major crises require centralized authority to provide disaster relief goods. Using a novel set of comprehensive donation and expenditure data collected from archival records, this paper examines a bottom-up relief effort following one of the most devastating natural disasters of the nineteenth century: the Chicago Fire of 1871. Findings show that while there was no central government relief agency present, individuals, businesses, corporate entities and municipal governments were able to finance the relief effort though donations. The Chicago Relief and Aid Society, a voluntary association of agents with a stake in relief outcomes, leveraged organizational assets and constitutional rules to administer aid.

H84|The Role of Insurance in Reducing Direct Risk - The Case of Flood Insurance|The provision of flood insurance is a patchwork, with countries showing varying degrees of penetration, coverage types, demand levels, and design structures. This article explores the current understanding of flood insurance with a specific focus on the ability of flood insurance to contribute to direct risk reduction. The starting point is a consideration of the existing provision of flood insurance, both in established insurance markets and in developing countries. A review of efforts to analyse and explain the use and design of flood insurance highlights how the understanding of supply and demand determinants is steadily growing, while clear gaps also emerge. Particularly the question of utilizing flood insurance in the context of climate change and as a lever for physical risk reduction would benefit from further empirical and theoretical analysis. The article concludes with a reflection on current efforts to reform and design flood insurance and offers some pointers for future research.
H84|Finance des risques catastrophiques. Le marché américain est en plein bouleversement|The series of unprecedented catastrophes that occurred in the us since 2001 have triggered historical economic and insured losses. Today there is a strong national debate about the role and responsibilities of the public and private sectors in providing financial protection against future disasters. U.S. catastrophe insurance markets are highly regulated and, as a result of local political interests, insurers cannot charge the premiums they consider necessary to continue doing business in several of the most exposed states of the Union. In the past decade, state and federal insurance has grown very significantly there, providing artificially low rates to those living in high risk areas. Federal disaster relief to uninsured and affected areas has reached record high level too. While public insurance can be legitimized when private insurers refuse to cover some risks or to access cheaper capital than through international markets, the path America has taken is unsustainable. The us Congress is currently examined several alternative proposals. Classification JEL : G22, G28, H50, H84
H84|Social Capital and Disaster Recovery: Evidence from Sichuan Earthquake in 2008-Working Paper 344|Social capital can help reduce adverse shocks by facilitating access to transfers and remittances.This study examines how various measures of social capital are associated with disaster recovery after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. We find that households having a larger Spring Festival network in 2008 do better in housing reconstruction. A larger network significantly increases the amount of government aid received for housing reconstruction. Furthermore, households having larger networks receive monetary and material support from more people, which also explains the positive impacts on recovery from the earthquake. As for other measures of social capital, connections with government officials and communist party membership do not significantly contribute to disaster recovery. Human capital, measured by the years of schooling of household head, is not positively correlated with housing reconstruction.
H84|Natural Disters : Exposure and Underinsurance|Insurance coverage for natural disasters remains low in many exposed areas. A limited supply of insurance is commonly identified as a primary causal factor in this low insurance coverage. The French overseas departments provide a rare natural experiment of a well-developed supply of natural disasters insurance in highly exposed regions. The French system of natural disasters insurance is underwritten and regulated by the French government; instituted initially for metropolitan France only, it was extended to overseas departments in the state of emergency following Hurricane Hugo in 1989. This natural experiment makes it possible to analyze the determinants of insurance coverage on the demand side. Based on unique household-level microdata, I estimate an insurance market model which had not yet been empirically tested. Using this structural approach, I show that underinsurance in the French overseas departments is neither due to perception biases nor to unaffordable insurance, but mainly to uninsurable housing and to the anticipation of assistance, which crowds out insurance. Individual insurance decisions are influenced by neighbors’ insurance choices through peer effects and neighborhood eligibility for assistance
H84|Are Natural Disasters Good for Economic Growth?|Natural disasters plague the populations of many countries, and the international community often seeks to alleviate the human suffering by means of humanitarian aid. Do natural disasters also have negative effects on aggregate economic growth? This paper shows that natural disasters on average have a positive association with subsequent economic performance. This overall positive association is driven by the experience of democratic developing countries that receive humanitarian aid.
H84|Climate Change and Extreme Weather Events in Latin America: An Exposure Index|Climate change is changing the frequency and intensity of Extreme Weather Events (EWEs), particularly in poor developing countries, and the international community is increasingly suggesting the design of adaptation funds to resolve this situation. Measures of vulnerability and exposure to EWEs are a critical instrument in guaranteeing a transparent, efficient and equitable allocation process in these funds. Latin American countries, which contribute little to climate change but are hard-hit by EWEs, urgently need new indicators to back up their claims for financial and technical assistance. Using DesInventar data, the paper develops an innovative Disaster Exposure Index (DEI) that encompasses many disasters' impacts. DEI calculations indicate an unexpected scenario where some regions usually considered resilient are found to be exposed. The results call for further development of regional indicators to facilitate the international, national and sub- national allocation of adaptation funds.
H84|State-led humanitarian aid: Another case of “government failure”|A review essay on Christopher Coyne’s Doing Bad by Doing Good: Why Humanitarian Action Fails (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2013). The book considers whether state-led humanitarian actions can be expected to succeed in reducing human suffering. Finding that as a rule they cannot be expected to do so, Coyne devotes the greater part of the book to an analysis of such programs in the light of the economic way of thinking, which in his approach blends public choice, basic applied price theory, Austrian economics, and the new institutional economics. He concludes that the best way to reduce human suffering in the long run is by promoting sustained economic development and that the best way to achieve such development is by adopting institutions that protect economic freedom.

H84|Operationalizing Experience: Donor Approaches to Service Delivery in Fragile States|This study explores the different approaches to service delivery in fragile states by surveying donors' own evaluations of their existing fragile states policies. Because there is limited understanding of what works in risky environments, monitoring and evaluation are critical components of effective assistance. By highlighting trends in the strategies that donors have developed to implement acknowledged good practices, we can better understand how these experiences might contribute to future project and evaluation design.
H84|The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement: Looking Ahead to the Next Steps|The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) represents the chance to set a trade agenda for the future across a wide range of topics for countries throughout the Asia-Pacific region. This means that the agreement should not be settled in haste. It also means that key decisions need to be reached about broader issues related to the institutional structure of the TPP. These decisions must be made now, before the deal is closed, on issues such as how to create the TPP as a living agreement, the formation of a TPP Secretariat, and the clarification of entry conditions for future members.
H84|Disaster Risk Management at the National Level|National governments are supposed to play a pivotal role in disaster risk management (DRM). This paper reviews trends and patterns in developing governance and institutions in DRM in the Asia and the Pacific region. The paper then derives recommendations on how to establish disaster risk governance for developing countries, including mainstreaming DRM into development plans and policies. A four-pronged approach is presented: First, strengthen the DRM coordination role of the national government. Second, develop an enhanced legal framework. Third, establish a DRM focal point agency. Fourth, build a flexible cooperation system among concerned organizations and all levels of government.

H84|Aiding Conflict: The Impact of U.S. Food Aid on Civil War|This paper examines the effect of U.S. food aid on conflict in recipient countries. To establish a causal relationship, we exploit time variation in food aid caused by fluctuations in U.S. wheat production together with cross-sectional variation in a country's tendency to receive any food aid from the United States. Our estimates show that an increase in U.S. food aid increases the incidence, onset and duration of civil conflicts in recipient countries. Our results suggest that the effects are larger for smaller scale civil conflicts. No effect is found on interstate warfare.
H84|Turkish voter response to government incompetence and corruption related to the 1999 earthquakes|The two major earthquakes which struck northwestern Turkey in 1999, caused enormous amounts of death and destruction, and exposed rampant government corruption involving construction and zoning code violations, as a factor magnifying the disaster. The opposition parties and one of the incumbent parties which participated in previous national governments and held power in current and past municipal administrations were responsible for that. The other two incumbent parties came to power only a short time before the earthquakes and controlled almost none of the local administrations in the disaster zone. They on the other hand, were responsible for the incompetence shown in providing relief, for involvement in corruption related to those efforts, and for failing to prosecute the businessmen who constructed the shoddy buildings and the corrupt officials who permitted them. How voters responded to these in the 2002 parliamentary elections is investigated, using cross-provincial data, controlling for other social, political and economic factors. The fact that different groups of parties were responsible for different types of corruption and mismanagement provided us with a unique data to differentiate between voter responses to corruption and incompetence, and to corruption which has occurred before and after the earthquakes. Our results show that voters punished all of the political parties which participated in governments during the previous decade. The party in charge of the ministry responsible for disaster relief, and parties that controlled more of the city administrations in the quake zone were blamed more. The newly formed Justice and Development Party (AKP) was the main beneficiary of the votes lost by these parties. Our results corroborate the view in the corruption literature that voters react drastically only when the corruption is massive, the information on it highly-credible and well-publicized, involves large number of political parties, not accompanied by competent governance, and a non-corrupt alternative is available.

H84|A Comparative Study of Risk Management in Agriculture under Climate Change|Climate change affects the mean and variability of weather conditions and the frequency of extreme events, which to a great extent determines the variability of production and yields. This paper reviews the scientific literature on the impacts of climate change on yield variance and investigates their implications for the demand of crop insurance and effectiveness of different farm strategies and policy measures using crop farm data in Australia, Canada and Spain. A microeconomic farm level model is calibrated to different types of farms and used to simulate the responses and impacts of four policy measures: ex post disaster payments and three types of crop insurance (individual yields, area-based yield and weather index). The strong uncertainties about climate change are captured in a set of seven scenarios covering different assumptions about the scope of climate change (no change, marginal change, and high occurrence of extreme events), and farmers’ adaptation response (no adaptation, diversification, and structural adaptation). Policy decision making under these uncertainties is analysed using a standard Bayesian probabilistic approach, but also using other criteria that look for robust second best choices (MaxiMin and Satisficing criteria).
H84|Turkish Voter Response to Government Incompetence and Corruption Related to the 1999 Earthquakes|The two major earthquakes which struck northwestern Turkey in 1999, caused enormous amounts of death and destruction, and exposed rampant government corruption involving construction and zoning code violations, as a factor magnifying the disaster.

H84|Strategic adaptation to climate change in Europe|This paper analyses the priorities and challenges for Europe as it adapts to the impacts of climate change. Whatever the ultimate level of warming we will experience, adaptation will be a permanent feature of decision making from now on. As such it is important to go about it in a strategic, rational way. A strategic approach to adaptation involves setting priorities, both spatially (where to adapt) and inter-temporally (when to adapt). The paper reviews the available evidence on Europe's exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to indicate geographic adaptation priorities. In terms of intertemporal priorities, it recommends fast-tracking two types of action: Win-win measures that yield an immediate return, such as water efficiency, and strategic decisions on infrastructure and planning that have long-term consequences for Europe's vulnerability profile. A strategic approach to adaptation involves careful project design to ensure adaptation measures are cost-effective (how to adapt). An important complication in this respect is the deep level of uncertainty that still exists about future climate change at the local level. This puts a premium on flexible designs that can be adjusted when new information becomes available. The final element of a strategic approach to adaptation is division of labour between the state on the one hand, and private actors (households and firms) on the other (who should adapt). The paper argues that the traditional functions of the state - the provision of public goods, creation of an enabling environment and protection of the vulnerable - also apply to adaptation.
H84|The Role of Transfer Payments in Mitigating Shocks: Evidence From the Impact of Hurricanes|Little is known about how aggregate economic shocks are mitigated by social safety nets. I use hurricanes as an exogenous shock to the economics of US counties and show that non-disaster government transfers, such as unemployment insurance and public medical spending, increase substantially in the decade after landfall. Indeed, I estimate that the net present value of the increase in non-disaster transfers is more than double that of direct disaster aid. Among the implications of these findings are that the fiscal costs of natural disasters are much larger than previously thought and that existing social safety net programs help to mitigate the effects of macroeconomic shocks.
