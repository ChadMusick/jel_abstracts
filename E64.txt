E64|La dinámica de los precios de la gasolina en Colombia, su regulación y estructura tarifaria|El consumo de combustibles refinados en la sociedad actual se comporta como determinante del desarrollo productivo diario de cada individuo, principalmente por su uso en los medios de transporte. Este bien está sujeto a diferentes factores regulatorios en su precio que aseguran que tanto el Estado, la sociedad y los productores se vean beneficiados por su producción y venta. El presente documento estudia la dinámica de los precios de la gasolina en Colombia y cómo se ve es afectada por factores externos como el precio internacional del petróleo. El análisis se lleva a cabo a través de la metodología de determinación de precios comparada con el panorama latinoamericano, por su cercanía y similitudes en costos. Se encuentra que la estructura actual es demasiado compleja e ineficiente si se quiere mejorar la competitividad y los precios en el mercado y que una política clara por parte del Gobierno podría no solo incentivar el sector sino también dinamizar la productividad del país, tomando en cuenta la transición hacia los combustibles renovables. The consumption of refined fuels in our current society works as a determinant in the daily productive development of every person mainly because of the use of transport issues. In this way, this good is subject to different regulatory factors in its price that ensure that the State, society and producers benefits by its production and sale. Thus, this document will study how the dynamics of prices in Colombia works by analyzing the operation of it in comparison with the Latin American panorama, due to its proximity and similarities in costs; and how this dynamic is affected by external factors such as movements in international oil prices. It is found that the current structure is too complex and inefficient if we want to improve competitiveness and prices in the market and that a clear policy by the Government could not only stimulate the sector but also boost the country's productivity taking into consideration the transition to renewable fuels.
E64|Lowering Welfare Benefits: Intended and Unintended Consequences for Migrants and their Families|Denmark's Start Aid welfare reform reduced benefits to refugee immigrants by around 50 percent for those granted residency after the reform date. The reform led to a sharp short run increase in labor earnings and employment, but it also induced a strong female labor force withdrawal, and a large and persistent drop in disposable income for most households. Furthermore, the reform caused a sharp increase in property crime among both females and males. Moreover, children's likelihood of being enrolled in childcare or preschool, their performance in language tests, and their years of education all decreased, while teenagers' crime rates increased.
E64|Monetary policy and the top one percent: Evidence from a century of modern economic history|This paper examines the distributional implications of monetary pol-icy from a long-run perspective with data spanning a century of modern economic history in 12 advanced economies between 1920 and 2015. We employ two complementary empirical methodologies for estimating the dynamic responses of the top 1% income share to a monetary policy shock: vector auto-regressions and local projections. We notably exploit the implications of the macroeconomic policy trilemma to identify exogenous variations in monetary conditions. The obtained results indicate that ex-pansionary monetary policy strongly increases the share of national income held by the top one percent. Our findings also suggest that this e?ect is arguably driven by higher asset prices, and holds irrespective of the state of the economy.
E64|Employment, hours and the welfare effects of intra-firm bargaining|Bilateral bargaining between a multiple-worker firm and individual employees leads to overhiring. With a concave production function, the firm can reduce the marginal product by hiring an additional worker, thereby reducing the bargaining wage paid to all existing employees. We show that this externality is amplified when firms can adjust hours per worker as well as employment. Firms keep down workers’ wage demands by reducing the number of hours per worker and the resulting labor disutility. Our finding is particularly relevant for European economies where hours adjustment plays an important role.
E64|The inequality of extreme incomes|The paper derives the conditions under which income inequality measured with the Gini index is expected to increase or decrease if missing observations are added at the top or/and at the bottom of an income distribution. It shows that adding observations on the extremes of the income distribution does not necessarily result in an increase in inequality, but that meeting the conditions for obtaining a decrease in inequality is unlikely. It also shows that adding observations at the top weighs more on inequality than adding observations at the bottom. These findings are confirmed by an application to US states data. Adding observations on the extremes of an income distribution should be normally expected to increase inequality and recovering missing observations at the top should be prioritized.
E64|The Impact of Fiscal Policy on Income Distribution in Tanzania: A Computable General Equilibrium Analysis|The Tanzanian government has established a goal to transform the country into a middle-income and semi-industrialized state by 2025. To promote this transformation, the government exempted the Value Added Tax on capital commodities in FY 2017-2018 as a way to promote utilization of these commodities by manufacturing industries and generate growth, employment, and increased incomes. This study analyzes the impact of a reduction in Value Added Tax on capital commodities (electricity, vehicles, machinery, and equipment) under two different closure rules: (1) fixed governmental expenditures and flexible governmental savings (2) flexible governmental expenditures and fixed governmental savings. Under the first regime, government savings declined and industries that depended heavily on government investments suffered. In the second, output increased for all industrial sectors, leading to a decrease in average unemployment. Real consumption increased for all but the richest household categories.
E64|Price Control in Islamic Economics|In economics, we often hear the word price and its scope. In this case, the relation is how the value that becomes the transaction between the seller and the buyer is the replacement of the goods or services exchanged. The economy is one of the teachers in the country's life. The strength and weakness of a country's economic system are determined by pricing so that price stability occurs. But it is not easy to create an economy at a stable price because sometimes the demand level is higher than the supply and vice versa.
E64|What is the Impact of Increased Business Competition?|This paper studies the impact of a structural reform that reduces entry costs for firms. We provide novel empirical evidence on the response of firms’ entry, employment, and exit behavior. To do so, we use as a natural experiment a reform in Portugal that significantly reduced entry time and costs. We find that the reform had an expansionary impact: firm entry and employment increased by 25% and 4% per year, respectively. Moreover, around 60% of the increase in employment came from incumbent firms expanding their size, with most of the rise occurring among the firms that were the most productive before the reform. Standard models of entry, exit, and firm dynamics, which assume a constant elasticity of substitution, are inconsistent with our findings about the heterogeneous response of incumbents to the reform. We show that a model with heterogeneous firms and variable markups accounts for our evidence. In this framework, the most productive firms face a lower demand elasticity and increase their employment in response to the entry of new firms.
E64|Shocking aspects of monetary policy on income inequality in the euro area|This paper examines the distributional effects of monetary policy, either standard, nonstandard or both, on income inequality in 10 EA countries over the period 2000-2015. We use three different indicators of income inequality in a Panel VAR setting in order to estimate IRFs of inequality to a monetary policy shock. Results suggest that: (i) the distributional effects of ECB’s monetary policy have been modest and (ii) mainly driven in times of conventional monetary policy measures, especially in peripheral countries, while, overall, (iii) standard and non-standard monetary policies do not significantly differ in terms of impact on income inequality.terms of impact on income inequality.
E64|Going the extra mile: Effort by workers and job-seekers|We introduce two types of effort into an otherwise standard labor search model to examine indeterminacy and sunspot equilibria. Variable labor effort gives rise to increasing returns to hours in production. This makes workers more valuable and contributes to self-fulfilling profit expectations, raising the likelihood of indeterminacy. Variable search effort makes workers search more intensively in a tighter labor market, which alleviates congestion and reduces the likelihood of indeterminacy. Indeterminacy disappears completely when vacancy posting costs are replaced with hiring costs.
E64|Growth Fatigue|This paper uncovers a new economic growth phenomenon whereby an economy becomes increasingly unresponsive to economic growth policies. This new phenomenon is referred to as growth fatigue. In this short paper, I document the growth fatigue phenomenon for the economy of Japan. My observations on Japan suggest that growth fatigue typically occurs in matured economies and that its causes are largely unknown.
E64|Plädoyer für eine neue Tarifpolitik: Kritische Situationsanalyse und Diskussion einer alternativen Gestaltungsvariante|Es gibt gute Gründe, die jahrzehntelang eingespielten Muster der Tarifpolitik kritisch zu hinterfragen. Für einen besonders problematischen Aspekt liefert das aktuelle Jahr 2019 ein gutes Beispiel: Die Ergebnisse von Tarifvertragsverhandlungen weisen aus betriebswirtschaftlicher Sicht ein kontraproduktives zeitliches Muster auf. Die höchsten Tarifabschlüsse werden nämlich oftmals in Jahren getätigt, in denen sich die Wachstumsraten der Wirtschaft deutlich reduzieren. Unternehmen bräuchten in dieser Phase eigentlich eine Kostenentlastung. Stattdessen gehen sie mit sockelwirksam erhöhten Personalkosten in eine Abschwungphase. Diese kontraproduktive Antizyklik kann potenziell zu einer Gefährdung der Arbeitsplätze in einzelnen Betrieben führen. Die Zahl der Betriebe in Kurzarbeit belegt dies deutlich. Weitere problematische Aspekte der üblichen tarifpolitischen Mechanismen sind: Kosten und Störpotenzial von Arbeitskämpfen, Belastung des öffentlichen Lebens und des Betriebsfriedens durch Streiks, Inflexibilität von Tarifverträgen, Kompliziertheit und Antiquiertheit von Verhandlungsritualen, finanzielle Überforderung einzelner Unternehmen durch Betriebsferne der Tarifverträge. Die Diskussion aller Aspekte führt zur Schlussfolgerung, dass die Suche nach alternativen Mechanismen in der Tarifpolitik sinnvoll ist. Es wird dazu ein Lastenheft entwickelt. Im Ergebnis wird ein neues Paradigma in der Tarifpolitik vorgeschlagen und diskutiert, das im Dauerbetrieb stärker durch eine betriebswirtschaftlich sinnhafte Zyklik, Standardisierung, Automatisierung und Einfachheit geprägt ist. Im Kern besteht der Ansatz aus zwei Komponenten. Alle Beschäftigten erhalten zunächst in jedem Jahr automatisch einen Ausgleich für die Inflationsrate. Dies schafft Kaufkraftstabilität. In einem nächsten Schritt wird die Gesamtbelegschaft dann zu einem langfristig vereinbarten Prozentsatz automatisch am Vorjahresgewinn des eigenen Unternehmens beteiligt. Dieses zweite Element sichert eine höhere Flexibilität der Personalkosten und führt zu betriebsnäheren Tarifergebnissen. Im Detail sind dabei eine Fülle von Einzelfragen zu diskutieren, unter anderem muss eine Lösung für nicht gewinnorientierte Organisationen gefunden werden.
E64|Die Verteilungseffekte der Geldpolitik der Europäischen Zentralbank und deren Einfluss auf die politische Stabilität|Seit Einführung des Euro im Jahr 1999 ist die Geldpolitik der Europäischen Zentralbank sehr locker. Die Leitzinsen sind auf und unter null gefallen. Die umfangreichen Kredite an Geschäftsbanken und Anleihekaufprogramme haben die Bilanz der Europäischen Zentralbank deutlich ausgeweitet. Das daraus resultierende starke Geldmengenwachstum hat negative Wachstums- und Verteilungseffekte, die über finanzielle Repression, Lohnrepression und die Inflationierung der Vermögenspreise auf die Gesellschaft wirken. Die wachsende Ungleichheit ist mit einer wachsenden politischen Destabilisierung verbunden, die marktwirtschaftliche Prinzipien und damit den Wohlstand gefährdet.
E64|Pareto-improving structural reforms|Economists recommend to partly redistribute gains to losers from a structural reform, which in many cases may be required for making the reform politically viable. However, taxation is distortionary. Then, it is unclear that compensatory transfers can support a Pareto-improving reform. This paper provides sufficient conditions for this to occur, despite tax distortions. I consider an economy where workers have sector-specific skills and some sectors are regulated by a price floor. Transfers have to be financed by proportional taxation on firm's revenues or, equivalently, labor income. Labor supply is elastic to net post-tax real wages, and hence reduced by taxation. In a setting where preferences are isolelastic, deregulation is implementable in a Pareto-improving way through compensatory lump-sum transfers, despite that these are financed by distortionary taxes. In a more general setting, there always exist Pareto-improving reforms but they may involve tightening regulation for some goods. I provide sufficient conditions for deregulation, i.e. a general reduction in price floors, to be Pareto-improving. They imply that demand cross-price elasticities should not be too large and that the reform should not be too unbalanced. Finally, I consider counter-examples where some people earn rents associated with informational or institutional frictions. In such situations, Pareto improvements are unlikely. If losers have veto power, the reform may only be supported by a minority of people. Broadening reform scope is especially useful to raise its political support when its impact is uneven across consumers.

E64|Regional Integration: Do intra-African trade and migration improve income in Africa?|Regional integration in Africa is a subject of great interest, but its impact on income has not been studied sufficiently. Using cross-sectional and panel estimations, this paper examines the impact of African integration on real per capita income in Africa. To do this, we consider intra-African trade and migration flows as quantitative measures reflecting the intensity of regional integration. In order to address the endogeneity concerns, we use a gravity-based IV strategy. Our results show that, from a long-term perspective, African integration has not been strong enough to generate a positive, significant and robust impact on real per capita income in Africa. However it appears to be significantly income-enhancing in the short term but only through inter-country migration. These results are robust to a wide range of specifications. Further analysis shows that economic diversification, financial development and the quality of transport and telecommunication infrastructure significantly affect the impact of intra-African trade on per capita income. Their improvement would make intra-African trade income-improving. Our policy recommendations have been formulated in this direction.
E64|Earnings Inequality and the Minimum Wage: Evidence from Brazil|We assess the extent to which a rise in the minimum wage can account for three facts characterizing a large decline in earnings inequality in Brazil from 1996â€“2012: (i) the decline is more pronounced towards the bottom of the distribution; (ii) one quarter of the decline stems from an increase in relative pay at less productive firms; and (iii) another quarter is attributable to falling pay differences due to worker heterogeneity. To this end, we build an equilibrium search model with heterogeneity in worker ability and firm productivity. The central feature of the model is the presence of spillover effects of the minimum wage on higher earnings ranks due to monopsonistic competition among firms for workers. We estimate the model using indirect inference and find that the rise in the minimum wage explains 70 percent of the decline in the variance of log earnings. Spillover effects of the minimum wage account for more than half of this decline and quantitatively match the three empirical facts. Our results suggest that labor market dynamics can lead to large effects of policy on earnings inequality.
E64|Friedman and Phelps on the Phillips Curve Viewed from a Half Century's Perspective|In the late 1960s the stable negatively sloped Phillips Curve (PC) was overturned by the Friedman-Phelps natural rate model. Their PC was vertical in the long run at the natural unemployment rate, and their short-run curve shifted up whenever unemployment was pushed below the natural rate. This paper criticizes the underlying assumption of the Friedman-Phelps approach that the labor market continuously clears and that changes in unemployment down or up occur only in response to “fooling” of workers, firms, or both. A preferable and resolutely Keynesian approach explains quantity rationing by inertia in price and wage setting. The positive correlation of inflation and unemployment in the 1970s and again in the 1990s is explained by joining the negatively sloped Phillips Curve with a positively sloped dynamic demand curve. For any given growth of nominal GDP, higher inflation caused by adverse supply shocks implies slower real GDP growth and higher unemployment. This “triangle” model based on inflation inertia, demand, and supply worked well to explain why inflation and unemployment were both positively and negatively correlated between the 1960s and 1990s, but in the past decade the slope of the short-run Phillips Curve has flattened as inflation exhibited a muted response to high unemployment in 2009-13 and low unemployment in 2016-2018. It remains to be seen whether a continuation of low unemployment will cause a modest and fixed extra amount of inflation, thus reviving the stable Phillips curve of the early 1960s, or whether inflation will continuously accelerate as Friedman and Phelps would have predicted.
E64|Количественное Смягчение По-Русски<BR>[Quantitative Easing, Russian Style]|In March 2018, President of Russia Vladimir Putin designated the target of increasing per capita GDP of the Russian population 1.5 times by 2024. In order to meet this target, GDP would be required to grow by 6% a year between 2018 and 2024. This is a challenging task as the last time growth rate ever reached the 6% bar was in the far off 2008. However, this can be done with the help of “quantitative easing, Russian way”. For that purpose, the commonly used “technology” of quantitative easing has to be adapted to the Russian environment. В марте 2018 года президент России Владимир Путин обозначил цель увеличить ВВП на душу населения в России в 1,5 раза к 2024 году. Для выполнения этой задачи требуется рост ВВП в 2018-2024 годах на 6% в год. Задача сложная, так как последний раз рост достигал 6% в далёком 2008 году. Но эту задачу можно решить с помощью «количественного смягчения по-русски». Для этого надо общепринятую «технологию» количественного смягчения приспособить (адаптировать) к российским условиям.
E64|Analyzing the trends of natural resources rents of Pakistan|An attempt was made to reveal the trends of natural resources in graphical form. Rental incomes which contribute to GDP were taken into account. For this purpose, economic statistics of Pakistan was taken from World Bank’s published data source. Data was put in SPSS-20 and comparative analysis chart was created to obtain the objectives. Results revealed no significant constant or linear trends in any factor of natural resources. It was concluded that oil and natural gas contributed significantly in the start of 21st Century. Mineral has been treated as neglected factor in contributing to GDP. A research can further expand to explore more trends of rental incomes in different regions of world. We would like to express our gratitude towards initial reviewer of draft and thank to people who helped us in completion of this study.
E64|Unconditional Basic Income: Who gets it? Who pays for it? A social Accounting Approach to Distribution|Unconditional basic income is not a new topic in political economy, and it gains new momentum as more and more research is being devoted to it. The discussion focusses on the adequacy and effects such a policy measure may entail for a person and his socio-economic situation, usually. Object of investigation is the individual, and the corresponding theory is of micro-economic descent. In this paper, in contrast, we develop a method of how to assess feasibility and consequences of an unconditional basic income for a modern, open economy, on the macroeconomic level, using concepts and statistics of a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) as our main tool. A SAM-based approach can measure, and perhaps model, the impact on the economic activity of a country, and on its economic institutions of new policy measures such as introducing an unconditional basic income. The economic activity of a country is expressed in monetary flows as registered in the National Accounts. So their underlying principles and definitions are adopted. However, the habitual way of putting an economy into a sequence of institutional accounts connecting each institution’s income to the cost, - similar to business accounting - reveals only one, namely the inner-institutional half of the economic circuit. The other, outer half, namely, how the costs of one institution generate income for another one is better captured by the format of a Social Accounting Matrix. In the paper, the impact of an unconditional basic income is quantified, for macroeconomic aggregates of institutional sectors and socio-economic groups of households, taking the German and the Portuguese economies as examples. Purpose of the paper is not to argue for, or against, an unconditional basic income, but to offer a scientific tool with which to calculate and assess possibilities and consequences of the proposal, for a national economy as a whole.
E64|Política Fiscal, Ingresos y Desigualdad en Colombia (1990-2015)<BR>[Fiscal Policy, Income And Inequality In Colombia (1990-2015)]|Due to the supported economic growth of the first decade of the 21st century, Colombia managed to reduce the levels of poverty and inequality. Nevertheless, the country continued to present one of the most inequitable economies in the world maintaining a high income concentration. In that sense, this paper aims at analyzing the fiscal policy incident in the income distribution. To that effect, the redistributive impact of the fiscal action in Colombia, Latin America and the group of country members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) were examined. Besides, a historical follow-up of the income and public expenditures behavior in Colombia was carried out from 1990 until 2015, highlighting two fundamental facts: 1) from the constitutional reform of 1991, the social public expenditure presented a remarkable growth as a response to the fiscal commitments acquired by the state and 2) the Income Tax and the Value-Added tax (VAT) have been the props on which the national tax structure has been supported. With these elements and the information supplied by the National Survey of Income and Home Expenses, there was approached the study of the distributive incident in Colombia, estimating Gini’s indicators, the income concentration, Kakwani and Reynolds-Smolensky. The results of the present investigation allow to conclude that though the Income Tax to natural people, the Value-Added Tax (VAT) and the public expenditure show a progressive behavior, their redistributive capacity is limited; that is why the Gini’s coefficient don’t present significant variations after the fiscal action.
E64|Endogenous Skills and Labor Income Inequality|How much does inequality in life depend on conditions established at age 18? What role does post-18 higher education play? I use an education choice model with exogenous conditions from family wealth, established human capital at age 18 and shocks to human capital to examine these questions. Family wealth and established human capital at age 18 determine the post-18 education choices. Education builds up human capital and reduces future earnings volatility. Absent this transmission channel, previous studies dramatically underestimate the importance of initial family wealth in explaining lifetime earnings inequality. My model finds that family wealth at age 18 explains up to 15% of lifetime earnings inequalities, and human capital at age 18 explains 72%. Policy counterfacutals that encourage college education by providing financial aid reduce inequality and improve welfare.
E64|New Frontiers in the Euro Debate in Iceland|The debate on currency arrangements and monetary policy frameworks in lceland has been motivated by developments in lceland and internationally in recent decades. Historically, lcelanders' colonial experience and struggle to retain control of vital natural resources made them hesitant participants in the European integration process. While sidestepping direct participation in the process leading to EU and EMU membership, they joined EFTA, the EEA and Schengen. Economic growth and development have been rapid, but the modernisation and liberalisation of the economy have been attended by signi:ficant volatility in nominal and real variables. At the same time, the European integration process has continued with its own set of challenges. It is in this context that a vibrant debate has taken place on the choice of currency and associated policies. The main emphasis has been on whether to adopt the euro (through EU membership) or retain the Icelandic króna with the most efficacious monetary policy framework possible. This article offers a review of salient contributions to the debate and the main lessons drawn from it. The key themes of the debate involve the impact currency choice would have on economic growth and resilience to shocks. While the early debate was mostly concerned with trade-theoretic issues, institutional factors have become increasingly important. A new theory concerning a heretofore overlooked policy variable, the evolution of inequality as measured by the wage-productivity gap, is discussed. It is shown to be potentially important for economic and financial outcomes, with implications for the debate.
E64|Les voies de la recherche cliométrique ouvertes par Le Capital au XXI e siècle|The publication of Thomas Piketty?s Capital in the 21st Century has revived interest in the issue of inequality in history. This book contains two key proposals: the author establishes a first principle of fundamental differences between the return on capital and wages, which would be the source of inequality in history. At the same time, the accumulation of capital is the factor that has historically driven economic growth. Piketty?s book explores these two aspects in succession, but he does not study the links between these two propositions: are inequalities a motor or a brake on economic growth in history? This is the thread of our analysis of the book, which examines two major questions: how to move from the statement of a ?historical law of capitalism? into a dynamic growth model? And, can savings be an obstacle to economic growth? In a final section, we suggest that the use of cliometrics can be a means of clarifying if not deciding these debates.

E64|Wachstumsfolgen von Einkommensungleichheit – Theorie, empirische Evidenz und Politikempfehlungen|Income inequality is “the defining challenge of our time”, former US President Barack Obama said in a speech in December 2013. Undoubtedly, the financial crisis and the sluggish recovery in its aftermath have increased the attention to rising inequality. This survey addresses the consequences of income inequality for economic growth from a theoretical and from an empirical angle. Both perspectives yield inconclusive results on whether inequality is ‘good’ or ‘bad’ for growth. This poses a problem for policymakers contemplating (e.g. tax) policies aimed at raising or lowering inequality. On the other hand, policies to promote social justice arguably do not need to pass a ‘do they increase economic growth?’ test. Some policy proposals which would reduce inequality are discussed as well.
E64|The role of internal devaluation on the correction of the Spanish external deficit|The Spanish economy has been one of the EU’s most affected by the Great Recession of 2008, recording a rate of unemployment of 26.2% in 2013. However, since 2014 Spain is growing faster than most Euro Area countries, reaching an annual growth rate over 3% during the period 2015- 2017. Moreover, it has turned its historical current account deficit, which peaked in 2007, into a surplus of 2 % of GDP in 2017. International and Spanish institutions, as well as some scholars, have rooted this readjustment of the current account in the “internal devaluation strategy”. Consisting in the reduction of wages, this strategy is supposed to have boosted exports and therefore Spanish economic activity, through the reversion of the accumulated loss of price-competitiveness since the creation of the European Monetary Union. Nevertheless, empirical evidence shows that changes in demand (and some exceptional factors as the recent evolution of oil prices) are much more important to explain the evolution of Spanish net exports than changes in price competitiveness. Based on an extended version of the Bhaduri-Marglin model, which enables the disentangling of the price effect from the demand effect, this paper sheds light on the true influence of internal devaluation on the deficit correction occurred in the Spanish external sector. It reveals that wage restraint has meant only limited gains in price-competitiveness, having affected external balance mainly through a “demand effect” on imports, although to a limited extent. The estimations carried out show that the internal devaluation strategy readjusted the Spanish external sector by 1.74 p.p. during the period of 2010-2017. Of all this correction, 98% is induced by a change in the demand of the economy, and only 2% is due to the effect on prices. It makes also clear that although exports performance has been remarkable during last years in Spain, it does not differ much from the previous decade, and it cannot be explained by internal devaluation.

E64|Some new insights on the empirics of Goodwin’s growth-cycle model|Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models have been used for a long time now to study profit-squeeze cycles, most of the time using problematic Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filtered time series. In a recent paper, Hamilton (2018) has provided a simple alternative that overcomes the main drawbacks of the HP procedure. In order to evaluate the empirical relevance of the profit-squeeze mechanism, we compare both methodologies using quarterly data for the United States from 1948-67 to 2016. Furthermore, we present an extension of Goodwin's (1967) growth-cycle model that includes employment rates, income distribution, and capacity utilisation as endogenous variables. We show analytically that the system always admits a family of periodic solutions. The model is estimated econometrically using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach. Through numerical simulations and making use of our estimations, we confirm that fluctuations are persistent and bounded.
E64|Austria’s Economic Competitiveness in a Neighbourhood Context: Is Austria’s Economy Locked-in to the CESEE Region?|Since the Eastern enlargement of the EU in 2004, Austria has lost global export market shares. At the same time exports to Central, East and Southeast Europe (CESEE) have gained a significant portion of Austria’s total exports. Moreover, in recent years Austrian GDP growth has slowed down and unemployment increased. In this context our main research question is whether the opening to the East has had a structural lock-in effect for Austria’s economy. In a novel approach on the territorial lock-in effect we apply a multi-perspective view from a microeconomic (firm-level), mesoeconomic (industry-level) and macroeconomic (country-level) perspective. The major finding is that by and large Austria is not subject to a lock-in effect into CESEE markets. On the contrary, the results suggest a growing internationalisation of the Austrian export structure. Nevertheless, policy recommendations that aim at further improving Austria’s competitiveness include a productivity‑oriented wage policy, an industrial policy that aims at technological upgrading, support for European policy measures that speed up income convergence across the continent as well as additional measures to internationalise Austrian businesses with a focus on the booming emerging markets in India and Africa.
E64|Corporatism and the Labour Income Share|Econometric Investigation into the Impact of Institutions on the Wage Share of Industrialised Nations The aim of this paper is to evaluate the changing impact of corporatism – cooperation between business, labour and state interest groups – over the period 1960-2010 and across industrialised economies on the development of the share of labour in national income. Also due to data issues this relationship has not been extensively analysed in the literature so far. A new time-variant corporatism index developed by Jahn (2016) allows us to fill this gap. Using different panel data techniques, samples and control variables, our main results suggest that there is a robust non-linear relationship at work. While the linear effects of both corporatism and the public sector share are positive, the coefficient of the interaction term of these two institutional indicators is negative and hence indicates a negative slope for countries with both a high level of corporatism and a large government share in GDP in explaining the change as well as the level of the adjusted wage share in the long run. To a certain extent the two institutions can be seen as substitutes. In countries where the role of the state has been reduced, the existence of a more centralised wage bargaining system has limited the extent of the fall in the share of labour in national income. In countries with less prevalent collective bargaining systems, a similar effect can be achieved by higher government spending. We therefore argue for a stronger role for centralised wage bargaining in economic policy-making, especially in countries where the share of government spending in GDP is low.
E64|The Dynamic Effects of Fiscal Consolidation Episodes on Income Inequality|Evidence for 17 OECD Countries over 1978-2013 Using an annual data set covering 17 OECD countries over the time period 1978-2013, this paper analyses the dynamic effects of ﬁscal consolidation episodes on income inequality in the short and medium run. By estimating impulse response functions from local projections, we ﬁnd that ﬁscal consolidations typically lead to an increase in income inequality. Baseline results suggest that in the aftermath of the start of a ﬁscal adjustment episode, the Gini coefficient of disposable income increases by about 0.4 percentage points in the short run (in year three), and by 0.6 percentage points in the medium run (in year seven). The impact of ﬁscal austerity measures on the income distribution is found to be more pronounced a) when the size of the ﬁscal consolidation package is large rather than small; b) when the duration of the adjustment is long instead of short; c) when the ﬁscal consolidation is based more on spending cuts than on tax increases; d) when the consolidation is started in the aftermath of a ﬁnancial crisis rather than in a non-crisis episode; and e) when the adjustment falls into a period of low economic growth instead of high growth.
E64|Economic Aspects of Subjective Attitudes towards the Minimum Wage Reform|Despite some skepticism among experts about the effects of a minimum wage, there is remarkably widespread public support for such policies. Using representative survey data from 2015 and 2016, we investigate the subjective attitudes driving public support for Germany’s recent minimum wage reform. We find that socio-economic characteristics and political orientations explain a minor part of the variation in attitudes, whereas beliefs that the reform will bring positive redistributional effects and perceptions that it will help people to maintain or improve their overall economic situation (measured by living standards, income, hours worked, and job security) play a major role.
E64|Austerity, inequality, and private debt overhang|Using panel data of 17 OECD countries for 1980–2011, we find that the distributional consequences of fiscal consolidations depend significantly on the level of private indebtedness. Austerity leads to a strong and persistent increase in income inequality during periods of private debt overhang. In contrast, there are no discernible distributional effects when private debt is low. This result is robust to alternative identifications of fiscal consolidations, to different ways of defining periods of private debt overhang, and to controlling for the state of the business cycle and the level of government debt. We explore different channels through which our findings can be rationalized.
E64|The local aggregate effects of minimum wage increases|This paper examines the effect of minimum wage changes on local aggregate inflation and consumption growth. The paper utilizes variation in state-level minimum wages across locations and finds that minimum wage increases have a relatively modest effect on both city-level inflation and spending growth over the years following the change. The most noticeable effects are for food consumed at home and away from home—industries that typically employ a large share of low-wage and minimum-wage workers. Interestingly, consumers adjust their real food consumption when minimum wages rise, suggesting that some workers benefit from minimum wage changes.
E64|Stagnation policy in the Eurozone and economic policy alternatives|Empirically, the macroeconomic institutions and the macroeconomic policy approach in the Eurozone have failed badly, both in terms of preventing the global financial and economic cri-sis from becoming a euro crisis and in generating a rapid recovery from the crisis, in particular. In this paper I will argue that the dominating macroeconomic policy regime in the Eurozone can be seen as a version of what Steindl (1979) had called ?stagnation policy?. To underline this argument, I will provide a simple Steindlian distribution and growth model in order to identi-fy the main channels through which stagnation policy affects accumulation and productivity growth. This will also provide a set of elements of a Steindlian anti-stagnation policy. Against this theoretical background I will then examine the macroeconomic institutions and the macro-economic policy approach of the Eurozone which has been based on the New Consensus Macroeconomics (NCM) and I will highlight its main deficiencies. This will then provide the grounds for an outline of an alternative macroeconomic policy approach for the specific institu-tional setup of the Eurozone based on a post-Keynesian/Steindlian/neo-Kaleckian approach.
E64|Opportunities and limits of rebalancing the Eurozone via wage policies|In this paper we discuss the relationship between the current account rebalancing in the Eu-rozone, income distribution and wage policies with a focus on the main surplus economy, Germany. We will illustrate how and to which extent German wage policies could be able to contribute to a more balanced development of the Eurozone and to overcome the export-led mercantilist German model. Our analysis and our scenarios will be based on stylized econo-metric results for Germany, as they have recently been obtained in the empirical literature estimating the German demand and growth regime based on post-Kaleckian models. We will focus in particular on the relationship between nominal wages and functional income distribu-tion, on the one hand, and between functional income distribution and domestic demand, on the other hand. We show that more expansionary wage policy can contribute to reducing the excessive German current account surplus, mainly through the domestic income-imports channel. However, wage policy alone will be overburdened with the task of rebalancing. For this, in particular more expansionary fiscal policies are required.
E64|Should the Rich be Taxed More? The Fiscal Inequality Coefficient| This paper holistically addresses the effective (relative) income tax contribution of a given income (or, wealth) group. The widely acclaimed standard in public policy is the absolute benefaction of a given income group in filling up the fiscal coffers. Instead, we focus on the ratio of the average income taxrate of an income group divided by the percentage of national income (or wealth) appropriated by the same income group. In turn, we develop the Fiscal Inequality Coefficient which compares the effective percentage income tax payments of pairs of income (or wealth) groups. Using data for the US, we concentrate on pairs such as the Bottom 90% versus Top 10%, Bottom 99% versus Top 1% and Bottom 99.9% versus Top 0.1%. We conclude that policy makers with a strong social conscience should re-evaluate the progressivity of the income tax system and make the richest echelons of the income and wealth distributions pay a fairer and higher tax.
E64|The effects of minimum wages on the labor market and income distribution in Kenya: A CGE analysis|In Kenya, there has been increased debate on the impact of minimum wage increases and pay disparities between sectors. Long-term differences in earnings across sectors and different regions (urban and rural) are reflected through higher poverty rates in rural areas, especially among wage earners. This study evaluates the effects of minimum wages on labor and its impact on growth. The study uses the single country static model, the PEP-1-1 model and the Social Accounting Matrix for Kenya for the year 2009. The key research questions are to assess the effects of minimum wages on rural or urban area labor markets, labor migration, and income distribution. To achieve this, the study simulates three scenarios: increases in minimum wages for formal workers in urban and rural areas at the same rate of 5%, different rates (10% rural and 5% urban), and a cut in the minimum wages in both regions. The findings indicate that increases in wage fuel the migration of labor from rural to urban areas, and stifles the expansion of the economy. A rise in minimum wages has an overall negative effect on incomes of rural households while benefiting urban households, which contributes to increased inequality. A fall in real minimum wages on the other hand, is supportive of output and employment growth.
E64|Moving Closer or Drifting Apart: Distributional Effects of Monetary Policy|Our paper picks up the current controversial debate about increasing (income) inequality due to recent monetary policy measures in major advanced economies. We use a VAR framework identified with sign restrictions to figure out how income inequality related measures react to monetary policy in six different advanced economies. These countries differ by their absolute income inequality as well as their redistribution. We choose the U.S., Canada and South Korea as countries with very little redistribution and Sweden, the Czech Republic and Hungary as countries with relatively high redistribution. While all economies experience an increase in Gini coefficients of gross income in the presence of an expansionary monetary policy shock, only the U.S., Canada and South Korea also show a significant response in Gini coefficient of net income. To figure out how the transmission of monetary policy to income inequality works we pick up the two major channels dominant in the literature: The employment channel and the income composition channel. The latter is analyzed by data from national accounts concerning two different kinds of income households receive: Labor related income and capital payments, both net. While we find that capital owners profit disproportionately in the less redistributing countries, we observe a more even reaction in both income types. This indicates that the harmful effects of expansionary monetary policy on the market income distribution are mitigated if the degree of redistribution is high.
E64|Artificial Intelligence and Its Implications for Income Distribution and Unemployment|Inequality is one of the main challenges posed by the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) and other forms of worker-replacing technological progress. This paper provides a taxonomy of the associated economic issues: First, we discuss the general conditions under which new technologies such as AI may lead to a Pareto improvement. Secondly, we delineate the two main channels through which inequality is affected – the surplus arising to innovators and redistributions arising from factor price changes. Third, we provide several simple economic models to describe how policy can counter these effects, even in the case of a “singularity” where machines come to dominate human labor. Under plausible conditions, non-distortionary taxation can be levied to compensate those who otherwise might lose. Fourth, we describe the two main channels through which technological progress may lead to technological unemployment – via efficiency wage effects and as a transitional phenomenon. Lastly, we speculate on how technologies to create super-human levels of intelligence may affect inequality and on how to save humanity from the Malthusian destiny that may ensue.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
E64|Modern (American) Capitalism: A Three Act Tragedy|This paper examines the process of demand formation in capitalist economies characterized by high levels of household indebtedness, with a particular focus on contemporary developments and their sustainability. The thesis developed is that over the past 35 years, supply-side economics hollowed out the core of the demand-generating mechanism in US capitalism, with disastrous consequences. Particular attention is focused on the interplay of growing inequality, emulation effects, the erosion of social provision, household debt accumulation, and the evolution of consumption spending. The unsustainability of these processes gives rise to a discussion of initiatives that might alter the process of demand-formation so as to make it both more equitable and more sustainable.
E64|Are higher wages good for business? An assessment under alternative innovation and investment scenarios|This paper aims at investigating the interplay between inequality, innovation dynamics, and investment behaviors in shaping the long-run patterns of development of a closed economy. By extending the analysis proposed in Caiani et al. (2017) we explore the effects of alternative wage regimes under different investment and technological change scenarios. Experiments results seem to de-emphasize the role of technological progress as a possible source of greater inequality. Overall, simulation results are consistent with the predominance of a wage-led growth regime in most of the scenarios analyzed: a faster growth of low and middle level workers’ wages, relative to managers’, generally exert beneficial effects on the economy and allows to counteract the labor-saving effects of technological progress. Furthermore, contrary to what is sometimes argued in the academic and political debate, a distribution more favorable to workers does not compromise firms’ profitability, but rather strengthen it creating a more favorable macroeconomic environment which encourages further innovations, stimulates investment, and sustains economic growth.

It is sufficient to mention, for instance, Brexit or the defeat of Matteo Renzi in Italy’s referendum. Populism and Euroscepticism have been growing. One reason for this is social discontent. The question then arises - how is it possible to have social discontent in one of the most economically developed parts of the world with such a high GDP per capita? In order to understand this phenomenon, we need to approach the notion of ""poverty"" within the framework of Europe. It is true that the poor in the EU are not deprived of food and essential necessities, as is the case in some other regions of the world, but they consider themselves as poor and underprivileged because they are neglected by society, they cannot find realization, they are turned into passive users of social security benefits. To resolve this issue is not to increase social assistance but to develop policies and programs that are mainly oriented towards the needs of people - education, medicine, culture. In the EU, these policies remain within the exclusive competence of national states. This creates great inequalities. Four different social models have emerged in the EU – Scandinavian, Continental, Mediterranean, and recently the Globalization model, which is least related to the traditions of the European social market economy, but seems to be gaining ground. If the European Union wants to achieve greater sustainability, it has to focus more on the social aspect of its activities and expand its competences in the social affairs and to develop a single EU social model."
E64|Decomposing the links between oil price shocks and macroeconomic indicators: Evidence from SAARC region|This study examines the impact of oil price shocks on key macroeconomic variables (i.e., real GDP, interest rate, inflation and exchange rate) for five SAARC countries (i.e., India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Bhutan). For this purpose, we adopt contemporary macroeconomic policy modeling tool called impulse response function (IRF) and forecast error variance decomposition method (FEVDM) in the structural vector autorepression (SVAR) setting using time series data over the extended period from 1982 to 2014. In addition, Johansen and Juselius (1990) cointegration method is applied for long-run relationship. The results of cointegration test confirms the long-run equilibrium relationship between all the underlying variables. However, the empirical findings of IRF explained significant variation among all underlying macroeconomic variables in response to exogenous oil price shocks at different time horizons. It means the macroeconomic factors are sensitive to even small oil price shocks and possess various socio-economic implications in the region. The results of FEVDM evidence that each country in a study group responds differently to oil price shocks, it corresponds their independent policies, macroeconomic fundamentals, sector constructions and heterogeneity across the countries. The findings help governments to reform public policies in the region by controlling macroeconomic fluctuations due to oil price shocks.

E64|Neoliberal Redistributive Policy : The U.S. Net Social Wage in the 21st Century|In this paper, I examine the trends of fiscal transfers between the state and workers during 1959-2012 to understand the net impact of redistributive policy in the United States. This paper presents original net social wage data from and analysis based on the replication and extension of Shaikh and Tonak (2002). The paper investigates the appearance of a post-2001 variation in the net social wage data. The positive net social wage in the 21st century is the result of a combination of factors including the growth of income support, healthcare inflation, neoliberal tax reforms, and macroeconomic instability. Growing economic inequality does not appear to alter the results of the net social wage methodology. Classification-JEL: H5, E62, E64, B5
E64|Declining labor-labor exchange rates as a cause of inequality growth|The current trends in the capital/labor split and the impacts thereof on the growth of inequality are one of the main concerns of national governments, European Commission and international organizations like UN, ILO, IMF, OECD and WB. These trends are usually studied at the macro level of functional distribution of income, that is, among capital and labor, and less with regard to productivity, remuneration policies or some other particular factors. In this paper, we contribute to the studies of the second type, explaining the decreasing labor income share in terms of unpaid working time and underpaid hourly earnings. For this purpose, we refer to the decreasing labor-labor exchange rate, i.e. devaluation of one's labor in exchange for other's labor embodied in the commodities affordable for one's earnings. We show that the productivity growth allows employers to compensate workers with always a lower labor equivalent, i.e. increasingly underpay works, maintaining however an impression of fair pay due to an increasing purchasing power of earnings. This conclusion is based on the OECD 1990-2014 data for G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom and United States) and Denmark (known for the world least inequality). Then statistically significant implications for the growth of inequality are derived and some policy suggestions are formulated like taxing the enterprises with the inner Gini that surpasses the national level.
E64|Political Economy of Trade and Storage Policies Coordination, and the Role of Domestic Public Storage in the World Market|In this paper, a standard theoretical model of trade policy is extended to incorporate domestic public storage policy, so as to explore government political motivations in the context of border and domestic policy coordination. Theoretically, domestic storage policy can add to price stabilization in the presence of trade policy, and can reinforce a price-insulating trade policy through increasing the countryÂ’s market power. However, the effects of these two price stabilization instruments on the international market price are in opposite directions. Furthermore, the effect of domestic public storage on the world market is then tested, using China cotton as a case study. The VAR econometrics reveal that in the case of cotton during 2011-14, China as a large player in the global market was able to stabilize to a non-trivial extent the international price of cotton through altering its public stockpile.
E64|Beyond the austerity dispute: new priorities for fiscal policy|The workshop aimed at moving forward the fiscal policy debate, which in the crisis years was unavoidably focused on how to regain fiscal credibility and to implement sizable and fast consolidation plans. Four main themes have been proposed for the debate during the workshop. First, the two-way link between fiscal consolidation and inequality, with the idea that consolidation efforts cannot be successful in the long run if they entail a socially unsustainable increase in inequality. Second, the importance of preserving, even in contexts in which the fiscal policy stance is necessarily restrictive, growth-enhancing public investments. Third, the challenges posed to fiscal management by a low inflation context, taking into account that a subdued price dynamics not only makes the real burden of debt heavier, but it also has subtle effects, at least in the short term, on several budgetary items. Finally, the need for a simpler and more appropriate set of rules for the governance of the EMU. The latter topic was also the object of the high-level panel at the end of the workshop. While differences in emphasis emerged among the panellists, they agreed that the current framework could be streamlined, and – more importantly – that no set of rules can work if trust and a sense of sharing a common objective is not rebuilt among the Member States.

E64|Policy Uncertainty and Manufacturing Investment: Evidence from U.S. State Elections|We estimate the effect of electorally induced policy uncertainty on investment in the manufacturing sector. Because state governors exercise considerable influence over legislation and considerable discretion over regulation and permitting, and because the policies relevant to business investment vary systematically by party, uncertainty over the partisan affiliation of the future governor is a source of political risk to firms considering business investment. More importantly, the lack of an incumbent in a race due to term limits raises uncertainty over the outcome, providing a convincing instrument that allows us to estimate causal effects. We find that, in a state with average partisan polarization, in the calendar year of a gubernatorial election, the elasticity of investment to the eventual margin of victory is 0.027. Both the significance and magnitude of this result are robust to various controls, measures, and estimators. Importantly, the investment decline is not reversed the following year. We show that own-state uncertainty is associated with a large and significant rise in neighboring states’ investment, suggesting that rather than postponing investment to the future, the effect of policy uncertainty at the subnational level is to drive investment to alternative sites.
E64|Can Minimum Wages Raise Workers' Incomes in the Long Run?|Using an intertemporal model of saving and capital accumulation with two types of agents (workers and capitalists) we demonstrate that it is impossible for any binding minimum wage to increase the after-tax incomes of workers if the production function is Cobb-Douglas with constant returns to scale, or if there are no differences in ability among workers. We also show that it is not possible to increase the incomes of employed workers through minimum wage legislation, even under decreasing returns to scale and heterogeneity of ability among workers, unless the welfare support provided to unemployed workers is far below what they would earn in the absence of minimum wages. Moreover, we establish that in the absence of a separate class of agents (i.e. capitalists) minimum wages cannot increase the incomes of employed workers even when there are decreasing returns to scale and no welfare support is provided to the unemployed.
E64|No free lunch: Fundamental tradeoffs in macroeconomic policy|This article identifies previously unknown, fundamental constraints on the effectiveness of economic policy instruments. The constraints arise from unstable zero dynamics, which occur commonly in macroeconomic models, and require (in the linear, time-invariant case) that infinite sums of discounted future values of certain endogenous variables necessarily equal zero, irrespective of policy. Unstable zero dynamics potentially explain the “price puzzle,” and are exemplified by classic explanations of the effect of changes in the rate of money creation on interest rates. They furnish a mathematical formulation of elements of Minsky’s financial instability hypothesis. In the multivariable case, they give rise to constraints involving multiple endogenous variables, which relate to the Phillips curve and Okun’s Law, and provide a system-theoretic paradigm for phenomena such as stagflation and stagnation.
E64|Reservation wages and the wage flexibility puzzle|Wages are only mildly cyclical, implying that shocks to labour demand have a larger short-run impact on unemployment rather than wages, at odds with the quantitative predictions of the canonical search and matching model. This paper provides an alternative perspective on the wage flexibility puzzle, explaining why the canonical model can only match the observed cyclicality of wages if the replacement ratio is implausibly high. We show that this failure remains even if wages are only occasionally renegotiated, unless the persistence in unemployment is implausibly low. We then provide some evidence that part of the problem comes from the implicit model for the determination of reservation wages. Estimates for the UK and West Germany provide evidence that reservation wages are much less cyclical than predicted even conditional on the observed level of wage cyclicality. We present evidence that elements of perceived “fairness” or “reference points” in reservation wages may address this model failure.
E64|Macroeconomic and financial sector policies to better serve the economy and society|Financialisation processes have been generated by the widespread liberalization and deregulation measures adopted in most developed and emerging economies. The result of these processes has been an unparalleled increase in the size of financial systems. Recent empirical research is showing that the relation between the size of financial system and economic activity is not a linear one and that in many countries we can talk of a an excessive size of financial systems as far as the current size of finances is well above the threshold that leads to a negative impact of finance on economic activity and growth and welfare. On the other hand, financialisation has come in parallel, fuelling them and being fuelled by, a change in the macroeconomic policy strategy (with the dominance of a monetary policy focused on price stability), a re-distribution of income in favour of top incomes and capital incomes, and a de-regulation and liberalization of financial markets and institutions. The paper argues that to promote a better financial system, economic authorities must adopt measures rationalizing (i.e., reducing) the size of financial markets at the same time that a more strict regulation of all financial markets and units be implemented. Moreover, the strategy of macroeconomic policy must be reformed, upgrading the current role given to fiscal policy and giving more relevance to real economic objectives, like economic growth and full employment. Finally, there must be an income redistribution in favour of lowest incomes and labour incomes.
E64|The Use Of Wto Legal Instruments In Russia’S Foreign Economic Relations|Experience shows that although certain notions like the norms and rules established by the World Trade Organization (WTO) are still being perceived as something abstract and metaphorical by many participants of foreign economic activity, these norms and rules have already been actively used in the traditional bilateral trade and economic relationships between the Russian Federation with the countries of near and far abroad. Although the WTO’s legal instruments vary in their effectiveness, they make it possible for a country to safeguard its national economic interests. However, if these norms and rules are implemented incorrectly, they can only give rise to additional problems and troubles.
E64|Regions’ Debt Burden: Awating Budget Loans|Over 11 months of 2015, regional debt growth came to nearly 5% against the turn of the year. Municipal debt growth during the same period constituted 1.5%. By the period-end for the entire year, the debt volume will increase further. However, growth rates, most likely, will slow down compared to 2014. By the end of 11 months, the budget loans share went up by 7.3 p.p. to 38.3% with simultaneous decline of the commercial loans share by 5.6 p.p. and state bonds by 1.4 p.p. in the debt structure. However, the situation signifi cantly diff ers in various regions: there are regions with public debt growth due to mainly commercial loans with already high level of accumulated debt.

E64|Tax reforms and their varying impacts on private households in Germany ? Socio-economic modelling opportunities in a macro-econometric input-output model|Taxation of incomes generated by economic agents is a main pillar of redistributive social policies undertaken by the government in Germany. The apparent lack of sufficient adjustments of the tax schedule during the period 2005-2015 has led to higher average annual growth rates in taxes than in income. This development has triggered a public dispute about alleged bracket creep, i.e. inflationary-caused nominal income increase pushing taxable income into higher tax bracket, which apparently poses higher tax burden especially among households with small and medium incomes. The aim of this paper is an analysis of the effects of a permanent proportional income tax reduction on the total economy as well as on the income situation of different household types, against the background of repeated public demands for tax reliefs resulting from increased tax burdens in recent years. The taxation scenario is not calculated on a microeconomic level but uses a macro-econometric approach instead, in order to give a broad overview over a wide variety of effects. By combining the macro-econometric input-output model INFORGE with the socio-economic system DEMOS containing household-specific income and consumption information we can assess how a simple fiscal measure would affect the economy, different household types, and inequality. It can be shown that a tax reduction has a positive aggregate effect throughout the economy in all years of the tax reform. Working households with high incomes profit most from simple tax cuts. Non-working households, however, are faced with comparably smaller positive deviations in income, which exacerbates the projected distance between household incomes and contributes to further increasing inequality.
E64|Fiscal Tool for Overcoming Poverty in Ukraine|In accordance with the UN research approximately 80 % of Ukrainians live below the poverty line. The article is concerned with the ways to induce increase in well-being of Ukrainian population through the fiscal tool. The structure of earnings of the Consolidated budget of Ukraine contains the analysis of a portion of mandatory payments, which cause tax burden on the nationals' income. It clears up the mechanism of application of the tax social privilege as a tool to protect socially vulnerable sectors of population. It finds that social standards in Ukraine disregard macroeconomic tendencies developing for years. The emphasis is made on the necessity to differentiate value added tax rates and to harmonize the rates of other taxes not directly influencing personal income, which are dominant in Ukraine. It describes the approaches to implementation of reduced value added tax rates, tax social privilege in withholding taxes from personal income and review of the minimum subsistence level that shall facilitate increase in income of the disadvantaged population.
E64|The effects of monetary policy shocks on inequality|This paper provides new evidence of the effect of conventional monetary policy shocks on income inequality. We construct a measure of unanticipated changes in policy rates—changes in short-term interest rates that are orthogonal to unexpected changes in growth and inflation news—for a panel of 32 advanced and emerging market countries over the period 1990–2013. Our main finding is that contractionary monetary policy shocks increase income inequality, on average. The effect is asymmetric—tightening of policy raises inequality more than easing lowers it—and depends on the state of the business cycle. We find some evidence that the effect increases with the share of labor income and is mitigated by redistribution policies. Finally, while an unexpected increase in policy rates increases inequality, changes in policy rates driven by an increase in growth and inflation are associated with lower inequality.
E64|Hungarian Energy Prices in an OECD Comparison|The goal of the study is to assess the effect of the utility cost reductions announced by the Hungarian government in 2012 on Hungarian energy prices. The effects are discussed in an OECD comparison. It is concluded that the government price control has resulted in a 15% steeper price reduction occurring 5-7 quarters earlier, compared to other OECD countries. The price reductions saved around 202 billion HUF for Hungarian households in 2014, which was around 0.63% of the GDP. If prices are compared to the monthly average wages however, household energy prices are still high in Hungary. One of the costs of the reduction in household energy prices was an increase in energy prices for industry: the industry/household price ratio is highest among OECD countries in the case of natural gas, and third highest for electricity.

Long waves and globalization influence on the economic policy of the USA and on personal income distribution in the country as well as economic, social and political consequences of such distribution are subjects of in-depth analysis. Adjustment of income distribution is presented in the article as a key problem to be solved by economics and form a part of the economic strategy adequate to the realities of the 21st century.

E64|Choques de Precios de Recursos Naturales, Asignaciones al Gasto Público y Posición Fiscal: una Ilustración con Bolivia|In this paper the impact of price shocks and the assignment of fiscal revenues on the fiscal stance of Bolivia were evaluated, whose public finances depend on hydrocarbons based on quarterly information: 2003-2011 (prevailing price boom) by using the methodology of structural vector autoregression (SVAR). We exemplified − from one case − to demonstrate that assignment of fiscal revenues to public spending is more relevant that natural shock prices on fiscal balances. At the same, the results show responses of desegregated public spending in terms of fiscal pressure that during boom times.
E64|Analysis of index prices of population consumption reveals a moderation through fiscal measures|This paper reflects the authors’ interest in the study of inflation. The analysis is based on specific indicators, such as the general evolution of consumer price indices, dynamics of indices for average net income, the increase of prices at the end of the interval considered (July 2016), price indexes per groups of goods and services, as outlined by national statistic classification. The indexes for food products and, respectively, non-food products, were analyzed in dedicated sections of the paper. At the end, the authors present the most valuable conclusions drawn from the study.
E64|Estimation of Income and Price Elasticities of Indiaâ€™s Trade in Services|Indiaâ€™s international trade in services benefited immensely from the change in policy stance from import substitution to export promotion in the post-1991 period. Services trade received a further boost when India became signatory to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. This article aims to estimate the income and price elasticities of Indiaâ€™s services trade during the post-WTO period, using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration, for the time period starting from 1996â€“97 Q1 (Quarter 1) to 2011â€“12 Q4 (Quarter 4). This study finds that the long-run income elasticity of services export is quite high and statistically significant, when the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries is taken as proxy for GDP of importing countries. However, the price elasticity of services export is found to be statistically insignificant. In case of services import, both the income and price elasticities of demand are found to be statistically significant, and services import is found to be more responsive to income than relative prices. The implications of the empirical findings for Indiaâ€™s current account deficit are also explored.
E64|Finansjalizacja cykli koniunkturalnych i jej konsekwencje dla polityki stabilizacyjnej|Celem artykułu jest wyjaśnienie zjawiska finansjalizacji cykli koniunkturalnych, wskazanie jego konsekwencji w postaci niezbędnych, zasadniczych zmian w sposobie prowadzenia polityki stabilizacyjnej i wreszcie nakreślenie dalszych, pożądanych kierunków badań, zarówno dotyczących teorii cyklu koniunkturalnego, jak i odnoszącychsię do gospodarki polskiej. Dla zrealizowania tego celu najpierw wyjaśnione zostaną pojęcie, geneza i przejawy finansjalizacji cykli koniunkturalnych, a następnie – opierając się na krytycznej analizie zarówno dotychczasowej polityki stabilizacyjnej, jak i pojawiających się w ostatnich latach propozycji jej zmian - podjęta zostanie próba zaproponowania „nowej” polityki stabilizacyjnej, uwzględniającej już w pełni zjawisko finansjalizacji cyklu koniunkturalnego. Finansjalizacja cykli koniunkturalnych oznacza radykalny wzrost znaczenia czynników finansowych w generowaniu i przebiegu wahań koniunktury gospodarczej. Z kolei spośród licznych wniosków dotyczących polityki stabilizacyjnej trzy wydają się najistotniejsze. Po pierwsze, najważniejszą funkcją polityki stabilizacyjnej powinna być prewencja w fazie wzrostowej cyklu koniunkturalnego, polegająca na zapobieganiu boomom kredytowym prowadzącym do powstawania bąbli spekulacyjnych na rynkach nieruchomości i/lub innych aktywów. Po drugie, w fazie recesji kluczowe znaczenie ma prawidłowe rozpoznanie charakteru tej recesji, gdyż od tego zależy, jak prowadzona powinna być polityka stabilizacyjna. Zwłaszcza tzw. recesje bilansowe wymagają specyficznych działań stabilizacyjnych. Po trzecie, polityka stabilizacyjna powinna być rozumiana szerzej niż to się tradycyjnie przyjmuje, tak iż powinno się mówić raczej o polityce gospodarczej.
E64|Devaluation of one's labor in labor-commodities-money-commodities-labor exchange as a cause of inequality growth|The inequality growth during the last quarter century is explained as caused by a decreasing labor-labor exchange rate, i.e. devaluation of one's labor in exchange for other's labor embodied in the commodities affordable for one's earnings. We show that the productivity growth allows employers to compensate workers with always a lower labor equivalent, i.e., in a sense increasingly underpay works, maintaining however an impression of fair pay due to an increasing purchasing power of earnings. This conclusion is based on the OECD 1990-2014 data for G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom and United States) and Denmark (known for the world least inequality). Finally, it is shown that the dependence between the degree of inequality and the degree of decline of the labor-labor exchange rate is statistically highly significant.
E64|How Is Tax Policy Conducted over the Business Cycle?|It is well known by now that government spending has typically been procyclical in developing economies but acyclical or countercyclical in industrial countries. Little, if any, is known, however, about the cyclical behavior of tax rates (as opposed to tax revenues, which are endogenous to the business cycle and, hence, cannot shed light on the cyclicality of tax policy). We build a novel dataset on tax rates for 62 countries for the period 1960-2013 that comprises corporate income, personal income, and value-added tax rates. We find that tax policy is acyclical in industrial countries but mostly pro cyclical in developing countries. (JEL E32, E64, H24, H25, O11, O23)
E64|Limitation Of Trade Margins As A Measure Of Food Price Controls: Experience Of Serbia| The aim of this study is to examine the influence of trade margins limitations to the prices of basic food products and general price level in the Republic of Serbia. Assessing the effects of the Regulation on the margins limitations from 2012, this paper considers the purpose of applying this instrument of indirect price control. In practice, prescribing a maximum trade margins can have positive effects on the food market stability only in the short term. It is therefore necessary a broader consideration of the factors of pricing on the food market and food inflation regulation by economic policy measures. A particular problem is the low degree of competition in the trade sector, which significantly affects the prices of the final products. Food price movements are very unstable, while their share in the consumer price index in the Republic of Serbia is significantly. It is logical to conclude that food prices have a dominant influence on inflation, so that the government actions in this area are justified.
E64|Demand of food energy, food availability and nutrient intake in Venezuela: Main changes and their nutritional implications| The main objective of this article is to analyze food demand in Venezuela, in order to examine the influence of real food prices, real income and its distribution, as well as other factors (such as domestic production, domestic agribusiness, land tenure, imports, shortages and food public networks), on the consumption of food and nutrients in Venezuela during the 1970-2014 period. Thus, based on official data and other secondary sources, a regression model using Ordinary Linear Square was estimated and some food and nutrition indicators were also constructed. Main findings show significant estimators and with expected signs for real prices, imports, domestic food production and real income and its distribution as explanatory variables of food demand in Venezuela. Nevertheless, future food and nutrition policies should focus on improving income distribution and stimulate domestic food production, rather than maintaining low prices and overvalued exchange rates, since such policy tools have discouraged domestic production and increased external dependence of Venezuela in terms of food security.
E64|Competitività e distribuzione funzionale nell'Eurozona|Nell’ultimo ventennio le economie europee hanno visto cambiare il contesto in cui sono immerse: alla pressione proveniente dalle grandi economie emergenti si è aggiunta quella dovuta alla cancellazione di meccanismi di isolamento nominale dai competitor interni all’Unione. Il CLUP si è così trasformato in un indicatore della rapidità di adattamento al nuovo contesto, diventando una delle metriche essenziali per definire modelli virtuosi e non. Il modello affermatosi come virtuoso è stato quello tedesco, con una riduzione sbalorditiva del CLUP. Per l’Italia, la critica più comune unisce la costatazione di una crescita della produttività anemica ad una crescita dei salari indipendente dalla produttività stessa. Da qui la richiesta di meccanismi di contrattazione decentrata, che consentano di legare i salari alla produttività. In questo lavoro mostriamo come in Italia le due principali componenti del CLUP (produttività e costo del lavoro) non si siano separate significativamente nell’ultimo ventennio. La peculiarità del modello tedesco, quindi, si identifica nel riuscire coniugare una crescita della produttività “francese” con una dinamica salariale “italiana”, con risultati immaginabili dal punto di vista della distribuzione del reddito. L’introduzione dei cambi fissi ha permesso di massimizzare il rendimento di questa strategia competitiva, consentendo incrementi della domanda estera proporzionali alla capacità del sistema di contrattazione di non ridistribuire gli aumenti di produttività. L’evidenza raccolta ma stimola una riflessione su alcuni temi del dibattito attuale. In particolare, va chiarito se è questo il modello di competitività che l’Europa vuole imporre a sé stessa, e se il decentramento della contrattazione salariale deve essere un meccanismo redistributivo strutturalmente penalizzante per il lavoro o, piuttosto, un meccanismo incentivante di condivisione dei risultati economici.
E64|Gender income disparity in the USA: analysis and dynamic modelling|We analyze and develop a quantitative model describing the evolution of personal income distribution (PID) for males and females in the U.S. between 1930 and 2014. The overall microeconomic model, which we introduced ten years ago, accurately predicts the change in mean income as a function of age as well as the dependence on age of the portion of people distributed according to the Pareto law. As a result, we have precisely described the change in Gini ratio since the start of income measurements in 1947. The overall population consists of two genders, however, which have different income distributions. The difference between incomes earned by male and female population has been experiencing dramatic changes over time. Here, we model the internal dynamics of men’s and women’s PIDs separately and then describe their relative contribution to the overall PID. Our original model is refined to match all principal gender-dependent observations. We found that women in the U.S. are deprived of higher job positions (work capital). This is the cause of the long term income inequality between males and females in the U.S. It is unjust to women and has a negative effect on real economic growth. Women have been catching up since the 1960s and that improves the performance of the U.S. economy. It will take decades, however, to full income equality between genders. There are no new defining parameters included in the model except the critical age, when people start to lose their incomes, was split into two critical ages for low-middle incomes and the highest incomes, which obey a power law distribution. Such an extension becomes necessary in order to match the observation that the female population in the earlier 1960s was practically not represented in the highest incomes. In the overall model, male population dominate in the top income range and the difference between two critical ages is masked. Gender versions of the refined model provide consistent quantitative description of the principal features in the male and female income distribution.
E64|How universal is the law of income distribution? Cross country comparison|The evolution of personal income distribution (PID) in four countries: Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the USA follows a unique trajectory. We have revealed precise match in the shape of two age-dependent features of the PID: mean income and the portion of people with the highest incomes (2 to 5% of the working age population). Because of the U.S. economic superiority, as expressed by real GDP per head, the curves of mean income and the portion of rich people currently observed in three chasing countries one-to-one reproduce the curves measured in the USA 15 to 25 years before. This result of cross country comparison implies that the driving force behind the PID evolution is the same in four studied countries. Our parsimonious microeconomic model, which links the change in PID only with one exogenous parameter - real GDP per capita, accurately predicts all studied features for the U.S. This study proves that our quantitative model, based on one first-order differential equation, is universal. For example, new observations in Canada, New Zealand, and the UK confirm our previous finding that the age of maximum mean income is defined by the root-square dependence on real GDP per capita.
E64|Spatial Comparisons Of Prices And Expenditure In A Heterogeneous Country: Methodology With Application To India|This study addresses two significant limitations in the literature on cross-country expenditure comparisons: (a) treatment of all countries, large and small, as single entities with no spatial differences inside the countries, and (b) use of Divisia price indices, rather than preference based “exact price” indices, in the expenditure comparisons. This paper proposes alternative preference consistent methods for estimating spatial price differences in a large heterogeneous country such as India. Unlike the conventional price indices, the use of demand systems based methods allows the incorporation of price induced substitution effects between items. The paper illustrates the usefulness of the methodology by using the “exact” spatial price indices, in conjunction with the inequality sensitive welfare measure due to Sen, to rank the Indian states and examine changes in ranking duirng one of the most significant periods in independent India. The results have methodological and empirical implications that extend much beyond India.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
E64|Cost-benefit framework for policy action to navigate food price spikes. FOODSECURE Working Paper No 33|This paper develops a cost-benefit framework for evaluating the impacts of price spikes and price volatility in food commodities ranging from allocative, political-economy and health to human welfare effects. After reviewing the research on impacts of price spikes and volatility, several policies to reduce volatility or its adverse impacts are classified and evaluated. The evaluation of policies is visualized according to different criteria that allow assessment of strengths and weaknesses of several policies.
E64|Employing Program-Terget Methods In The Foreign Sector Of The Russian Economy|According to economic theories, the application of program-target methods (PTMs)1 of governance and regulation at the industrial level, including the foreign sector of the economy, allows target objectives to be achieved at faster pace, with higher probability and cost-effectively.
E64|The stages and guidlines of restructuring of the system of trade mission of the Russian Federation|Trade missions (TM) in foreign states are an integral part of the system of promotion and protection of national economic interests and implementation of the country’s foreign economic policy, while by their status they are a part of the diplomatic mission of the Russian Federation abroad. In the past 10 years, efforts have been repeatedly taken to reform the system of TM in order to upgrade its efficiency for the country’s foreign complex as a whole. It is to be noted that principally different options ranging from a transfer of the foreign administrative apparatus of the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation to another agency to complete liquidation of that institution were considered.
E64|Экспорт-Импорт: Почти Синхронное Падение|Признаки импортозамещения наблюдаются только в сельском хозяйстве и пищевой промышленности: по отдельным позициям (мясо животных, мясо птицы, рыба, мука из зерновых культур) снижение объема импорта сопровождается ростом отечественного производства. Некоторый рост выпуска одновременно с падением импорта отмечается также по отдельным товарам низкой степени переработки (пластмассы в первичных формах; чугун). В то же время замещения импорта транспортных средств, сельхозтехники, потребительских товаров длительного пользования отечественными не происходит. Несмотря на девальвацию рубля, не произошло ожидаемого роста несырьевого экспорта. Незначительный рост физических объемов экспорта наблюдался только в группах товаров низкого и среднего уровня переработки.
E64|Measuring Income Inequality: An Application Of The Population Dynamic Theil'S Entropy|In this paper we use the index we call Population Dynamic Theil's Entropy to analyze as the income inequality varies on time. The index may consider both the inequality among the classes in which we assign the individuals and the inequality within each class. This inequality measure working in a dynamic way allows to forecast inequality in time. Besides it may capture not only changes in the wealth but also changes in the population composition. The earned results are relevant for adopting a social and economic policy of wealth distribution. We fulfilled the model with statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and we applied it to Mexico, Portugal and Spain. We picked up economic data about population, means and medians of the equivalised net income for the three countries. The data refer to years from 2004 to 2011.
E64|How should a government finance redistribution policies?|In OECD countries, redistribution policies are provided for young and old generations. Taxation of many kinds to finance the redistribution policy exists, just as redistribution policies of many kinds exist. Our paper sets a model with heterogeneous labor productivity for households and sectors of two types: a skilled sector and an unskilled sector. The model elucidates how the government should collect tax revenue for redistribution policies. Results show that the labor income tax can always shrink income inequality. However, the consumption tax increases wage inequality between skilled and unskilled sector. It is not always sufficient to shrink income inequality after redistribution, even if skilled workers increase. A corporate tax shrinks income inequality if intertemporal consumption is substitutive. Results show that the redistribution policy effects depend on how the government collects tax revenue.
E64|Zum politischen Machtwechsel in Griechenland. Die Parlamentswahlen von Januar 2015 aus einem kritischen Blickwinkel<BR>[The political Change in Greece. The parliamentary elections in January 2015 in a critical perspective]|"The Greek parliamentary elections in January .2015 led to a foreseeable change in government. The coalition government between the conservative Nea Dimokratia and of the socialist PASOK, become replaced. by a coalition government between the left wing coalition party SYRIZA and the extreme right-wing ANEL ( ""Independent Greeks""}, The cause for this radical political shift is located in the latent anger of the citizens in relation to the political elites of Greece and their politics in the last years. Logically this broad anger found now his expression in the ballot box. This described anger is related with the hard consolidation program taken by the creditors of Greece (EU, ECB, IMF) to restrain the country's fiscal crisis. The Intention of the restructuring program is to lead as soon as possible Greece out from the debt. In fact however the Result of this Politics is that around a quarter of the Greek population is drifted in poverty now. The rehabilitation target within a fairly short period, to promote competitiveness and make Greece more attractive as an investment location was coupled with massive wage cuts, pensions cuts , tax increases and more flexible working conditions. The new coalition government of SYRIZA and ANEL even though no more in the Position of a hard Opposition, promotes in the one hand a social Messianism in the sense of a liberation of the society of their distress and, on the other hand the hope of a settlement of the Greek dept by a conference of creditors or by favourable arrangements of the EU partner countries. The announcements of the new Government is also coupled with a whole set of ambitious programs for social and economic reconstruction and development of the country . In conclusion, this version of the political changes in Greece is also embedded in a obsession of the return in the good times of the past. In this sense, it can be assumed that this political change has no trend-setting character for Greece but represents a transition phase in an process of cushioning the social anger. However, it remains to be seen whether the consequences of this transition process for Greece are portable."
E64|Sustainable Institutions or Sustainable Poverty Targeting: The Case of Microfinance|Microcredit, being the most unique form of antipoverty intervention in terms of its methodology and outreach, has generated considerable amount of disagreements in recent times. While there may be more serious disagreements surrounding microcredit, this article addresses whether or not microcredit has the potential to alleviate poverty, and whether or not the conclusion derived to the first issue is sensitive to interest rate variations. Connecting the already established principles of economics, we show that there is every reason to believe that microcredit has the potential to change the fortunes of the poor communities. However, we also show that this change in fortune can be in any direction, depending on how costly the financial services of the microfinance institutions are felt by the poor.
E64|Impact of Wage Policy on Economic Growth in Transitive Countries and New Interpretation of the Phillips Curve|This paper considers the problem why minimal and average earnings differ dramatically in rich and new EU countries, as well as in Ukraine. Such phenomenon is usually explained by the difference among levels of labour productivity but the modern globalization processes have been doing the technology of production in many emerging economies very similar, especially in cases of the transnational companies’ influences. The practice of the Post-Socialist transitive countries also has been demonstrating such problem. While in the beginning of the reforms they were at more or less equal economic levels, very soon they were becoming a very differ by labour cost, and it led to significant differentiation of GDP per capita. For the short-term period it is difficult to explain this phenomenon by the cardinal changes in the physical labour productivity of existing productions, but it can be done taking into account the difference in the wages policy, and the innovation changing of technological structure of production. Mentioned problems have been analysed using the Phillips curve approach. The analysis shows the transitive countries which had undertaken considerable gradual increasing of labour cost and simultaneously stimulating of the innovation activities then later they have got a high dynamics of real GDP per capita.

E64|Is There Any Regional Price Disparity in Peninsular Malaysia?|This study examines whether there are significant differences in prices across four regions in Peninsular Malaysia, namely Northern, Central, Southern, and Eastern Peninsular Malaysia. Disaggregate monthly consumer price indices for twelve types of goods and services from July 2010 to February 2013 were analyzed. Based on the Levin and Lin (1993) panel unit root test, this study found statistical evidence of price convergence among the four zones for two-thirds of the price groups. Most importantly, price convergence exists for three major consumers’ expenditures items: Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages; Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas and Other Fuels; and Transport. Indeed, these eight price groups that converged comprised 83.6% of total consumer expenditures. Evidence of price convergence among these price groups suggests that Peninsular Malaysia markets are highly integrated. In addition, this study found that the half-life for the tradable goods is roughly 2-3 months and for nontradable goods about 5-10 months. These findings indicate that tradable goods prices adjust more rapidly than nontradable goods do.
E64|The World Economy in the Times of Financial Crisis and its Impact on European Energy Policy|Since 2007, globalization of the world economy has led to the expansion of the financial crisis. It affects the long-term international negative positions of EU members. They reacted to the new situation by carrying out structural reforms and by support of new adaptation programs. An important element of this process was the preparing of the convergence of the national energy policies in the framework of the Europe 20-20-20 program, which should remain one of the determining elements of their success in support of the international competitiveness of the EU.
E64|Reforma laboral, devaluación salarial y empleo: una perspectiva macroeconómica|El objetivo de este artículo es analizar la reforma laboral aprobada en 2012 desde una perspectiva macroeconómica, en el sentido de que nos interesa comprender su inserción en el contexto global de la estrategia de política económica que han aplicado las autoridades, y su impacto en el desempleo registrado por la economía española. Se ocupa principalmente del efecto que la reforma laboral ha tenido en el comportamiento agregado de los salarios, y su influencia, junto a otros elementos con los que se combina, como la austeridad fiscal, en la evolución del desempleo. Nuestra conclusión es que la caída de los salarios impulsada por la reforma laboral ha sido perjudicial para el empleo porque el efecto restrictivo sobre la demanda interna –que se suma al que se deriva de la austeridad fiscal- ha sido mayor que el impulso sobre la demanda externa.
E64|Does the demand regime matter over the medium run? Revisiting distributional issues in a portfolio framework under different exchange rate regimes|Is growth in capitalist economies wage-led or profit-led? Empirical studies have found conflicting results for different countries and periods. Possible reasons may include the endogeneity of distributional shares, differences in the monetary policy/exchange rate regimes across countries, and divergence between macro behavior in the short- and medium-runs. I theoretically explore these possibilities using a portfolio balance framework to keep track of asset stocks and wealth effects over time. With fixed exchange rates, the Central Bankâ€™s need to intervene in the asset market via official reserve transactions results in assigning a crucial role to the current account in constraining accumulation and output. The binding nature of this constraint vanishes with flexible exchange rates. Regardless of the exchange rate regime, the most important message that emerges is that, once we impose plausible constraints on dynamic behavior, the demand regime ceases to determine the effect of redistribution on the steady state levels of utilization, profit rates, capital, and wealth.
E64|Post-Keynesian Alternative Policies to Curb Macroeconomic Imbalances in the Euro Area|In this paper we outline alternative post-Keynesian policy recommendations addressing the problems of differential inflation, divergence in competitiveness and associated current account imbalances within the Euro area. We provide a basic framework in order to systematically address the related issues making use of Anthony P. Thirlwallâ€™s (1979, 2002) model of a â€œbalance-of-payments-constrained growth rateâ€ (BPCGR). Based on this framework, we outline the required stance for alternative economic policies and then we discuss the implications for alternative monetary, wage/incomes and fiscal policies in the Euro area as a whole, as well as the consequences for structural and regional policies in the Euro area periphery, in particular.
E64|The housing market: the impact of macroprudential measures in France|The housing market is a central macroprudential policy concern in France due to the significant proportion of residential property loans in bank balance sheets and the high weight of housing in household wealth. The surge in house prices at the start of the 2000s means we cannot rule out the risk of a bubble or a sharp downward correction, even though prices currently seem to be stabilising. However, if the evolution of house prices does start to pose a threat to financial stability, French authorities have access to a number of macroprudential tools that can be used to modify trends in factors such as the provision of housing loans. Using a model, this article attempts to examine the impact of measures which directly or indirectly influence loan interest rates and maturities, or the size of repayments in relation to household income. The empirical results show that these measures have a significant impact on trends in home lending, but a more limited impact on house prices due to the way variations in lending affect housing supply.
E64|How Does Fiscal Consolidation Impact on Income Inequality?|" type=""main""> In this paper, we assess the impact of fiscal consolidation on income inequality. Using a panel of 18 industrialized countries from 1978 to 2009, we find that income inequality significantly rises during periods of fiscal consolidation. In addition, while fiscal policy that is driven by spending cuts seems to be detrimental for income distribution, tax hikes seem to have an equalizing effect. We also show that the size of the fiscal consolidation program (in percentage of GDP) has an impact on income inequality. In particular, when consolidation plans represent a small share of GDP, the income gap widens, suggesting that the burden associated with the effort affects disproportionately households at the bottom of the income distribution. Considering the linkages between banking crises and fiscal consolidation, we find that the effect on the income gap is amplified when fiscal adjustments take place after the resolution of such financial turmoil. Similarly, fiscal consolidation programs combined with inflation are likely to increase inequality and the effects of fiscal adjustments on inequality are amplified during periods of relatively low growth. Our results also provide support for a non-linear relationship between inequality and income and corroborate the idea that trade can promote a more equal distribution of income."
E64|Inflating Away the Public Debt? An Empirical Assessment|We propose and implement a method that provides quantitative estimates of the extent to which higher-than-expected inflation can lower the real value of outstanding government debt. Looking forward, we derive a formula for the debt burden that relies on detailed information about debt maturity and claimholders, and that uses option prices to construct risk-adjusted probability distributions for inflation at different horizons. The estimates suggest that it is unlikely that inflation will lower the US fiscal burden significantly, and that the effect of higher inflation is modest for plausible counterfactuals. If instead inflation is combined with financial repression that ex post extends the maturity of the debt, then the reduction in value can be significant.
E64|Sticker Shock: The Causes of the Canada-US Price Differential|Whether they are buying dinnerware, diapers, or dairy products, Canadian consumers are becoming frustrated by the higher prices of similar goods in Canadian stores relative to US stores. The federal government has promised to introduce legislation to address alleged price discrimination in Canada relative to the US. But before the government acts, it should understand why Canadian prices are often higher and how much its own policies are the cause of relatively higher prices for Canadian consumers. The Canada-US price gaps at the retail and wholesale levels seem to closely track the Canada-US exchange rate. Using detailed data from 2004 through 2007 from a major grocery retailer operating in Canada and the US, I find that the Canada-US gaps in wholesale prices play a much greater role than gaps in retail margins in generating the price gaps consumers observe. There is less competition among manufacturers in Canada, as reflected in the fact that the average product category carried by the retailer has one-third fewer major brands in Canada than in the US. While more competition is associated with smaller increases in price gaps, there is little evidence to conclusively demonstrate what fraction of the wholesale price gap is due to a legitimately higher cost of operating in Canada. What can Canadian governments, especially the federal government, do to reduce the price gap between Canada and the US? The easiest thing Canadian governments can do if they want to reduce the Canada-US wholesale price gap is eliminate existing tariffs and supply-management policies that are responsible for the largest price gaps. The government should also consider building on recent actions that allow consumers to pay US prices for goods by increasing duty-free exemptions for travellers and postal shipments. As well, it should consider the role of certain taxes and regulations that could be raising the cost of doing business in Canada for manufacturers, distributors and retailers. If the federal government is serious about reducing prices for Canadians, it might want to first look at some of its own policies before tasking the Competition Bureau with investigating companies charging higher prices in Canada relative to the US.
E64|Minimum Wages, Capital Accumulation and Worker's Incomes|Using an intertemporal model of saving and capital accumulation we demonstrate that it is impossible for any binding minimum wage to increase the after-tax incomes of workers if the production function is Cobb-Douglas with constant returns to scale, or if there are no differences in ability among workers.
E64|Minimum Wages as a Redistributive Device in the Long Run|This paper analyzes long run outcomes resulting from adopting a binding minimum wage in a neoclassical model with perfectly competitive labour markets and capital accumulation. The model distinguishes between workers of heterogeneous ability and capitalists who do all the saving, and it entails – relative to the perfectly competitive benchmark - large output and employment losses (among the lowest-ability workers) from the imposition of moderately binding minimum wages. Yet, with linear taxation in place, all employed workers can become better-off provided that the unemployed receive limited welfare support. With progressive taxation in place, the minimum wage may garner political support (i.e. a majority) even when the unemployed receive substantial welfare support despite potential opposition from the capitalists and the unemployed, as well as from the very-high ability workers whose net-of-taxes incomes decline.
E64|Inflating Away the Public Debt? An Empirical Assessment|We propose and implement a method that provides quantitative estimates of the extent to which higher- than-expected inflation can lower the real value of outstanding government debt. Looking forward, we derive a formula for the debt burden that relies on detailed information about debt maturity and claimholders, and that uses option prices to construct risk-adjusted probability distributions for inflation at different horizons. The estimates suggest that it is unlikely that inflation will lower the US fiscal burden significantly, and that the effect of higher inflation is modest for plausible counterfactuals. If instead inflation is combined with financial repression that ex post extends the maturity of the debt, then the reduction in value can be significant.
E64|Excessive financial services CEO pay and financial crisis: Evidence from calibration estimation|The questions of whether there ever existed excessive risk-taking incentives from executive compensation in the financial industry, and whether top executives of financial services firms actually responded to such excessive incentives that eventually led to the crisis remain unanswered. The prior research has attempted to answer the second question, however, with conflicting evidence and without a clear definition of excessive. To answer the first question, this paper uses a numerical calibration approach to estimate the optimal level of CEO pay and derive the excessive compensation which provides excessive risk-taking incentives. We then examine the extent of excessive compensation in the financial industry relative to the non-financial industries during the 2000s and whether there were changes in compensation practices between the post Sarbanes–Oxley period and the pre-crisis period. We find mixed evidence in favor of the presence of higher excessive pay in the financial industry, and the CEO compensation practices remained largely unchanged over time. In addition, the relation between excessive pay and excessive risk-taking in the financial industry is somewhat weak, suggesting that CEO compensation might not be a major cause for the crisis in 2008.
E64|Evaluating labor market reforms: A normative analysis|This paper shows that a reform aimed at improving labor market flexibility is not necessarily welfare-enhancing. We adopt a New-Keynesian model enriched with search and matching frictions. We investigate the effects of institutional labor market reforms, described by a permanent change in firing costs and unemployment benefits. Improving labor market flexibility by cutting unemployment benefits is welfare-enhancing for households. On the contrary, cutting firing costs reduces welfare. We argue that real wage dynamics play a crucial role in the results. Furthermore, welfare effects tend to zero when the reform is pre-announced.
E64|Constrained or unconstrained price for debit card payment?|Retailers in the Netherlands and the U.K. can charge different prices for a commodity depending on whether cash or a debit card is used as payment, whereas retailers in the U.S. generally cannot. These two types of economies with and without a uniform pricing constraint for cash and debit card payments are compared in a microfounded monetary model. We place particular emphasis on the distinctive features of cash and debit cards as payment methods: the cost of a cash transaction for the seller is typically lower than that of a debit card, whereas the cost of cash holdings for the buyer is higher than that of a debit card. Our results suggest that a uniform pricing constraint makes cash-holding costs decline but consumption dispersion between the poor and the rich increase. Numerical examples show that the beneficial effect of the constraint dominates its negative effect.
E64|Austerity, inequality and politics|We analyze the effect of budget consolidation on income inequality in 17 OECD countries while controlling for political and ideological differences. We find that the impact of fiscal adjustments on the Gini coefficient does not depend on the political party in power, but on the type of government. Austerity measures by coalition governments significantly reduce income inequality when compared with single party and minority governments, even when they are successful or expenditure based. While coalition governments are less successful in reducing structural budget deficits, they perform much better in terms of addressing distributional concerns.
E64|The equalising power of internal immigration and the desertification process of southern Italy|According to some scholars, immigration can have a relevant role in the reduction of inequality. It has happened in the past and it may also happen in the future, as it is possible and desirable. However, migration in itself does not resolve definitely the issue of the inequalities and, moreover, in light of the recent studies on the effect of immigration, the exigency of additional in depth research on the impact of this phenomenon on regional disparities and income inequalities has become evident. The present paper faces these relevant issues, focusing on the regional impact of internal migration and attempting to demonstrate, with reference to the Italian case, how out-migration can increase income inequalities, thus hindering economic growth and exacerbating regional disparities, while immigration can reduce income inequalities and mitigate economic imbalances, according to the hypothesis of skilled immigration equalising, formulated in 2008 by Kahanec and Zimmermann.
E64|Financialisation and the financial and economic crises: The case of Germany|This study on Germany examines the long-run changes between the financial and the non-financial sectors of the economy, and in particular the effects of these changes on the macroeconomic developments that have led or contributed to the financial crisis starting in 2007 and the Great Recession in 2008/09. The first part provides some descriptive statistics on real GDP growth, on the growth contributions of the main demand aggregates, and the financial balances of the macroeconomic sectors since the early 1980s, and it classifies the German type of development as 'export-led mercantilist'. The second part examines the effects of an increasing dominance of finance since the early/mid 1990s on income distribution, investment in capital stock, consumption and the current account in more detail. The third part links the longrun developments with the financial and economic crisis and examines the causes of the quick recovery in Germany.
E64|Financialisation and the Financial and Economic Crises: The Case of Estonia|This study on Estonia examines the long-run changes between the financial and the non-financial sectors of the economy, and in particular the effects of financialisation on key variables / categories of the real economy as well as the their contribution to the financial crisis of 2007/08. The first part provides the background historical overview of last 20 years in Estonia with some descriptive statistics on GDP, growth contributions of the main demand aggregates, and the financial balances of the macroeconomic sectors since early 1990s, and it classifies the Estonian development path as following the ‘debt-led consumption’ one. The following chapters examine the effects of financialisation and their extent, accompanied by transition processes, on income distribution, financing of capital stock investments, consumption and current account dynamics in detail. The final parts deal with the elaboration on the causes of the financial and economic crisis as well as the policy response in Estonia.
E64|Financialisation and Economic and Financial Crises: The Case of Italy|This report on Italy examines the long-run changes between the financial and the real sectors of the economy, with a focus on the effects of financialization on the macroeconomic developments which drove to the 2007 financial crisis. The first part provides some analysis on the major GDP components and the financial balance pattern over the long period. The analysis allows to classify the nature of Italian growth as mainly consumer led type. The second part finds out the effects of an increasing dominance of finance since the beginning of the 1990s on income distribution, investment in capital stock, consumption and the current account. The third part links the long-run developments with the financial and economic crisis, showing how the consumer collapse and the public investment constraints explain how the recession is still charactering the Italian economy.

This paper interprets the German performance against the background of financialisation. After an examination of the pre-crisis demand and growth regime, the focus is on how financialisation has contributed to the German 'export-led mercantilist' regime.

E64|Coping with Imbalances in the Euro Area: Policy Alternatives Addressing Divergences and Disparities between Member Countries|"In this paper we outline alternative policy recommendations addressing the problems of differential inflation, divergence in competitiveness, and associated current account imbalances within the euro area. The major purpose of these alternative policy proposals is to generate sustainably high demand and output growth in the euro area as a whole, providing high levels of noninflationary employment, as well as preventing ""export-led mercantilist"" and ""debt-led consumption boom"" types of development, both within the euro area and with respect to the role of the euro area in the world economy. We provide a basic framework in order to systematically address the related issues, making use of Anthony Thirlwall's model of a ""balance-of-payments-constrained growth rate."" Based on this framework, we outline the required stance for alternative economic policies and then discuss the implications for alternative monetary, wage/incomes, and fiscal policies in the euro area as a whole, as well as the consequences for structural and regional policies in the euro-area periphery in particular."
E64|Russia’S Trading Partners: 100 Years After|During the Soviet period, Russia’s 1913 statistics were used as a reference point against which the achievements of the planned-administrative economy of the USSR were evaluated. However, the demise of the Soviet system has made this approach to the economic history of Russia rather obsolete and dysfunctional. As nature abhors a vacuum, economic historians have rapidly begun a quest for new approaches to that issue. In recent years, a number of studies have focused on analyzing the possible alternative routes for Imperial Russia’s economic development in the early 20th century1. It can be said with confidence that only a thorough analysis of Russia’s economic development over long stretches of ?? me can make it possible to identify the key stages and the turning points of her economic history, and to carry out relevant international comparative studies.
E64|The 2013 Results Of Global Trade In Goods And Services|In mid-April, the Secretariat of the World Trade Organization published an annual analytical review – The Global Trade in 2013 and Forecasts for 2014. After a Two-Year Recession, Moderate Growth in Trade is Expected in 2014 and 2015 – on development of the international trade. Also, the above document includes the preliminary statiscal data on the 2013 results of the global trade in goods and services by country and region.
E64|The Impact Of Politicaly Motivated Trade Sanctions On Russia’S Foreign Trade Sector|The specifi c situation at the current stage of development in the sphere of Russia’s foreign trade (including exports) has been shaped by the infl uences of the following three key factors: low activity on world markets due to the continuing uncertainty in the global economy; stagnation in Russia’s national economy and its major sectors; and the introduction of political sanctions and restrictions in the sphere of trade and economic exchange.

Так, по объемам поступивших прямых иностранных инвестиций (ПИИ) - 79 млрд долл. - страна в 2013 г. заняла третье место в мире, а по экспорту предпринимательского капитала (95 млрд долл.) – четвертую позицию2. В целом прирост мирового притока ПИИ в 2013 г. составил 9%, а вывоз – 5% .
E64|Decomposition Of The Population Dynamic Theil'S Entropy And Its Application To Four European Countries|In this paper we propose a modification of the Dynamic Theil's Entropy that considers the inequality in the whole population. We decompose it into three addends and we show how to compute them within a Markov model of income evolution. In this way the income inequality can be measured in the whole population and not only among a given number of classes in which the economic agents are classified. The model is implemented with statistics from Eurostat data applied on France, Germany, Greece and Italy. The results reveal different inequality behaviors characterizing the considered European countries.
E64|Can Social Protection Really Make A Significant Contribution To Poverty Reduction? The Case Of Romania|Most Romanians believe that the state should assume more responsibility for the welfare of everyone. Social protection must actually be understood in the broader framework of gradual and more alert transfer of the responsibility from the individual to the state level. If in the case of a minimal state the individuals would be forced to save to cope with unforeseen situations like job loss, disability or illness, in the case of a welfare state, which guarantees minimum incomes, these reasons fade. Individuals have increasing expectations from the authorities, and largely decline their capabilities of helping others through charity or philanthropy. In the light of the lack of confidence in the strength of private actions to support those in need, public solutions are expected to eliminate poverty through social protection programs. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the ability of social protection programs in Romania to help improve well-being among the most disadvantaged citizens of Romania and the costs associated with such objective.
E64|The Economics of Net Neutrality: Policy Issues|Although the net neutrality debate dates back to 2000s, it received recently renewed attention from IT specialists, broadband operators, content service providers and not ultimately from civil rights activists and policy makers. In this context the study of the impact of net neutrality regulations on the broadband market development is of great interest. The present article outlines the main pros and cons in the net neutrality debate and provides a synthetic analysis of net neutrality key problems and policy issues. Based on a relevant literature review, it gives an account of the potential economic impact of net neutrality regulations. The intended contribution of the present research is to provide additional arguments against price control on the ISPs market, emphasizing at the same time the role of increased transparency and increased competition between broadband operators in securing an open internet.
E64|Economic Policy in India: For Economic Stimulus, or for Austerity and Volatility?|"The implementation of economic reforms under new economic policies in India was associated with a paradigmatic shift in monetary and fiscal policy. While monetary policies were solely aimed at ""price stability"" in the neoliberal regime, fiscal policies were characterized by the objective of maintaining ""sound finance"" and ""austerity."" Such monetarist principles and measures have also loomed over the global recession. This paper highlights the theoretical fallacies of monetarism and analyzes the consequences of such policy measures in India, particularly during the period of the global recession. Not only did such policies pose constraints on the recovery of output and employment, with adverse impacts on income distribution; but they also failed to achieve their stated goal in terms of price stability. By citing examples from southern Europe and India, this paper concludes that such monetarist policy measures have been responsible for stagnation, with a rise in price volatility and macroeconomic instability in the midst of the global recession."
E64|Coping with imbalances in the Euro area: Policy alternatives addressing divergences and disparities between member countries|In this paper we outline alternative policy recommendations addressing the problems of differential inflation, divergence in competitiveness and associated current account imbalances within the Euro area. The major purpose of these alternative policy proposals is to generate sustainably high demand and output growth in the Euro area as a whole, providing high levels of non-inflationary employment, as well as preventing ‘export-led mercantilist’ and ‘debt-led consumption boom’ types of development, both within the Euro area and with respect to the role of the Euro area in the world economy. We provide a basic framework in order to systematically address the related issues making use of Thirlwall’s (1979; 2002) model of a ‘balance-of-payments-constrained growth rate’ (BPCGR). Based on this framework, we outline the required stance for alternative economic policies and then we discuss the implications for alternative monetary, wage/incomes and fiscal policies in the Euro area as a whole, as well as the consequences for structural and regional policies in the Euro area periphery, in particular.
E64|Pakistan’s Dependency on Imports and Regional Integration|With growing global and regional economic integration, Pakistan, too, is actively seeking to enhance regional economic cooperation; it has entered into various regional and bilateral trade agreements that encompass trade policies ranging from import substitution to export promotion. However, the country’s imports remain concentrated in a few product categories as well as in terms of origin. Despite several regional trade agreements, Pakistan has not been able to source its imports from regional trading partners. This stems from constraints relating to trade facilitation, regulatory frameworks, and physical infrastructure. Our empirical analysis shows that, while changes in real income and import prices have a significant effect on import demand in the long run, variations in the domestic price level do not. If Pakistan is to grow at 7–8 percent per annum as envisaged in official development plans, it will continue to experience strong growth in imports to meet its rising industrial and consumer needs. Pakistan needs to develop a strategy to use regional integration schemes as a platform for enhancing trade ties in both imports and exports. This will ensure greater trade and investment links with its regional trading partners, helping to lower the transaction costs of trade and boosting economic growth.
E64|Stylized Facts on the Interaction between Income Distribution and the Great Recession|There are several narratives connecting the financial crisis - as well as the Great Depression of the 1930s - with the functional or personal income distribution and its pre-crisis movements. The paper investigates whether this claim can be supported with evidence showing that the crisis was deeper in countries in which incomes were more polarized or where wage shares were lower. Empirical evidence for 37 mainly industrialized countries does not generally support the hypothesis that either the level of or the change in distribution was closely linked to the performance of a country during the crisis. Some evidence shows a tentatively improved performance if wage shares as well as polarization decreased. Declining wage shares could have increased the resilience of firms in the crisis; the lower income differences may have bolstered consumption of domestic goods. The existence of more compelling evidence for the impact of distribution on the crisis may have been diluted by the global character of economies. Savings in one country or region can lead to low interest rates as well as financial or real investment in other regions via international capital flows which might stop abruptly in the crisis.
E64|The new national consumer price index|The new national consumer price index (NCPI) on which the health index is based came into effect in January 2014. It underwent full revision, as it does every eight years. This brings to an end the significant obsolescence of the index, in which the weighting scheme increasingly failed to reflect real consumer behaviour, a fact which had implications for the inflation figures. On this occasion, various methodological adjustments were introduced, most of them corresponding to the changes announced previously during 2013. The most important innovation is the switch to the use of a chained index instead of a fixed base. That decision will make it easier not only to implement gradual methodological improvements in future, but above all to adapt the weighting scheme annually and thus regularly reflect observed changes in consumption habits. The set of changes will influence the inflation figures according to the NCPI and the inflation gap between that and the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP). Although the NCPI methodology has been brought closer to that of the HICP, the two indexes are likely to continue to display divergent movements owing to the remaining methodological differences, particularly between the weighting schemes, though the effect will be smaller than in recent years.
E64|The Foley Liquidity / Profit-Rate Cycle Model Reconsidered|In this paper, we reconsider the Foley model of Liquidity / Profit-Rate Cycles where such cycles are generated as bifurcations from initially attracting steady states if a parameter of the model crosses a critical value, for example the growth rate of money supply as in the Foley paper. We employ a slightly modified version of the Foley model and provide sufficient conditions for the local asymptotic stability of its balanced growth path. A second theorem then shows the existence of a Hopf-bifurcation derived from such a stable situation by decreasing the growth rate of liquidity to a sufficient degree. The generated cycles are studied from the numerical point of view in addition.
E64|Tax Power and Economics|The article is divided into two parts. The first describes Hayek's critique of the progressive tax system since its conception of social order and fiscal rationality. Hayek thinks about a key principle in liberal democracies: majority rule. And stretching comments to the influence of morality in taxation decisions. The second is aimed at analyzing the reception of Hayek in constitutional economics Brennan and Buchanan. However, in the interpretation of tax policy has decisively if governments reflect a tyrant or benevolent Leviathan State. The Fiscal Constitution must be accompanied by a monetary constitution. Both constitutional forms are related and prevent leviathánico power of governments, especially when they are short stay. Although, for the authors, the Fiscal Constitution has important implications for monetary constitution.

In particular a positive reflections on the progressive tax is added.
E64|Thomas Piketty's Capital in the 21st Century|"Thomas Piketty's ""Capital in the 21st century"" has been the most important book economy in recent times. Its aim integrates the debate theories of growth, income distribution, inequality and differences between the extremes income and income of the majority. The work predicts a slow increase in the share of capital income and inequality. His proposal for a global tax on capital is a way to evaluate such tendencies."
E64|Mid-term Effects of the Flat Rate Personal Income Tax in Hungary|The objective of the paper is to examine whether the advantages and disadvantages mentioned in the literature of the flat rate income tax could be observed in Hungary. Personal income tax data provided by the Hungarian National Tax and Customs Administration was used to check the arguments. It was found that the flat tax indeed favours richer taxpayers, and because of the family tax credits, it heavily favours families with children. Tax revenues declined as tax rates were cut, while the GDP growth rate was close to stagnant. Both of these developments go against the expectations of the flat tax supporters, although it has to be mentioned that the changes were made in the midst of a European- and world-wide depression, which could have distorted the pure effects of the new tax code. Although in many countries the flat rate tax was a positive signal for investors boosting foreign direct investments, the Hungarian government introduced extra taxes on some of the transnational companies in order to balance the budget (and compensate for the lost personal income tax revenues), which meant that there was a decline in the mood of the investors. There is some indication that some illegal activities are shifted to the legal domain: the ratio of those tax reporters who earned an annual income of HUF 2 million or higher has gone from 62.5% to 66.6% in the period of 2010-12.
E64|Segmented Labor Markets and the Distributive Cycle: A Roadmap towards Inclusive Growth|The paper builds on the Goodwin (1967) model which describes the distributive cycle of capitalist economies whereby mass unemployment is generated periodically through the conflict about income distribution between capital and labor. We add to this model a segmented labor market structure with fluid, latent, and stagnant components. The model exhibits a unique balanced growth path which depends on the speeds with which workers are pushed into or out of the labor market segments. We investigate the stability properties of this growth path with segmented labor markets and find that, though there is a stabilizing inflation barrier term in the wage Phillips curve, the interaction with the latent and stagnant portions of the labor market generates potentially (slowly) destabilizing forces if policy measures are absent that regulate these labor markets. We then introduce an activating labor market policy, where government in addition acts as employer of last resort thereby eliminating the stagnant portion of the labor market, whilst erecting benefit systems that partially sustain the incomes of workers that have to leave the floating/latent labor market of the private sector of the economy. We show that such policies guarantee the macrostability of the economy’s balanced growth path.
E64|The relationship between dynamic price and dynamic unemployment: the case of the Central European-3 and the Baltic Tigers|Convention specifies the relationship between price and unemployment in terms of the Phillips curve (PC) where inflation and the rate of unemployment are correlated. This paper uses a variant of the PC that is more consistent with the relationship between price and output as depicted in the aggregate supply (AS) curve. The relationship between price and unemployment using convention and its variant is tested on Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the pooled data. The Expectations Augmented (EA) is able to track a negative relation between inflation and unemployment better than the New Keynesian (NK) is able. Within the EA runs, the convention is able to track the same negative relation better than the variant, but one has to be cautious given the implied results.
E64|Politica dei redditi. La linea brutale e la linea civile|"The author discusses the policy of keeping (or not opposing) a certain level of unemployment as a means to promote wage deflation, and identifies it as the ""brutal"" way to pursue macroeconomic stability. By contrast, Sylos Labini identifies the cost of living and productivity as two other determinants of the wage level, and thus proposes a rich policy of structural reforms as the most civilised way to obtain the same result."

The paper also discusses FM's interpretation of PSL's oligopoly theory, as well as their collaboration (and differences) on policy issues, such as their opposition to the 100% money wage indexation adopted in Italy from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s.

E64|Competitiveness Disparities Behind the Economic Crisis in the Euro Area|Abstract The euro area economic crisis is largely a result of the competitiveness disparity between Germany and the rest of the euro area. The wage moderation in Germany has considerably improved its competitiveness in relation to the rest of the euro area. Wage policy has been deflationary in Germany in the 2000s in the sense that real wage growth has fallen below labour productivity growth. In the rest of the euro area wage policy has been inflationary since real wage growth has exceeded labour productivity growth. The input-output price model implies that due to the lower wage inflation the unit cost of production in industry has grown much less in Germany than in the rest of the euro area. Restoring competitiveness necessitates a clear wage inflation halt in the rest of the euro area in the coming years.
E64|MGNREGS in Jharkhand|Employment guarantee programs have often been used by developing countries to ensure livelihood of the poorer sections of the society without recourse to physical or human capital. India started the world’s largest such program in 2005 in the form of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in the background of jobless growth during most part of the nineties, stagnation or even decline in agricultural productivity, and increased migration of poor people from rural to urban areas. The scheme was devised as a public work programme with a rights based approach to development, providing income security through guaranteed wage employment. Present paper analyses the Indian experience by examining the working of the scheme in a lagging region, where supposedly the scheme should be both necessary and beneficial.
E64|Inflation-Industrial Growth Nexus in India â€“ A Revisit Through Continuous Wavelet Transform|We study the inflation-industrial growth nexus in India using the methodology of wavelets. More specifically, cross wavelet power spectrum, cross wavelet coherency, and wavelet phase angle, tools of Continuous Wavelet Transform are used to unravel time and frequency dependent relationships between industrial growth and inflation. It is shown that inflation and industrial growth are negatively related at low frequencies having time dynamics of eight to sixteen months, with inflation leading industrial growth for almost whole of the time period considered.
E64|BJP’s Demographic Dividend in the 2014 General Elections: An Empirical Analysis|The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept the 2014 General Elections in India and emerged as a single party with absolute majority, a result not witnessed since 1984. Not only did it win a majority of seats, it also managed to increase its vote share in almost all states between 2009 and 2014. Using state-level data, we show that BJP’s extraordinary poll results relied crucially on attracting young, especially first time, electors.
E64|Re-Distribution, Aggregate Demand, and Growth in an Open Economy: The Crucial Interaction of Portfolio Considerations and External Account Constraints|A large body of literature inspired by the seminal contribution of Marglin and Bhaduri (1988) has debated the distributional determinants of demand and growth. A general conclusion has been that open economy considerations weaken the potential for a wage-led growth regime. How- ever, this literature has largely ignored asset portfolio considerations and the stock and flow interactions that result from the feedback from savings to wealth and from wealth to the current account. This paper develops a theoretical framework that speci.es a fuller system of (instantaneous) flow equilibria embedded in a medium-run framework with stable steady state stocks of real and financial assets. The balance of payments constraint that results ensures that simply raising the wage does not yield a higher stock of real capital. A lower mark-up may increase the steady state stock of capital but only through the relative price channel. These results are much stronger than those derived by existing literature, and more importantly, emerge regardless of whether the demand regime is wage-led or profit-led in autarky.
E64|Recent macroeconomic trends in emerging economies and implications for development - Country Study: Brazil|The paper reviews the sluggish growth and inclusive developments of the Brazilian economy in the last decade. The first section analyzes the macroeconomic performance pointing export growth as the engine of growth. The second evaluates social policies and their relationship with the improvements in the labor market. The third examines Brazilian policy reactions to the global crisis that managed to recover consumption but failed to sustain investment and growth. The discussion of challenges for a sustainable development concludes the paper. Investment in education and infrastructure are consensual policy advices but there are plenty of disagreements and controversies with regards to industrial policies, financing strategies and the role to be played by the public sector.
E64|Fiscal Policy and Rebalancing in the Euro Area: A Critique of the German Debt Brake from a Post-Keynesian Perspective|The German debt brake is often regarded as a great success story and has therefore served as a role model for the Euro area and itâ€™s Fiscal Compact. In this paper we fundamentally criticise the debt brake. Firstly, we show that it suffers from serious shortcomings and that its success is far from certain even from a mainstream point of view. Secondly, we show that, from a Post-Keynesian perspective, the debt brake completely neglects the requirements for fiscal policies of member countries in a currency union like the Euro area. It will prevent fiscal policy from contributing to the necessary rebalancing in the Euro area. Thirdly, we show that alternative scenarios, which could avoid the deflationary pressures of the German Debt Brake on domestic demand and contribute to internally rebalancing the Euro area, are extremely unlikely as they would have to rely on unrealistic shifts in the functional income distribution and/or investment and savings behaviour in Germany.
E64|Finance-dominated capitalism in Germany – deep recession and quick recovery|Germany’s recent export successes and the fast recovery from the 2007 -2009 crisis made it Europe’s “economic superstar” in public opinion. This paper interprets the German performance against the background of financialisation. After an examination of the pre-crisis demand and growth regime, the focus is on how financialisation has contributed to the German ‘export-led mercantilist’ regime. The paper focuses subsequently on the determinants of the German current account balance, to then interpret the development of Germany during the financial and economic crisis and the causes for the quick recovery in light of the previous analysis.
E64|Financialisation and the Financial and Economic Crises: The Case of Germany|This study on Germany examines the long-run changes between the financial and the non-financial sectors of the economy, and in particular the effects of these changes on the macroeconomic developments that have led or contributed to the financial crisis starting in 2007 and the Great Recession in 2008/09. The first part provides some descriptive statistics on real GDP growth, on the growth contributions of the main demand aggregates, and the financial balances of the macroeconomic sectors since the early 1980s, and it classifies the German type of development as ‘export-led mercantilist’. The second part examines the effects of an increasing dominance of finance since the early/mid 1990s on income distribution, investment in capital stock, consumption and the current account in more detail. The third part links the long-run developments with the financial and economic crisis and examines the causes of the quick recovery in Germany.
E64|Measuring Inflation Expectations|To conduct monetary policy, central banks around the world increasingly rely on measures of public inflation expectations. In this article, we review findings from an ongoing initiative at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York aimed at improving the measurement and our understanding of household inflation expectations through surveys. We discuss the importance of question wording and the usefulness of new questions to elicit an individual’s distribution of inflation beliefs. We present evidence suggesting that consumers update their inflation expectations in response to new information and that information dissemination may lead to more informed and reliable reporting of inflation expectations. Finally, we report on a financially incentivized experiment suggesting that expectations surveys are informative and that respondents generally act on their stated beliefs in a way consistent with expected utility theory.
E64|Dinámica inflacionaria, persistencia y formación de precios y salarios|"Los artículos de este libro están dividos en tres temas: dinámica y persitencia de la inflación; formación de precios; y rigideces salariales. Estos fueron realizados en el contexto de la investigacion conjunta ""Dinámica inflacionaria, persistencia y formación de precios y salarios"". El adecuado conocimiento de la dinamica inflacionaria es esencial para la modelación y formulación de la política monetaria. La primera parte del libro se enfoca en identificar cambios generales en la tendencia de la inflación y en el grado de persistencia inflacionaria. La segunda parte, en la formación de precios desde una perspectiva macroeconómica entre otros, utilizando microdatos de consumo. Finalmente, la tercera parte estudia las rigideces de precios, también desde la visión macroecoómica, con microdatos de una serie de encuestas."
E64|La reforma tributaria de 1935 y el fortalecimiento de la tributación directa en Colombia|En este artículo se estudian los elementos más relevantes de la reforma tributaria propuesta y puesta en práctica por el presidente Alfonso López Pumarejo en 1935, durante su primera gestión de gobierno. La reforma fue implementada fundamentalmente mediante la Ley 78 de 1935 y complementada por medio de la Ley 63 de 1936. Se trata de uno de los importantes cambios realizados durante el período de la denominada “revolución en marcha”. Uno de los elementos más relevantes de la reforma fue la consolidación y fortalecimiento de los impuestos directos en Colombia utilizando como instrumentos principales el incremento del impuesto a la renta y la creación de los impuestos al exceso de utilidades y al patrimonio. Los nuevos recursos fiscales obtenidos constituyeron una importante fuente de financiamiento del programa integral de reformas y políticas propuestaspor el Gobierno lopista.
E64|Do Institutionalists and post-Keynesians share a common approach to Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)?|Are Institutional and post-Keynesian economists converging on a shared approach to understanding Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)? The literature suggests growing recognition that post-Keynesians and Institutionalists share a common intellectual history, conceptual frameworks, and overlapping professional memberships. For this reason, Post-Keynesian Institutionalism (PKI) has emerged as a unifying approach to heterodox economics. In this review of the Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) literature, I explore the degree to which this PKI convergence extends, or fails to extend, to the historical, theoretical, and policy issues surrounding MMT. The point of this paper is to delineate where scholars from these traditions agree, where they specifically disagree, and to explore whether or how these disagreements may be ameliorated with respect to MMT.
E64|Austerity in the euro area: the sad state of economic policy in Germany and the EU|The euro area is currently going through its worst period of recession and economic stagnation since the Great Depression and World War II. The article tries to give an impression of the extraordinary degree of fiscal austerity and the devastating economic effects it has already had and must be expected to have in the near future. In addition it is argued that both the lack of economic justification and the devastating consequences of the fiscal policies currently executed should have been absolutely obvious even from a mainstream perspective. Therefore the sad state of economic policies in the euro area is that it did not even follow moderate mainstream proposals but instead seemed to rely on radical and outdated theoretical or purely ideological foundations. Germany as the most economically and politically influential member state of the euro area seems to be most infected with such radical ideas.
E64|Economic theory and policy: a coherent post-Keynesian approach|This contribution focuses on a coherent new way of thinking about the macroeconomy in terms of both economic theory and economic policies. The central bank should focus on financial stability; for fiscal policy in the short term and in the long term to address demand issues is very important. Interest rate policy should be such that the real rate of interest is in line with trend rate of growth in the economy. Fiscal and monetary policies, though, should be coordinated closely. Major central bank cooperation and intervention in the foreign exchange market is necessary to control the exchange rate. Regional and industrial policies to create the required capacity are important, along with incomes policies, to contain inflationary/deflationary pressures. Distribution of income and wealth is another important policy dimension in view of its importance in terms of the great recession.
E64|Contribución efectiva al Impuesto Sobre la Renta en personas del régimen general|En esta investigación se analiza la contribución efectiva de las personas morales del régimen general al Impuesto Sobre la Renta en México, a partir de la comparación entre las utilidades netas y el impuesto pagado por las empresas con mayor capitalización en el país, es decir, las registradas en la Bolsa Mexicana de Valores. Asimismo, se propone una metodología para determinar la tasa efectiva de impuesto pagado, se cuantifica la magnitud de las deducciones autorizadas y se construyen escenarios de recaudación potencial. Los resultados de la investigación sugieren la fragilidad de la Ley del Impuesto Sobre la Renta en el sentido de que incluye una amplia gama de beneficios fiscales y deducciones autorizadas, sin que esté confirmado que estos beneficios generan compensaciones efectivas visibles en las principales variables macroeconómicas.
E64|Inflation and Monetary Policy in Russia in February 2013|In February 2013 the consumer price index made 0.6% (as compared with 0.4% in February 2012), which is less than in January of the current year by 0.4 p.p. In March infl ation has also increased: by the results of 18 days of the month, the CPI made 0.3%. As a result, the infl ation rate in annual terms reached 7.3%. According to the tentative estimates of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia, in February the net outfl ow of capital from the country amounted to about $6bn (against $14–16bn from the beginning of the year).
E64|The 2012 Results Of The International Trade In Goodsand Services In And Prospects Of Its Development|In mid-April 2013, the Secretariat of the World Trade Organization (WTO) published an annual analytical review on the basis of the results of development of the international trade in 2012 and the prospects of its development in 2013. The above document includes as well the initial statistical data on the global trade in goods and services by the country in 2012.
E64|Innovative Exports Promotion In Russia: Role Of Intellectual Property Rights Protection|Diversification of innovation-based foreign economic relations has become significant with global economic transition to the sixth technological mode. At the current stage, expansion of export of high-technology products (goods, services, technologies) is a key element to socio-economic development and a factor of international competitiveness of the state.
E64|Main Trends In The Russian Export Of Direct Investment|Despite uncertainty in the global economy and domestic problems of the Russian economy, the export of direct investments from Russia keeps growing. Generally, a large-scale withdrawal of the enterprise capital from the country has a contradictory – both positive and negative – effect on national reproduction processes and is ambiguously assessed by Russian scientific and research community so it requires an in-depth analysis.
E64|Inflation and Monetary Policy|Significant slowdown in the growth rate in prices for non-food goods and maintained prices for commercial services at the level of the preceding month resulted in the fact, that the baseline inflation slowed down from 0.5 % per month in October to 0.3% in November (against 0.4% in November 2011). In December, due to the growth of consumer activity at the background of the New Year Eve, growth rate of consumer prices increased: consumer price index as of 17 days of the month made 0.3%, having matched the indicator of the same period of preceding year. As a result, the cumulative inflation since the beginning of the year amounted to 6.3% as of December 17 (compared to 6% in 2011). Herewith, from December 11, 2012 the Bank of Russia has again increased the interest rate on the RF CB ruble deposits on fixed terms by 0.25 p.p. up to 4.5% and decreased the rate of the RF Central Bank ruble transactions “currency swap” by the same amount to 6.25%.
E64|Inflation and Monetary Policy|In December the pre-Christmas growth in foodstuffs prices and in transport tariffs provoked acceleration of inflation, which made 0.5% within the month (against 0.4% in December 2011). As a result, by the end of 2012 the inflation rate made 6.6%, having matched the recent official forecast of the RF Central Bank. In January 2013 the increased excise duties and continued seasonal growth in prices for fruit and vegetables resulted in significantly accelerated growth rate of consumer prices: over the first three weeks of the month it amounted to 0.6%. In 2012 the monetary base in broad definition remained virtually unchanged, but by the end of the year it has significantly increased: only in the last month of the year it increased by 19%. Therefore, within the year its growth rate made 14% (against 5.5% in 2011). In the Q4 2012 capital outflow from the country has accelerated, having reached $9.4bn. After the Bank of Russia has reviewed the balance of payments for the first three quarters of 2012, the tentative estimate of the net outflow of capital as of 2012 results amounted to $56.8bn, as compared with $80.5bn in 2011.
E64|Inflation and Monetary Policy in January 2013|In January 2013 the seasonal growth in prices for fruit and vegetables, as well as the planned in¬crease in excise duties have contributed to inflation by two-fold, as compared with December 2012: CPI for the month made 1%. As a result, the inflation rate in annual terms has reached 7.1%. In February, the growth rate of consumer prices has slowed down: in 18 days of the month it made 0.3%. According to tentative estimates of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia, the net outflow of capital from the country at the beginning of 2013 has accelerated, having reached in January $8-10bn. On February 12 the Bank of Russia has decided to establish a uniform rate for mandatory reserves for all categories of liabilities to credit institutions in the amount of 4.25%.

E64|Top Heavy: A Study on Wealth Distribution in Malaysia|This article uses data from Household Income Survey (HIS) to provide an overview of the structure and distribution of wealth in Malaysia, providing estimates of the mean and median levels of household per-capita wealth by asset classes and estimates of the degree of inequality of wealth holdings. The data confirm that wealth is unequally distributed and also that it is much more unequally distributed than income. The study also finds that a sizeable number of Malaysians do not possess any wealth and that more than half do not own any financial assets. Most of their wealth is in the form of property assets, with minimal ownership of financial assets. Quantile regression analysis indicates that wealth is significantly related to a range of factors including age, occupation, education, marital status, ethnicity, and income. It is expected that the inequality gap will remain wide, unless there are reforms in the educational system, the taxation regime, and in poverty-alleviation programs.
E64|Do You Mind if I Round?: Eliminating the Penny A Structural Analysis|For decades, economists have debated the price-rounding effect on the economy if the penny is eliminated. Deviating from the bulk of the literature, which typically considers case-studies with empirical simulations and data manipulation, I evaluate a multiple household, deterministic model with endogenous currency production. My findings suggest that the elimination of the smallest unit of currency has a “nickel-and-dime” effect on the economy, regardless of the rounding policy. This structural model is constructed and calibrated to emulate a “worst-case scenario”, but it is also robust to the empirical results in the literature.
E64|The crisis of finance-dominated capitalism in the euro area, deficiencies in the economic policy architecture, and deflationary stagnation policies| In this paper, the euro crisis is interpreted as the latest episode of the crisis of finance-dominated capitalism. Against this background, the euro crisis and the economic policy reactions of European governments and institutions are examined. It is shown that deflationary stagnation policies have prevailed since 2010 and have meant massive real gross domestic product (GDP) losses and some improvements in price competitiveness of the crisis countries, but considerable and persistent current account imbalances, reductions in government deficit-GDP ratios with continuously rising trends in government gross debt-GDP ratios, a further recession for the euro area as a whole, the risk of deflationary stagnation in major parts of the euro area, and an increasing threat of a final collapse of the euro as a currency. Therefore, an alternative macroeconomic policy approach tackling the basic contradictions of finance-dominated capitalism and the deficiencies of European economic policy institutions and economic policy strategies, in particular, the lack of an institution convincingly guaranteeing public debt and the lack of a stable and sustainable financing mechanism for acceptable current account imbalances, is outlined.
E64|Measuring inflation : the stakes and the state of play|The major overhaul of the national consumer prices index (NCPI), upon which the health index is based, is an opportunity to adjust the methodology to make inflation measurement more accurate and ensure that the index is representative. The new index will enter into force in January 2014. In addition to the changes made in January 2013 at the government’s behest relating to the effect of seasonal sales and to heating oil prices, certain other changes are to be recommended. They include switching to a chain index, which allows for weightings to be adjusted more frequently (annually), taking better account of quality changes and substitution effects, switching to scanner data for products sold in supermarkets, and more accurately reflecting trends in the telecoms market. Lastly, pending a decision on whether or not to include owner-occupied housing costs in the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP), some improvements can already be made to the current index of real rents in order to more accurately reflect rental market swings. Some of the changes being considered for the NCPI were made in 2013 to the HICP, which means that in certain cases it is possible to estimate their impact on NCPI inflation, were they to be adopted in 2014. However, the overall effect will also depend on how the new index is introduced. As in 2006, the Index Commission will have to set the conversion coefficient enabling the transition from the old to the new index.
E64|An income gap theory and its effects on unemployment and economic growth|An Income Gap Theory and it effects on Unemployment and Economic Growth By Drs Kees De Koning Abstract An income gap is often described as the difference in incomes between the rich and poor. This is a relative gap. In economies a different income gap can occur which can be defined as the absolute income gap. Such a gap emerges when collectively individual households show an income shortfall and become unable to buy all goods and services available in an economy. The principal cause why such a gap can emerge is to be found in the use of savings. Savings -financial assets- are turned into financial liabilities -loans or other commitments to governments, banks, companies or other individuals. If any of these households do not return such savings for the full amount or only with a lower return a financial loss will occur. The net worth of all individual households - their equity base- will be written down. In this study the focus has been on the U.S. and the U.K. In 2004 in both countries the respective governments plus their individual households had accelerated their borrowing levels from earlier years to the highest levels since 1996. In the U.S. 17.41% of the GDP value was financed by the increase in government’ plus individual households’ borrowings in 2004. In the U.K. the level was 14.50% in the same year. Government’ and individual household debt has been added up for the simple reason that individual households are ultimately responsible to service both debts. More than 70% of individual households’ borrowings are used for buying a home. When the pace of borrowing accelerates, the volume of house building usually can not keep pace with the money flows and home prices start to increase rapidly. This happened in 2003 and 2004 and in the years in the run up to 2008. Of course incomes did not grow at the same speed as these borrowing levels. Banks did invent all kinds of loan features to get low income families on the property ladder. They also sold a substantial part of the risks to outside investors. The results were enormous loan losses, which translated in even bigger losses to the net worth of individual households in 2008. In the U.S in 2008 these households lost the equivalent of 110% of the value of the U.S. GDP from their net worth. In the U.K. the loss was about 90% of the U.K.’s GDP in the same year. Individual households did not mean to lose these amounts, however they were at the receiving end of the loss making activities of banks and the financial sector. Individual households were generally speaking not the gamblers. The effects of such equity losses were substantial. Job losses occurred, which meant income losses; lower labour force participation rates showed up which again caused additional income losses; wages settlements did no longer keep pace with inflation levels. This also caused income losses. Furthermore individual households started to save more and repay their outstanding home mortgage debt, which caused another drain on economic growth. The net equity loss caused a substantial income loss to individual households, further aggravated by the rapidly increasing government debt situations. When income levels are down, one usually looks at the savings levels. However the main savings element is pension funds and they are currently prevented by government rules for turning some of the individual households’ equity into cash incomes at times when the income gap occurs. There are ways to counteract and prevent the absolute income gap occurring. The key is to act as fast as possible as lost individual incomes from jobs cannot be recouped in future years. Pension funds can help as they currently have accumulated funds both in the U.S. and the U.K. outstripping total financial liabilities of individual households. Long term fixed rates mortgages can help, which if granted through one major vehicle, can help slow down or speed up mortgage lending in a country. The key to economic growth can be found, but also has to be found, through considering what happened and happens to the collective of individual households, their equity and income position and their actions taken by them and for them. What governments, central banks, banks and companies do is all reflected in the net equity base and income developments of individual households. Economic studies should start with individual households rather than focussing so strongly on governments, central banks and banks.
E64|Analysis of external factors affecting the development of SMEs in Kosovo|Small and medium enterprises are becoming increasingly important for the creation and development of a modern, dynamic and knowledge-based economy. This is because of their capacity to promote entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial skills, and because of their ability to be flexible and adapt quickly to a changing market, and to generate new jobs. SME sector is the backbone of the economy in countries with higher income, while it is less developed in the countries with the low incomes. Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reports that more than 95% of enterprises in the OECD area are SMEs. These enterprises employ about 60% of private sector workers, make a major contribution in the field of innovation and support regional development and social cohesion. Also, SMEs in most low income countries give significant contribution to GDP growth and the creation of new jobs. In Kosovo SMEs represent more than 99% of the total number of enterprises and their share in GDP amounts to more than 50% (CBK, 2011). For this reason, the identification of external factors affecting the development of SMEs in Kosovo is very important, in order to take all the necessary steps to reduce or remove barriers and create new opportunities for these enterprises. This research focuses primarily on the impact of external factors, with special emphasis on access to finance for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Kosovo. External factors such as access to finance, competition, corruption, and government policies have very important impact in the development of SMEs in Kosovo. Facilitating access to finance is essential to set up a favorable environment to develop SMEs. However, in general, SMEs in developing countries face numerous barriers to funding, although this problem is not unknown even in developed countries. Barriers that face SMEs usually relate to high administrative costs, high collateral requirements and the lack of willingness of banks to lend to SMEs. Raising the level of awareness of their role and availability of access to finance for SMEs can improve economic conditions in developing countries by promoting innovation, growth of GDP and reduce unemployment.
E64|Cointegration Analysis of Oil Prices and Consumer Price Index in South Africa using STATA Software|This paper investigates the concept of vector autoregression (VAR) and cointegration using a bivariate model of global oil prices and headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) in South Africa. The study aims to determine how much of inflation is driven by oil prices. Particular attention is paid to the theoretical underpinnings of cointergration analysis and the application of STATA software to undertake such analysis and perform test statistics. Contrary to the popular myth that a rise in global oil prices fuels inflation, this study has observed that global oil prices are not the drivers of inflation in South Africa. In this way, other macroeconomic indicators and policy developments need to be integrated in analyzing the determinants of South African inflation.
E64|The peculiar distributional character of the Greek taxation system (1995‐2008) and the reform that never took place|The period 1995‐2008 is a period of fundamental transformation for the Greek economy. The dominance of services in the GDP and the decline of manufacturing and agriculture, the expansion of wage earners and the decline of self‐employment, the strengthening of large companies versus the smaller ones, the massive influx of immigrants and women in the labour market, the economic expansion to the Balkans and Turkey, the liberalization of the financial system, the euro, are all aspects of a transformation that occurred during that period. So, at a first glance it seems to be a paradox that the structure of the taxation system and its results only changed marginally. The explanation of this paradox lies in the peculiar distributive (as opposed to redistributive)character of the taxation system. Namely, the fact that the government interventions during the period 1995‐2008 resulted in the distribution of the surplus generated from the robust growth to business elites and specific social groups, instead of using this surplus to fund a reform of the taxation system aiming at a fairer distribution of the tax burden. Unfortunately, the combination of the tax agenda of the conservative party in government (Nea Dimocratia) along with a populist rhetoric of the opposition did not allow the promotion of the so needed tax reform.
E64|Ο Ιδιότυπός Διανεμητικός Χαρακτήρας Του Ελληνικού Φορολογικού Συστήματος (1995-2008) Και Η Αναγκαία Μεταρρύθμιση Που Ποτέ Δεν Έγινε<BR>[The peculiar distributional character of the Greek taxation system (1995‐2008) and the reform that never took place]|Η περίοδος 1995-2008 συνιστά μια περίοδο θεμελιακών μετασχηματισμών για την ελληνική οικονομία. Η κυριαρχία των υπηρεσιών ως προς την παραγωγή του ΑΕΠ και η υποχώρηση της μεταποίησης, η τεράστια επέκταση της μισθωτής εργασίας και η αντίστοιχη μείωση της αυτοαπασχόλησης, η ενίσχυση των μεγάλων επιχειρήσεων έναντι των μικρών, η μαζική είσοδος των μεταναστών, το άνοιγμα της οικονομίας στον διεθνή ανταγωνισμό και η επέκτασή της στα Βαλκάνια και την Τουρκία, η απελευθέρωση του χρηματοπιστωτικού συστήματος, όλα αυτά [και άλλα τόσα] αποτελούν όψεις ενός μετασχηματισμού που συντελέστηκε κατά τη διάρκεια αυτής της περιόδου. Με αυτό δεδομένο, εμφανίζεται κατ’ αρχήν ως παράδοξο το γεγονός ότι η δομή του φορολογικού συστήματος και τα οικονομικά αποτελέσματά του μεταβληθήκαν οριακά. Η ερμηνεία αυτού του παραδόξου βρίσκεται στον ιδιότυπα διανεμητικό χαρακτήρα της εξέλιξης του φορολογικού συστήματος. Δηλαδή στο γεγονός, ότι οι κυβερνητικές παρεμβάσεις της περιόδου 1995-2008 είχαν ως τελικό αποτέλεσμα το πλεόνασμα που προέκυψε από τις ευνοϊκές οικονομικές συνθήκες να διανεμηθεί σε επιχειρηματικές ελίτ και συγκεκριμένες κοινωνικές ομάδες, αντί να χρηματοδοτήσει τη δικαιότερη κατανομή του φορολογικού βάρους. Έτσι, η ανισοβαρής επιβάρυνση μισθωτών και συνταξιούχων όχι μόνο διατηρήθηκε αλλά ενισχύθηκε περαιτέρω. Συνεπώς η μεταρρύθμιση του φορολογικού συστήματος αποτελεί αδήριτη ανάγκη, ωστόσο, όπως θα υποστηριχθεί κατά το δεύτερο μέρος του άρθρου, ο συνδυασμός της φορολογικής ατζέντας της Νέας Δημοκρατίας με τον αντιπολιτευτικό λαϊκισμό δεν επέτρεψε την προώθηση της τόσο αναγκαίας φορολογικής μεταρρύθμισης
E64|The Nature of the Finnish Competitiveness Problem|Abstract We assess Finland’s competitiveness in the light of various, mainly short-term indicators. It turns out that the weak export market performance over the last few years is linked to the deterioration of profitability of production in Finland. A better export and employment performance requires a decline of relative unit labour costs and an improvement of business profitability. Wage moderation is necessary for this to happen. On the other hand, the determinants of Finland’s long-term competitiveness are quite good and maintaining and developing them should remain a key element of economic policy also in the future.
E64|Inflation uncertainty, growth uncertainty, oil prices, and output growth in the UK|This study examines the transmission and response of inflation uncertainty and output uncertainty on inflation and output growth in the UK using a bi-variate EGARCH model. Results suggest that inflation uncertainty has positive and significant effects on inflation before the inflation-targeting period, but that the effect is significantly negative after the inflation-targeting period. On the other hand, output uncertainty has a negative and significant effect on inflation and a positive effect on growth, while oil price rises significantly increase inflation for the UK. Results also indicate that inflation uncertainty significantly reduces output growth before and after the inflation-targeting period. These findings are robust and the Generalized impulse response functions corroborate the conclusions. These results have important implications for an inflation-targeting monetary policy, and for stabilization policy in general. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013
E64|Ungleiche Verteilung der Einkommen bremst das Wirtschaftswachstum|In Germany in the last decade, corporate incomes have increased much more sharply than private household incomes. At the same time, the inequality of household incomes has increased. High-income households have profited particularly from investment income and self-employment. The income gap has not widened further in recent years, but the high level of inequality already reached in 2005 has resulted in a sustained reduction of consumer spending. What is needed now is a level of income and wealth distribution that will strengthen domestic demand. Copyright ZBW and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013
E64|Moving from Inflation Targeting to Prices and Incomes Policy|This paper focuses on the future of economic policies with regard to inflation. The dominant approach to inflation over the past two decades or so has been inflation targeting. The global environment of the decade circa 1995 to 2005 with the â€œChina effectâ€ pushing down prices of manufactured goods and with primary commodity prices being subdued was conducive to low inflation. It is argued that inflation targeting has not been a great success story and is unable to address inflation arising from global forces or from struggles over the distribution of income. It is argued that a more sophisticated analysis than that contained in the Phillips curve is required. Further, and from our analysis, counter inflation policies should include the achievement of an inflation barrier consistent with full employment without inflationary pressures. This can be addressed by ensuring that there is sufficient productive capacity to underpin full employment, where sufficient is to be interpreted in terms of quantity, quality and geographical distribution. Further, we argue that this should be complemented by some form of incomes policy, to enable inflation to be contained without resorting to demand deflation.
E64|Effects on Taxation on the Forecasting of Income Inequality: Evidence from Germany, Greece, and Italy|In this paper, we investigate the impact of the fiscal system on wealth redistribution in Germany, Greece, and Italy. We demonstrate the application of the model to the data of the quoted countries. We obtain the gross income distributions by starting from the net income distributions downloaded from the Eurostat website and by using the individual income tax rates of each country. We evaluate the Dynamic Theil's Entropy that allows us to recover the total inequality between the net and gross income distributions for each of these countries. Such a comparison allowed us to understand how the fiscal systems affect wealth distribution. These results can be used for planning welfare policies.

E64|Future fiscal and debt policies: Germany in the Context of the European Monetary Union|Currently fiscal policies in Germany seem to be in a very comfortable position and the German Debt Brake is regarded as an institutional precondition for this success and has been exported to the Euro area in the guise of the Fiscal Compact. In this paper we scrutinize German fiscal policies and its new national and European institutional constraints from a macroeconomic perspective. We start by reiterating the requirements for fiscal policies of member countries in a currency union like the Euro area from a Post-Keynesian perspective and examine German fiscal policies in the period from 1999 until 2007 against this theoretical background. We then turn to German fiscal policies during the Great Recession, the German Debt Brake, the Fiscal Compact and future perspectives, and analyse the associated problems and risks. Finally, we discuss alternative scenarios which could avoid the deflationary pressures of the German Debt Brake and the Fiscal Compact on domestic demand and contribute to internally rebalancing the Euro area.
E64|Deadweight Loss of Alternative Energy Pricing Policy (in Thai)|When a market for biodiesel B5 occurred in 2006, the government set a retail price for biodiesel B5, which was subsidized by oil taxes and the oil fund of high speed diesel. This paper evaluates the economic loss from such cross-price subsidy policy. The variation in demand and supply in the markets of high speed diesel and biodiesel B5 was estimated to calculate a deadweight loss. The model obtained was then used for a model simulation to find the optimum pricing policy. Time series data from February 2007 to January 2011 were used. The study shows that the cross price subsidy generated a deadweight loss of 11,497 million baht within a 4-year period. The loss mainly occurred in the high-speed diesel market. The result of the simulation supports a continuous collection of fuel tax, but not a cross price subsidy. The tax must be collected in accordance to a social cost of externality from fuel consumption. The function of the oil fund should be to maintain the stability of retail price levels only. Government should monitor the tax rates in the way that makes the proportions of retail price and cost of the two fuels equal. This would avoid the loss.
E64|Effectiveness of Minimum Support Price Policy for Paddy in India with a Case Study of Punjab| The effectiveness of minimum support price (MSP) for paddy has been examined in different regions of India and its role and contribution towards production in surplus states like Punjab have been studied. Based on the secondary data spanning from 1980-81 to 2006-07, the deviations of farm harvest prices from the MSP have been used as a measure of ineffectiveness and the impact of prices and technology on rice productivity has been examined by using the simultaneous equation model. While the MSP policy has been very effective in surplus producing states like Punjab and Andhra Pradesh, it has not been so effective in the deficit states. In Punjab, the effective implementation of the price policy has helped in improving the production and productivity of rice. Non-price factors such as use of improved varieties, availability of assured irrigation at subsidized rates and high fertilizer-use have been found to be significant determinants of growth in rice production. The study has suggested that without losing sight of the environmental concerns, the Punjab model can be used for increasing the production of rice in other potential areas of the country.
E64|La nueva fórmula de la gasolina y su potencial impacto inflacionario en Colombia|El objetivo de este documento es explicar el nuevo esquema para la fijación del precio máximo de venta al público de la gasolina automotor, establecido recientemente por el gobierno, y mediante un análisis insumo producto determinar su posible impacto sobre la inflación al consumidor. La nueva fórmula del precio al consumidor de la gasolina contempla una estructura con 4 componentes principales y tres criterios. La estructura no se modificó y está compuesta por el ingreso al productor, los costos de adicionar alcohol carburante, los impuestos y otros costos, incluidos los márgenes de comercialización. Los criterios, que es lo novedoso, contienen la definición de una tendencia, una brecha y topes a los ajustes en el precio local. El impacto inflacionario potencial, tomando los máximos incremento mensuales y anuales permitidos por la nueva fórmula, aumentaría la inflación anual al consumidor, por una sola vez, en 7 puntos base (p.b) en un mes o 91 p.b. en un año completo.

E64|Are house prices too high in China?|This short note defines a new measurement of housing affordability in terms of permanent income. Using this new measurement, we find that housing affordability in China is very strong relative to other developed economies, although the ratio of housing prices to current income in China is much higher than those of developed nations.
E64|Inflation, Inflation Uncertainty and Macroeconomic Performance in Australia|Using quarterly data this study finds that inflation uncertainty have negative and significant effects on inflation and output growth at least after the inflation targeting. We also find that output uncertainty has negative and significant effect on inflation. The study uses a newly constructed oil price dummy variable as a control variable and finds that oil price changes significantly increase the inflation uncertainty. These findings are robust and the Generalised Impulse Response Functions corroborate the conclusions. These results have important implications for inflation targeting (IT) monetary policy, and the aim of stabilisation policy in general.
E64|Income inequality dynamic measurement of Markov models: Application to some European countries|In this paper we present a methodology for measuring income inequality dynamically within a Markov model of income evolution. The proposed methodology requires knowledge of the evolution of the population and the averages and medians of the incomes in a country and allows the computation of dynamic inequality indices. The methodology is supported with statistics from Eurostat data applied on France, Germany, Greece and Italy.
E64|Income inequality and economic growth|Despite the extensive existing literature on income inequality and economic growth, there remains considerable disagreement on the effect of inequality on economic growth. Existing literatures find either a positive or a negative relationship. In this paper, we attempt to theoretically examine that relationship with a stochastic optimal growth model. We make the disagreement clear within a single model. We conclude (i) that both are possible – that is, higher inequality can retard growth in the early stage of economic development, and can encourage growth in a near steady state, (ii) that income redistribution by high income tax does not always reduce income inequality. Income inequality can be reduced by higher income tax in a near steady state, but it cannot be reduced in the early stage of economic development, and (iii) that two government polices – rapid economic growth and low income inequality – can be achieved by low income tax in the early stage of economic development, but both cannot be achieved simultaneously in a near steady state.
E64|Optimal contracts and the role of the government in wage bargaining|This paper introduces a contract between the government and trade unions in a model of strategic wage bargaining à la Lippi (2003). It shows that an optimal contract can be implemented through an appropriately defined inflation target.
E64|Agriculture and development: A brief review of the literature|After 20 years of neglect by international donors, agriculture is now again in the headlines because high food prices are increasing food insecurity and poverty. In the coming years, it will be essential to increase food productivity and production in developing countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and with smallholders. This, however, requires finding viable solutions to a number of complex technical, institutional, and policy issues, including land markets, research on seeds and inputs, agricultural extension, credit, rural infrastructure, connection to markets, rural non-farm employment, trade policy and food price stabilization. This paper reviews what the economic literature has to say on these topics. It discusses in turn the role played by agriculture in the development process and the interactions between agriculture and other economic sectors, the determinants of the Green Revolution and the foundations of agricultural growth, issues of income diversification by farmers, approaches to rural development, and issues of international trade policy and food security, which have been at the root of the crisis in agricultural commodity volatility in recent years.
E64|Can austerity work?|Economic policies in several major countries have shifted from fiscal stimulus to austerity in the last few years. They seek to reduce fiscal deficits and reverse the increasing trend of public debt mainly through immediate spending cuts. The fact that fiscal austerity is applied simultaneously in these countries adds to its negative impact on economic recovery. Austerity policies are based on a wrong diagnosis of the nature and depth of the crisis, and also on erroneous views of economic mechanisms. This is a financial crisis due to private over-indebtedness and financial deregulation, not a crisis caused by fiscal profligacy: austerity focuses on a symptom of the crisis, not on its causes. With high unemployment and the ongoing de-leveraging process, private demand tends to remain subdued for a prolonged period and will not be stimulated by monetary expansion alone. If in addition governments tighten fiscal policies, demand and growth will be further compressed, fiscal revenues will decline, expected fiscal consolidation will remain elusive and so will the recovery of investors' confidence, which many see as the key to restoring growth. Only a recovery of growth, with nominal GDP expanding at rates higher than interest rates in the medium and long run will abate debt-to-GDP ratios. That growth can result from coordinated supportive policies, which may include changes in the level and composition of public income and expenditure and a better distribution of income and credit, which would expand fiscal multipliers and the purchasing power of low and medium income groups with a high propensity to consume.
E64|Trade and Rural-Urban Income Inequality: Evidence from China|Using the provincial panel data from 1978 to 2007, this paper makes an empirical analysis of the relationship between international trade and rural-urban income inequality in China. The results show that international trade has a fundamental impact on rural-urban income inequality. For the whole country, the development of international trade from 1978 to 2007 enlarged the rural-urban income gap. During the three different periods (defined in section 3.3), the impact was also noticeable in terms of extent, direction and significance respectively at the national and regional levels. During the three periods, the relationship has an inverted ¡°U¡± shape for China as a whole, central China and western China, but for eastern China the relationship has a ¡°U¡± shape. At the same time, exports and imports have different influences on the rural-urban income gap in China, the influences were also different across regions; and the imports has had a more significant influence on these regions than exports has had.
E64|Inflation and Monetary Policy|In September the growth rate of food prices, higher cost of fuel, as well as a new stage of regulated tariffs indexing have provoked acceleration of consumer price inflation: as per the month results, CPI amounted to 0.6% (vs.0% in September 2011). Within three weeks of October, there was no reduction in the growth rate of consumer prices, and on October 22 it was recorded at the level of 0.3% (against 0.2% in the same period of 2011). As a result, the cumulative inflation since the beginning of the year made 5.7% (vs. 4.9% in the same period of the last year). According to tentative estimates of the Central Bank, the net capital outflow from the country in Q3 reached $13.6bn, exceeding the outflow in Q2 of this year. Thus, over the first nine months of 2012 capital outflow amounted to $57.9bn (vs. $45.5bn in the relevant period of 2011).
E64|Inflation and Monetary Policy|The effect of September indexation of housing and public utilities prices began to subside, leading to a slowdown of inflation in October: as per the month results, the CPI equaled the same period of the last year and amounted to 0.5%. In November, the growth rate of consumer prices remained unchanged and on November 19 amounted to 0.3%. As a result, the cumulative inflation since the beginning of the year on that date amounted to 6% (against the relevant indicator of 5.6% last year). Thus, as per the year results, inflation is likely to be within the projected value, the upper level of which is 7%. According to tentative estimates of the RF Central Bank, the net capital outflow from the country within ten months of the current year reached $61bn (vs. $60bn the relevant period of 2011).
E64|Inflation and Monetary Policy|In August, the consumer price index was the lowest in the current year and amounted to 0.1% (against 0.2% decline in August 2011). The main inflation curbing factor was the inflation decline in food prices (-0.5%). The second phase of regulated tariffs indexation urged the acceleration of inflation in September, which made 0.4% within 17 days. As a result, cumulate inflation from the beginning of the year exceeded the relevant indicator of the previous year, amounting to 5% as of September 17 (vs. 4.6% in 2011). Foreign currency and gold reserves in mid-September reached the maximum peak of the four months and amounted to $522.8bn. From September 14, the Bank of Russia has tightened the monetary and credit policy, having raised the interest rate by 0.25 p.p. to 8.25%. On September 21, the Bank of Russia decided to reduce the maximum interest rate on deposits from October 1.
E64|Comparing South African Inflation Volatility Across Monetary Policy Regimes: An Application of Saphe Cracking|Recent empirical evidence on the direct link of inflation targeting and inflation volatility is at best mixed. However, comparing inflation volatility across alternative monetary policy regimes within a country based on conventional ways, used in previous studies, begs the question. The question is not whether the volatility of inflation has changed, but rather whether the volatility is different than it otherwise would have been. In such a backdrop, this paper uses the cosine-squared cepstrum to provide evidence that CPI inflation in South Africa has become more volatile since the first quarter of 2000, when the country moved into an inflation targeting regime, than it would have been had the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) continued with the more eclectic monetary policy approach pursued in the pre-targeting era.
E64|The Determinants of Food Prices in Pakistan|Controlling prices is one of the biggest tasks that macroeconomic policymakers face. The objective of this study is to analyze the demand- and supply-side factors that affect food prices in Pakistan. We analyze their long-run relationship using an autoregressive distributed lag model for the period 1970–2010. Our results indicate that that the most significant variable affecting food prices in both the long and short run is money supply. We also find that subsidies can help reduce food prices in the long run but that their impact is very small. Increases in world food prices pressurize the domestic market in the absence of imports, which cause domestic food prices to rise. If, however, we import food crops at higher international prices, this can generate imported inflation. The error correction is statistically significant and shows that market forces play an active role in restoring the long-run equilibrium.
E64|The Supply-Shock Explanation of the Great Stagflation Revisited|"U.S. inflation data exhibit two notable spikes into the double-digit range in 1973-1974 and again in 1978-1980. The well-known ""supply-shock"" explanation attributes both spikes to large food and energy shocks plus, in the case of 1973-1974, the removal of price controls. Yet critics of this explanation have (a) attributed the surges in inflation to monetary policy and (b) pointed to the far smaller impacts of more recent oil shocks as evidence against the supply-shock explanation. This paper reexamines the impacts of the supply shocks of the 1970s in the light of the new data, new events, new theories, and new econometric studies that have accumulated over the past quarter century. We find that the classic supply-shock explanation holds up very well; in particular, neither data revisions nor updated econometric estimates substantially change the evaluations of the 1972-1983 period that were made 25 years (or more) ago. We also rebut several variants of the claim that monetary policy, rather than supply shocks, was really to blame for the inflation spikes. Finally, we examine several changes in the economy that may explain why the impacts of oil shocks are so much smaller now than they were in the 1970s.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
E64|Finance-dominated capitalism, re-distribution and the financial and economic crises: A European perspective|In this paper the euro crisis is viewed as the most recent episode of the crisis of financedominated capitalism. Therefore, two major features of finance-dominated capitalism, the increasing inequality of income distribution and the rising imbalances of current accounts, are analysed for a set of major Euro area countries. Against this background the euro crisis is examined, and it is shown that the economic policy reactions of European governments and institutions, narrowly interpreting the crisis as a sovereign debt crisis caused by irresponsible behaviour of some member country governments, are misguided and will lead to deflationary stagnation and an increasing risk of disintegration of the Euro area. For this reason, an alternative macroeconomic policy approach tackling the basic contradictions of financedominated capitalism and the deficiencies of European economic policy institutions and economic policy strategies is outlined. It is argued that, on the one hand, an institution which convincingly guarantees the public debt of Euro area member countries and, on the other hand, an expansionary macroeconomic policy approach, in particular in the current account surplus countries of the Euro area, need to be introduced.
