B51|The Danger of a “Geyser Disease” Effect: Structural Fragility of the Tourism-Led Recovery in Iceland|The fall of the Icelandic economy in 2008 highlighted the destructive effects of unbridled markets. Yet, the small Nordic country has experienced an impressive recovery, so much so that in recent years its annual growth rates have been significantly higher than those of the overwhelming majority of advanced capitalist countries. Several commentators have attributed this extraordinary accomplishment to the interventionist state policies adopted by successive Icelandic governments. The aim of this article is to debunk this myth by delving into the fragile foundations that the current Icelandic economic boom rests on. We argue that the substantial growth of the real exchange rate has made the rapid absorption of unemployment compatible with price stability during the recovery period. At the same time, the boom in tourism services made the impressive appreciation of the Icelandic króna compatible with the country’s external balance. However, the laissez-faire approach shown by the Icelandic authorities towards the krona appreciation hasseverely penalized most of the tradable sector, in which the bulk of skilled labor is usually concentrated. Arguably, the heavy specialization in the tourism sector, by restricting sources of productivity growth and international competitiveness, will render the current level of unemployment and real wages inconsistent with internal and external equilibrium in Iceland in the long run.
B51|La estructura sectorial de Colombia: Un análisis insumo-producto|En los últimos años ha existido el consenso de que la economía colombiana es muy dependente del sector minero – energético, por lo cual se deben encontrar formas de transformar el aparato productivo. El análisis insumo-producto ayuda a identificar cuales pueden ser los sectores que pueden contribuir a una mayor diversificación de economía, además de la clasificación por clústeres, los cuales no han cambiado tanto en los últimos quince años.
B51|Generación de empleos y clústeres|En este trabajo se utiliza la metodología insumo – producto para analizar la creación del empleo desde la perspectiva sectorial, al utilizar los multiplicadores del empleo los multiplicadores del empleo y mostrar las relaciones del empleo entre e intra – clúster de la economía. Se encuentra que los clústeres más cercanos a la demanda final son los de agro – industria e industria y construcción. Si se realiza algún estímulo sobre la demanda de los productos finales de estos clústeres se va a generar una mayor absorción del trabajo, no solo dentro de cada clúster, sino en el sistema productivo en general. El efecto se refuerza si existen conexiones fuertes con clústeres proveedores netos de insumos, tales como el de servicios o el de industria minero – energética.
B51|El bicentenario: una mirada entre la historia económica y la economía política|En el marco del Bicentenario de la independencia de Colombia, el Centro de Investigaciones para el Desarrollo (CID), en alianza con el periódico Portafolio, ha presentado una serie de reflexiones sobre la trayectoria económica que ha atravesado el país, en aras de entender los retos del futuro y las lecciones aprendidas del pasado. El contenido es muy amplio incluyendo temas que han jugado un rol clave en la historia del país, como el café, la violencia, la tierra, hasta temas que son menos conocidos pero deberían formar parte de la reflexión colectiva, como el papel de la mujer, los estudios sectoriales, o el desarrollo de largo plazo. El lector no tiene que esperarse una narración univoca, ni un recorrido lineal: estos escritos son reflexiones que vienen de investigadores con enfoques teóricos y metodológicos muy diferentes, como tradición en la Universidad Nacional. Así, ensayos de análisis económico de las instituciones son acompañados por reflexiones de análisis marxiano aplicado, y la cliometría se entrelaza a la finanza pública. Por la misma razón, decidimos no proponer una estructura interpretativa o una organización del contenido, prefiriendo reportar los escritos en el orden cronológico en el cual aparecieron en el portal del periódico. *** In the framework of the Bicentennial of the independence of Colombia, the Centro de Investigaciones para el Desarrollo (CID), in alliance with the newpaper Portafolio, has gathered a series of reflections about the economic trajectory that the country has gone through, for the sake of understanding the challenges of the future and the lessons learned from the past. The content is very broad including issues that have played a key role in the history of the country, such as coffee, violence, land, and issues that are less known but should be part of collective reflection, such as the role of women, sectoral studies, or long-term development. The reader should not expect a univocal narrative, nor a linear perspective: these texts are reflections that come from researchers with very different theoretical and methodological approaches, as a tradition at the Universidad Nacional. As a result, economic analysis of the institutions goes hand by hand with applied Marxian analysis, and the cliometry is intertwined with public finance. For the same reason, we decided not to propose an interpretative structure or an organization of the content, opting for an order of presentation that follows the chronological order in which they appeared in the newspaper's portal.
B51|A non-linear Keynesian Goodwin-type endogenous model of the cycle: Bayesian evidence for the USA|This paper incorporates the so-called Bhaduri-Marglin accumulation function in Goodwin’s original growth cycle model and econometrically estimates the proposed model for the case of the US economy in the time period 1960–2012, using a modern Bayesian sequential Monte Carlo method. Based on our findings, the US economy follows an exhilarationist regime throughout our investigation period with the sole exception of an underconsumption regime for the time period 1974–1978. In general, the results suggest that the proposed approach is an appropriate vehicle for expanding and improving traditional Goodwin-type models.
B51|Sraffian Indeterminacy in General Equilibrium Revisited|In contrast to Mandler's (1999a; Theorem 6) impossibility result about the Sraffian indeterminacy of the steady-state equilibrium, we first show that any regular Sraffian steady-state equilibrium is indeterminate in terms of Sraffa (1960) under the simple overlapping generation economy. Moreover, we also check that this indeterminacy is generic. These results are obtained by explicitly defining a simple model of overlapping generation economies with Leontief production techniques, in which we also explain the main source of the difference between our results and Mandler (1999a; section 6).
B51|Optimal Weight of Commercial Sector and Reproduction Scheme|In the field of commercial capital theory, recently Yano (2006) and Murakami (2014) have tried to incorporate the commercial sector into the reproduction scheme. However, Yano's formulation put the commercial capital outside the reproduction formula, and his explanation is too complex. Moreover, Murakami's formation still has a problem owing to his methodology that uses only the numerical examples. Therefore, this paper incorporates the commercial sector into the reproduction scheme as a perfect equation system based on the equalized profit rate. It is because equalized profit rate is also applied to the commercial sector to determine its weight in the whole economy. As a result of these calculations, this paper also identified that average profit rate is determined by the technological conditions only in the industrial sectors.
B51|Investment, autonomous demand and long run capacity utilization: An empirical test for the Euro Area|In recent years, the role attached to the autonomous components of aggregate demand has attracted rising attention, as testified by the development of the Sraffian Supermulti plier model (SSM) and the attempts to include autonomous demand in the Neo-Kaleckian model. This paper reviews and empirically tests the validity and the policy conclusions of the two models in the Euro Area. First, we theoretically assess whether the SSM may con stitute a complex variant of the Neo-Kaleckian model. In this sense, it is shown that results compatible with the SSM can be obtained by implementing a set of mechanisms in a modified Neo-Kaleckian model, leading to the convergence towards a desired rate of utilization. Furthermore, the chief diffierence between the models is recognized to be the role attached to the rate of capacity utilization in the long run. Second, the paper empirically tests the main implications of the models in the Euro Area, based on Eurostat data. In particular, the discussion outlines the short and long-run relation between autonomous demand and output, by testing both the cointegration and the direction of causality between the two with a VECM model. Moreover, the role accounted by both theories to the actual rate of capacity utilization and its discrepancies from the normal rate is empirically assessed, through a time-series estimation of the Sraffian and Neo-Kaleckian investment functions. While confirming the theoretical relation between autonomous demand and output in the long run, the results show that the dynamics of the rate of capacity utilization still plays a key role in the short-run adjustment mechanism - despite its stationary behaviour in the long term. Therefore, admitting that Keynesian results may hold even after the traverse, our work suggests to be Kaleckian in the short run and Sraffian in the long run.
B51|Was ist falsch an der Arbeitswerttheorie? Wie Wert wirklich gebildet wird<BR>[What is wrong with the labor value theory? How value is really made]|"In this article it is shown that the labor value theory according to Marx is flawed in a central aspect: Neither the surplus value nor the value is produced. Value is a social relationship that is formed on the social level between exchange partners. Potential goods are produced as reference points for possible value relationships. They are shaped by manpower, machine and nature. On this basis, the description of value formation deviates from the classical interpretation of labor theory, and the value is no longer perceived as a subjective singularity (as a generated ""work value"", that can only be an expectation value) but as a real relationship between humans."
B51|Rationality and Capitalist Schooling|In the field of philosophy of mind, the concepts of rational behavior, rational choice theory, and instrumental rationality (the “practical reasoning” version of rationality) are important in trying to make statements and conclusions about human thinking and behavior in general. Rational choice theory is also considered a normative but not a descriptive or positive theory. Much of economic theory is based on the principle that economic agents usually or always behave rationally in maximizing the benefits and/or minimizing the costs of their decisions. Developments in behavioral economics over the last several decades have begun to question this principle with much of the questioning about rationality and rational behavior centering on whether individuals can correctly and adequately assess probabilities and risk/reward. The inability to correctly assess risk/reward limits rational behavior and can yield sub-optimal outcomes for economic agents. This exploratory paper examines the linkages between schooling in a capitalist society and limits on rationality in a monopoly capital economic system.
B51|The Impact of Financialization on the Rate of Profit: A Discussion|The present work, by making use of the ‘integrated wage-goods sector’ methodology proposed by Gareg-nani, investigates some channels through which financialization may impact the normal rate of profit. We analyze the effect of a higher profit share in the financial sector, the technical innovations in the financial sector and rising household indebtedness. We find that none of them influences normal profitability, with the exception of one type of technical innovation. We subsequently critically discuss some Marxian strands of analysis that describe financialization as a temporary countertendency to supposed falling gen-eral profitability. We argue in favor of a separate analysis between growth caused by private borrowing and the study of a normal distribution. Finally, a recent attempt to read the ‘sixth’ countertendency to the falling rate of profit listed by Marx as an anticipation of the phenomenon of financialization is criticized, proposing an alternative interpretation.
B51|Capital accumulation and corporate portfolio choice between liquidity holdings and financialisation|Most models of investment decisions utilised in macroeconomic models take free or perfect competition as explicit or implicit assumption. However, the oligopolistic structure of most real markets lead to corporate strategic behaviours that can produce very different results. Strategic decisions, connected with agency problems, can play a major role in producing financialisation and timing the rhythms of real investment. The paper deals with both mainstream and heterodox contributions that analyse the effects of corporate governance and strategic behaviours on portfolio management and investment decisions in big corporations, seeking to determine how these effects might play a major role in producing growing liquidity holdings and financialisation. The main objective is to understand whether these models can explain the tendency to place growing shares of social surplus in speculative financial channels, thereby contributing to long-term real stagnation.

Moreover, we also check that this indeterminacy is generic. These results are obtained by explicitly defining a simple model of overlapping gener- ation economies with Leontief production techniques, in which we also explain the main source of the difference between our results and Mandler (1999a; section 6).
B51|Persistent Exploitation with Intertemporal Reproducible Solution in Pre-industrial Economies|This paper presents an intertemporal model of pre-industrial economies defined with leisure preference to study the condition of the emergence and persistence of exploitation as unequal exchange of labor. We show that pure workers are exploited in any finite periods if there is positive real profit rate, even though labor allocation among agents tends to be equalized in the limit regardless of the saving behaviors. The so-called Fundamental Marxian Theorem and Profit-Exploitation Correspondence Principle are generalized in the intertemporal setting with exploitation in the whole life, and the Class-Exploitation Correspondence Principle is established with exploitation within period.
B51|Une analyse de la nature de l’investissement immatériel par le rapport capital / travail|Cet article propose de revisiter le concept d’investissement immatériel en posant la question de la nature de celui-ci. Ce travail d’inspiration marxienne analysera la transformation de la nature de l’investissement immatériel en partant des transformations du rapport capital / travail. À partir des modifications de ce rapport identifiées grâce à la notion de subsomption du travail au capital, nous chercherons à appréhender la nature de l’investissement immatériel au travers du rapport actifs / ressources immatérielles. L’identification de ces ressources potentielles poussera nos investigations hors de la sphère de la production. Les notions « d’exploitation de second degré » et de « mobilisation totale » seront alors mobilisées pour comprendre ce qui caractérise aujourd’hui l’investissement immatériel et notamment le fait que les entreprises n’investissent plus seulement dans du capital fixe, mais aussi, et surtout dans les capacités créatives et d’innovations des individus et du corps collectif, plus encore dans le développement d’une nouvelle subjectivité capitaliste. Nous développons donc l’hypothèse que pour analyser le capitalisme contemporain il est nécessaire d’enrichir le concept d’investissement grâce à une redéfinition de l’investissement immatériel et cela en partant des transformations précédemment identifiées.
B51|Heterodox economics and Economic Anthropology: reflections prompted by two books|This paper has been long ago inspired by Jared Diamond (1997) and, in particular, by his extensive use of the concept of economic surplus as the key to the development of civilization. Unfortunately, Diamond does not even mention the origin of the concept in classical and pre-classical economics. Moreover, Diamond does not pay any consideration to the long debates in economic anthropology on the role of economic analysis in studying primitive and ancient economic formations. These debates are instead the object of a more recent book by Cedrini & Marchionatti (2017), who context the neoclassical “imperialist” attempt to occupy the territory of economic anthropology. They rely, however, upon the frail institutionalist background provided by Karl Polanyi and his school and by other anthropologists of similar inspiration. In so doing, they fail to provide a robust economic basis to institutional change, by firmly anchoring it around the changing modes of generation and distribution of the economic surplus. These notes are explorative, as also shown by a post-scriptum. Comments welcome.
B51|Where Did Good Jobs Go? Acemoglu and Marx on Induced (Skill Replacing) Technical Change|The paper lays out a hypothesis about the effect global oversupply of labor had on induced technological change, clarifying how it might have contributed to the demand reversal for high skill workers and other recent observed trends in technological change in the US. The argument considers the effect of market friendly political/institutional transformations of the 1980s on technology as they created a potential for an integrated global labor market. The innovations induced by the promise of this potential eventually culminated in the creation of global value chains and production networks. These required large set up costs and skill enhancing innovations, but once in place they reduced the dependence of expanding low skill employment around the globe on skill intensive inputs from advanced countries, giving rise to the wellobserved high skill demand reversal and sputtering of IT investment.
B51|Investment, Autonomous Demand and Long Run Capacity Utilization: An Empirical Test for the Euro Area|This paper reviews and empirically tests the validity and policy conclusions of the Sraffian Supermultiplier model (SSM) and the modified Neo-Kaleckian model after the inclusion of autonomous components of aggregate demand. First, we theoretically assess whether the SSM may constitute a complex variant of the Neo-Kaleckian model. In this sense, it is shown that results compatible with the SSM can be obtained by implementing a set of mechanisms in a modified Neo-Kaleckian model. Second, the paper empirically tests the main implications of the models in the Euro Area, based on Eurostat data.

While confirming the theoretical relation between autonomous demand and output in the long run, the results show that capacity utilization still plays a key role in the short-run adjustment mechanism. Therefore, admitting that Keynesian results may hold even after the traverse, our work suggests to be Kaleckian in the short run and Sraffian in the long run.
B51|Karl Marx: An early post-Keynesian? A comparison of Marx's economics with the contributions by Sraffa, Keynes, Kalecki and Minsky|"This paper compares Marx's economics with those by Sraffa, Keynes, Kalecki and Minsky. The paper takes an ""ex post"" view on the matter and rather looks at the output side of the respective authors, but not at the input side. This means no attempt is made at studying in a systematic way, if and to what extent Sraffa, Keynes, Kalecki and Minsky were individually influenced by Marx's work. First, the relationship between Marx's theory of value and Sraffa's reformulation of the classical theory of prices and distribution is reviewed. Then the relationship between Marx's and Keynes's monetary theory is examined relying on an interpretation of Marx's theory of value as a ""monetary theory of value"". Next, some light is shed on the Marx-Kalecki connection focusing on Marx's theory of simple and extended reproduction and the built-in, although not fully elaborated ""principle of effective demand"" and the related theories of distribution and accumulation. Finally, Marx's and Minsky's views on financial instability and crises are scrutinised. It is concluded that Marx should not be considered as an ""early post-Keynesian"" but rather as an important forerunner of modern post-Keynesianism, with certain similarities, but also some important differences, and several areas of compatibility."
B51|The European economic crisis from 2007 onwards in the context of a global crisis of over-production of capital - a Marxian monetary theory of value interpretation|This paper attempts to clarify how the European economic crisis from 2007 onwards can be understood from the perspective of a Marxian monetary theory of value that emphasizes in-trinsic, structural flaws regarding capitalist reproduction. Chapter two provides an empirical description of the European economic crisis, which to some extent already reflects the struc-tural theoretical framework presented in chapter three. Regarding the theoretical framework Michael Heinrich's interpretation of 'the' Marxian monetary theory of value will be presented. Heinrich identifies connections between production and realization, between profit and inter-est rate as well as between industrial and fictitious capital, which represent contradictory tendencies for which capitalism does not have simple balancing processes. In the context of a discussion of 'structural logical aspects' of Marx's Critique of the Political Economy, explana-tory deficits of Heinrich's approach are analyzed. In the following, it is argued that Fred Mose-ley's view of these 'structural logical aspects' allows empirical 'applications' of Marxian mon-etary theories of value. It is concluded that a Marxian monetary theory of value, with the characteristics of expansive capital accumulation and its limitations, facilitates a structural analysis of the European economic crisis from 2007 onwards. In this line of argument, expan-sive production patterns are expressed, among other things, in global restructuring processes, while consumption limitations are mitigated by expansive financial markets and shifts in ex-port destinations.
B51|Marx, the Predisposition to Reject Markets and Private Property, and Attractive Alternatives to Capitalism|Ever since capitalism came to be recognized as a new economic system, its principal institutions of private property and markets have had vociferous critics, of whom none was more wide-ranging and influential than Karl Marx. Marx claimed that not only were private property and markets critical to creating an ideological patina of freedom behind which, as in slavery and feudalism, a small class extracted from the mass of producers practically all output above that necessary for bare subsistence, they were also corrupting. Yet Marx recognized that capitalism, unlike earlier exploitative systems, was radically dynamic, producing unprecedented wealth, while transforming not only all it inherited from the past, but also its own nature so as to eventually empower even the producers, who he believed would abandon these capitalist institutions. This article claims Marx was correct in identifying the core problem of capitalism to be its extreme inequality in the ownership and control of the means of production, but that finding fault with private property and markets has been a mistake that has impeded the generation of an attractive and viable alternative to capitalism. It concludes with an outline of an alternative which would eliminate the core problem of exploitation due to unequal ownership and control of the means of production, while retaining roles for private property and markets. It would entail two components: Guaranteed employment at living wages and democratic worker control of firms.
B51|Labour values and energy values|In the history of economic thought various thinkers have been attracted by the problematic idea of a single cause of economic value. Today such ideas appear mostly in studies on the labour theory of value of Karl Marx. In 1867 his “Das Kapital” tried to explain the values of all commodities by a special common substance, the quantity of abstract labour embodied in them, i.e., the direct and indirect labour time necessary to produce them. Several well-known mainstream economists (for example, Wicksteed, Böhm-Bawerk, Wicksell and Pareto) quickly pointed out that labour was not the only common substance in commodities. Another problem was Marx’s deficient mathematics. In Marx’s system the same commodities can appear on the side of the inputs and on the side of the outputs. Today it is well-known that many analytical problems in such circular systems can be solved by means of simultaneous equations of the input-output type. Here the most original contributions were not made by leading economists mentioned above, but by rather unknown outsiders (Mühlpfordt, Dmitriev, Charasoff, Potron), whose pioneering works were neglected for decades. In December 1927, both Sraffa and Leontief, independently of each other, argued that the reduction of all commodities to labour values was not a unique process; from a formal point of view, it was possible to compute not only labour values, but also wheat values, coal values, etc. For various reasons, their insights of 1927 remained rather unnoticed for several decades. A few decades ago the high impact journal Science published some papers advocating the use of energy values, corresponding to the direct and indirect quantity of energy necessary to produce a commodity. The most conspicuous text of this type is the often cited paper “Embodied Energy and Economic Valuation” by Robert Costanza (published in Science in 1980), claiming that both theory and empiry suggest a close connection between prices and energy values. The energy theory of value is usually discussed outside the networks of orthodox or marxian economics, but the empirical and theoretical studies on energy values and labour values show several remarkable cases of analogous arguments and imperfections, both trying to support the use of a single substance of economic value. My paper considers both theoretical and empirical aspects of such discussions on labour values and energy values. I also use a simple numerical example, to illustrate the computation of both labour values and energy values via two methods: via a system of simultaneous input-output equations and via subsystems (vertically integrated systems that produce only one net output). The two computation methods are well-known from the rich literature on labour values, but comparing energy values and labour values forces me to a generalisation of the notion of a subsystem: in order to define this notion unambiguously, I need to specify not only the net output of the subsystem, but also its net input. If the only net input of the subsystem is energy, I use the expression “energy subsystem”. This concept is needed to establish a percentage formula for the deviation of prices from energy values, analogous to my formula for the deviation of prices from labour values. By generalising Sraffa’s notion of subsystems it is possible to explain why supporters of labour values and energy values both present misleadingly “good” empirical results for their favourite theory. Both groups should be more aware of the non-uniqueness of their exaggerated claims for their one sided theories of value.
B51|Changing levels of self-organization : how a capitalist economy differs from other complex systems|This paper investigates the specificity of a modern capitalist economy as a complex system. This investigation is based on a review of the literature to understand complexity in the physical and biological worlds, to learn the bases of complexity and self-organization, and to locate the tools used to identify and measure them. An economy has different layers and levels of organization, based upon human beings, agents that think, have intentions and change all the time. This paper presents a new model to replicate the workings of a capitalist economy that endogenizes the introduction of innovations and institutional change, and it runs a simulation. The analysis of those results indicate that a modern capitalist economy is a complex system, and that this complex system changes its level of self-organization over time. This finding highlights the peculiarity of a capitalist economy vis-à-vis other complex systems.
B51|Producción no mercantil en la economía capitalista|Este texto busca contribuir a la interpretación sobre la presencia muy notable en las sociedades capitalistas contemporáneas de actividades productivas de bienes y servicios que no son mercantiles. En las familias de los trabajadores contemporáneos algunos de sus miembros se dedican de manera exclusiva a generar a través del auto-suministro bienes y servicios que son decisivos para para la reproducción de todos los miembros de los hogares. E incluso los individuos que desarrollan tareas mercantiles estables, sean ellos asalariados o agentes mercantiles simples, dedican una parte apreciable de su tiempo adicional a realizar tareas de auto-suministro que no son remuneradas mercantilmente. Como en general los fenómenos económicos que no son monetarios tienden a ser invisibles, se tiene la impresión de que el peso de estas actividades no mercantiles es algo marginal. Pero estadísticas como los sondeos sobre el uso del tiempo muestran un panorama muy distinto. En términos globales en los hogares el tiempo de trabajo no remunerado tiende a exceder el tiempo destinado a actividades mercantiles. E incluso los individuos con vínculos laborables mercantiles estables, además de su jornada laboral pagada, trabajan un 50% más de tiempo en tareas de auto-suministro no mercantil. El enfoque de este texto parte de la noción de que este fenómeno no necesariamente está inducido por una lógica de comportamiento ajena a las referencias mercantiles. Nuestra tesis es que los trabajadores que están inmersos en una economía capitalista, sean ellos asalariados o agentes mercantiles simples, realizan decisiones entre dedicar su tiempo al trabajo mercantil o al auto-suministro no mercantil, a partir de consideraciones mercantiles. Se aborda este tema utilizando dos variantes de la teoría del valor trabajo (con versiones relativamente peculiares, hay que advertirlo): la Teoría del Valor Trabajo Comandado de Adam Smith y la Teoría del Valor Trabajo Abstracto de Marx, en su versión de la Nueva Aproximación. Y sin embargo, a pesar de que estas elecciones siguen una lógica mercantil, está sobre-determinadas por circunstancias globales de relaciones de fuerza entre las clases, tanto en el plano estrictamente económico, como en lo jurídico y en lo ideológico. Se examinan tres casos pertinentes de este fenómeno: la autoconstrucción de vivienda, muy extendida en los países periféricos actuales; el trabajo doméstico no remunerado, que afecta especialmente, aunque no de manera exclusiva a las mujeres; y la creciente práctica que algunos denominan “prosumo” que consiste en desplazar hacia el consumidor parte de los procesos productivos de los bienes adquiridos mercantilmente con el fin de reducir su precio monetario. El texto indaga sobre el papel que desempeña esta actividad no mercantil en la parte mercantil de la actividad laboral, y por lo tanto en aspectos claves como la explotación efectiva, la magnitud del salario y la tasa de ganancia.
B51|La conjetura de Shaikh. Un modelo clásico de la tasa de cambio real Colombia - Estados Unidos|"En este trabajo se presenta lo que hemos denominado la “Conjetura de Shaikh”. (i) explicamos la concepción clásica de la competencia real en el modo de producción capitalista, definida como una guerra continua por la sobrevivencia, cuyas armas son el cambio técnico, la inversión en capital y los ajustes de precios que permiten golpear duramente a los capitales adversarios para concentrar y centralizar el poder en el mercado. (ii) introducimos la teoría de la desventaja absoluta que determina la especialización y la división internacional del trabajo, que explica los procesos de causación circular acumulativa de los superávits comerciales y de acumulación de obligaciones externas entre países desarrollados y en desarrollo (iii) explicamos porque la interpretación monetaria de la tasa de interés impide que las ventajas absolutas se transformen en desventajas comparativas en libre comercio. Por último, se presenta el modelo de determinación de la tasa de cambio real entre dos países (USA y Colombia), que se deriva de la teoría clásica del sistema de precios de producción. ****** In this paper, we present what we have called the ""Shaikh Conjecture"". (i) We explain the classical conception of real competition in the capitalist mode of production, defined as a continuous war for survival, whose weapons are technical change, investment in capital and price adjustments that allow capital to hit hard adversaries to concentrate and centralize power in the market. (ii) We introduce the theory of absolute disadvantage that determines the specialization and international division of labour, which explains the cumulative circular causation processes of trade surpluses and accumulation of external obligations between developed and developing countries. (iii) We explain why the monetary interpretation of the interest rate prevents absolute advantages from becoming comparative disadvantages in free trade. Finally, we present the model for determining the real exchange rate between two countries (USA and Colombia), which is derived from the classical theory of the production price system."

B51|Exploitation, skills, and inequality| This paper uses a computational framework to analyse the equilibrium dynamics of exploitation and inequality in accumulation economies with heterogeneous labour. A novel index is presented which measures the intensity of exploitation at the individual level and the dynamics of the distribution of exploitation intensity is analysed. The e ects of technical change and evolving social norms on exploitation and inequalities are also considered and an interesting phenomenon of exploitation cycles is identi ed. Various taxation schemes are analysed which may reduce exploitation or inequalities in income and wealth. It is shown that relatively small taxation rates may have significant cumulative effects on wealth and income inequalities. Further, taxation schemes that eliminate exploitation also reduce disparities in income and wealth but in the presence of heterogeneous skills, do not necessarily eliminate them. The inegalitarian effects of different abilities need to be tackled with a progressive education policy that compensates for unfavourable circumstances.
B51|The commodification of knowledge and information|In this paper we present an analysis of the commodification of knowledge and information in contemporary capitalism. We provide a consistent account of how information as a commodity effects the workings of both capitalism and of Marxist theory. The first part of the paper critically revisits Marx’s own writings on the commodification of knowledge and how the immaterial labour hypothesis initially interpreted these writings. Based on the new categories knowledge-commodity and knowledge-rent, we then present our own approach in response to the challenges raised by the immaterial labour hypothesis. Lastly, we analyse the more recent contributions on the commodification of knowledge and information within the Marxist literature. The current debate on the value of knowledge has been divided between two camps: the reproduction cost approach, and the average cost approach. At the end of the paper we present empirical estimates of the magnitudes of knowledge-rents.
B51|Towards a Marxist theory of financialised capitalism|In the rapid growth of the literature on financialisation, the term risks becoming meaningless (‘take x, add finance’). This contribution first reviews this literature, highlighting characteristic empirical features at the macroeconomic level and their variegation across different institutional contexts, then turning to meso- and micro-level multidisciplinary studies of how processes of financialisation have manifest in the transformed behaviour of firms, states and households, as well as in the changing mode of provision of public services and the appropriation of the commons. Marxist attempts to theorize the essences of financialisation are examined and found wanting. Two proposals are made in the spirit of advancing this project. First, financialisation as cyclical process must be disentangled from financialised capitalism as secular stage. Second, it is argued that the emergence of financialised capitalism as a new stage within mature capitalism is linked with the central role played by finance in the internationalisation of the circuit of production.
B51|The Theory Of Exploitation As The Unequal Exchange Of Labour|This paper analyses the normative and positive foundations of the theory of exploitation as the unequal exchange of labour (UEL). The key intuitions behind all of the main approaches to UEL exploitation are explicitly analysed as a series of formal claims in a general economic environment. It is then argued that these intuitions can be captured by one fundamental axiom - called Labour Exploitation - which defines the basic domain of all UEL exploitation forms and identifies the formal and theoretical framework for the analysis of the appropriate definition of exploitation.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

B51|On the Ricardian invariable measure of value in general convex economies|This study examines the possibility of an invariable measure of value when price changes induced by income redistribution between profit and wages take place in general convex economies. While Ricardo searched for an invariable measure of value with respect to changes in both the factor income distribution and the technique, Sraffa constructed a standard commodity serving as a measure of the change in a factor income distribution alone by leaving aside the possibility of changes in the size and composition of output and means of production. This study allows for the possibility that a change in factor income distribution involves a change in technique, and proposes an extension of Sraffaâ€™s standard commodity. Then, we show that it serves as an invariable measure of value with respect to the income redistribution, even though it involves a change in technique. Finally, we examine whether the linear distributional relation is preserved.
B51|The Heckscher—Ohlin—Samuelson Trade Theory and the Cambridge Capital Controversies: On the Validity of Factor Price Equalisation Theorem|This paper examines the validity of the factor price equalisation theorem (FPET) in relation to capital theory. First, it presents a survey of the literature on Heckscher—Ohlin—Samuelson (HOS) models that treat capital as a primary factor, beginning with Samuelson (1953). In addition, by consulting the Cambridge capital controversies, this paper observes that the validity of the FPET relies crucially on this setting. It does no longer hold whenever capital is assumed to be a bundle of reproducible commodities. This paper also refers to the recent literature on the dynamic HOS trade theory and argues that such studies ignore the difficulties posed by the capital controversies. It thereby concludes that the FPET holds even when capital is modelled as a reproducible factor. In conclusion, the paper suggests the necessity of reconstructing basic theories of international trade without relying on the FPET.
B51|On the Ricardian Invariable Measure of Value in General Convex Economies|This study examines the possibility of an invariable measure of value when price changes induced by income redistribution between profit and wages take place in general convex economies. While Ricardo searched for an invariable measure of value with respect to changes in both the factor income distribution and the technique, Sraffa constructed a standard commodity serving as a measure of the change in a factor income distribution alone by leaving aside the possibility of changes in the size and composition of output and means of production. This study allows for the possibility that a change in factor income distribution involves a change in technique, and proposes an extension of Sraffa’s standard commodity. Then, we show that it serves as an invariable measure of value with respect to the income redistribution, even though it involves a change in technique. Finally, we examine whether the linear distributional relation is preserved.

B51|Eigenvalue distribution, matrix size and the linearity of wage-profit curves|Brody (1997), while experimenting with random matrices, conjectured that the relative size of the second eigenvalue with respect to the first tended to fall as a random matrix got larger. Bidard and Schatteman (2001) proved that in a random matrix with independently and identically distributed entries the speed of convergence increases with the size of the matrix because the relative size of all subdominant eigenvalues tends to zero as the matrix size approaches infinity. Schefold (2010) then showed that zero subdominant eigenvalues imply linear wage-profit curves for any given numeraire. Our concern is with actual input-output matrices. We successively aggregate the US 2002 matrix from 403 to 10 industries and observe the distribution of the moduli of eigenvalues at each level of aggregation. The random matrix hypothesis predicts that both the size of ratio of the modulus of second eigenvalue to the first and the average size of all moduli will fall toward zero as matrix size increases. At an empirical level, we find that the eigenvalue ratio rises while the average size of eigenvalue moduli falls towards a positive constant. These findings do not support the applicability of Brody’s conjecture for real input-output tables, and by implication do not support the hypothesis that wage-profit curves will become strictly linear in the limit. It is still possible to reconcile our findings with empirically observed near-linear wage-profit curves.
B51|The Weight of Essentials in Economic Activity|THIS PAPER HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM CIRCULATION TEMPORARILY. PLEASE CONTACT THE AUTHOR FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. This paper is interested in the weight of essential goods and services in economic activity. The first measure is concerned with the sphere of production, which makes use of World Input-Output Tables to construct net-product subsystems so as to estimate the total (direct and indirect) share of essentials in aggregate product. The second measure approaches the same question from the sphere of consumption by relying on OECD data on household final consumption expenditures. The results lie roughly in the interval of 45-70% and 50-75% in the spheres of production and consumption, respectively, where the lower and upper bounds are given by essentials in the narrow and broad sense, respectively. Interesting patterns are captured by comparing different groups of countries. Moreover, evidence is found for the aggregate-level counterpart of Engel’s Law. The results have important implications when read in the context of the literature on the welfare state, de(commodification), universal basic income, and the need to adjust consumption and production in response to the looming ecological crisis.
B51|Managing the Discontent of the Losers|In the early-mid 1990s, Social Structure of Accumulation (SSA) theorists identified the solidification of a neoliberal SSA that included a capital-citizen accord based on “managing the discontent of the losers”. This created social stability by reconciling working households to material hardships emanating form the neoliberal labour market by means of either coercion or non-economic distraction. This paper argues that there was, in fact, a fundamentally material basis to the neoliberal capital-citizen accord, including the ability of households to accumulate debt in order to limit the growth of consumption inequality in the face of burgeoning income inequality. The material basis of the capital-citizen accord broke down during the financial crisis of 2007-09, destabilizing the accord itself. The result is that an SSA that has resisted top-down reform is now threatened by bottom-up “reform” in the shape of rising populism. The outcomes of this process are highly uncertain – a key characteristic of the periods of inter regnum that separate successful SSAs.
B51|Inter-Industry Wage Inequality: Persistent differences and turbulent equalization|Persistent inter-industry wage differentials are an enduring puzzle for neoclassical economics. This paper applies the classical theory of ‘real competition’ to inter-industry wage differentials. Theoretically, we argue that competitive wage determination can be decomposed into equalizing, dispersing and turbulently equalizing factors. Empirically, we show graphically and econometrically for 31 U.S. industries in 1987-2016 that wage differentials, like regulating profit rates, are governed by turbulent equalization. Furthermore, we apply a fixed effects OLS as well as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model and find that the link between regulating profit rates and wage differentials is positive, significant and robust.
B51|Production Prices Systems as derived from Labour Values Systems|Slightly changing Karl Marx procedure to calculate his production prices by keeping surplus value in the price cost of commodities, allows us to envisage a labour values system as a production prices system. The current industry rates of profit, in labour terms, are used in the calculation of these production prices which will be equalized afterwards. This work presents an alternative approach to calculate production prices and the rate of profit based in the eigenvalue and the eigenvector of the Leontief matrix. This allows us to see production prices systems as derived from labour values systems and keeping them proportional. Only after the industry rates of profit equalization occurs, i.e., when a similar remuneration to all capitals has to be assured, will prices differ necessarily from values. Prices and labour values initially form a unique system from which prices become autonomous.
B51|Less Is More: Capital Theory And Almost Irregular-Uncontrollable Actual Economies|Capital theory and the price effects consequent upon changes in the distributive variables hold center stage when it comes to the internal consistency of both classical and neoclassical theories of value. This paper briefly reviews the literature and then focuses on the detected skew eigenvalue distribution of the vertically integrated technical coefficients matrices of actual economies. The findings prompt the use of the Schur triangularization theorem for the construction even of a single industry from the input–output structure of the entire economy. Such a hyper-basic industry, in combination with hyper-non-basic industries, embodies properties that may capture the behavior of the entire economic system. Thus, we can derive some meaningful results consistent with the available empirical evidence, which finally suggest that actual economies tend to respond as ‘irregular-uncontrollable’ systems.
B51|Ricardo’s Theory of Value is Still Alive and Well in Contemporary Capitalism|The purpose of this article is, on the one hand, to shed light on some significant aspects of Ricardo's theory of value and on the other hand to show that Ricardo's insights about the explanatory power of the relative labour times on the movement of relative prices were in the right direction. For this purpose, Ricardo's theory of value is cast rigorously and in modern terms such that by using detailed intertemporal data from input-output tables of two major economies to show that Ricardo's insights are absolutely consistent with the facts.
B51|Big Business and Management: Too Many Bosses and Too Much Pay?|The mainstream or neoclassical economics view that labor is rewarded according to its productivity has been extended to managers and management teams as justification for the levels of compensation that they receive. Additionally, the management concept of “span of management” or “span of control” has been used to explain the total number of and per employee number of managers in any organization along with the assumption that the appropriate span of management is where the marginal productivity of the last manager employed should equal his/her marginal cost, or wage. On the other hand, Marxists and institutionalists hold different views of the roles and purposes of managers within organizations and attempt to explain these through either the view of managers exploiting workers on behalf of owners or the view of managers exploiting both workers and owners in order to advance their own agenda. This research note examines managerial compensation and intensity from both traditional/mainstream and alternative views by focusing on measures of managerial salaries, employee productivity, return on owners’ equity, return on assets, and rates of worker exploitation.
B51|Zur mathematischen Struktur der Wertformen von Karl Marx in 'Das Kapital'<BR>[About the mathematical structure of the form of value of Karl Marx in 'Das Kapital']|In the first section of Das Kapital by Karl Marx different forms of values are analysed. From a mathematical point of view one can find therein structures, which correspond to elements of the mathematical theory of categories. These are especially the limit of cones and the definition of subobjects as morphisms. Using the limit cone, the concept of money contains the categorial product of commodities. The concept of the value of a commodity contains the categorial definition of a subobject.
B51|The secular decline in profit rates: time series analysis of a classical hypothesis|Recent global financial crisis and ongoing turbulence in the global economy revived interest in the classical hypothesis of declining profit rates and vanishing profit opportunities as one of the reasons of economic instabilities. This paper, while not joining theoretical debate on the driving factors of profit rates’ decline, reconsiders empirically the hypothesis of the secular decline in economy-wide profit rates. A panel of unit root tests is used and deterministic and stochastic trend models (with or without structural breaks) are estimated. It is shown that instead of continuous downward trend, profit rates exhibit diverse dynamics – random walk, deterioration with breaks, reversals, or the absence of trend. Likewise, it is shown in an exploratory analysis that a variety of factors were determining profit rates, with capital productivity and competitive dynamics in the economy likely being the most salient.
B51|The Effect of Military Expenditures on the Profit Rates in Turkey|This paper analyses the effects of military expenditure on the rate of profits in Turkey during the period of 1950–2008 by employing a Markov-switching autoregression model within a Marxist framework for the first time. Findings show that the effect of military expenditure on profit rates is nonlinear—negative during turbulent years and positive in more tranquil years. The negative effects are larger than positive effects, but the probability of positive effects prevailing is larger.
B51|Monopoly Capital and Innovation: An Exploratory Assessment of R&D Effectiveness|This research note performs some limited empirical assessments of the Baran and Sweezy (1966) contention that most research and development (R&D) efforts in the US are “wasted” at the macroeconomic level in that as R&D succeeds by absorbing a little of the excess economic surplus generated by a capitalist system, it still fails to generate a lot of innovation of a transformative nature. At an aggregate level, greater R&D efforts are correlated with higher worker productivity and standards of living, which is to be expected according to mainstream economic theory and literature. Yet, R&D efforts regarding job creation, new firm creation, and net business investment show either mixed results or even negative connections. There is some preliminary empirical support in this paper for many aspects of the Baran and Sweezy point of view on R&D, and these findings also hint that R&D is used in a monopoly capital system to further monopolization. The findings of this note also may help to explain how productivity gains and innovation over the last few decades may not be benefitting the typical worker or the creation of small businesses as well.
B51|A non-linear post-Keynesian Goodwin-type endogenous model of the cycle for the USA|Since its original formulation, Goodwin’s (1967) approach became a standard endogenous business cycles model. However, despite its elegant mathematical formulation, the empirical estimation of Goodwin-type models has not always ended up in success. The present paper uses the so-called Bhaduri-Marglin accumulation function in Goodwin’s original growth cycle model. Based on its derived equations of motion and dynamic properties, we econometrically estimate the proposed model for the case of the US economy in the time period 1960-2012, using structural breaks. The empirical estimation is very satisfactory and, in general terms, consistent with economic theory and the findings by other researchers on the US economy. The results of this work suggest that the proposed approach is an appropriate vehicle for expanding and improving traditional Goodwin-type models.
B51|Sraffa on non-self-replacing systems: a note|In two passages of Production of Commodities, Sraffa states very concisely that the analysis presented also applies to viable economic systems in which the means of production consumed are not fully replaced. This aspect of the book has been nearly ignored for a long time, and only in the last two decades have some scholars begun to discuss it in depth. Since these scholars basically rely on the terse references to non-self-replacing systems appearing in Sraffa’s published works, however, a question is left pending in their contributions—what exactly was Sraffa’s position as regards the nature and relevance of those systems? The present note seeks to shed light on this question by systematically examining the pertinent passages of Sraffa’s unpublished manuscripts. On the basis of this examination, the final section briefly comments on some debatable aspects of current renditions of Sraffa’s theory.
B51|Capital, technical progress and international trade|(Abstract) CAPITAL, TECHNICAL PROGRESS AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE Much has been written about the objection originally formulated by Piero Sraffa to the use of production functions and aggregate capital and of the disputes that ensued, but there seems to be no systematic explanation in one place of why this objection is crucial to the foundations of economic theory and why the various attempts to escape it fail. This paper is an attempt provide one. First, it presents the reasoning of the objection and shows how the arguments against it are either fallacious or too restricted to be useful. Second, it shows how technical progress and international trade give two more reasons for the same objection, which, though logically independent, only became apparent because of the first. From these it follows that neither technical progress nor international trade can be plausibly described or explained if capital goods are not treated as heterogeneous goods manufactured with the use of capital goods. This leads to a more realistic depiction of technical progress as the outcome of the R&D of competing firms. (For brevity, government activities are left out.) The implications for international trade are described briefly. This paper is not a survey; it is confined to the minimum needed to establish its contentions. Its discussion of the disputes has mostly been said before, but it covers some gaps that seem to have been overlooked. It adds to the discussion in that the disputes did not take up the implications of technical progress and international trade.
B51|Airbnb, Technological Change and Disruption in Barbadian Tourism: A Theoretical Framework|This paper focuses on how Airbnb, an internet platform which has created the possibility for mass participation in the tourism market, is resulting in class conflict between new entrants and the ‘traditional’ tourism industry. Specifically, it studies how traditional tourism interests in Barbados have responded to Airbnb by seeking to restrict participation in the industry and presents this as a microcosm of broader class transitions and conflicts associated with new technologies. The paper utilises a Marxist theoretical perspective buttressed by Joseph Schumpeter’s theory of ‘creative destruction’ – places emphasis on the process of destroying productive systems to understand how specific industries expand and survive – and Clayton Christensen’s notion of ‘disruptive innovation’ – a process by which a disruptive product transforms a market – for studying how transformations in technology are impacting the tourism industry in Barbados. Its aim is to provide an account of how the process of disruption is unfolding in Barbados by highlighting the reactions of the main hotel lobby group to Airbnb, while also applying the ideas of Marx, Schumpeter and Christensen as useful theoretical lenses through which to examine the unfolding of the process of disruption of settled class and historical control of a dominant economic sector by new technologies.
B51|Demand-Led Growth Theory in a Classical Framework: Its Superiority, Its Limitations, and Its Explanatory Power|The main purpose of this paper is to show that the Keynesian-Kaleckian demand-led theory of growth proposed within the classical framework of prices and distribution as articulated by Sraffa (1960), is superior to the neoclassical supply-driven theory in explaining economic growth. After showing the fundamental theoretical problem with the neoclassical supply-driven approach to growth, we expound a demand-led model of growth that abandons ‘steady-state’ and, instead, adopts an ‘historical approach’ in which the data is specified for historical periods of time. The model incorporates the contribution of technical progress to demand-led growth and, thereby, provides the basis to identify the most important political, social, and institutional developments that historically explain growth and economic development since the advent of capitalism. Our historical analysis shows how demand-led growth theory can provide the foundation for a new and more coherent interpretation of the history of economic development.
B51|On The Second Stage Of The Cambridge Capital Controversy|The second stage of the Cambridge capital controversy concerns the neo‐Walrasian theory of value and distribution. Since production is not understood in this theory as employing factors of production but rather commodities, that is goods and services with date and place of delivery, some scholars maintained that it is not affected by the problems that emerged, during the first stage of the controversy, as regards the conception of capital as a factor of production and the rate of interest as the price for its use. The reply of the ‘neo‐Ricardians’ was based on two arguments. The first regarded the relevance of the new notions of equilibrium adopted in the neo‐Walrasian approach, with particular reference to temporary and Arrow–Debreu equilibria, and the second the possibility that the phenomena of re‐switching and reverse capital deepening, by affecting the working of the saving‐investment market, could cause equilibrium multiplicity and instability also in a neo‐Walrasian framework.
B51|On the Origins of Piero Sraffa’s Equations. New Evidence Following Pierangelo Garegnani’s Lead|The paper investigates the origins of the equations which form the structure of Piero Sraffa’s Production of Commodities by means of Commodities. Following an interpretation first developed by Pierangelo Garegnani in a paper that highlighted the importance of a manuscript headed ‘Notes Lon-don, Summer 1927 (Physical Real Costs etc.)’, we single out new evidence relevant to the reconstruction of the path which led Sraffa to conceive his equations. In particular, we stress how Sraffa came to pay special attention to the case of a subsistence economy (‘a community that produces just what is sufficient to keep it going’) and how this led him to shift his attention from the idea of reducing heterogeneous physical costs to an ‘absolutely necessary commodity’ to the determination of exchange ratios by the solution of systems of simultaneous equations.
B51|Crestere economica, acumulare ?i dezechilibre în România perioadei comuniste|The main economic results of the Romanian centralized planification and the dictatorial policy applied in Romania during the 1948-1989 period are analysed in this paper. During the first stage known as an extensive development, Romania was industrialized and almost the whole economic branches were modernized by a huge resource mobilization. In the circumstances of the obsession of high rates of growth, the heavy industry priority, the very high accumulation rates and the rejection of any elementary market mechanism, the socialist economic system was driven to a very deep and irreversible crisis.
B51|The Dialectical View Of Real And Financial Crises In Marx'S Thought|Economic crises are a recurrent topic in Marx’s works, but nowhere does he deal with this subject in a systematic way. Nevertheless, we do find many considerations that are consistent with a systematic and complete view of crises as dialectical moments in the movement of capitalist economies. According to Marx, the ultimate cause of all actual crises is always the contradiction between subjective and objective goals in the capitalist mode of production. But in the real world there are several direct causes of economic crises, each of which can randomly prevail over the others to trigger the phenomenon. However, the different causes are random only in prevailing as prime mover, not in terms of their presence or absence. The paper deals with the reconstruction of Marx’s dialectical view of economic and financial crises, analysing many passages in Capital and Theories of Surplus-Value, but especially in Economic Manuscripts of 1857-58 (Grundrisse).
B51|From Long-Term Growth To Secular Stagnation. A Theoretical Comparison Between Régulation Theory, Marxist Approaches And Present Mainstream Interpretations|Since 2013 various eminent mainstream economists have proposed reviving the doctrine of “secular stagnation”. According to these authors, the only explanation for this new trend could be a negative Wicksellian natural rate of interest, produced by an excess of saving over investment at any positive interest rate. But the idea that the real world economy has entered into a new stagnation trend is really the other side of the coin in explaining the extraordinary long-term growth that characterised the aftermath of World War II. This peculiar growth period has been the main research objective of Régulation Theory, which found accumulation regimes and corresponding modes of regulation as its major determinants. In the paper the theoretical explanations of the new secular stagnation theory are compared with those of Régulation theory and with the original Marxist approaches that initially inspired the French régulation theorists.
B51|Sraffa’s Silenced Revival of the Classical Economists and of Marx|The standpoint of the old classical economists as well as of Marx “has been submerged and forgotten since the advent of the ‘marginal’ method” – to borrow Sraffa’s own words. The neoclassical (or ‘marginal’) paradigm, in fact, triumphantly dominated over the twentieth century (and is still dominating even now). A serious step towards the rehabilitation of the paradigm of the old classical economists was made by Sraffa (1951) with his remarkable ‘Introduction’ to Ricardo’s Principles, his seminal 1960 book Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities (PCMC) followed a few years later, as a logical completion of his long-standing work. The paper here proposed argues that Sraffa’s 1960 contribution has so far been mainly interpreted and used as a highly powered tool for destroying the foundations of neoclassical theory from a logical point of view, with the confident belief that attacking the logical side of the theory would have been sufficient to bring about its definite dismissal, which, instead, did not happen. As a consequence of all this, the revival of the classical economists and of Marx – which is one of the most characterizing feature of Sraffa’s 1960 contribution – was automatically silenced and this very fact precluded Sraffa’s theoretical framework from being used in a constructive way as a real alternative ‘vision’ to that proposed by the neoclassical market-centered paradigm. The aim of the paper is to underscore the crucial importance of Sraffa’s revival referred to above, by emphasizing its usefulness in providing a genuine alternative perspective and a radically different representation of the economy, compared with that provided by neoclassical theory. An attempt will be made to show the main features of the Sraffian framework in providing such an alternative ‘vision’ which, it will be argued, is now much needed, not least for suggesting far more sensible alternative economic policies than those so far pursued in the ceaseless turmoil of present day world economies.
B51|The commodities boom and the profit squeeze: output and profit cycles in Brazil (1996-2016)|The aim of the present paper is to contribute to the understanding of the recent Brazilian crisis by arguing that it was related to a cyclical profit squeeze that took place between 2010 and 2014, following the long cyclical expansion that started in 2003. To do so, the cyclical trajectories of output and profit rates in the Brazilian economy, throughout the five business cycles that took place between 1996 and 2016, are examined by resorting to the part of the framework established by Weisskopf (1979) that focuses on cycles. The results indicate that profit squeezes are rare in the Brazilian economy, possibly due to the truncated character and the weakness of the business cyclesâ€™ expansions. However, a profit squeeze did took place in the last cycle partly as result of the commodities boom, which attenuated the foreign vulnerability of the economy and allowed for a longer than usual expansion.
B51|Marx's Analysis of Ground-Rent: Theory, Examples and Applications|This paper offers a unified analytical treatment of Marx’s theory of ground-rent, building on the analysis that is available in Volume Three of Capital. Since ground-rent is a transformation of surplus profit generated in agriculture, the main argument is developed in two steps. In the first step, I derive results on the existence of surplus profit in capitalist agriculture in the absence of landed property. In the second step, I used these results on surplus profit to arrive at the total ground-rent that is appropriated by the owners of land, and also decompose it into the three components that Marx highlighted: absolute rent, differential rent I, and differential rent II. I argue that the power of Marx’s analysis lies in the fact that it can be generalised far beyond the domain of agriculture, which he had analysed, and can illuminate the emergence of rent in any system of capitalist commodity production that uses privately owned non-produced resources that is limited in quantity. Hence, Marx’s analysis of ground-rent can be used to investigate many interesting issues in contemporary capitalism.
B51|Does the Steindl-Dutt Investment Function Rule Out Profit-Led Expansion?|Bhaduri and Marglin (1990) had argued that an investment function which has the profit rate and the capacity utilization rates as the two determinants of investment imposes unwarranted restrictions on the macroeconomic model and rules out profit-led expansion. In this paper, I show that this critique only holds in a closed economy model. In an open economy model, such an investment function does not rule out profit-led expansion. I argue that the problem was less in the investment function itself than in the larger model within which it was embedded, in particular the saving behavior of the macroeconomy entailed by the model.
B51|Unproductive Activities and the Rate of Surplus Value at the Industry Level in Korea, 1995–2015|In order to explain how the Korean economy underwent the structural change through the two crises of 1997-8 and 2008 within the context of globalization, this article focuses on class analysis and inter-sectoral value transfer by estimating the sectoral rates of exploitation along with the sectoral monetary expressions of labor time. Our data indicate the possibility that the expansion of unproductive activities, accompanied by intensification of exploitation within the unproductive sectors, might not have overtaken capital accumulation in Korea during 1995–2015. It can also be concluded that the condition for manufacturing’s capital accumulation steadily improved since the 1997–8 crisis, but started to deteriorate after 2011. Our value–theoretic analysis provides a foundation for understanding the context of the regime change, which may plausibly characterize the Korean economy last couple of decades.
B51|"Addendum to ""Marx's Analysis of Ground-Rent : Theory, Examples and Applications"""|In a recent paper, I had proposed an analytical framework to understand Marx’s theory of ground-rent. An important question had been left unaddressed in the paper : how are the price and output levels (of the agricultural commodity) determined in a way that can both take account of fluctuations in market demand and also embed profit-maximizing behavior of the capitalist-farmers? In this note, I offer a simple way to think about the determination of equilibrium levels of price and output for the agricultural commodity that makes explicit two important dimensions: (a) the role of aggregate demand for the agricultural commodity, and (b) profit maximizing behavior of the capitalist farmers.
B51|A Puzzle about the Monetary Expression of Labor Time : An Equilibrating Mechanism or Just A Coincidence?|In this paper, we report a puzzling result about the monetary expressions of labor time (MELTs) of the productive and unproductive sectors. Since part of the aggregate value produced in productive sectors is transferred to unproductive sectors, the productive sector’s MELT is a measure of value realized in productive sectors while the unproductive sector’s MELT is a measure of value transferred to unproductive sectors. Using the national income data for the U.S. economy during 1987-2016 and for the Korean economy during 1993-2016, it is found that the MELT of the aggregate productive sector and the MELT of the aggregate unproductive sector have been moving in a very close lockstep in both countries during the entire sample periods. We build a model which explicitly formalizes the unproductive sector as not producing any value but making the value production process efficient, and find that the co–movement of the two MELTs is not an optimal condition. We also suggest some ex post implications of it, including what the puzzling result implies on the relation between unproductive sector and capital accumulation.
B51|Karl Marx's thoughts on functional income distribution - a critical analysis|Keynes, following the tradition of Marx, argued that all values are created by labour and profits. However, functional income distribution between wages and profits is explained differently. In Marx's explanation of functional income distribution, wages are given as a basket of goods needed for the reproduction needs of the working class. Profits are then the remaining part of income creation. Given the capital stock, the profit rate can be calculated. The paper shows that Marx's explanation of functional income distribution has several theoretical and practical shortcomings. The Keynesian paradigm in the tradition of the original Keynes provides an alternative. Here the profit rate is given by processes in the financial market, and, among other things, by the interest rate. Monopolistic or oligopolistic structures, following the tradition of Kalecki, can also influence the profit rate. In addition, financialisation can push up the profit rate. Given the capital stock the consumption basket of workers depends on the level of productivity and the profit rate explained in a Keynesian and Kaleckian way.
B51|A network model for the complex behavior of the rate of profit: Exploring a simulation model with overlapping technological revolutions|This article proposes a network model to replicate the behaviour of the profit rate in the long run. Specifically, it accounts for the results of an empirical investigation of the profit rate in the US, which show that it has fractal properties and its complexity changes over time. The starting point of the model is MarxÂ’s insights on the interplay between the tendency of the rate to fall and its countertendencies. It combines these insights with the persistent generation of new commodities Â– inventions Â– and a specific set of new branches of production that triggers technological revolutions. A simulation running this network model successfully replicates historical features of the system.
B51|Determinantes de las relaciones reales de intercambio de España con Alemania (1970-2010). Un análisis econométrico de la ventaja absoluta de costo intrasectorial|El presente trabajo tiene como objeto analizar los determinantes de las relaciones reales de intercambio de España con Alemania, tomando como período 1970-2010. Para tal propósito, se lleva a cabo un análisis de series temporales aplicando pruebas de raíces unitarias y un test de cointegración, siendo el marco teórico de referencia el enfoque de Anwar Shaikh de la ventaja absoluta de costo intrasectorial. Finalmente, el análisis econométrico constata que el tipo de cambio real efectivo entre España y Alemania se encuentra sujeto en el largo plazo a los costos laborales unitarios reales relativos de la industria manufacturera de ambos países. ***** The main aim of this paper is to analyse the determinants of the real terms of trade between Spain and Germany during the 1970-2010 period. In order to do so, we have used unit root and cointegration tests, in which our theoretical framework is the absolute cost advantage that was developed by Anwar Shaikh. Finally, our econometric analysis discovered that the real effective rate exchange between Spain and Germany is, in the long term, subject to the real unit labour costs of manufacturing sectors.

Only in a scenario in which distributive conflicts are resolved through negotiation processes between the parties, recognizing the tensions and interests of the classes, will it be possible to move towards a democratic model of inclusive growth that penalizes predatory and nepotist behaviors, based on ""Extractive political and economic institutions"""
B51|La determinación de los precios en la teoría económica de Sir James Steuart|Resumen: Este artículo tiene como objetivo interpretar la teoría de los precios de Sir James Steuart. Para tal fin, se adopta la perspectiva clásica de los precios de producción, razón por la cual es necesario introducir hipótesis que justifiquen en Steuart la existencia de un excedente productivo y su norma de distribución. Sin embargo, los precios son determinados por los comerciantes y no por los productores, a través de un proceso teórico que implica distinguir dos etapas analíticas: por un lado, el acto privado del comerciante que determina los precios de venta y, por otro lado, el acto colectivo o competitivo que determina los precios de compra o de mercado. Al final se muestra que, si bien se puede justificar un análisis de los precios desde una perspectiva clásica, Steuart conserva su lugar en la tradición mercantilista. / Abstract : The aim of this paper is to interpret James Steuart’s theory of prices. To achieve this purpose, specials hypothesis about the surplus and his distribution rule are included into the classical theory of production prices. However, prices are determined by merchants and not by manufacturers, through a theoretical process that involves two analytical stages: on the one hand, the private act of the merchant determines the sales prices and, on the other hand, the collective or competitive act of the merchants determines the purchase prices. Although it is possible to demonstrate an affiliation of Stueart's thinking to the classical approach, he continues as a mercantilist economist.

B51|Surplus Value Production and Realization in Marxian Theory - Applications to the U.S., 1987-2015|This paper highlights the separation between surplus value production and realization in Marx's work. A new method of estimating surplus value production at the industry level is proposed and implemented. Marx's procedure of transforming labor values into prices of production shows that capitalist competition to equalize the profit rate entails transfers of surplus value across industries, thus differentials between surplus value created and surplus value realized as profit can exist at the industry level. These types of transfers can also exist between productive and unproductive activities in the circuit of capital. First, to trace out these transfers, a framework linking money value added to surplus value production by industry is established. Second, data on value added by industry for the U.S. are used to estimate surplus value production at the industry level. The analysis allows comparison of surplus value production and realization in each industry. The pattern of differentials between surplus value creation and realization across industries points to a potential source of instability for capitalist economies.
B51|Unproductive accumulation in the United States: a new analytical framework|In this paper I offer an innovative analysis of unproductive accumulation in the United States economy from 1947 to 2011. I develop a new theoretical and empirical framework to analyze the accumulation of capital in its productive and unproductive forms. I also develop a methodology to compute Marxist categories predicated on the idea that the production of knowledge and information is an unproductive activity that relies on the creation of knowledge-rents. In particular, I provide new empirical estimates to uncover the shifting balance between productive and unproductive forms of accumulation. The accumulation pattern observed during the 1947-1979 phase that prioritized productive accumulation gave way after the 1980s to a contrasting pattern prioritizing unproductive accumulation. Unproductive activity has been growing at a fast pace in terms of incomes, fixed assets, and employment. Among all forms of unproductive activity, my approach places special attention on how the production of knowledge and information has constituted a rising share of total unproductive income and capital stock. Additionally, productive stagnation and rapid unproductive accumulation have been related to greater exploitation of productive workers and to widening income inequality.
B51|Effective demand and Say’s law in Marxist theory: an evolutionary perspective|In this paper I theorize the roles of effective demand and Say’s Law in the Marxist theory of exploitation and accumulation. I claim that an exogenous rate of exploitation implies deploying the strongest version of Say’s Law, which leads profit rates not to equalize across sectors. Marx’s own procedure in Capital III was therefore logically mistaken. Once Keynes’ principle of effective demand is introduced, the rate of exploitation, and hence the distribution of income between wages and profits, becomes endogenous to aggregate demand. Profit rates can then equalize across sectors and prices of production can function as gravitational centers for market prices in a competitive economy. I develop an innovative evolutionary approach to demonstrate how effective demand, within the Marxist framework, determines the rate of exploitation and the rate of profit. At the intersection of Marx, Keynes, and Kalecki, my evolutionary framework integrates effective demand, functional income distribution, profit rate equalization, technological diffusion, and the gravitation towards prices of production.
B51|Invitation to Think: Technology and Sustainability – A Utopia Paradigm|"""Objective – This paper pursues an approach of archaeological meditations into human achievement and its fruits; meditations in search of the possibility and the means of conditioning innovations in a manner that can harness these innovations to make ""sustainable development"" a reality that goes beyond mere ""utopian dreams."" The process seems like a feast for the thinking and inquiry: what do we do about the experienced paradox of the times: the abundant wealth of the scientific technological experience with its ever-evolving revolutions of innovation on one hand, and a plethora of deeply-rooted ever-increasing problems manifested in the issues of sustained development that challenge present creativity while pursuing the dream. Methodology/Technique – In this research, previous studies reviewed extensively. Findings – In conclusion, we intended our approach to be a feast for thinking based on the Aristotelian concept of """"the will to live together,"""" in order to foster mature and responsible thinking methodologies. This can be possible when the philosophical mind comprehensively and radically tackles existing and future realities, in light of the present situation while contending with irresponsible practices, to achieve a transition from mental deficiency to maturity as a first step towards a productive system for human activity in general. Novelty – The study justifies that we intended our approach to be a feast for thinking based on the Aristotelian concept of """"the will to live together,"""" to foster mature and responsible thinking methodologies."""
B51|Globalisation and inequality in a dynamic economy: an axiomatic analysis of unequal exchange|Abstract An axiomatic analysis of the concept of unequal exchange (UE) between countries is developed in a dynamic general equilibrium model that generalises John Roemer’s (Central Planning and the Soviet Economy, MIT Press, Cambridge, 1983) economy with a global capital market. The class of UE definitions that satisfy three fundamental properties—including a correspondence between wealth, class and UE exploitation status—is completely characterised. It is shown that this class is nonempty and a definition of UE exploitation between countries is proposed, which is theoretically robust and firmly anchored to empirically observable data. The full class and UE exploitation structure of the international economy is derived in equilibrium.
B51|One Million Miles to Go: Taking the Axiomatic Road to Defining Exploitation|This paper analyses the Marxian theory of exploitation. A general axiomatic approach is developed which is appropriate to study the concept of exploitation - what it is and how it should be captured empirically. Two properties are presented that capture some fundamental Marxian insights. It is shown that, contrary to the received view, there exists a nonempty class of definitions of exploitation that preserve the relation between exploitation and profits - called Profit- Exploitation Correspondence Principle - in general economies with heterogeneous agents, complex class structures, and production technologies with heterogeneous labour inputs. However, among the main approaches, only the so-called ‘New Interpretation’ satisfies the Profit- Exploitation Correspondence Principle in general.
B51|Elementi di pensiero economico nello Stato commerciale chiuso di J. G. Fichte|"Questo scritto analizza i contributi dello Stato Commerciale Chiuso (1800) di Johann Gottlieb Fichte all'economia politica nel loro complesso. Presenta l'interpretazione del diritto di proprietÃ del filosofo tedesco come un a priori fondamentale del suo metodo economico. Quanto deriva da questa interpretazione - principalmente l'impianto di un'economia pianificata centralmente - appare il risultato di una costituzione economica ""razionale"" che perviene a un equilibrio di stampo socialista ma senza un calcolo economico esplicito. Il paper fornisce anche una nuova e diversa interpretazione dell'""anarchia dei mercati"" di Fichte, riconducendola a un esito derivante dal ""fallimento dei mercati"" stessi. Questi argomenti vengono discussi, infine, in una prospettiva comportamentale che giustifica l'attenzione di Fichte verso gli stili economici (Wirtschaftsstil) quale caratteristica tipica della tradizione economica tedesca."
B51|Regularities in Prices of Production and the Concentration of Compositions of Capitals|Recent developments in price of production models have proposed a hypothesis on the structure of the input coefficient matrices to explain the empirical near-linearity and monotonicity found in prices as a function of income distribution - the tendency towards zero of subdominant eigenvalues. The objective of this paper is twofold: First, based on the behavior of observed eigenvalues, the paper shows that they cannot explain by their own the regularities found in prices of production. Second, it is shown theoretically and empirically the existence and relevance of an additional force acting on the input matrix and the labor coefficient vector: the concentration of industries' vertically integrated compositions of capital around their average. It is argued that the combined effect of these two factors produces the empirical regularities in relative prices. The tendency of the vertically integrated labor to means of production proportions to cluster around their average reveals the existence of an economic force acting on the structure of technology of observable economies and calls for an explanation. The paper relies on the US 1987- 2007 Input-Output accounts, at the highest disaggregation level (between 370-466 sectors), for the empirical evidence in this paper.
B51|The Political Economy of Real Exchange Rate Behavior: Theory and Empirical Evidence for Developed and Developing Countries, 1960-2010|Empirical results of the PPP hypothesis have constantly shown that relative prices do not converge to the same level, neither in the short nor the long run. Therefore the PPP explanation of the determination of the real exchange rate is not operative to get a reasonable measure of competitiveness at the international level. In this paper, we put forth a different approach based on the works of Ricardo, Marx, Harrod, and Shaikh, which argues that the real relative unit labor cost is the main force that explains the long-run behavior of the real exchange rate. In the second section of the paper we explain the theoretical underpinnings of our proposed approach. In the third section we analyze the role of the real interest rate differential in explaining real exchange rate misalignments. In the fourth section, we present a graphical analysis of the interrelation among the real effective exchange rate, the real unit labor cost ratio, the short-run real interest rate differential, and the trade balance for sixteen OECD countries, Taiwan, and three developing countries for the period 1960-2010. In the fifth section we investigate the long-run relationship between the latter three indexes through cointegrating and error correction models using the ARDLECM framework. The last section provides our conclusions.
B51|Monopoly Capital and Entrepreneurism: Whither Small Business?|There has been a growing literature over the last several years on a possible decline in US entrepreneurship and the reasons for it. US small business formation and the jobs created by small businesses are supposed to be key elements in US economic growth. Many claim that without growth in small businesses and the jobs they provide that the US economy will either not grow at all or only very slowly. Therefore, small business formation is a possible key to understanding capitalism in the 21st century since under monopoly capital there is claimed to be a tendency toward economic stagnation. Some of the general causes mentioned for less US entrepreneurism include high levels of personal debt (mortgages, student loans, credit cards, etc.) among the US populace and the increasing challenges that small businesses face against larger ones. Another concern is the amount of increasing business regulation and government presence in the US economy with which small businesses struggle more than larger ones. If entrepreneurism requires risk taking, then high levels of household debt and large, well-financed potential competitors may be hindering prospective entrepreneurs. This exploratory paper finds that high levels of household debt, the increasing size of existing businesses, and government size are highly correlated with the slowdown in the entry rates of new firms into the US economy since the late 1970s as well as with a slowdown in the job creation rate of these firms.

B51|Value, Price, And Exploitation: The Logic Of The Transformation Problem|This paper tries to clarify the logical structure of the relationship between labor values and prices from an axiomatic perspective. The famous â€œtransformation problemâ€ is interpreted as an impossibility result for a specific interpretation of value theory based on specific assumptions and definitions. A comprehensive review of recent literature is provided, which shows that there are various theoretically relevant and logically consistent alternative interpretations based on different assumptions and definitions.
B51|Financialisation: Dimensions and determinants. A cross-country study|The financialisation literature has grown over the past two decades. While there is a generally accepted definition, effectively financialisation has been used to describe very different phenomena. This paper proposes a multi-faceted notion of financialisation by distinguishing between financialisation of non-financial companies, households and the financial sector and using activity as well as vulnerability measures of financialisation. We identify seven financialisation hypotheses in the literature and empirically investigate them in a cross-country analysis for 17 OECD countries for the 1997-2007 period. We find that different financialisation measures are only weakly correlated, which suggests the existence of distinct financialisation processes. There is strong evidence across all sectors that financialisation is closely linked to asset price inflation and correlated with a debt-driven demand regime. Financial deregulation encourages financialisation, especially in the financial and household sector. By contrast, there is limited evidence that market-based financial systems tend to be more financialised, meaning financialisation can occur with large banks. Foreign financial inflows do not seem to be a main driver. We do not find indication that a secular investment slowdown precedes financialisation. Overall, our findings suggest that financialisation should be understood as variegated process, playing out differently across economic sectors in different countries.
B51|Garegnani, Ackley and the years of high theory at Svimez|In the late 1950s, Svimez was an influential research centre on Italian economic and regional policies. It was advised and visited by top international development experts and by leading Italian economists. Pierangelo Garegnani, fresh from his seminal Ph.D. thesis on capital theory at Cambridge, wrote a report for Svimez, published in 1962, on the relevance of Keynes’ theory for economies at an intermediate stage of development, like Italy. Interestingly, in 1963 Gardner Ackley published a similar report for Svimez. The theoretical parts of Garegnani’s report were published in English in 1978-79 and 2015. In a final applied section, which has not yet been published, Garegnani estimates that a fuller utilisation of productive capacity would have allowed for the creation of 550 thousand additional jobs without problems relating to the balance of payments. In this section, Garegnani also raises several interesting theoretical issues. Ackley’s report is an econometric explanation of the Italian ‘economic miracle’ based on a demand-led growth supermultiplier model – a theoretical approach re-discovered by Bortis and Serrano, and recently taken up by Marc Lavoie and others. A comparison between these two genuine Keynesian approaches looks very promising.
B51|Is Marx’S Absolute Rent Due To A Monopoly Price?|Absolute rent, in Marx’s view, has an upper limit represented by the difference between the value and the price of production of agricultural commodities. The actual relevance of this limit was questioned by Bortkiewicz and other scholars because of the difficulties concerning the argument which Marx based it on. The lack of this upper limit prompted a number of scholars to claim that there is no difference between absolute rent and a rent paid by a monopoly price. Referring to the classical/Marxian theory of monopoly price, we shall argue that is still possible— notwithstanding the missing upper limit—to distinguish absolute rent from a rent actually due to a monopoly price. In particular, the difference between the two rests on the removability (in the case of absolute rent) or the persistency (in the case of monopoly rent) of the obstacle to the expansion of agricultural production.
B51|Long-Term Stagnation And Financialisation. A Theoretical Comparison Between Kaleckian And Neo-Marxist Approaches|Subsequent to the financial crisis of 2007-2008 there has been a revival of theories on the possibility of a “secular stagnation”. Some of these theories hark back to Alvin Hansen’s doctrine, developed on Keynesian bases. Nevertheless, they have shifted attention toward a disproportion between saving and investment only explained on the basis of demographic and technological factors, typical of a neoclassical framework of growth theory. However, the idea that neo-capitalist economies have an inherent tendency to stagnation has also long been the main research objective of many heterodox economists, in particular Kaleckian and neo-Marxist, who found stagnation to be a major result of the monopolistic nature of big corporations and the features of their monopolistic forms of competition. The paper deals with some of these theories and focuses on the role that corporate governance in big corporations can play in producing growing corporate savings and putting them into financial channels.
B51|CLASSES, CAPITAL AND THE SOCIAL FORMS IN BETWEEN - On the political and intellectual organization of the contradiction|This working paper focusses on a rigorous and somewhat idiosyncratic exposition of the concepts of dialectics, determinations of reflection (or essentialities) and social forms, adopting a Marxist reading of Hegel's Science of Logic. The objective of this focus is to address one of the elements highly common in debates between Marxists and post-structuralists e amongst Marxist themselves: the centrality of categories of the one (like Universality, necessity, identity and so on) or of the multiple (like particularity, contingency, difference etc). Hence, the focus of this work is on the centrality of reflexive or mutual determinations (essence, non-identical identity, contradictory unity and social forms). Initially, even though Marx and some Marxist authors had used the notion of social forms, none of them had this notion developed in itself. The specific developments of this notion: such as the value forms, commodity form, political and juridical social forms were explored by various authors and by Marx himself. But, in the literature review made for this research, it wasn't found any conceptualization of the general notion. The concept of social form can be explored as a methodological resource to mediate those above-mentioned elements of the debates. For instance, to centralize the social forms is to centralize the negative and reflexive element when we discuss if it's the capital and its tendency laws that make for the historical march or the class struggle and the political contingency. The focus is on the something that exists in-between, the objectivation process in itself, not in its extremes
B51|The Structure and Content of Das Kapital|Karl Marxâ€™s magnum opus, Das Kapital, presents an analysis of the long run dynamics of a mature capitalist economy. The analysis is conducted at two primary levels of abstraction â€“ â€˜capital in generalâ€™ (where competition between individual capitals is abstracted from) and â€˜many capitalsâ€™ (where the phenomenon of competition between individual capitals is introduced) â€“ and the presentation is organized into three volumes. In terms of structure, the analysis in the first two volumes is located at the level of â€˜capital in generalâ€™, and the analysis in the third volume is located at the level of â€˜many capitalsâ€™. In terms of content, the first volume analyses the production and accumulation of surplus value, the second volume investigates the problems of realization of surplus value, and the third volume analyses the mechanisms that lead to the distribution of surplus value into income streams of different fractions of the ruling class â€“ as profit of enterprise, commercial profit, interest and rent (and monopoly profit more generally). The three volumes together give a comprehensive picture of the workings of a mature capitalist economy and highlights its long run, contradictory tendencies.
B51|A Unified Marxist Approach to Accumulation and Crisis in Capitalist Economies|An economic crisis in capitalism is a deep and prolonged interruption of the economy-wide circuit of capital. Crises emerge from within the logic of capitalismâ€™s operation, and are manifestations of the inherently contradictory process of capital accumulation. The Marxist tradition conceptualizes two types of crisis tendencies in capitalism : a crisis of deficient surplus value and a crisis of excess surplus value. Two mechanisms that become important in crises of deficient surplus value are the rising organic composition of capital and the profit squeeze; two mechanisms that are salient in crisis of excess surplus value are problems of insufficient aggregate demand and increased financial fragility. This paper offers a synthetic and synoptic account of the Marxist literature on capitalist economic crises.
B51|Advanced or postponed wage payments: Sraffa validates Marx|In his theoretical model of production prices Marx follows the classical economists in treating wages as being paid in advance. Sraffa, instead, tends to treat them as being paid post factum. However, when Marx tackles the problem under less abstract scrutiny, he abandons the classical approach and declares that, as a matter of fact, wages are postponed. We prove that, if the period of postponed wage payment differs from the length of the production process, the correct prices are better approximated by an equation with the full post-payment of wages than by one with full pre-payment. Under perfect competition and postponed wage payments, Sraffa’s approach to price determination is the correct one, and validates Marx’s non-classical vision, whatever the period of wage payment.
B51|Beyond the traditional monetary circuit: endogenous money, finance and the theory of long-period effective demand|The paper is a contribution to a long-run theory of effective demand with elements from monetary circuit theory, Modern Monetary Theory and endogenous finance analysis. Some shortcomings of the still influential neo-Kaleckian growth model and monetary circuit theory are underlined, and the Sraffian supermultiplier is indicated as the most promising heterodox approach to growth and instability in capitalism. The Sraffian supermultiplier allows full consideration of the autonomous components of aggregate demand as the ultimate sources of growth and instability in modern capitalism. Following Steindl, capital gains are included among these components. Autonomous demand and investment are typically fed by endogenous finance. The paper articulates the relation between autonomous demand and investment on one hand, and endogenous finance on the other, in the light of Keynes’s distinction between initial and final finance.
B51|Financialization, Housing Bubble, and the Great Recession: an interpretation based on a circuit of capital model|This paper offers an interpretation of the Great Recession based on Foley’s circuit of capital model. It is maintained that the contractionary effects of financialization were compensated by the housing bubble, from the mid-1990s to the early 2006. The busting of the bubble, then, was followed by the crisis. The model is calibrated with reference to quarterly data from the Flow of Funds Accounts, from 1960 to 1995. The interaction of financialization and the housing bubble, from 1996 to 2006 and from 2006 to 2009, is examined by simulating a baseline version of the model and imposing the observed shocks

Este trabajo usa el modelo insumo-producto para el análisis económico. Se aplican 2 enfoques no usados tradicionalmente para la economía colombiana: análisis de descomposición espectral (Dietzenbacher, 1992) e identificación de clústeres (Garbellini y Wirkierman, 2014). El resultado es la construcción de indicadores de encadenamientos sin sesgo de sobrestimación o subestimación, y la identificación de clústeres de manera endógena. Adicionalmente se derivan los flujos de trabajo incorporado que se propagan a través de la red productiva. Cada uno de estos flujos se descompone en indicadores que permiten caracterizar los clústeres de acuerdo a su cercanía con la demanda final, su grado de cohesión con la red y su importancia para el resto del sistema.
B51|The Dynamics of Exploitation and Class in Accumulation Economies|This paper analyses the equilibrium dynamics of exploitation and class in accumulation economies with population growth, technical change and bargaining by adopting a novel computational approach. First, the determinants of the emergence and persistence of exploitation and class are investigated, and the role of laborâ€ saving technical change and, even more importantly, power is highlighted. Second, it is shown that the concept of exploitation provides the foundations for a logically coherent and empirically relevant analysis of inequalities and class relations in advanced capitalist economies. An index that identifies the exploitation level, or intensity of each individual can be defined and its distribution studied using the standard tools developed in the theory of inequality measurement.
B51|The Gravitation of Market Prices as A Stochastic Process|The theory of value has been based ever since Adam Smith on the idea that the market prices of commodities, those at which actual trade takes place, gravitate around a central position known as natural prices. This paper seeks to develop a statistical idea of the process in question and suggests in particular that market prices can be said to gravitate around natural prices if the probability of their means being very close to natural prices after t observations tends to 1 as t tends to infinity. A set of possible conditions leading to that result is also presented.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B51|Structural Heterogeneity in Capitalism: A View from the Marxist Abstract Labor Theory of Value|This text deals with the analysis of the phenomenon of heterogeneity in capitalist economies with the presence of sectors that are known, in different theoretical traditions, as “informal”, “marginality”, “popular economy”, etc. This is made with Marxist categories and from the “New Approach” paradigm (or the “Abstract Labor Theory of Value”. The node of the analysis is focused in the use of two notions: the coexistence of different “forms of production” in economies dominated by the capitalist mode of production, and the assimilation, in analytical terms, of these alternative non-capitalist forms of production to the Marxist category of Simple Commodity Economy. We analyze the role of simple commodity production in the basic operation of the capitalist economy, especially in the operation of the proletarianization and wage setting: we analyze the conditions of the coexistence of capitalist and petty commodity producers in a same market; and made some exploration on the articulation of the phenomenon of unemployment in an economy that includes both mentioned forms of production.

This work uses the input-output (I/O) model for economic analysis. Two approaches, not traditionally used, are applied to analyse the Colombian economy: spectrum of different I/O coefficient matrices (Dietzenbacher, 1992) and clustering techniques (Garbellini y Wirkierman, 2014). As a result, indicators of linkages are obtained without bias of overestimation or underestimation. Additionally, clusters are identified endogenously. Furthermore, embodied labour flows that spread through the network-production are calculated. Each of these flows is broken down into indicators that characterise the clusters according to their proximity to final demand, to their degree of cohesion to the network, and to their importance for the rest of the system.
B51|Cálculo de la Productividad Sectorial en Colombia con Herramientas Insumo-Producto|En este trabajo se adopta la recomendación de Felipe y McCombie (2007) y Pasinetti (1987) de medir la productividad desde un punto de vista desagregado. De esta manera, es posible entender el comportamiento inter-sectorial, frente a los distintos escenarios por los que atraviesa la economía. Para tal fin, se hace uso de las herramientas basadas en el modelo Insumo-Producto: fraccionamiento del sistema productivo en clústeres y cálculo de la productividad laboral total por subsistemas verticalmente integrados. Se usan los clústeres identificados por Villamil y Hernández (2016) para clasificar los sectores y, a partir de allí, se logró establecer las fuentes del cambio de productividad: de acuerdo al clúster de origen. Se encuentran 29 sectores dinámicos en el período 2005-2012. Dentro de estos últimos, se destacan los sectores con vocación hacia la intermediación (comercio, finanzas y transporte) y algunos sectores de la industria manufacturera (equipo de transporte, maquinaria eléctrica y mecánica). Se encuentra, que en los sectores no-dinámicos, existe una alta incidencia negativa sobre la productividad generada dentro de su propio clúster. Se concluye resaltando la necesidad de ahondar en el estudio de las relaciones interindustriales a nivel de sector o, incluso, a nivel de firma.
B51|Pronóstico del Consumo Privado: Usando datos de alta frecuencia para el pronóstico de variables de baja frecuencia|Uno de los componentes más importantes del PIB es el consumo de los hogares, por lo cual el pronóstico de esta variable es clave para poder evaluar y predecir el comportamiento de la actividad económica. En este trabajo se introducen dos elementos innovadores para su predicción, primero se incorpora dentro de la función de consumo el índice de confianza al consumidor, con el fin de involucrar un indicador líder del comportamiento de los consumidores y el segundo es el uso de metodologías econométricas en las que se incorporan series de alta frecuencia para el pronóstico de series de baja frecuencia, con el fin de no perder información que pueda ser valiosa. Se encuentra que el pronóstico dentro de la muestra ha sido bastante cercano a los datos reales, aunque los intervalos de confianza del pronóstico pueden ser amplios.
B51|Underconsumption, capitalist investment and crisis: a reply to Sardoni|Sardoni (2015) presents an underconsumptionist reading of Marxâ€™s crisis theory and argues for developing a theory of capitalist investment by building on the insights of Keynes and Kalecki. This paper engages with both these arguments. It offers a critique of the underconsumptionist reading of Marxâ€™s crisis theory and flags some critical differences between the Marxian and Keynesianâ€“Kaleckian viewpoints of capitalist investment. It also presents some general remarks on Marxist crisis theory.
B51|Introduction: the theoretical legacy of Augusto Graziani|Augusto Graziani (1933â€“2014) was one of the most eminent Italian economists of the twentieth century. He is internationally known as the founding father of the theory of monetary circuit. His contributions to economic theory went beyond the circuit, especially in the early part of his career. They included both other theoretical areas (for example, a critical review of Walras's general equilibrium model) and the analysis of the â€˜uneven developmentâ€™ of the Italian economy. Even his approach to â€˜circuitismâ€™ was quite original and cannot be reduced to a special branch of post-Keynesianism. This introduction to the symposium on â€˜The Economics of Augusto Grazianiâ€™ highlights some key points of his heretical thinking, and gives a quick summary of the papers that follow.
B51|Autonomous demand and the Marglinâ€“Bhaduri model: a critical note|Within post-Keynesian macroeconomic theory, the contribution by Marglin and Bhaduri (Bhaduri and Marglin 1990; Marglin and Bhaduri 1990) on the relationship between income distribution and growth has progressively asserted itself as a benchmark model, a reference point that has originated and still gives rise to plenty of theoretical and empirical works. Given this popularity, in the related literature it is often claimed that the only open question left is an empirical one: to assess econometrically whether a particular economy is wage- or profit-led. In this essay, I will argue that some theoretical issues, related to this model and to the literature inspired by it, can nonetheless be raised. In particular, the treatment of investment appears to be the least convincing aspect of the approach Ã la Marglinâ€“Bhaduri. More specifically, it seems possible to raise some doubts about an independent long-run influence of the profit rate or of the profit share on investment, an influence that is not in general justified or explained in detail by this literature and that to some extent is simply taken for granted. It will be shown that, if the Marglinâ€“Bhaduri model is integrated with an explicit consideration of the autonomous components of demand, income distribution does not exert any permanent influence on the rate of growth of the economy and on the rate of accumulation. Matching this result with the usual assumption, made in post-Keynesian models of growth and distribution, that capacity utilization is the adjusting variable in equilibrating investment and savings leads to paradoxical results that question the plausibility of an accumulation function like the one used in the Marglinâ€“Bhaduri model.
B51|Demand Drives Growth All The Way|This paper makes three contributions to the existing literature on economic growth: first, we provide a demand-driven alternative to the conventional supply side Solow-Swan growth model. The model’s medium run is built around MarxGoodwin cycles of demand and distribution. Second, we introduce wage income of “capitalist” households. The Samuelson-Modigliani steady state “dual” to Pasinetti’s cannot be stable when capitalists have positive wages. Finally, we speak to the discussion triggered by Piketty on the stability of wealth concentration and its relation to the profitability of capital. Our demand-driven model of the long run satisfies Kaldor’s stylized facts (the gold standard of growth theory) and generates sustained economic growth with the capitalists’ share of wealth stabilizing between zero and one. Complications arising from “excess” capital gains and how well the model fits the data are briefly considered.
B51|What are production, work and consumption? Trans-historical re-conceptualisations|This paper argues for trans-historical reformulations of the basic economic concepts of production, work and consumption. The definition of the production boundary by System of National Accounts (SNA) is inconsistent from a scientific point of view. For example, while some non-market and illegal services are viewed as productive, others are not, and services and goods are treated differently. The definition proposed by feminist economics, the so-called third person criterion, is consistent, but in need for further development; furthermore, it is a definition of work and not of production. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether it is possible to formulate a non-eclectic set of logically consistent definitions that could be considered variations of a common underlying understanding across various theoretical traditions – mainly Classical, Neoclassical, Institutional, Marxist, Feminist and Keynesian Economics – of how humans consciously change external nature in order satisfy human needs. Important issues concern how to deal with violence, double counting of transaction costs, human capital formation, non-market activities and causation of final consumption. Production, work and consumption are defined as relations between events, the subject matter and the agent, and in the main definitions reduced to non-economic sentences. Even the utility concept is avoided. First-order logic is used, complemented with modal operators for some of the sentences. In this study, it is shown that production, work and consumption all share the common feature of intentional physical transformation of the intrinsic properties of the subject matter. The object transformed during the productive activity and work must at some point in time be external to the agent. For work, the purpose of transforming an external object must not lie in the transformation of the agent. A productive activity must potentially be able to cause the satisfaction of human needs, or final consumption, which is not a condition for work or required by the third-person criterion. Final consumption involves the transformation of the subject matter that is a final purpose for the consumer or serves as a purpose for transforming the consumer. Using a criterion applied by the institutional economist Cheung to identify transaction costs, this study defines social reproduction as an activity that would not occur in a Robinson Crusoe economy. Social reproduction occurs under an institutional setting. We can further differentiate between coercive and non-coercive social reproduction. In this study, eight different definitions of production are presented. The definition of agent external production is close to the third person criterion, but the possible causation of future final consumption is included as a condition for a productive activity. It is also related to the basic neoclassical model with its assumptions of no transaction costs. The definition of agent external non-coercive production entails that transformations of persons against their own will, whether legally or illegally performed, are unproductive activities. The definition of agent external non-social production entails that all socially reproductive activities are unproductive, and comes close to the distinction made by Classical and Marxist economists of productive and unproductive work. Humanity external production only includes the transformation of non-persons. The three definitions of time scale invariant production entails that human capital formation could be considered productive activities. Market production comes close to Keynesian theory and the present definition of SNA, with the difference that it excludes non-market goods production. The present study also opens for the possibility of unproductive work, for example failed production or professional murder, and productive final consumption that does not involve any work, for example hobby-hunting, play with children or research activity for own pleasure. Which definition of production is applied greatly affects the modelling and empirical application of growth theory and the analysis of the driving forces in economic history. For example, assume trade causes labour productivity outside of trade to increase four-fold due to specialisation, while the share of GDP in total working time increases from nil to half. With the same value added per productive hour and with total hours worked kept constant, the value added of agent external production then records a four-fold increase, while that of non-social production only a doubling. Similarly, during wars the SNA GDP often increases substantially, while the concept of agent external non-coercive production entails that all war expenses are treated as unproductive. Time frame invariant production grows faster than agent external production during expansions of the education system. Market production could serve important analytical purposes, for example to investigate the relation between money supply and inflation, but should be rid of inconsistencies such as the inclusion of non-market goods production.
B51|Globalisation and inequality: A dynamic general equilib- rium model of unequal exchange|A dynamic general equilibrium model that generalises Roemer's [23] economy with a global capital market is analysed. An axiomatic analysis of the concept of unequal exchange (UE) between countries is developed at general dynamic equilibria. The class of UE definitions that satisfy three fundamental properties - including a correspondence between wealth, class and UE exploitation status - is completely characterised. It is shown that this class is nonempty and a definition of UE exploitation between countries is proposed, which is theoretically robust and firmly anchored to empirically observable data. The full class and UE exploitation structure of the international economy is derived in equilibrium.
B51|Cambio estructural y desindustrialización en México./ Structural Change and desindustrialisation in Mexico|En este artículo se hace un análisis de la economía mexicana que en las últimas décadas se transformó y sufrió cambios de gran magnitud en su estructura productiva y sectorial, convirtiéndose en una economía abierta, estancada y expulsora de trabajo hacia los Estados Unidos. Se demuestra como con la apertura en los años noventa y la competencia del exterior, se fortaleció la insuficiencia dinámica de la industria y se acentuó la terciarización precoz de la economía mexicana. Lo que trajo consigo una acelerada desindustrialización y la consecutiva absorción espuria del trabajo. En esta perspectiva se hace una revisión de los principales conceptos de la teoría del desarrollo sobre la naturaleza del cambio estructural y se analiza el comportamiento de la economía mexicana durante el periodo./ This paper presents an analysis of the Mexican economy. The Mexican economy has transformed and suffered major changes in its productive and sectorial structures during recent decades. Becoming an open, stagnant economy that expels labor towards the US. This demonstrates how as the nineties began along with foreign competition, the dynamic failure of the industry was strengthened and early outsourcing of the Mexican economy deepened. Which resulted in an accelerated deindustrialization and consecutive spurious absorption of labor. This point of view reviews the main concepts of development theory which describes the nature of structural change and analyzes the behavior of the Mexican economy during that period.

Este trabajo muestra que al incluir las ecuaciones de producción, y el modelo económico de demanda de Ramsey (1928), la indeterminación del sistema de Sraffa (1960) desaparece siempre y cuando haya pleno empleo del factor trabajo. Sin embargo, sigue siendo cierto que los precios relativos de las mercancías en relación a los salarios se determinan en una variante de la teoría del valor trabajo./ The model by Piero Sraffa (1960) proposes an indeterminacy in the distribution of income, which has important implications since its arbitrary determination modifies relative prices among goods. This paper shows that when we include equations of production and the Ramsey´s 1928 model of demand for goods, the indeterminacy of the Sraffian system disappears provided where there is full employment of labor. Relative prices of goods in terms of wages are determined as a variant of the labor theory of value, nonetheless.
B51|From Abstraction to Phenomenology in Social Theory: Yanis Varoufakis the Economist|This document contains the text of the academic 'laudatio' delivered by IUC Academic Coordinator Ugo Mattei, upon appointing Yanis Varoufakis a Honorary Professor of the IUC in March 2016. The address presents an overview of Yanis Varoufakis' intellectual development and trajectory, to demonstrate how the latter fulfils the motivations underpinning his honorary appointment, namely: (i) Varoufakis' denunciation, informed by disciplinary acumen, of the theoretical and practical failure of the current mainstream approach in economics; (i) his deep theoretical contribution to the discipline of Political Economy through the recovery of the humanistic thought of Karl Marx; (iii) his lucid analysis of the reasons for the collapse of austerity policies in Europe and elsewhere; (iv) his vivid demonstration of the fallacy â€“ also theoretical â€“ of the extractive financial policies that victimize the working classes, the poor and the commons in Europe; (v) the clarity, in his theoretical work, about the incompatibility with the democratic ideal of a macroeconomic framework devoid of government instruments able to cushion the shock to the markets imposed by the capitalist mode of production in the absence of regulation and control of financial speculation.
B51|The Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson Model and the Cambridge Capital Controversies|This paper examines the validity of the factor price equalisation theorem (FPET) in relation to capital theory. Additionally, it presents a survey of the literature on Heckscherâ€“Ohlinâ€“Samuelson (HOS) models that treat capital as a primary factor, beginning with Samuelson (1953). Furthermore, this paper discusses the Cambridge capital controversy, which contends that marginal productivity theory does not hold when capital is assumed to be as a bundle of reproducible commodities instead of as a primary factor. Consequently, it is shown that under this assumption, the FPET does not hold, even when there is no reversal of capital intensity. This paper also demonstrates that the recent studies on the dynamic HOS trade theory generally ignore the diÂ¢ culties posed by the capital controversies and are thereby able to conclude that the FPET holds even when capital is modelled as a reproducible factor. Our analysis suggests that there is a need for a basic theory of international trade that does not rely on factor price equalisation and a model that formulates capital as a bundle of reproducible commodities.

B51|Methodological institutionalism 2.0: From institutions to institutional configurations|"Svetlana Kirdina (2013) defends the need to develop new version of holism — methodological institutionalism. This paper elaborates on this idea on the basis of comparative analysis of the opposing methodologies and suggests the concept of institutional configurations, i.e. models of interactions of institutions and their stakeholders in concrete economic space. Methodological institutionalism is considered as a methodology for the configuration mesoanalysis of social and economic systems holding intermediate position between holism and institutional individualism. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of the ""switching mode"" of methodologies between individualism and holism."
B51|Economic theory in IMEMO|(The Soviet period) The article deals with the history of economic research at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO) of the Russian Academy of Sciences. This history is analyzed in the context of the Soviet and world economic science. The specific nature of Soviet economic theory is characterized as well as a special position of IMEMO, in its function of the leading think-tank in the field of world economy and international relations. Two main directions of theoretical work of IMEMO economists are identified: transition from the facts and statistical data towards a revision of dogmatic Marxism, and from Western theories to original ideas and practical recommendations. The connection of the theory and applied expertise is given a special attention.
B51|"Marx contra o otimismo tecnológico: economia ""imaterial"" desmistificada e desdobramentos para as questões ambientais [Marx against technological optimism: demystified ""immaterial"" economy and outcomes concerning environmental issues]"|In previous papers, we have conducted a broad review of the economic literature concerning environmental debates (especially the debate on climate change). In general, the several considerations - ranging from the ones built upon neoclassical theory to the ones based on heterodox thinking - tend to converge, with very few exceptions, to the notion of dematerialization; or, to put it clearly, to the hope that technological development will allow for the realization of a supposedly immaterial production. This paper starts from these previous assessments and has the objective of demystifying (that is, deconstructing critically) the notion of dematerialization as a real possibility in the present socioeconomic formation. Along with the very nature of this critique, we simultaneously intend to offer a theoretical argument of our own, rooted in Marx's thinking and capable of explaining why the faith in the dematerialization process tends to be systematically frustrated as long as the production and distribution of social wealth is structured around capital.
B51|Rent as a share of product and Sraffa’s price equations|The classical economists usually regarded rent in their analyses as a share of the gross product obtained from the use of land or a mine, which was indeed the way rent was treated in bargaining between landowner and tenant. The article revives this view of rent, proceeding from its historical basis through Smith’s analysis to arrive at Sraffa’s equations, and also examines the case of the introduction of a tax conceived as a tithe, to which Sraffa referred very briefly (Sraffa, 1960, p 55).
B51|Monopoly Capital and Capitalist Inequality: Marx after Piketty|This paper proposes that one major explanation of growing inequality in the United States (US) is through the use of the concept of economic surplus. The economic surplus is a neo-Marxian term which combines the traditional Marxian tenet of surplus value with other ways that surplus value can be invested in a mature, advanced capitalist economy. A rising economic surplus that is not absorbed through growing consumer spending, luxury spending or government spending results in stagnant wages and growing inequality via higher levels of underemployment and greater monopoly and monopsony power among a decreasing number of huge, powerful corporations. Therefore, the politics surrounding the growth of inequality in the US has to be understood first by understanding over accumulation of the economic surplus by those at the top of the US capitalist class. This research note gives estimates of the rising economic surplus over the last several decades in the US as well as how these correlate with the level of inequality. The growth of the economic surplus gives rise and form to the politics of inequality and austerity. As time goes by, the politics of inequality and austerity in the US will be manifested by greater corporate influence in the political system, greater political polarization, less government effectiveness, and more debates about welfare spending, corporate taxation, taxes on upper income households, and taxes on wealth.
B51|Joint analysis of labour values and production prices|We begin the article with a probe of commensurability of production prices and labour values and by describing useful new concepts such as total or cumulated profits and surplus value. We then compare the results of a capitalist economic system through balances and imbalances of the data in production prices and labour values. We detect new relations between the two ways of measurement with reference to the values that the rate of profit in prices may take. A specific wage (in labour value terms) could be found that allows the coincidence of both Marxian equalities: total prices and total labour values and total surplus value and total profits, which corresponds to a Golden ratio between the surplus value and the wage in labour units. We relate the concepts employed with those of other visions of the transformation of values in prices: the use of a monetary expression of labour time (MELT) and the establishment of the value added of one period as the only subject of transformation.
B51|The Impossibility of Democratic Socialism: Two Conceptions of Democracy|Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny (1994) have used Public Choice analysis to criticize market socialism. Peter J. Boettke (1995) and Peter T. Leeson and Boettke (2002) have argued that F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom (2007 [1944]) constituted a form of Public Choice analysis as well, in particular presaging an application of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem to democratic socialism. This essay demonstrates that additionally, Hayek's book adumbrated the distinction between liberal or limited democracy and illiberal or totalitarian democracy. This distinction between two conceptions of democracy provides another means of criticizing democratic socialism. The democratic political system and socialist economic system are fundamentally incompatible, making democratic socialism impossible, in the sense that democracy cannot fulfill for socialism what democratic socialists expect from it. Democratic socialism will fail, not because those in power will betray their trust or abuse their power, but because the fundamental institutional constraints of democracy are incompatible with socialist economics.
B51|Interest Groups and the Impossibility of Democratic Socialism: Hayek, Jewkes, and the Arrow Theorem|Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny (1994) have used Public Choice analysis to criticize market socialism. Peter J. Boettke (1995) and Peter T. Leeson and Boettke (2002) have argued that F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom (2007 [1944]) constituted a form of Public Choice analysis as well. Boettke and Leeson say that Hayek adumbrated a form of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. This essay shows that Hayek was joined by John Jewkes in presaging a form of the Arrow theorem. In addition, this essay expands on the analysis by Boettke and Leeson, elucidating the broader implications which the Arrow theorem has for democratic socialism in particular. Democratic socialism is demonstrated to be impossible, in the sense that it cannot successfully accomplish the goals of its advocates. This is because the Arrow theorem implies that democratic political institutions are fundamentally incompatible with socialist economics.
B51|Labor Economics in a Planned Economy: F. A. Hayek and John Jewkes on the Impossibility of Democratic Socialism|Milton Friedman (1962) is associated with the claim that political and economic freedom cannot be distinguished (cf. Lawson and Clark 2010), using the famous example that there can be no freedom of speech where the government owns the printing presses. Less well-known is F. A. Hayek's example, drawn from labor economics, used to illustrate the same principle. Hayek was joined in this by his less well-known colleague, John Jewkes. Hayek and Jewkes argued that without a freely operating price system, central economic planning cannot function without compulsory regimentation of labor. Similarly, no state may simultaneously fix “fair” wages and demand a given pattern of productive output and employment. It is impossible to both achieve income equality and accomplish an economic plan. Hayek's and Jewkes's examples help explain why democratic socialism is impossible, in the sense that it cannot accomplish what its advocates desire.
B51|The Foreign Policy of a Democratic Socialist Regime: From Intervention to Protection to Warfare|Discussions of democratic socialism have focused on whether that system is compatible with domestic civil liberties. Less attention has been paid to its foreign policy implications. Despite the widespread acceptance of the democratic peace hypothesis, democratic socialism would be incompatible with peaceful foreign relations. Economic intervention and economic planning – even democratic – cannot be successful without insulating the domestic economy from foreign competition. This implies economic nationalism and autarky. Moreover, democratic socialism is often justified by the notion that the democratic will of the people should be absolutely sovereign. Such a conception of democracy has no place for constitutional limits on power. Such an unlimited democracy would soon prove illiberal and liable to be captured by a demagogic authoritarian dictator, and this would only exacerbate the deleterious foreign policy consequences of economic nationalism. Democratic socialism is therefore incompatible with the cosmopolitan and humanitarian values of democratic socialists.
B51|Monopoly Capital and Capitalist Management: Too Many Managers?|The mainstream or neoclassical economics view that labor is rewarded according to its productivity has been extended to managers and management teams as justification for the levels of compensation that they receive. Additionally, the management concept of “span of management” has been used to explain the total number of and per employee number of managers in any organization along with the economics assumption that the appropriate span of management is where the marginal productivity of the last manager employed equals his/her marginal cost, or wage. On the other hand, Marxists and institutionalists hold different views of the roles and purposes of managers within organizations and attempt to explain these through either the view of managers exploiting workers on behalf of owners or the view of managers exploiting both workers and owners in order to advance their own agenda. This research note examines managerial compensation and intensity from both traditional/mainstream and alternative views by focusing on measures of managerial salaries, employee productivity, return on owners’ equity, return on assets, and rates of workers exploitation.
B51|Monetary Expressions of Labour Time and Market Prices: Theory and Evidence from China, Japan and Korea| This article presents estimates of labour values and prices of production following two approaches: the first is based on the classical and Marxian theory of value and distribution; the second on the so-called ‘new solution’ to the ‘transformation problem’ and its variant, the Temporary Single-System Interpretation (TSSI). The major advantage of the latter approach is its simplicity, along with the relatively low data requirements. Our empirical findings from the economies of China, Japan and South Korea suggest that both approaches give estimates of labour values and prices of production which are extremely close to each other as well as to actual market prices. On further examination, however, we conclude that our empirical findings are absolutely consistent with the theoretical requirements of the classical approach and contradict those of the TSSI.
B51|The Social Provisioning Process and Heterodox Economics|The social provisioning process is how heterodox economists define economics in general. Instead of having a narrow definition of what constitutes economics, such as the mainstream has with its allocation of scarce resources among competing ends via the price mechanism, heterodox economists have opted for a much more expansive definition that permits different theoretical explanations for ways in which the provisioning process can take place in different types of economies in different historical contexts. In this chapter, we first examine the changes in the definition of economics from classical political economy to neoclassical and heterodox economics. The comparison between classical political economy and neoclassical economics manifests a clear distinction in view of economy and economics. The second section substantiates the meaning of the social provisioning process. In doing so we make a case that, first, defining heterodox economics as the study of the social provisioning process positions heterodox economics as an alternative to neoclassical economics, and, second, that such an expansive definition of economics has potential to synthesize various heterodox theoretical frameworks in a constructive manner.
B51|A Heterodox Theory of the Business Enterprise|The business enterprise directs and controls the social provisioning process. Enterprise decisions on price, investment, output and employment, in particular, directly affect the material basis of society as well as the material standard of living of working class households. The understanding the structure of and changes in the capitalist capitalists system thus requires a theory of the business enterprise that offers relevant and convincing explanations of business decisions and actions embedded in the wider social context. Such a theory must replace the mainstream-neoclassical theory of the firm, which is not only theoretically incoherent but also practically irrelevant since it confines itself to the hypothetical market structure and individual optimizing behavior. With this rationale this chapter attempts to build a heterodox theory of the business enterprises incorporating contributions made by various theoretical traditions in heterodox economics.
B51|Ricardo on Machinery: A Textual Analysis|"Modern production theory (Kurz and Salvadori, 1995) is utilized to provide a textual analysis of the famous chapter ""On Machinery"" added by Ricardo in the third edition of his Principles and to reconstruct the examples that are reported there. Two sets of assumptions that rationalize the basic example presented by Ricardo are identified: a) the innovation concerns a non-basic commodity; b) the innovation concerns an agricultural commodity and it does not change the technology applied on the marginal land, which is still marginal after the innovation. Ricardo was aware of these two facts and he seems to have used the latter of the two in his initial example. In effect, the example holds perfectly well if it is assumed that the new machine is specific to a quality of land that is marginal neither in the pre-innovation nor in the post-innovation economy. When the innovation is introduced in the production of an industrial commodity (cloth) that is used by the workers, as in the second example discussed by Ricardo, the rate of profits, and therefore the rate of growth, cannot be the same in the pre-innovation and in the post-innovation economy, unless the innovation is introduced in a switch-point between the technique employed prior to the innovation and that used after the innovation. This is too strong an assumption and can be of some interest only if it provides information about events that occur in the vicinity of a switch point. This “continuity” assumption is what Ricardo seems to have used as the basis for discussion in his second example."
B51|Two consecutive steps in transformation: from Values to Prices and from Sectoral Rates to a Weighted Common Rate|Karl Marx in chapter 9 of Capital, Volume III, remove profits from the cost-price of sectors so as to calcultate the production prices. If instead of doing so, we keep them we can obtain a set of production prices at the existing sectoral rates of profit in value terms which are proportional to values. This proportionality, based on the rate of surplus value, is only lost when trying to apply the resulting Marxian (wheigthed) rate of profit to the employed sectoral capitals measured in this proportional production prices. The common rate can only be applied by artificially establishing a price that modifies the common unit of the sectoral values.
B51|Biased Technical Change and Economic Growth: The Case of Korea, 1970–2013|Abstract This paper explores the pattern of technical change in the Korean economy from 1970 to 2013 and investigates its determinants. We use the Classical growth-distribution schedule to show that the labor-saving and capital-using pattern has predominated. For the rationale behind this Marx-biased technical change, we focus on the relationship between technical change and real wage growth via the evolution of labor and capital productivity, and verify the historical direction of technical change against the rise and fall of the working class. Furthermore, we find that the deviation during the post-crisis period from the long-run trend of Marx-biased technical change is not attributable to the vitality of new technological innovations, but rather the reflection of class dynamics over extracting productivity under weaker capital deepening. The results suggest that the recent deterioration of labor share and labor unions in Korea is closely associated with low incentive for technological progress, which contributes to prolonged stagnation.
B51|Capital theory: Less is more|Capital theory and the associated with it price effects resulting from changes in the distributive variables hold centre stage when it comes to the internal consistency of both classical and neoclassical theories of value. The article briefly reviews the literature and then focuses on the detected skew eigenvalue distribution of the vertically integrated technical coefficients matrices of actual economies. The findings prompt the use of the Schur triangularization theorem for the construction even of a single industry from the input-output structure of the entire economy. Such a hyper-basic industry, in combination with hyper-non-basic industries, embodies properties that may capture the behaviour of the entire economic system. Thus, we can derive some meaningful results consistent with the available empirical evidence.
B51|Un Marco General para la Ciencia de la Sociedad Humana<BR>[A General Framework for the Science of Human Society]|This essay is meant as a contribution towards the integration of ‘the social sciences’ into a ‘science of human society’. For this it uses concepts and methods that economics has developed, but also questions the adequacy of mainstream economic theory in two aspects: a) the absence of a hierarchical class structure and consequent inter-class conflicts of interest, and b) the ‘benevolent government' or ‘social planner' approach to policy decisions. I construct three simple models where the first two are basically building blocks for the third. The first is a model of slaves and masters, the second of governed (clans) and governors and the third of capitalism (salaried workers, capitalist entrepreneurs, and governors). In each model, the agent(s) that have a higher rank in the hierarchy have the power to condition the decision rules of those below in a way that is similar to Stackelberg’s modeling of leader and follower firms within an oligopolistic industry. All agents in the model face a consumption/toil tradeoff. They have the same utility function albeit with class-specific parameters. The second model introduces public goods in consumption, which may have a negative impact on utility (public bads) for the governed, generating conflicting interests between the two classes. In each model, the agents deciding on the production of goods exert Planning, Organizing, Commanding and Controlling (POCC) work effort that enhances production but yields disutility. In the last two models the governing class exerts POCC work effort in the production of public goods and in the taxation necessary to finance it as well as its own consumption. The third model extends a basic model of monopolistic competition to include the Government and POCC work effort in the production of private and public goods. The distribution of income in terms of private goods is seen to depend entirely on decisions made by the upper class in the hierarchy. A more sophisticated distribution of ‘welfare’ could show much greater inequality due to possibly high levels of disutility due to public output which are public bads for workers but public goods for the upper classes. The framework is meant as a first approximation to a realistically more complex process where lower level classes have some degree of countervailing power (including elections, strikes, demonstrations, etc.). But that closer approximation could be modeled in different ways and would only modify the basic power structure reflected in the approximate model ‘in the margin’. RESUMEN Este ensayo pretende contribuir a la integración de ‘las ciencias sociales’ en una ‘ciencia de la sociedad humana’. Para ello usa conceptos y métodos que ha desarrollado la economía pero también cuestiona a la economía del mainstream en dos aspectos: a) la ausencia de una estructura jerárquica de clases y de conflictos de intereses inter-clases, y b) el enfoque del ‘gobierno benévolo’ o ‘planificador social’ para las decisiones de política. Construyo tres modelos sencillos de complejidad creciente. El primero es de esclavos y esclavistas, el segundo de (clanes) gobernados y gobernantes, y el tercero de capitalismo (asalariados, empresarios, y gobernantes). En cada modelo los agentes de mayor rango tienen el poder de condicionar las reglas decisorias de quienes están más abajo. Esto tiene similitud con la modelación de Stackelberg de empresas líderes y seguidoras en oligopolio. Todos los agentes confrontan un tradeoff consumo/esfuerzo y tienen la misma función de utilidad aunque con parámetros clase-específicos. El segundo modelo introduce los bienes públicos en el consumo, los que pueden tener impacto negativo sobre la utilidad (males públicos) de los gobernados, generando conflicto de intereses entre clases. En cada modelo los agentes que deciden sobre la producción ejercen trabajo de Planificación, Organización, Comando, y Control (POCC) que aumenta la producción pero brinda desutilidad. En los dos últimos modelos la clase gobernante ejerce trabajo POCC en la producción de bienes públicos y en la recaudación tributaria que lo financia, así como su consumo. El tercer modelo es extensión del modelo de competencia monopolística estándar que incluye el Gobierno y el trabajo POCC en la producción de bienes privados y públicos. Se muestra que la distribución del ingreso en términos de bienes privados depende de las decisiones tomadas por los gobernantes. Una distribución de ‘bienestar’ mostraría mayor desigualdad debido a las posibles desutilidades generadas por productos públicos que son males públicos para trabajadores pero bienes públicos para las clases altas. Se concibe este marco como primera aproximación de un proceso más complejo en que las clases inferiores tienen algún grado de poder contestatario (incluyendo elecciones, huelgas, manifestaciones, etc.) Pero esa mayor aproximación puede ser modelada de diferentes maneras y sólo modificaría la estructura de poder básica del modelo aproximado ‘en el margen’.
B51|The Whole of the Storm: Money, debt and crisis in the current Long Depression|"This is the prepublication version of an article which appeared in Marxism 21 and should be cited as ""Freeman, A. 'The Whole of the Storm', Marxism 21 Volume 20, No.2, pp 190-224'. It investigates the mechanisms and causes of recessions and depressions, and their relation to the more spectacular financial crises which announce them. It demonstrates how the concept of the Monetary Expression of Labour Time (MELT) allows us to understand the most difficult aspect of this relation, namely how money acquires value, and thereby serves, under definite conditions which characterise recessions and depressions, as self-expanding value, so becoming an alternative use of capital to production."
B51|La società dinamica e il contributo di Paolo Leon (The dynamic society and Paolo Leon's contribution)|The article recalls Paolo Leon's major contributions to economics and economic policy with a specific emphasis on the books he published. The authors focus on Leon's interpretation of Engel's Law and its macroeconomic implications, as well as on the relations between capitalist development, effective demand and structural change.
B51|Valor, precio y moneda, una revisión con base en «El capital» de Carlos Marx|El valor-trabajo, desde sus orígenes en la economía política, ha tenido una relación central en su explicación del precio y la moneda, el autor cuyo prototipo llevó hasta sus últimas consecuencias dicha concepción de manera crítica, fue Marx. Se retoma aquí dicha relación entre valor, precio y moneda en su desarrollo teórico-abstracto y la finalidad que subyace en dichos postulados. La pertinencia de la teoría de Marx se hace presente, al introducir el dinero en una sociedad descentralizada, que permita hacer las transacciones superando el dualismo producción-mercado, en una visión heterodoxa, es decir monetaria institucional.
B51|Lo político y la política Desdoblamiento del poder político en la Política de la Liberación de Enrique Dussel|Lo político tiene una relación directa con el poder instituyente. La política, por su parte, tiene una relación directa con el poder instituido. Los vínculos entre ambos poderes son dialécticos y las líneas que los separan son endebles. El poder instituyente no desaparece -por tanto- con la formación del poder instituido. El punto de partida para el desarrollo de lo político y la política es el poder político de la comunidad, cuya sustancia es el consenso racional. Lo racional es lo real y, lo real, es la corporalidad viviente del ser humano. El objetivo -entonces- del proceso político en su conjunto (lo político y la política) es mantener y acrecentar la vida humana. Este objetivo constituye la base de la Política de la Liberación de Enrique Dussel. La sustancia del poder político -de manera inevitable- se invisibiliza -principalmente- con el desarrollo de la política, dando lugar al poder fetichizado. Se trata de un poder donde lo racional queda oculto. La comunidad que decide hacer frente a los embates de la fetichización del poder y que decide instalar otro poder instituido se erige como pueblo. En este proceso retorna el poder instituyente.
B51|Marxismo ecológico: un recuento crítico del estado del arte|En el presente documento de trabajo se efectúa una revisión crítica de las principales aportaciones hechas por los autores ligados a la corriente científico-política del marxismo ecológico. En primer lugar, se ensaya una definición de lo que actualmente puede entenderse por marxismo ecológico. En segundo término, se realiza una descripción de las principales teorías y conceptos nacidos a partir de esta corriente, privilegiando aquellas que abordan las temáticas de depredación y contaminación ecosistémicas yendo más allá de la simple interpretación exegética de los textos de Marx y Engels. Finalmente, en tercer lugar, se desarrolla una evaluación crítico-comparativa, provisional, de las distintas teorías y conceptos abordados en la sección dos, haciendo especial énfasis en los tópicos más polémicos y relevantes para la política concreta de nuestra época histórica. In this working paper I undertake a critical review of the main contributions developed by the authors associated with the scientific and political school of thought known as Ecological Marxism. First of all, I try to propose a definition of what can be understood today by Ecological Marxism. Secondly, I describe the main theories and concepts originated by this school of thought, giving preference to those that take into account topics like depletion of resources and pollution, going further than the exegetical interpretation of Marx and Engels. Finally, I develop a critical and comparative evaluation of the different theories and concepts reviewed, emphasizing the most controversial and significant issues related to the concrete politics of our time.
B51|Sistema mundial y formas de capitalismo: la teoría marxista de la dependencia revisitada|This paper underscores the significance of the Use Values that Latin America produces, which contributes to a reduced and focalized increase in productivity, and allows an unequal interchange with developed economies. This generates a modality of Capitalism—Dependent, which presents peculiarities in its reproduction, that the Marxist Dependency Theory aims to explain. En este escrito se pone de manifiesto la significación de los valores de uso que produce América Latina, lo que propicia una elevación reducida y focalizada de la productividad y abre paso al intercambio desigual con las economías desarrolladas. Todo esto genera una modalidad de capitalismo, el dependiente, que presenta particularidades en su reproducción, las que la teoría marxista de la dependencia busca explicar.
B51|Afterthoughts on urban economic theory and its focus|An interesting part of the present scientific debate in urban economics concerns the appropriateness of some theoretical —and consequently empirical— definitions of the city and its role, underlining the reductive character of purely functional approaches in terms of agglomeration economies. Many scientific achievements have been attained exploiting the virtues of these approaches, residing in their strong internal consistency (within their logical assumptions) and sophisticated formalization. What appears to be left is the inspection of the true nature of cities, going far beyond their agglomerated physical form and the consequent benefits on transactions and communications. The paper suggests that the geographical-functional approach should be complemented by two other approaches, implicit in classical economics and in evolutionary economic theory, which allow the inspection and (perhaps) a proper interpretation of other constituents of the nature of cities: what I call the relational-cognitive approach —interpreting the city as a cognitive milieu, generating knowledge, creativity and innovation— and the hierarchical-distributive one, interpreting the relationships with the non-city, the «countryside» of classical economists, in terms of control and monopolistic determination of relative prices. The former approach looks at the intrinsically generative role of the city and its capability of developing continuously new activities and functions; the latter at power relations on space and control on income distribution. If the functional approach looks nowadays quite consolidated, the cognitive one needs still in depth reflections, as it implies the (at least partial) abandonment of methodological individualism that permeates neoclassical economics, with the advantage of better utilizing the conceptual achievements of other social disciplines. On the other hand, the hierarchical and distributive approach looks today quite unexplored. At the end, a tentative, formalized model of agglomeration economies is presented, with the goal of stimulating the attention on the empirical measurement of the effects of the cognitive and control roles of the city. Two main open issues emerge, both referring to income distribution: how are the advantages of increasing returns to urban scale being distributed among the internal production factors (and urban social classes, including land owners) and how could we measure the urban power in terms of income distribution in space.
B51|Sraffa on the Degeneration of the Notion of Cost|The paper reconstructs the history of what Sraffa called the ‘degeneration of cost’ as emerges from his manuscripts of the late 1920s. In particular, Sraffa regards the Physiocrats as having the correct idea of cost as being the commodities that allow workers to subsist. The classical economists measured this bundle of commodi-ties in terms of labour, which they also ambiguously viewed as ‘toil and trouble’. Then, the idea of labour as ‘toil and trouble’ was indicated by neoclassical authors as an anticipation of their conception of cost as a sacrifice. Conferring also upon abstinence from consumption the nature of sacrifice, the neoclassical-marginalist theory understood wages and interest as compensation for the disutility of working and saving. Then, cost was ultimately seen as what induces workers and capitalists to produce. This completed the degeneration of cost from the objective-physical conception of the Physiocrats to the subjective-psychological view of the neoclassical school.
B51|"Measured, Unmeasured, Mismeasured, and Unjustified Pessimism: A Review Essay of Thomas Piketty’s Capitalism in the Twenty First Century<BR>[Измеренный, Безмерный, Преувеличенный И Безосновательный Пессимизм: О Книге ""Капитализм В Xxi Веке"" Томаса Пикетти]"|Thomas Piketty has wrote a serious empirical work on economic history. The central thesis of the work is that the force of interest on inherited wealth causes inequality of the income earned from the wealth to increase in inevitable and stable manner. The author has collected and presented a huge bulk of empirical data. But despite all its advantages the book contains many serious flaws. In fact its own data suggest that the inequality of income has increased much only in a few countries and only recently. Moreover, all the way a steady share of rich people constantly have been dropping out of riches or coming into them, in evolutionary fashion. Piketty does not see the key role of entry of new entrepreneurs into the markets and their exit from them while this is the key to understanding of the process of market-tested betterment that has made the poor rich. Piketty’s definition of wealth does not include human capital, owned by the workers. The fundamental ethical problem in the book, is that Piketty has not reflected on the ethical relevance of equality as such and in comparison with raising of the poor. It is the latter notion that is ethically relevant from the point of view of their human dignity. If income is correctly measured the real income of the poor has risen in sustained way from 1800 because of rising productivity, and consumption of basic necessities is very much more equally enjoyed nowadays
B51|Risking Capitalism|The growing centrality of risk management in pro-market governance raises important questions regarding how risks are produced, and why? Who and what is included in, and excluded from, risk management, and why? And, what is the relationship between the rise of risk management and neoliberalism? Charting the relationship between risk, contemporary capitalism and its neoliberal modes of governance, Risking Capitalism, addresses these questions by examining - both analytically and empirically - diverse meanings and practices of risk management across a range of scales and themes, ranging from austerity to climate change to housing and debt. The authors investigate the relationship between shifts in contemporary capitalism and the ways in which neoliberal forms of risk management have emerged, been reproduced and normalized, and, transformed historically.
B51|Species Commodification|A theoretically promised confluence of favorable biological, economic, and social outcomes in neoliberal solutions for fisheries is illusory. The required commodification of the fish, including the species and accompanying oceanic commons enclosures, result in contradictions that cannot be understood within the neoclassical economic paradigm. A process of dialectical abstraction and qualitative modeling exposes the source and mechanism of the contradictions providing an alternative basis for discourse on the fishery and the commons.
B51|Minskyâ€™s Analysis of Capitalist Development|Beginning in the mid-â€™80s, well after he brought his famous financial instability hypothesis to maturity, Hyman P. Minsky analyzed the evolution of capitalism. This paper proposes a critical reading of this analysis, focusing on the institutional dimension of Minskyâ€™s research. From my point of view, if Minskyâ€™s analysis constitutes more a history of capitalism than a theory of capitalism, this is because of the weak conceptualization of institutions and the absence of a genuine analysis of institutional change. From this perspective, I believe it necessary to clarify and complete Minskyâ€™s institutional analysis. Only by doing so can we take full measure of Minskyâ€™s research on the evolution of capitalism and identify all the repercussions for an analysis of the instability and resilience of the current stage of capitalism.
B51|Two Views on Urban Revolution|The word â€œrevolutionâ€ is used very differently by Bruce Katz and Jennifer Bradley in their mainstream liberal work as opposed to the way David Harvey uses the word in his book where he advocates for a revolution by moving decision making away from the elite class currently in control to working people currently subject to those decisions. Both works see urban centers as loci of change. Both want very different changes.
B51|Absolute Advantage and International Trade|The purpose of this paper is to give empirical content to the approach of international trade based on the principle of absolute advantage and to show that differences in productivity may give rise to transfers of value towards the units of capital with an absolute advantage in production. Our approach is based on the classical/Marxian theories of value and competition and it is operationalized using input-output data for the years 1995, 2000, and 2005 of four euro-zone countries (Greece, Spain, Finland, and the Netherlands). The derived results are consistent with the view that productivity differences persist over the years, which is equivalent to saying that the absolute advantage in production does not change into comparative advantage.
B51|From Heterodox Political Economy to Generalized Darwinism|The paper focuses on the successive tensions that emerged in Geoffrey M. Hodgsonâ€™s thought in his passage from political economy to Darwinian social science. The main argument is that Hodgsonâ€™s tensions have their origins in two fundamental problems: the irrelevance of population thinking in analyzing both social structures and historical processes; and the necessity of different levels of abstraction in biology and social sciences. Hodgson resolves the first tension by shifting the focus of inquiry from the analysis of capitalism to the genesis of a single convention. But afterwards he is unable to come back down from the extremely abstract level of evolving systems (ranging from amoebas to humans) to the analysis of social problems in contemporary capitalism.
B51|Neoliberalism and the Formation of the English Premier League|I have argued elsewhere 1 that the formation of the English Premier League (EPL) can be interpreted as an instance of accumulation by dispossession. This paper complements that analysis by arguing that the theory of â€œSocial Structures of Accumulationâ€ can also be used to locate the formation of the EPL within the modalities of the structural changes that characterized the move to neoliberalism. The conclusion remains that the role of football 2 in the neoliberal restoration of capitalist class power cannot be ignored.
B51|Modes of Production and Household Production|This paper consists of a brief presentation of modes of production in class societies, highlighting the significance of household production in these. This is followed by a new approach to the conceptualization of the (non-class) communist mode of production and the place of household production in such a society.
B51|A Comment on “What Is Wrong with the West’s Economies?” by Edmund Phelps|Abstract Can one simultaneously have an economic system that is both vibrant and just? And, if so, is the current mainstream economic paradigm helping us achieve such a worthwhile goal? We argue that the notions of justice and economic vibrancy should not be discussed in isolation from one another. Also, any potential solution to this problem has to be dynamically consistent and take into the account changing nature of the world economy in which production and distribution of information and knowledge takes increasingly the center stage. This may require switching from solving mechanistic optimization problems prevalent in the main stream economics, to more complex approaches that explicitly take into the account both the role of institutional development and more complex ways in which economic decisions are actually made today.
B51|Double trouble: modern misreadings of Cantillon|Although the 18th century Franco-Irish financier Richard Cantillon is universally esteemed as an outstanding pioneer of economic analysis, his work is not immune to present-day misunderstanding. This paper identifies two current misreadings both relating to his concept of â€œintrinsic value.â€ Both need clearing-up. (1) Anthony Brewer (1992) claimed to find a fatal flaw in Cantillonâ€™s theory of value. The present author (1993) demurred. That objection has not been taken up (or dismissed) in subsequent discussion of Cantillonâ€™s work. We therefore have unfinished business. (2) A second issue has emerged. Modern â€œAustrianâ€ commentators (who express great admiration for Cantillon) are promoting a seriously erroneous misinterpretation of his theory of value. We think it is time both to put forward, against Brewerâ€™s allegation, a stronger defence of Cantillonâ€™s theory, and also to make the point that Cantillonâ€™s conception is fundamentally different from how (some) â€œAustrianâ€ admirers apparently see it.
B51|Markets, Morality, and Economic Growth: Competition Affects Utilitarian Judgment|Scholars since Hume and Smith have debated possible causal connections between market experiences and moral beliefs. Of particular interest today are questions related to incentive designs: for example, could the structure of employment affect moral attitudes? Here, I study the impact of employment structure on three normative issues: utilitarian versus deontological values, other-regarding preferences, and charitable donations. Through a labor market intermediary, I randomly assigned workers to competitive or piece-rate work conditions. The groups were given a moral question posing a conflict between utilitarian and deontological values, and offered a choice to make a charitable donation. The moral question was accompanied by an illustration that made salient outgroup considerations. Four results emerge: Competitively structured work experiences increased deontological value choices, deontological commitments towards outgroup members, and donations by productive workers relative to non-productive workers; and the effects on deontological value choices differ over economic development. I reconcile these results with a formal model based on experimental findings in affective moral psychology. When competition is perceived as unfair or unfamiliar, negative affect triggers deontological value choices, but when it is perceived as familiar or even fun, positive affect increases utilitarian attitudes. If utilitarian attitudes lead to market-oriented policies, multiple steady states arise where some countries sustain high utilitarianism, market-orientation, and economic growth, and vice versa. This perspective helps explain the intellectual history of the doux commerce thesis.

B51|The Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson Model and the Cambridge Capital Controversies|This paper examines the validity of the factor price equalisation theorem (FPET) in relation to capital theory. Additionally, it presents a survey of the literature on Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson (HOS) models that treat capital as a primary factor, beginning with Samuelson (1953). Furthermore, this paper discusses the Cambridge capital controversy, which contends that marginal productivity theory does not hold when capital is assumed to be as a bundle of reproducible commodities instead of as a primary factor. Consequently, it is shown that under this assumption, the FPET does not hold, even when there is no reversal of capital intensity. This paper also demonstrates that the recent studies on the dynamic HOS trade theory generally ignore the difficulties posed by the capital controversies and are thereby able to conclude that the FPET holds even when capital is modelled as a reproducible factor. Our analysis suggests that there is a need for a basic theory of international trade that does not rely on factor price equalisation and a model that formulates capital as a bundle of reproducible commodities.
B51|Long Waves of Capitalist Development : An Empirical Investigation|In this paper, I investigate the phenomenon of long waves of capitalist development from two perspectives. First, I look for evidence of long waves of economic growth taking the dates for turning points of long waves from the historical literature (Mandel, 1995). Using historical data for 20 capitalist countries from the Maddison-Project, I find that the growth rate of real per capita GDP (and real GDP) is significantly higher in the upswing than in the downswing phase of long waves. I interpret this as evidence of long waves of economic activity. Second, I revisit the method used by Gordon, Weisskopf and Bowles (1983) to identify long waves, using historical data on the U.S. economy from Dumenil and Levy (2013). I use this definition of long waves to test their hypothesis that business cycle downturns are â€˜reproductiveâ€™ during the upswing phase and â€˜non- reproductiveâ€™ during the downswing phase of long waves. I find evidence in support of the hypothesis.
B51|The modern revival of the Classical surplus approach: implications for the analysis of growth and crises|The paper reviews the main elements of Modern Classical Theory in view of the analysis of contemporary societies and in particular: the recovery of the Classical and Marxist “surplus approach” as a solid foundation for the analysis of social conflict; a demand-led theory of the level and growth of output based on the rejection of Say’s Law and the recovery of the notion of “external markets” put forward by Rosa Luxembourg and Kalecki, as the framework for the investigation of growth and crises in different historical phases of capitalism; the dismantling of the analytical core of Marginalism and of its laissez-faire policy prescriptions; and finally, the rejection of methodological individualism and of subjectivism in economic analysis and the preservation of the analytical methods of the Classical economists and Marx. In this regard, the paper underlines some differences with other heterodox schools, but also convergence with endogenous money theory and with systemic views of technical change.
B51|The Rise and Decline of General Laws of Capitalism|Thomas Piketty's (2013) book, Capital in the 21st Century , follows in the tradition of the great classical economists, like Marx and Ricardo, in formulating general laws of capitalism to diagnose and predict the dynamics of inequality. We argue that general economic laws are unhelpful as a guide to understanding the past or predicting the future because they ignore the central role of political and economic institutions, as well as the endogenous evolution of technology, in shaping the distribution of resources in society. We use regression evidence to show that the main economic force emphasized in Piketty's book, the gap between the interest rate and the growth rate, does not appear to explain historical patterns of inequality (especially, the share of income accruing to the upper tail of the distribution). We then use the histories of inequality of South Africa and Sweden to illustrate that inequality dynamics cannot be understood without embedding economic factors in the context of economic and political institutions, and also that the focus on the share of top incomes can give a misleading characterization of the true nature of inequality.
B51|Economic paradoxism and meson economics|The structure of the paper brings together three major sections, following the general approach to the impact of paradoxes in economic theory. The first section describes a necessary investigation in the synthesized universe of paradoxes, to capitalize on Quine’s paradox taxonomy, and to reveal the importance of really paraconsistent paradoxes, defining, in a relative and innovative manner, economic paradoxism in the sense of excess of creative capitalization of paradoxes in the area of science, as initiated by mathematician and logician Florentin Smarandache. The second section turns into an original exposition of economics theory and the third section reveals the concept of meson economics and the principles of that economy, completed with some final remarks, some of which are conclusive, and some others interrogative, aligned to the paradox of knowledge, in keeping with which human beings are looking for answers, and finally find more and more questions.
B51|Fra Marx e List: sinistra, nazione e solidarietà internazionale|In questo breve saggio esaminiamo l’importanza attribuita da Friedrich List allo Stato nazionale nell’emancipazione economica di un paese a fronte della visione cosmopolita del capitalismo e degli interessi dei lavoratori che Marx gli contrappone. Rifacendoci a uno spunto di Massimo Pivetti sosteniamo che lo Stato nazionale sia lo spazio più prossimo in cui una classe lavoratrice nazionale può legittimamente sperare di modificare a proprio vantaggio i rapporti di forza. Nell'aver sostenuto lo svuotamento della sovranità nazionale in nome di un europeismo tanto ingenuo quanto superficiale, la sinistra ha contribuito a far mancare a sé stessa e ai propri ceti di riferimento il terreno su cui espletare efficacemente l’azione politica contribuendo in tal modo allo sbandamento democratico del paese.
B51|Spiegare la crisi: stagnazione secolare o caduta tendenziale del saggio del profitto?|Summers has recently reintroduced the hypothesis of “secular stagnation”, first proposed by Alvin Hansen in 1938 as an explanation for the protracted slump of the US economy. However, the secular stagnation hypothesis looks rather as a description, than as an explanation of the current low-growth environment. In this paper we consider the Marxian hypothesis of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall as an alternative theoretical paradigm. Looking at the post-WWII data, the Marxian hypothesis provides an adequate picture of the long-run growth trends. This conclusion is reinforced once we take into account the counteracting factors mentioned by Marx, all of which, and in particular the use of share capital, were operating in the last decades. The paper concludes by outlining some alternative scenarios of recovery.
B51|Thomas Piketty, the Future of Capitalism and the Theory of Distribution: A Review Essay| This essay reviews Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century. The focus is upon the conceptual framework and theoretical interpretation of the empirical findings assembled in the book, rather than those empirical findings themselves (which are, in any case, broadly incontestable). The core theoretical logic of the distributional dynamics is explained and subjected to scrutiny with respect to the theory of distribution in particular, but also the theory of growth.
B51|Marx, Profits and Fractal Properties: notes on countertendencies to the fall of the rate of profit, simulation models and metamorphoses of capitalism|What really matters to understand capitalist dynamics in the long run are the countertendencies to the tendential fall of the rate of profit. For researchers in 2015, with all historical and statistical information on capitalist dynamics (not available to Marx, Schumpeter or Bain), capitalism can be seen as an engine for the creation of countertendencies to the fall of the rate of profit. Since classical political economy (Smith, Ricardo, Mill) and Marx the behavior of the rate of profit is a key subject of investigation, that has been also investigated by Schumpeter, evolutionary economist and modern industrial economics. Contemporary debates on the rate of profit would have three advantages vis-à-vis previous rounds of this long-lasting discussion: 1) the MEGA Project has provided more information Marx's works; 2) there are data on the long-term behavior of the rate of profit; 3) there are new tools to investigate the logic of capitalism as a complex system - a dialogue with physics is useful for this analysis. This paper combines different approaches and methods: a short review of the history of economic thought, lessons from economic history, data analysis of the movements of the rate of profit and a simulation model to test our understanding of those movements - a model based on two very simple rules, inspired on an interpretation of Marx's insights about the contradictory interaction between the tendency and the countertendencies to the fall of the rate of profit. These different approaches and methods organize this paper.
B51|Marxist Theory of Land Rent. Original Exposure and Contemporary Reformulations|"Here is presented an English version of the first two chapters of the book of Samuel Jaramillo Hacia una teoría de la renta del suelo urbano (2009) (Towards a theory of Urban Land Rent) that is only published in Spanish. This is justified because the theme developed in these two chapters have greater thematic scope than the book, since it refers to the general category of rent, which has a crucial role in the Marxist interpretation of value and price formation in capitalism, and these days it is the subject of several debates. Therefore, it may be interesting not only to those involved in real estate and urban phenomena. The two chapters have autonomy and great consistency as text. Its approach is original and challenging, as shown by the discussions awakened by the Spanish version. With this publication we want to broaden the spectrum of these theses and introduce them to those who do not speak Spanish and are interested in the topic of land property. The text has three core themes. In the first chapter a scheme of the original exposure of Marx, which is relatively sparse in his work, is presented. Initially we outline his general notions, and then, the different forms of manifestation of this category: Differential Rent Type I and Type II, Absolute Rent and Monopoly Rent. In the second chapter the main notes and objections that have been made to the original presentation, mainly in Latin American and French literature, are discussed. These objections are examined, their scope is evaluated, and is analyzed what could be the origin of the mismatches identified, when judged that they are justified. A reformulation of the original approach to absorb or overcome these difficulties is proposed. Three cores of discussion are analyzed: the Marx notion of Absolute Rent and its connection to an organic composition of capital in agriculture abnormally low; the presentation of Differential Rent Type II and the relationship with an unequal distribution of agricultural capital; the difference in nature that Marx proposes between Differential and Absolute Rent and the relationships established between the latter category with the private ownership of land. The chapter concludes with an outline of a general reformulation of the Marxist category of Rent, in order to overcome these criticisms and enhance its potential to interpret the dynamics of price formation and the distribution of value in capitalism. The latter is developed in the light of contemporary discussion of the Marxist theory of value, roughly following the perspective known as ""New Approach""."
B51|Una aproximación a los cambios en la composición económica de la clase dominante en el nuevo modo de desarrollo argentino (2002- 2009)|Este artículo apunta a dar cuenta de los cambios económicos de las clases dominantes en el marco del nuevo modo de desarrollo en la Argentina del siglo xxi. El texto intentará rastrear los procesos de recomposición económica de las clases dominantes luego de la salida devaluatoria de la crisis neoliberal en Argentina, específicamente en el periodo 2002-2009. Abordamos aquí, de manera renovada, las clásicas preguntas elaboradas en los estudios latinoamericanos de economía política: qué fracciones lideran el proceso de acumulación, cuál es el origen de estas fracciones y en qué ramas de la producción se ubican. ****** This article focuses on the economic changes at ruling class level within a framework of the new Argentine development mode in the twenty-first century. The text will try to trace the economic reassembling processes of the ruling classes after the neoliberal crisis in Argentina, specifically, in the 2002-2009 period. We address here in a renewed manner, the typical questions elaborated by the Latin-American studies of political economy: which fractions are leading the accumulation process, which are the origins of these fractions and in what production branches they are located?
B51|Encadenamientos, Clústeres y Flujos de Trabajo en la Economía Colombiana|Conocer de manera profunda las relaciones de interdependencia de la estructura económica es de gran importancia en el ejercicio de diseño de políticas económicas. Este trabajo usa el modelo insumo-producto para el análisis de impacto. Se aplican dos enfoques no usados tradicionalmente para la economía colombiana: análisis de descomposición espectral (Dietzenbacher, 1992) e identificación de clústeres (Garbellini & Wirkierman, 2014). El resultado es la construcción de indicadores de encadenamientos sin sesgo de sobrestimación o subestimación; y la identificación de clústeres de manera endógena. Adicionalmente se derivan los flujos de trabajo involucrado que se propagan a través de la red productiva. Cada uno de estos flujos se descompone en indicadores que permiten caracterizar los clústeres de acuerdo a: su cercanía con la demanda final, a su grado de cohesión con la red y a su importancia para el resto del sistema.

B51|Revisiting profit persistence and the stock market in Japan|This paper tests the classical hypothesis of inter-industry profit rate's proclivity to gravitate towards the economy's average profit rate. In so doing, individual as well as panel unit root tests have been applied on a dataset consisting of 52 Japanese manufacturing industries spanning the period 1974–2008. The evidence generated is rather mixed in a sense that the inter-industry profit rates tendency to gravitate towards the economy's average rate of profit depends on the idiosyncratic characteristics of each industry. However, the rate of profit of regulating capitals, as this is reflected in the incremental rate of profit, displays gravitational behaviour around the economy-wide incremental rate of profit, the movement of which is found to be linked to the rate of return in the stock market. These results lend support to those who contend that the classical theory of competition is an area where further research is warranted.
B51|Price–price deviations are highly persistent|The present paper explores the persistence of the deviations between market prices on one side and either production or direct prices on the other – namely their tendency to vanish after being hit by a shock. We consider various countries – Austria, Denmark, Italy, Norway, Japan and the US – across different time periods, econometric approaches and methods of computing direct and production prices. Results can change depending on these methods, but even the weakest results would point to price–price deviations taking 5 years to shrink by one half after a shock. The strongest results, instead, show no tendency of price–price deviations to disappear.
B51|Is a Marxist explanation of the current crisis possible?|The object of the paper is to explore whether, or to what extent, a Marxian explanation of the current capitalist crisis is possible. The answer is that, although Marx's theory offers important insights to understanding the ultimate causes of capitalist crises, it is not able to provide a fully satisfactory explanation of typical crises of contemporary capitalism. In particular, Marx's analysis cannot account for the long periods of stagnation following the eruption of financial and economic crises. In Marx's analytical context, crises are followed by recovery and growth in a relatively short span of time. It is argued that the main reason for Marx's inability to explain crises of contemporary capitalism is that he developed his analysis by considering free-competitive economies, whereas modern economies are characterized by monopolistic competition. A more satisfactory explanation of the current crisis requires going beyond Marx's original contributions.
B51|ヘクシャー=オリーン=サミュエルソン貿易理論と資本理論|本稿は、ヘクシャー=オリーン=サミュエルソンモデル（HOSモデル）の理論的発展をレビューする。ケンブリッジ資本論争における新古典派経済学に対する批判を受けて、HOS貿易理論がどのような反応を示したのかにとりわけ関心を向ける。Samuelson（1953）による一般均衡理論に基づくHOS貿易理論は、費用関数のヤコビアンを用いて要素価格均等化定理の成立条件を明らかにし、その後の研究の方向性に大きな影響を与えた。資本論争での1つの教訓は、資本が複数の再生産可能財から成る場合、限界生産力説が一般的には成立しないことであった。同様に、国際貿易理論の文脈でも、標準的なHOSモデルの様に資本を1つの本源的生産要素と取り扱うのではなく、複数の再生産可能財から成ると見做すならば、資本を複数の再生産可能な財からなるものとしてより適切に定式化された下では、2財の世界であれ、それ以上の財の存在する世界であれ、一般的に要素価格均等化が実現しない事を本稿は示す。資本論争での批判を受けて、Burmeister(1978)は資本が本源的生産要素ではなく再生産可能財から成る場合の要素価格均等化の成立条件の特徴づけを行ったが、彼が提示したモデルは資本論争で提起された問題を回避していることを示す。以上の議論は、既存の標準的なHOS貿易理論とは異なって、要素価格均等化の実現を前提とせずに、資本を複数の再生産可能な財からなるものとしてより適切に定式化された下での国際貿易の基礎理論を新たに再構築する必要性を示唆している。
B51|Transcending the Trend of Financialization: The Heterodox vs. Islamic Economics View|The paper aims to link three prominent issues relevant to the financial world today – the mounting level of financialization, heterodox perspective on functionless investors, and compatibility of Islamic principles to heterodox thinking particularly in regards to interest and uncertainty. Examining the vast array of burgeoning literature the paper argues that the trend of financialization in the capitalist countries has created a new class of capitalist with huge accumulation of wealth ensued merely from financial transactions. Income gap between the rich and poor has widened which is at odd with heterodox perception of equality among social classes. In the Marxian and Keynesian traditions, there is little room for functionless investors to expropriate surplus earned by working and entrepreneurial classes particularly through financing means or rent. We find Islamic prohibition of interest and uncertainty compatible with this heterodox thesis. Islam does not allow rentier income from interest; rather it encourages profit and loss sharing financial contracts so that uncertainty involving with the future income is shared by contracting parties.
B51|Financing the Capital Development of the Economy: A Keynes-Schumpeter-Minsky Synthesis|"This paper discusses the role that finance plays in promoting the capital development of the economy, with particular emphasis on the current situation of the United States and the United Kingdom. We define both 'finance' and 'capital development' very broadly. We begin with the observation that the financial system evolved over the postwar period, from one in which closely regulated and chartered commercial banks were dominant to one in which financial markets dominate the system. Over this period, the financial system grew rapidly relative to the nonfinancial sector, rising from about 10 percent of value added and a 10 percent share of corporate profits to 20 percent of value added and 40 percent of corporate profits in the United States. To a large degree, this was because finance, instead of financing the capital development of the economy, was financing itself. At the same time, the capital development of the economy suffered perceptibly. If we apply a broad definition -to include technological advances, rising labor productivity, public and private infrastructure, innovations, and the advance of human knowledge- the rate of growth of capacity has slowed. The past quarter century witnessed the greatest explosion of financial innovation the world had ever seen. Financial fragility grew until the economy collapsed into the global financial crisis. At the same time, we saw that much (or even most) of the financial innovation was directed outside the sphere of production -to complex financial instruments related to securitized mortgages, to commodities futures, and to a range of other financial derivatives. Unlike J. A. Schumpeter, Hyman Minsky did not see the banker merely as the ephor of capitalism, but as its key source of instability. Furthermore, due to ""financialisation of the real economy"", the picture is not simply one of runaway finance and an investment-starved real economy, but one where the real economy itself has retreated from funding investment opportunities and is instead either hoarding cash or using corporate profits for speculative investments such as share buybacks. As we will argue, financialization is rooted in predation; in Matt Taibbi's famous phrase, Wall Street behaves like a giant, blood-sucking ""vampire squid"". In this paper we will investigate financial reforms as well as other government policy that is necessary to promote the capital development of the economy, paying particular attention to increasing funding of the innovation process. For that reason, we will look not only to Minsky's ideas on the financial system, but also to Schumpeter's views on financing innovation."
B51|Marx's Theory of Money and 21st-century Macrodynamics|Marx's theory of money is critiqued relative to the advent of fiat and electronic currencies and the development of financial markets. Specific topics of concern include (1) today's identity of the money commodity, (2) possible heterogeneity of the money commodity, (3) the categories of land and rent as they pertain to the financial economy, (4) valuation of derivative securities, and (5) strategies for modeling, predicting, and controlling production and exchange of the money commodity and their interface with the real economy.
B51|El sistema de pensiones de reparto frente a los sistemas financiados: Una crítica a la teoría neoclásica/The Pay-As-You-Go Pension System against the Funded Schemes: A Criticism of the Neoclassical Theory|"El objetivo de este artículo es desmontar las bases teóricas que justifican la adopción obligatoria de esquemas de pensiones completamente financiados, públicos o privados, como sustitutos totales o parciales del actual sistema de reparto, no financiado en su totalidad. La transición desde un sistema público de reparto a otro completamente financiado no dotará a las generaciones futuras de un mayor capital, ni aumentará el producto per cápita. La causali¬dad neoclásica ?el ahorro genera inversión? no se cumple. Además, la privatización, total o completa, del sistema de pensiones plantea dudas relacionadas con el riesgo precio de los activos, la existencia de costes de transacción, y la equidad. La hipótesis de inestabilidad financiera (HIF) de Hyman Minsky ofrece un marco teórico de crítica a las hipótesis utilizadas para justificar la transición hacia un sistema de pensiones financiado y privado. Finalmente, se ofrecen soluciones a los problemas asociados al actual sistema de pensiones público de reparto. The aim of this article is to dismantle the theoretical bases that justify the adoption of mandatory fully funded schemes, public or private, as an alternative to the current pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system. Such a transition does not generate more capital and output per capita. The neoclassical causality ""saving precedes investment"" is not met. In addition, privatization of the pension system, raises questions related to the price-risk of assets, the existence of transaction costs and fairness. The financial instability hypothesis (HIF) of Hyman Minsky offers a critical theoretical framework of assumptions used to justify the transition from a PAYG system to a fully funded private pensions system. Finally, solutions to problems associated with the current PAYG system are provided."
B51|Neoliberalism, ‘Digitization’, and Creativity: the Issue of Applied Ontology|The paper extends Foucault’s analysis of neoliberalism in The Birth of Biopolitics. More specifically, I construct and defend an anti-Husserlian approach to the labour process with the objective of investigating how collectively generated forms of intellectual labour have been appropriated under capitalist relations of production. I also interrogate the way that different notions of (computational) applied ontology influence both the nature of and our very conception of social creativity. What, quite wrongly, has been thought of in Spinoza as pantheism is simply the reduction of the field of God to the universality of the signifier, which produces a serene, exceptional detachment from human desire. In so far as Spinoza says—desire is the essence of man, and in the radical dependence of the universality of the divine attributes, which is possible only through the function of the signifier, in so far as he does this, he obtains that unique position by which the philosopher—and it is no accident that it is a Jew detached from his tradition who embodies it—may be confused with a transcendent love. This position is not tenable for us. Experience shows us that Kant is more true, and I have proved that his theory of consciousness, when he writes of practical reason, is sustained only by giving a specification of the moral law which, looked at more closely, is simply desire in its pure state, that very desire that culminates in sacrifice, strictly speaking, of everything that is the object of love in one’s human tenderness—I would say, not only in the rejection of the pathological object, but also in its sacrifice and murder. That is why I wrote Kant avec Sade. (Lacan, 1979: 275-6) But it is like the story of the Resistance fighters who, wanting to destroy a pylon, balanced the plastic charges so well that the pylon blew up and fell back into its hole. From the Symbolic to the Imaginary, from castration to Oedipus, and from the despotic age to capitalism, inversely, there is the progress leading to the withdrawal of the overseeing and overcoding object from on high, which gives way to a social field of immanence where the decoded flows produce images and level them down. Whence the two aspects of the signifier: a barred transcendent signifier taken in a maximum that distributes lack, and an immanent system of relations between minimal elements that come to fill the uncovered field (somewhat similar in traditional terms to the way one goes from Parmenidean Being to the atoms of Democritus). (Deleuze and Guattari,1987: 290-1). Marx was vexed by the bourgeois character of the American working class. But it turned out that the prosperous Americans were merely showing the way for the British and the French and the Japanese. The universal class into which we are merging is not the revolutionary proletariat but the innovative bourgeoisie. (McClosky, D. 2009)
B51|Visible seeds of socialism and metamorphoses of capitalism: socialism after Rosdolsky|Roman Rosdolsky suggests a method to deal with the transition towards socialism that integrates three issues: 1) the identification of dynamic features of capitalism; 2) the systematisation of metamorphoses of capitalism; 3) the evaluation of how these metamorphoses reshape the elaboration of alternatives to capitalism. This evaluation is a precondition for the visualisation, within the complex dynamics of capitalism, of seeds of a new society—institutions born out of political struggles and of emancipatory features of key social processes. These institutions reshape the nature of the metamorphoses of capitalism and the possibility of establishing socialism and democracy.
B51|George Orwell and the Incoherence of Democratic Socialism|George Orwell's famous fictions, Animal Farm and Nineteen-Eighty Four were intended to advocate democratic socialism by portraying undemocratic forms of socialism as totalitarian. For Orwell, democracy was a political institution which would limit the abuse of power. But there are several problems with democratic socialism which ensure its failure. In Orwell's novel A Clergyman's Daughter, Orwell's views of economics and politics are inconsistent and conflicting in a way that ensures democratic socialism will not succeed on Orwell's terms. Democratic socialism in general is criticized according to F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom and John Jewkes's The New Ordeal by Planning, whose arguments differ crucially from those against market socialism by Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny. An economic analysis of the political institutions of democratic socialism shows that democratic socialism must necessarily fail for political (not economic) reasons even if nobody in authority has ill-intentions or abuses their power.
B51|Two Opposing Economic-Literary Critiques of Socialism: George Orwell Versus Eugen Richter and Henry Hazlitt|Orwell's famous fictions, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four criticized totalitarian forms of socialism from a Public Choice perspective, assuming that socialism would work as an economic system as long as the proper political institutions were in place to curb the potential for the abuse of power. This is contrasted with two novels by others who took the opposite approach: Richter's Pictures of the Socialistic Future and Hazlitt's Time Will Run Back. These two assumed that the political implementation of socialism would be perfect but that socialism would necessarily turn totalitarian because of the problem of economic calculation. These novels assumed away the Public Choice problem of institutions and the abuse of power and focused on the political implications of socialism as a purely economic system. Contrasting these two sets of novels shows how the Austrian and Public Choice schools criticize socialism in two entirely different ways.
B51|Networks in Manuel Castells’ theory of the network society|This paper discusses the conceptualization of network in Manuel Castells’ theory of network society. Castells’ early academic works were built on the structural analysis of capitalism and social movements in response to the contradictions of capitalist society, without any explicit connection to network analysis. Networks gradually appeared in Castells’ works in the late 1980s, when he became interested in the configuration of the relationships between technology, economy, and society. The culmination of this phase was his opus magnum, The Information Age trilogy, which introduced network as a key concept of his macro theory, even though he remained laconic about the concept itself. This is paradoxical, for Castells became possibly the most prominent figure globally in adopting network terminology in macro sociological theory, but at the same time made hardly any empirical, theoretical or methodological contribution to social network analysis or network theory in general. This implies that ‘network’ in Castells’ social theory is not an analytical concept but rather a powerful metaphor that served to capture his idea of the new social morphology of late capitalism.

B51|Capital In the 21st Century: A Review|This paper reviews Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century. Piketty's Capital seeks to bring the issue of inequality back to the centre of social analysis and to encourage discussion about the evolution of wealth and inequality with a view to inform policy. The book uses data stretching as far back as the 1700's. The main thesis of the book is that capitalism automatically generates inequality and wealth concentration since the rate of return on capital always exceeds the growth rate of income. To resolve this problem, the book proposes a progressive tax on wealth and income. I show that Piketty's book is based on a misunderstanding of classical political economy, particularly Marx. Piketty's view of the development and phases of capitalism is inadequate. His tax proposals, though progressive, will not resolve the inequality problem. Lastly, his conclusion that modern economic growth made it possible to avoid the Marxist apocalypse is not borne out by his data.
B51|Capital theory ‘paradoxes’ and paradoxical results: resolved or continued?|Abstract Capital theory controversies and ‘paradoxes’ showed that, due to price-feedback effects, the wage–production price–profit rate curves may display shapes inconsistent with the requirements of the neoclassical theory of value and distribution. Subsequent findings on a number of quite diverse actual single-product economies suggested that the impact of those effects is of limited empirical significance. This paper argues that, by focusing on the distributions of the eigenvalues and singular values of the system matrices, we can further study these issues and derive some meaningful theoretical results consistent with the available empirical evidence. Consequently, the real paradox, in the sense of knowledge vacuum and, thus, requiring further research, is the distributions of the characteristic values and not really the ‘paradoxes in capital theory’.
B51|Testing Bienenfeld’s Second-Order Approximation for the Wage-Profit Curve|This paper constructs Bienenfeld’s second-order approximation for the wage-profit curve and tests it using data from ten symmetric input-output tables of the Greek economy. The results suggest that there is room for using low-dimensional models as surrogates for actual single-product economies.
B51|From endogenous growth to stationary state: The world economy in the mathematical formulation of the Ricardian system| We analyse international trade in a Pasinetti–Ricardo growth model in the world economy scenario in which several small trading countries coexist and international commodity prices are determined by the interplay of supply and demand amongst them. We demonstrate that all the trading countries eventually reach the stationary state, though this process is not monotonic and the dynamics of capital and population may actually push some countries towards the stationary state and others away from it. We also use our model to assess an argument which Malthus employed in the second edition of An Essay on the Principle of Population (1803) to support a policy of agricultural protectionism.
B51|Half-forgotten Personalities of economic Thought - Robert Owen|Robert Owen was a British businessman, thinker, philanthropist, campaigner and reformer, who was looking non-violently for an alternative system. He is said to be a pioneer of socialism in Britain and a leader of the utopian socialist movement in the 19th century. He is also known as a predecessor of the cooperative movement. He tried to start a set of reforms, which were not followed.
B51|Crisi e centralizzazione del capitale finanziario (Crysis and Centralization of Financial Capital)|The possible nexus between economic crises and what Marx and Hilferding referred to as “centralisation” of capital is one of the themes raised by the “great recession”. The article reviews the main studies devoted to such a nexus, comparing the Marxist and mainstream economic literature. A double causal relation is analysed: both concerning the role of centralisation in feeding the contradictions of the capitalist system and its recurrent crises, and the impact of these crises on the very process of centralisation.
B51|Sylos Labini su Marx: implicazioni per la politica economica (Sylos Labini on Marx: economic policy implications)|This article considers Sylos Labini’s works on Marx (Sylos Labini, 1991; 1994). It places the Italian economist’s assessment of Marx in the context of the former’s wider economic production (both previous and subsequent to the 1991 article) and the debate that followed his “Carlo Marx: è tempo di un bilancio”. Such article, written right after the fall of Berlin’s Wall, attempted at developing a fair assessment of Marx’s thought, seen as one of the most important Classical economists and, from many points of view, a precursor of Keynes. Sylos Labini criticised Marx’s political position and what Sylos perceived as his “unethical behaviour”. On the contrary, he held Marx the economist in great regard.
B51|La crítica de la teoría del valor en Marx, Sraffa y Keynes: Un complemento conceptual para la economía|The paper presents the main capitalism contemporary characteristics: indebtedness and concentration. It has been a conceptual analysis at Ricardo and Marx value theories and his improvement by Sraffa and Keynes. However, the categories that was not included by these authors are incorporated. We conclude that indebtedness has a negative effect around the capital accumulation. The purpose of this paper is also to lay out the conceptual complement about the theories. The importance of research is in to incorporate indebtedness and capital concepts.
B51|Causality and interdependence in Pasinetti’s works and in the modern classical approach|The formal representation of economic theories normally takes the shape of a model, that is, a system of equations which connect the endogenous variables with the values of the parameters which are taken as given. Sometimes, it is possible to identify one or more equations which are able to determine a subset of endogenous variables priory and independently of the other equations and of the value taken by the remaining variables of the system. The first group of equations and variables are thus said to causally determine the remaining variables. In Pasinetti’s works, this notion of causality has often been emphasized as a formal property having the burden of conveying a profound economic meaning. In this paper, we will go through those works of Pasinetti where the notion of causality plays a central role, with the purpose of contextualizing it within the econometric debate of the Sixties, enucleate its economic meaning, and show its connections with other fields of the modern classical approach.
B51|Autonomous demand and economic growth:some empirical evidence|According to the Sraffian supermultiplier model, economic growth is driven by the autonomous components of aggregate demand (exports, public spending and autonomous consumption). This paper tests empirically some major implications of the model. For this purpose, we calculate time-series of the autonomous components of aggregate demand and of the supermultiplier for the US, France, Germany, Italy and Spain and describe their patterns in recent decades. We observe that changes in output and in autonomous demand are tightly correlated, both in the long and in the short-run. The supermultiplier is substantially higher and more stable in the US, while in the European countries it is lower and strongly decreasing. Consistently with theory, we find that where the supermultiplier is reasonably stable - i.e., in the US since the 1960s - autonomous demand and output share a common long-run trend (i.e, they are cointegrated). The estimation of a Vector Error-Correction model (VECM) on US data suggests that autonomous demand exerts a long-run effect on GDP, but also that there is simultaneous causality between the two variables. We propose an explanation based on the idea that autonomous demand is socially and historically determined. We then estimate the multiplier of autonomous spending through a panel instrumental-variables approach, finding that a one dollar increase in autonomous demand raises output by 1.6 dollars over four years. A further implication of the model that we test against empirical evidence is that increases in autonomous demand growth tend to be followed by increases in the investment share. Through Granger-causality tests and instrumental variables analysis, we find that this is the case in all five countries. An additional 1% increase in autonomous demand raises the investment share by 0.57 percentage points of GDP in the long-run
B51|Distribution and Cost-Push inflation in Brazil under inflation targeting, 1999-2014|In this paper we analyze the evolution of Brazilian inflation under the inflation targeting system from a cost-push perspective. We identify the main features of three quite distinct phases (1999-2003, 2004-2009 and 2010-2014) and explain them in terms of tradable price trends in local currency, changes in the dynamics of monitored prices and behavior of wage inflation. We conclude that the trend towards continuous nominal exchange rate devaluation after mid-2011, together with the strengthening of the bargaining power of workers and the trend of rising real wages since 2006, means that distributive conflicts in Brazil are getting much more intense. We also suggest that the apparently very irrational recent (early 2015) change in the orientation of economic policy towards contractionary fiscal, incomes and monetary policies in a stagnating economy seems to be ultimately based on the desire to weaken the bargaining power of workers that was much strengthened during the brief but intense Brazilian “golden age” of 2004-2010.
B51|Engaging Geopolitical Economy|Two-volumes: This work advances geopolitical economy as a new approach to understanding the evolution of the capitalist world order and its twenty-first century form of multipolarity. It revives and redeploys the idea of uneven and combined development (UCD) as a way of uniting the understanding of domestic and international developments, and the struggles of classes and nations, into a single perspective as critical to this task. Geopolitical economy, as developed in VOLUME 30A, sheds light on the nature of contemporary international tensions as never before. VOLUME 30B then advances geopolitical economy as a new approach to the study of international relations and international political economy. Following upon the theoretical limitations exposed in Volume A, the analytical limitations are explored in this volume.
B51|À propos de la théorie du néo-surtravail|Nous nous proposons ici de discuter la théorie du néo-surtravail développée par Guillaume Tiffon. La théorie du néo-surtravail vise à expliciter les conditions sous lesquelles le « travail du client » peut être, dans le cadre de la production d’une « marchandise-service », créateur de valeur d’échange. Elle permettrait ainsi d’asseoir l’idée, déjà développée par ailleurs (Dujarier, 2008), d’un modèle productif reposant sur la mise au travail de la clientèle. Cependant, nous voudrions montrer qu’elle souffre de quelques ambiguïtés et confusions qui altèrent sa cohérence logique.
B51|Materialized Composition of Capital and its Stability in the United States|The materialized composition of capital, a concept needing more attention, helps to correctly understand the value or organic composition that Marx discussed. For theoretical clarity, it is actually preferable. Evidence from frequently utilized data indicates that the materialized composition in the United States has been stable since 1956 at a level around two. Changes in the value or oft-cited organic composition of capital have, therefore, been limited to changes in the rate of surplus value.
B51|Unproductive Activity and Endogenous Technological Change in a Marxian Model of Economic Reproduction and Growth|This paper integrates unproductive activity into a Marxist growth model based on Marxâ€™s reproduction schemes. Labor extraction and technological change are related to the production and distribution of surplus and thus are endogenous. Unproductive labor is shown to have potentially contradictory effects. It can squeeze profits and reduce growth or increase work intensity and develop productivity enhancing technological change, which increase profitability and growth. Empirical evidence indicates that both effects occurred in the postwar United States. Marxâ€™s reproduction schemes are also shown to rely on a classical growth dynamic in which the profit and savings rates determine the rate of growth.
B51|Was Henri de Man an Early Post-Keynesian Neo-Marxist?|Henri de Man is the author of the dissenting â€œAu-delÃ du Marxismeâ€ (1926) and of the Belgian Plan du Travail (Labor Plan) of 1933. Later he became a Belgian social-democratic leader. He published between 1931 and 1935 18 economic articles in the Bulletin dâ€™Information et de Documentation of the National Bank of Belgium. It is shown that the articles, partly inspired by Keynesâ€™s writings up to 1931, are rather reflecting early Keynesian economic ideas relating to government intervention and public works, and do not contain any reference to the multiplier mechanism. A number of arguments in the articles are, however, advocating a Marxist inspired underconsumption theory. Based on further analysis of these articles, it is concluded that they contain also other important characteristics in common with the post-Keynesian neo-Marxist economic theories developed after the Second World War, such as the importance attached to the external markets of capitalism and a rejection of the labor theory of value, as well as a neglect of the Marxian law of the falling rate of profits. Their economic ideas are rooted in Marxism and the analysis of new economic phenomena, including the early Keynesianism of John Maynard Keynes. Therefore, they should be considered as an early version of these theories.
B51|On the Cambridge, England, Critique of the Marginal Productivity Theory of Distribution|The Cambridge critique of the marginal productivity theory of distribution is entwined with the criticsâ€™ theories of value, price, distribution, capital, growth, and methodology that occurred alongside it. The article first discusses these dimensions, then the inescapable need to explain the origin and size and rate of profits in any approach to the theory of distribution. The need in the neoclassical approach to have a unit in which to measure capital that is independent of distribution and prices is examined. The alternative classical/Marxian alternative and the relationship of pricing and market structures to systemic relationships in Post-Keynesian theory are analysed. Unresolved debates among the critics of the mainstream are outlined including those between Garegnani and Hahn. Ways forward are suggested in the concluding section.
B51|Two Kinds of MELT and Their Determinations|In an article published in 2011 in this journal, Fred Moseley tries to discuss how the value of inconvertible credit money is determined in a Marxian theoretical tradition. In this critical comment, while sharing some crucial views with Moseley, the author makes a critique to some views in Moseley. The first critique concerns the so-called circular reasoning in the MELT as defined by the New Interpretation. The second concerns the relationship between Moseleyâ€™s MELT and capital accumulation. In his definition of MELT with inconvertible credit money, Moseley seems to overlook a theoretical tradition embodied especially in the work of Okishio-Foley-Kotz, which to different extents points out that the incentive and the real magnitude of capital accumulation or new investment play a crucial role in determining the value of inconvertible credit money.
B51|Capital Accumulation, Profitability, and Crisis|This paper uses the rate of profit to address the issue of structural changes in class relationships and the process of capital accumulation that occurred under neoliberalism. I take a long-term class perspective and show that changing class relationships along with the financialization of the economy beginning in early 1980s progressively set the stage for the crisis of 2007-2009.
B51|The Top One Percent and Exploitation Measures|With the Occupy movement that recently took place on Wall Street and in other parts of the globe, a lot of attention has recently been given to growing income inequality. The 2008 United States financial crisis, the Great Recession, and the subsequent weak recovery have brought about a more serious focus on income inequality and the widening income gap between the top 1 percent and other groups. These events have brought about some social unrest and instability in American society perhaps not seen since the Great Depression. How much has the top 1 percent of households gained in terms of income versus the other 99 percent in the United States over the last 30 years or so? Mainstream economists and other social scientists point to various causes which have been mentioned in many scholarly and popular writings. All of these mainstream factors affecting inequality have been found to be statistically significant in one scholarly study or another. This research paper explores other major concepts to explain income inequality rather than to dispute the findings of other existing research efforts. The empirical findings of this paper support radical arguments that income accumulation of those at the top is not connected to the productivity of capital investment, but rather instead is connected to the declining incomes and exploitation of the rest of the U.S. population despite the rising output per worker of the U.S. workforce over the last 30 to 40 years.
B51|Capitalism and Forms of Capitalism|To understand a severe economic crisis such as that of 2008, it is not sufficient to analyze capitalism-in-general along with various economic policy decisions and contingent events. An adequate analysis requires taking account of the particular form of capitalism. This approach to crisis theory is illustrated by an examination of the roots of the economic crisis that broke out in 2008 in the United States.
