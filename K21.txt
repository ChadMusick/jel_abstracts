K21|Challenges for EU Merger Control|The proposal to relax EU merger control to allow for anti-competitive ô€‡²European Championsô€‡³ may lead policy makers to update current merger control. While we see little merit in this specific proposal, we recommend a revision that goes into a different direction and, in particular, addresses mergers of potential competitors and the burden of proof. Thus, our proposal aims at the EC addressing problems of under-enforcement and making better-informed decisions. However, we would find it sensible to introduce in the Merger Regulation a clause whereby in exceptional and well-defined cases a merger, which would otherwise pass muster on competition grounds, may be prohibited due to defence, strategic and security of supply considerations.
K21|Mergers, Mavericks, and Tacit Collusion|We study whether firms’ collusive ability influences their incentives to merge: when tacit collusion is unsuccessful, firms may merge to reduce competitive pressure. We run a series of Bertrand oligopoly experiments where the participants decide whether, when, and to whom they send merger bids. Our experimental design allows us to observe (i) when and to whom mergers are proposed, (ii) when and by whom merger offers are accepted, and (iii) the effect on prices when mergers occur in this way. Our findings suggest that firms send more merger offers when prices are closer to marginal costs. Maverick firms that cut prices and thereby fuel competition are the predominant (but reluctant) receivers of these offers.
K21|Exclusive Data, Price Manipulation and Market Leadership|The unprecedented access of firms to consumer level data not only facilitates more precisely targeted individual pricing but also alters firms’ strategic incentives. We show that exclusive access to a list of consumers can provide incentives for a firm to endogenously assume the price leader’s role, and so to strategically manipulate its rival’s price. Prices and profits are non-monotonic in the length of the consumer list. For an intermediate size, price leadership entails a semi-collusive outcome, characterized by supra-competitive prices and low consumer surplus. In contrast, for short or long lists of consumers, exclusive data availability intensifies market competition.
K21|Cooperation, Dependence and Eviction - How Platform-To-Business Relationships in Mobile Telephony Ecosystems Should Be Addressed in A Competition Law Perspective?|This contribution aims at analysing the potential effects of competition law based decisions in the mobile operating systems domain, considering their two-sided structure. Based on the notion of complementary investments, it proposes to investigate the relationships between the pivotal player and its partners. After establishing the economic and technical grounds underlying their contractual relationships, we assess them under the length of competition laws requirements. We show that, despite the gains that can result from these relationships, their asymmetrical nature may induce abuses of dominance or anticompetitive takeovers. However, we stress that competition law based remedies may be poorly efficient to address these issues. Cette contribution porte sur les effets des décisions concurrentielles dans le domaine des systèmes d’exploitation mobiles en regard de leur structure de plateforme biface. S’appuyant sur la notion d’investissement complémentaire, elle se propose d’analyser les relations entre la firme pivot de chaque système et ses partenaires. Il s’agit d’évaluer en termes concurrentiels les dispositifs techniques et financiers qui les lient. Au-delà de cette question liée à l’évaluation de leur effet net sur la concurrence, il s’agit également de s’interroger sur les possibles abus d’exploitation et d’éviction qui peuvent résulter de telles relations complémentaires mais asymétriques. Cette contribution discute enfin les possibles effets de remèdes concurrentiels portant sur ces relations. Version en français de cet article
K21|The Late Emerging Consensus Among American Economists on Antitrust Laws in the Second New Deal|This paper presents the late convergence process from US economists that led them to support a strong antitrust enforcement in the late thirties despite their long standing distrust toward this legislation. The 1945 Alcoa decision crafted by Judge Hand embodied the results of this convergence. The purpose of antitrust law enforcement does not consist in promoting economic efficiency, as today’s more economic approach advocates, but in searching for a reasonable compromise aiming at preventing improper uses of economic power. This paper presents the path from which institutionalist economists, on one side, and Chicagoan neoliberals, on the other one, have converged on supporting the President F.D. Roosevelt administration towards reinvigorating antitrust law enforcement as of 1938, putting aside their initial preferences for a regulated competition model or for laissez-faire.
K21|Family Ownership and Antitrust Violations|We study how family ownership shapes the firms' likelihood of being involved in antitrust indictments. Using data from Italy, we show that family firms are significantly less likely than other firms to commit antitrust violations. To achieve identification, we exploit a law change that made it easier to transfer family control. Studying the mechanisms at play, we find that family firms are especially less likely to commit antitrust violations when they feature a more prominent size relative to the city where they are located, which magnifies reputational concerns. Next, we show that family firms involved in antitrust violations appoint more family members in top executive positions in the aftermath of the indictment. Moreover, these firms invest less and curb equity financing as compared to nonfamily firms. Collectively, our findings suggest that family control wards off reputational damages but, at the same time, it weakens the ability to expand in order to keep up with fiercer competition following the dismantlement of the anticompetitive practice.
K21|Dominance and the pre-emption of competition following the Servier and Paroxetine GSK judgments|This paper discusses, from economic and enforcement perspectives, unilateral conduct aimed at foreclosing the entry of generics. We assume, in line with empirical evidence, that before the entry of generics, competition takes place among originators mostly through non price instruments and in particular, promotion. The entry of generics for one molecule introduces head to head price competition for that molecule and changes competitive interactions among the originators that remain patent protected. First, we develop a model in which competition takes place through price and promotion and analyse the consequence of unilateral conduct preventing the entry of generics, thus prolonging the status quo. We find that that the extent to which this conduct reduces consumer welfare (if at all) depends on whether promotion enhances the utility of users and whether promotion also involves business stealing. In order to provide some guidance for enforcement, we characterise the competitive outcome that prevails before entry in terms of consumer welfare. We find that unlike what happens with price competition, common indicators of performance such as the number of firms, the level of concentration (for a given number of firms) and the intensity of rivalry might be negatively associated with consumer welfare. As a consequence, the foreclosure of entrants might lead to welfare losses even when the status quo involves intense non-price competition and low concentration. Finally, we consider how unilateral conduct towards generic entry can be dealt with in the current enforcement framework. In the Servier and Paroxetine cases, the foreclosure of generics has been framed as an abuse of a dominant position held by the originator before entry, in spite of evidence of non-price competition. We show that it would be preferable to frame the conduct as an abuse of the dominant position that the originator holds in the molecule market as a consequence of its patent. In such a framework, the dominant position is instrumental in making exclusion feasible.
K21|Tying in evolving industries, when future entry cannot be deterred|We show that the incentive to engage in exclusionary tying (of two complementary products) may arise even when the incumbent's dominant position in the primary market cannot be protected. By engaging in tying, an incumbent firm sacrifices current profits but can exclude a more efficient rival from a complementary market by depriving it of the critical scale it needs to be successful. In turn, exclusion in the complementary market allows the incumbent to be in a favorable position when a more efficient rival will enter the primary market, and to appropriate some of the rival's efficiency rents. The paper also shows that tying is a more profitable exclusionary strategy than pure bundling, and that exclusion is the less likely the higher the proportion of consumers who multi-home.
K21|De l’intérêt de créer un nouveau concept: la lucrativité limitée|The Interest in Creating a New Legal Concept: Limited Lucrativity The notion of non-profit is one of the foundations of the social economy. However, this reality is never accepted as a structuring criterion in Union law. Based on an analysis of European Union law rules and the case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the purpose of this article is first to show that the concept of non-profitmaking is not operational to distinguish profit-making enterprises from social economy enterprises. On this basis, the second question will be to determine what can be done to promote a better legal recognition of the social economy and its particularities in the European system. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union defines two categories of organisations: on the one hand, those organisations that do not seek profit and, on the other hand, civil or commercial law companies, which include cooperative companies. Under European Union law, certain associations, as well as all mutuals and cooperatives, are grouped together with profit-making companies. Wheter an entity is described, under its national law, as a non-profit or for-profit entity never has any beary on the application of Union’s law. It is therefore difficult to find examples in positive law where the absence of profit is valued per se and could be considered in the application of internal market and competition legislation. However, this reality has an impact on the way economic activity is carried out. Social economy enterprises therefore do not find their place in the current legal 6 frameworks. They are positioned in the same competitive perimeter as for-profit companies. How can the singularity of social economy enterprises in terms of limited profit distribution be reflected in the European Union laws? According to the binary classification currently used, neither their complete assimilation into the for-profit category nor their classification as non-profit enterprises reflect what social economy enterprises are and their needs. The first step of a useful response was taken by the ECJ in a decision concerning cooperatives. The ongoing work of the European Commission and the European Parliament to promote the concept of social enterprise in European Union law also offers interesting avenues for reflection. To go even further, we propose to introduce into EU law the notion of limited lucrativity, which would define all organisations (sometimes also called “not-for-profit entities”) which are likely to make profits but which are not intended to distribute them to their owners because their final purpose is different. This European concept would be operational because it could lead to the application of specific rules, for example on competition, public procurement or taxation. In any case, the aim would be to restore the conditions for free and undistorted competition with profit-making companies that are not subject to the same constraints on access to capital. The introduction of this concept into Union law would lead to better political recognition and legal translation at European level of one of the strong characteristics of social economy enterprises.
K21|25 Years of European Merger Control|We study the evolution of the EC’s merger decision procedure over the first 25 years of European competition policy. Using a novel dataset constructed at the level of the relevant markets and containing all merger cases over the 1990-2014 period, we evaluate how consistently arguments related to structural market parameters were applied over time. Using non-parametric machine learning techniques, we find that the importance of market shares and concentration measures has declined while the importance of barriers to entry and the risk of foreclosure has increased in the EC’s merger assessment following the 2004 merger policy reform.
K21|EU Merger Policy Predictability Using Random Forests|I study the predictability of the EC’s merger decision procedure before and after the 2004 merger policy reform based on a dataset covering all affected markets of mergers with an official decision documented by DG Comp between 1990 and 2014. Using the highly flexible, non-parametric random forest algorithm to predict DG Comp’s assessment of competitive concerns in markets affected by a merger, I find that the predictive performance of the random forests is much better than the performance of simple linear models. In particular, the random forests do much better in predicting the rare event of competitive concerns. Secondly, postreform, DG Comp seems to base its assessment on a more complex interaction of merger and market characteristics than pre-reform. The highly flexible random forest algorithm is able to detect these potentially complex interactions and, therefore, still allows for high prediction precision.
K21|The Impact of Stricter Merger Control on Bank Mergers and Acquisitions. Too-Big-To-Fail and Competition|The effect of regulations on the banking sector is a key question for financial intermediation. This paper provides evidence that merger control regulation, although not directly targeted at the banking sector, has substantial economic effects on bank mergers. Based on an extensive sample of European countries, we show that target announcement premia increased by up to 16 percentage points for mergers involving control shifts after changes in merger legislation, consistent with a market expectation of increased profitability. These effects go hand-in-hand with a reduction in the propensity for mergers to create banks that are too-big-to-fail in their country.
K21|How Law and Economics Was Marketed in a Hostile World: L'institutionnalisation du champ aux États-Unis de l'immédiat après-guerre aux années Reagan|Cet article met en relief l'implication des fondations d'entreprises dans le développement de la Law and Economics aux Etats-Unis des lendemains de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale aux années Reagan. Il s'appuie notamment sur l'analyse de trajectoires individuelles ou collectives, qu'il s'agisse des programmes de recherche menés à l'université de Chicago par Aaron Director autour de l'antitrust, des programmes de formation des juges portés par Henry Manne ou encore des travaux académiques et du parcours administratif de Robert Bork. Il met l'accent sur le rôle de fondations d'entreprises pro-marché dans l'essor de la Law and Economics et sur son impact sur les manières de juger.
K21|Exploitative Abuse and Abuse of Economic Dependence: What Can We Learn From an Industrial Organization Approach?|This article conducts a detailed analysis of the concept of economic dependence and exploitative abuse based on how their treatment in competition law and economics and their enforcement in European case law have evolved. Although the theoretical roots of these concepts lie in economic theory, these issues have been ignored or considered only scantily in the context of competition law enforcement. An effects-based approach should take these problems into account and could provide insights into how to portray the impacts of these abuses. We draw on two examples???from the agri-food industries and the digital economy???of relevant economic dependence issues. This paper highlights the existence of a paradox: although industrial organization models provide relevant tools to characterize these abuses, assess their effects, and devise remedies, it seems that they are seldom used by competition law enforcers.

K21|Dynamic Vertical Foreclosure|This paper shows that vertical foreclosure can have a dynamic rationale. By refusing to supply an efficient downstream rival, a vertically integrated incumbent sacrifices current profits but can exclude the rival by depriving it of the critical profits it needs to be successful. In turn, monopolising the downstream market may prevent the incumbent from losing most of its future profits because: (a) it allows the incumbent to extract more rents from an efficient upstream rival if future upstream entry cannot be discouraged; or (b) it also deters future upstream entry by weakening competition for the input and reducing the post-entry profits of the prospective upstream competitor.

K21|Controlling Algorithmic Collusion: short review of the literature, undecidability, and alternative approaches|Algorithms have played an increasingly important role in economic activity, as they becoming faster and smarter.Together with the increasing use of ever larger data sets, they may lead to significant changes in the way markets work. These developments have been raising concerns not only over the rights to privacy and consumers’ autonomy, but also on competition. Infringements of antitrust laws involving the use of algorithms have occurred in the past. However, current concerns are of a different nature as they relate to the role algorithms can play as facilitators of collusive behavior in repeated games, and the role increasingly sophisticated algorithms can play as autonomous implementers of pricing strategies, learning to collude without any explicit instructions provided by humanagents. In particular, it is recognized that the use of ‘learning algorithms’ can facilitate tacit collusion and lead to an increased blurring of borders between tacit and explicit collusion. Several authors who have addressed the possibilities for achieving tacit collusion equilibrium outcomes by algorithms interacting autonomously, have also consideredsome form of ex-ante assessment and regulation over the type of algorithms used by firms. By using well-known resultsin the theory of computation, I showthat such option faces serious challenges to its effectivenessdue to undecidability results. Ex-post assessment may be constrained as well. Notwithstanding several challenges face by current software testing methodologies, competition law enforcement and policy have much to gain from an interdisciplinary collaboration with computer science and mathematics.
K21|New Technology and Increasing Returns: The End of the Antitrust Century?|The advance of digital technology is changing the nature of markets, enhancing the capacity of corporations to extract more consumers' surplus and lower the wages paid to workers. The rise of new technology has also diminished the efficacy of traditional laws to regulate firms and corporations. This is best illustrated by antitrust laws. With the new technology, there is greater returns to scale in production, and further, it is possible to have different components of the same final good be produced by different firms in faraway places. Unlike in earlier times the n firms in one industry, say the automobile industry, would all be producing cars, now the n firms in that industry produce n different parts of the product, thereby getting enormous returns to scale. Such markets are described as vertically serrated markets and their equilibria are characterized. Traditional antitrust law does not apply to these markets because the high returns to scale are natural and not artificially induced. This compels us to look for novel ways to regulate such markets. This paper discusses, in particular, laws that compel firms to have widely dispersed share holdings.
K21|Antitrust Analysis with Upward Pricing Pressure and Cost Efficiencies|We investigate the accuracy of UPP as a tool in antitrust analysis when there are cost efficiencies from a horizontal merger. We include model-based, merger-specific cost efficiencies in a tractable manner and extend the standard UPP formulation to account for these efficiencies. The efficacy of the new UPP formulations is analyzed using Monte Carlo simulation of 40,000 mergers (8 scenarios, 5,000 mergers in each scenario). We find that the new UPP formulations yield substantial gains in prediction of post-merger prices, and there are substantial gains in merger screening accuracy as well. Moreover, the new UPP formulations outperform the standard UPP formulation at higher thresholds for all the standard cases in the paper. The results support the inclusion of model-based cost efficiencies in the standard UPP formulation for more accurate antitrust decision-making.
K21|Vertical Mergers: Ex Post Evidence and Ex Ante Evaluation Methods|This article assesses recent empirical evidence on efficiencies and competitive harm that are associated with vertical mergers. It evaluates both ex post or retrospective empirical studies that rely on post merger data and ex ante or forecasting techniques that use premerger data. It develops the idea that, although there is a need for vertical merger screening tools, there are a number of problems that are associated with attempts to adapt horizontal screens to the vertical context. Mergers in the technology, media, and telecom sectors are emphasized because they tend to dominate contested vertical mergers.
K21|Ex-post Analyse der Ministererlaubnis-Fälle - Gemeinwohl durch Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen?|Die sogenannte Ministererlaubnis als Teil der deutschen Fusionskontrolle repräsentiert wahrscheinlich das umstrittenste Instrument sowohl in der juristischen als auch in der ökonomischen Fachdiskussion. Vereinfachend ausgedrückt ermöglicht die Ministererlaubnis dem Bundeswirtschaftsminister, ein Zusammenschlussverbot des Bundeskartellamtes aufgrund von erwarteten positiven Gemeinwohleffekten aufzuheben. Zu den Kritikpunkten zählt dabei, dass die tatsächlichen Erlaubnisentscheidungen weniger durch Gemeinwohlerwägungen zu begründen seien als vielmehr durch politökonomische Interessen bzw. erfolgreiche Lobbyaktivitäten. Zwar können wir im vorliegenden Beitrag nicht die tatsächlichen Motivationen der Erlaubnisentscheidungen nachweisen, aber wir können mit Hilfe von Ex-Post-Analysen zeigen, dass sich nur in einem geringen Teil der Erlaubnisfälle die Gründe, welche zur Erlaubnis führten, ex-post empirisch bestätigt haben und auch auf die Fusion zurückzuführen sind. Damit kann die Ministererlaubnis in ihrer gegenwärtigen Form nicht als effektives Instrument einer gemeinwohlorientierten Korrektur von Fusionskontrollentscheidungen eingestuft werden.
K21|The new media economics of video-on-demand markets: Lessons for competition policy (updated version)|"The markets for audiovisual content are subject to dynamic change. Where once ""traditional"" (free-to-air, cable, satellite) television was dominating, i.e. linear audiovisual media services, markets display nowadays strong growth of different types of video-on-demand (VoD), i.e. nonlinear audiovisual media services, including both Paid-for VoD like Amazon Prime and Netflix and Advertised-financed VoD like YouTube. Competition policy decisions in such dynamic markets are always particularly challenging. The German competition authority was presented such a challenge when, at the beginning of the 2010s, German television providers sought to enter online VoD markets with the help of cooperative platforms. We review the antitrust concerns that were raised back then in an ex post analysis. In doing so, we first discuss the dynamic development of the German VoD markets during the last decade. In the second part of this paper, we derive four aspects, in which the previous antitrust analysis cannot be upheld from today's perspective. First, relevant implications of modern platform economics were neglected. Second, some inconsistencies in the assessment of the two projects appear to be inappropriate. Third, the emerging competitive pressure of international VoD providers was strongly underestimated. Fourth, the question of market power in online advertising markets looks very different at the end of the decade."
K21|Happily ever after? Vertical and horizontal mergers in the U.S. media industry|This paper provides an economic analysis of recent vertical and horizontal mergers in the U.S. industry for audiovisual media content, including the AT&T-Time Warner and the Disney-Fox mergers. Using a theory-driven approach, we examine economic effects of these types of mergers on market competition, focusing on digital media content distribution. In doing so, we address three research questions: (i) Is the current development of analyzing industry with its recent merger activity concerning? (ii) Would vertical or horizontal integration be more preferable for overall welfare and competition in this industry? (iii) What are implications for antitrust policy? We conclude from our analysis that in the already highly horizontally concentrated U.S. market for audiovisual content the process of further vertical integration creates concerns from a competition policy perspective. Moreover, even though horizontal concentration on some of the market stages may be anticompetitive as well, vertical integration is likely to be more harmful. As a consequence, we recommend a stricter approach to vertical merger control in this industry, as well as a more active abuse control against already vertically-integrated media companies.
K21|How does online streaming affect antitrust remedies to centralized marketing? The case of European football broadcasting rights|The collective sale of football broadcasting rights constitutes a cartel, which, in the European Union, is only allowed if it complies with a number of conditions and obligations, inter alia, partial unbundling and the no-single-buyer rule. These regulations were defined with traditional TV-markets in mind. However, the landscape of audiovisual broadcasting is quickly changing with online streaming services gaining popularity and relevance. This also alters the effects of the conditions and obligations for the centralized marketing arrangements. Partial unbundling may lead to increasing instead of decreasing prices for consumers. Moreover, the combination of partial unbundling and the no-single-buyer rule forces consumers into multiple subscriptions to several streaming services, which increases transaction costs. Consequently, competition authorities need to rethink the conditions and obligations they impose on centralized marketing arrangements in football. We recommend restricting the exclusivity of (live-)broadcasting rights and mandate third-party access to program guide information to redesign the remedies.
K21|Kartellrecht und Ökonomik: Institutions matter!|Der vorliegende Beitrag diskutiert die Schnittstelle zwischen Recht und Ökonomik in der Wettbewerbspolitik. Aus einer ökonomischen Perspektive werden Ansätze zu einer institutionenökonomischen Analyse der Kartellrechtsdurchsetzung betrachtet. Im Rahmen einer positiven Institutionenökonomik der Wettbewerbspolitik analysieren die Autoren informationsökonomische Aspekte, verhaltensökonomische Ansätze, sowie die politökonomische Dimension. Zudem werden Bausteine einer normativen Institutionenökonomik des Kartellrechts diskutiert. Schließlich exploriert der Beitrag soziologische Aspekte der Wettbewerbspolitik, welche in der Literatur bisher weitgehend vernachlässigt werden. Insgesamt weisen die Autoren auf zahlreiche offene Fragen für das optimale Institutionendesign bei der Kartellrechtsdurchsetzung hin und identifizieren zahlreiche offene Forschungsfragen für die institutionenökonomische Wettbewerbsforschung.
K21|Public interest considerations in European merger control regimes|Nowadays, merger control predominantly relies upon a strict analysis of the effects from merger and acquisitions on effective competition. However, there is scope for so-called public interest considerations in several European merger control regimes and recently a number of European politicians have called for more elbowroom for non-competition-oriented interventions into merger control. For instance, they did so in the context of the prohibition of the Siemens-Alstommerger and the upcoming industrial policy discussion about European Champions. Since the social welfare effects of competitive markets present an important public interest in itself, additional public interest considerations justifying an intervention need to be non-market in the sense that these goals stand in conflict with competition. However, a trade-off between effective competition and public interest, i.e. public interests that are better served through market power then through effective competition, is a rare phenomenon. This paper gives an overview of public interest considerations in the merger policy of European Union member states and analyzes four jurisdictions in more detail. We find that the institutional designs how public interests considerations are included in the merger control regimes lack focus on non-market public interest considerations across the analyzed jurisdictions. Furthermore, there are relevant shortcomings regarding transparency and legal certainty. Moreover, our ex-pots analysis shows that the empirical record of past public interest-motivated interventions is questionable with only few interventions yielding the desired effects. Therefore, we suggest revising the public interest regulations in the respective merger control regulations by narrowing their focus to real non-market public interests and by levying decision power on less politically-influenced bodies.
K21|Endogenous choice of minority shareholdings: Effects on product market competition|Non-controlling minority shareholdings in rivals (NCMS) lower the sustainability of collusion under a wide variety of circumstances. Nevertheless, NCMS are sometimes deemed to facilitate collusion, in particular if the level of NCMS is exogenous. The present paper endogenizes firms' choice of NCMS and answers the question: Would colluding firms find it rational to acquire NCMS in rivals? The study of the acquisition reveals that firms have an incentive to acquire NCMS which are accompanied by a shift from collusive to competitive behaviour.
K21|Do pump prices really follow Edgeworth cycles? Evidence from the German retail fuel market|Most of the literature on retail fuel markets find high-frequency and asymmetric price cycles. This is typically explained by the model of Edgeworth price cycles. A key element of this model is that prices fall to marginal costs during a cycle. It seems challenging to address this assumption empirically. However, I use a natural experiment in the German fuel market to analyze the effects of an external cost shock. I find strong evidence that prices do not fall to marginal costs. This is not in line with Edgeworth cycles and thus, should be taken into account when analyzing fuel markets.
K21|Market Power and Income Taxation|Does significant market power or the presence of large rents affect optimal income taxation, calling for greater redistribution due to tainted gains? Or perhaps less because of an additional wedge that distorts labor effort? Do concerns about inequality have implications for antitrust, regulation, trade, and other policies that influence market power, which contributes to inequality? This article addresses these questions in a model with heterogeneous abilities and hence a concern for distribution, markups, multiple sectors, ownership that is a function of income, allowance for any share of profits to be recoveries of investments (including rent-seeking efforts), endogenous labor supply, and a nonlinear income tax. In this model, proportional markups with no profit dissipation have no effect on the economy, and a policy that reduces a nonproportional markup raises (lowers) welfare when it is higher (lower) than a weighted average of other markups. With proportional (partial or full) profit dissipation, proportional markups are equivalent to a downward shift of the distribution of abilities, and the welfare effect of correcting nonproportional markups associated with nonproportional profit dissipation now depends also on the degree of dissipation and how that is affected by the policy. In all cases, optimal policies maximize consumer plus producer surplus, without regard to a policy’s distributive effects on consumers and profits or how markups and income taxation distort labor effort.
K21|A Study of Exclusionary Coalitions: The Canadian Sugar Coalition, 1888–1889|In this paper we examine exclusion accomplished by a coalition of firms—frequently, a coalition of suppliers and customers—that share the benefits of exclusion. As a particular historical example, we study the Canadian sugar industry of the 1880s, which was controlled by a complex coalition of refiners and wholesalers. We assess the incentives and conduct of the parties as revealed in the records of a House of Commons inquiry into anticompetitive practices in the industry. Drawing upon this example, we identify and evaluate several doctrinal approaches to establishing antitrust liability for anticompetitive exclusionary coalitions.
K21|Competitors In Merger Control: Shall They Be Merely Heard Or Also Listened To?|There are legal grounds to hear competitors in merger control proceedings, and competitor involvement has gained significance. To what extent this is economically sensible is our question. The competition authority applies some welfare standard while the competitor cares about its own profit. In general, but not always, this implies a conflict of interest. We formally model this setting with cheap talk signaling games, where hearing the competitor might convey valuable information to the authority, but also serve the competitor's own interests. We find that the authority will mostly have to ignore the competitor but, depending on the authority's own prior information, strictly following the competitor's selfish recommendation will improve the authority's decision. Complementary to our analysis, we provide empirical data of competitor involvement in EU merger cases and give an overview of the legal discussion in the EU and US.
K21|Bargaining power and market power: approaches to separation for the purposes of antitrust policy<BR>[Переговорная Сила И Рыночная Власть: Подходы К Разделению Для Целей Антимонопольной Политики]|At first glance, the effects of market power on one side of the market are similar to the effects of asymmetric distribution of bargaining power. This is the source of their mistaken confusion. These effects include both distributional and coordination. However, some of the effects may be related to the distribution of winnings, for example, in favor of sellers, but not related to restricting competition (the so-called exclusionary practices). The prevailing approaches to law enforcement in Russia, based primarily on the concepts of market power, dominant position and abuse of dominance, give rise to the question of the need to find a new balance between the categories of restriction of competition and the effects of bargaining power.
K21|Methods of intracompany control of antitrust risks in the strategic management system<BR>[Методы Внутрифирменного Контроля Антимонопольных Рисков В Системе Стратегического Менеджмента]|This article is devoted to the analysis of the system of intra-company control of antimonopoly risks through the consideration of practical examples of the implementation of internal control systems in the context of their elements, consistent with the goals and objectives of strategic management. According to international and national recommendations on the organization of antitrust compliance, as well as on the basis of the analyzed experience in the prevention and control of antitrust risks of domestic and foreign companies, the internal control system should include such elements as regulatory control of the control system, assessment and management of antitrust risks, and control methods, communication system, control measures and monitoring of compliance system. These elements are interrelated and the inefficiency of at least one of them leads to the inefficiency of the entire system, leveling the achievements in risk reduction.
K21|Dynamic Vertical Foreclosure|This paper shows that vertical foreclosure can have a dynamic rationale. By refusing to supply an efficient downstream rival, a vertically integrated incumbent sacrifices current profits but can exclude the rival by depriving it of the critical profits it needs to be successful. In turn, monopolizing the downstream market may prevent the incumbent from losing most of its future profits because: (a) it allows the incumbent to extract more rents from an efficient upstream rival if future upstream entry cannot be discouraged; or (b) it also deters future upstream entry by weakening competition for the input and reducing the post-entry profits of the prospective upstream competitor.
K21|Patent Protection and Threat of Litigation in Oligopoly|In a context of imperfect patent protection, this paper analyses the strategic use of patents from a novel perspective; patents are seen as a means available to the incumbent firm to control entry and, more importantly, to influence the post-entry market interaction process effectively, by creating the conditions that favour collusion. The level of patent protection chosen by the incumbent affects the likelihood that a potential entrant will be found guilty of patent infringement. This mechanism can operate as a punishment device that eases the conditions for collusion sustainability. Therefore, in a sense, patent protection can be regarded as an instrument allowing replication of the monopoly outcome in the context of a contestable market.
K21|Pricing algorithms in oligopoly: theory and antitrust implications|Pricing algorithms are computerized procedures that a seller may use to adapt instantaneously its price to market conditions, including to prices quoted by its rivals. These algorithms are related to the extensive use of web-collectors which contribute in many industries to identifying the best price. In such settings, price competition operates between algorithms, no longer between executives of brick and mortar companies. In this context, the question is to know whether economic efficiency is achieved as implicit forms of collusion may arise between the sellers. This paper is aimed at discussing this conceptual issue in a price-setting homogeneous product oligopoly with decreasing returns to scale where algorithms implement downward and upward matching policies. Using fixed point argument akin to general equilibrium theory, we find a multiplicity of equilibria with prices located between collusion and Cournot, if matching is allowed upward and downward. When matching operates only for price undercutting, this multiplicity is extended up to a bottom value of the market price, close to the competitive price. This bypasses the Bertrand-Edgeworth paradox. As a result, pricing algorithms may contribute to the stability of the market and also to welfare improvement.
K21|Collusion and Antitrust Enforcement in Advertising-Selling Platforms|This paper underlines the impact of indirect network externalities on the effectiveness of antitrust enforcement to deter collusion between advertising-selling platforms. Since two-sided collusion is less likely to be sustained as consumers (e.g. readers/viewers) become more ad-avoiders while the opposite is true for one-sided collusion, firms may be induced to semi-collude (collude on advertising while competing for consumers) instead of colluding on both sides. When firms semi-collude on advertising and consumers are neutral towards advertisements, the imposition of fines based on the illegal gain of the colluding side (one-sided fines) enhances cartel deterrence compared to fines based on the total illegal profits (two-sided fines).
K21|On the allocation of evidence among cartelists under a leniency program|The impact of leniency programs on cartelists’ decision to allocate the incriminating evidence is investigated. Firms are allowed to possess either exclusive or common pieces of cartel-related evidence. The cartel organization is able to allocate the incriminating evidence in an attempt to enhance the sustainability of the illicit agreement. Assuming that the Antitrust Authority (AA) provides incentives that induce confession, reporting is either partial or universal. It is shown that in the former case the cartel organization selects to split and equally share the evidence (each firm possesses only exclusive pieces) whereas in the latter case every firm may possess perfect evidence. Unless the conviction of an investigated cartel is unlikely, when the AA optimally anticipates the cartel’s ability to allocate the evidence, only partial information is obtained.
K21|Of course Collusion Should be Prosecuted. But Maybe... Or (The case for international antitrust agreements)|We study the incentives of competition authorities to prosecute collusive practices of domestic and foreign firms. For that purpose, we develop a model of multi-market contact between two firms that can engage in collusion in two countries. In each country, there is a competition authority with a mandate to maximize national welfare. Each competition authority decides its prosecution policy at the beginning of time and commits to it. In equilibrium, the ownership distribution of the firms (domestic versus foreign) affects prosecution policies. The country that does not own the firms prosecutes them as soon as information of collusion becomes available. On the contrary, the country that owns the firms has an incentive to protect their profits in foreign markets delaying prosecution. This strategic delay is valuable because it contains the information spreading that could trigger prosecution in the foreign country. Prosecution delays, however, are not optimal from the point of view of global welfare, something that could be solved through the integration of the competition authorities. The country of origin of the firms would nevertheless oppose integration. Finally, in a multi-industry setting, both countries delay prosecuting domestic firms, which again is not optimal from the point of view of global welfare. Moreover, in a multi-industry setting, both countries can be better off under integration.
K21|Debarment and Collusion in Procurement Auctions|This article presents the first experiment exploring the impact of debarments - the exclusion of colluding bidders - on collusion in procurement auctions. We find that debarments and their most common alternative, fines, reduce collusion and bids relative to a market with no sanction. The deterrent effect of debarments increases in their length. However, shorter debarments reduce efficiency and increase the bids of non-debarred bidders. This suggests that debarments that are too lenient may trigger tacit collusion among the bidders who remain in the market, thereby facilitating the very behavior they aim to deter.
K21|Competition Policy and Sector-Specific Regulation in the Financial Sector|Reforms of financial regulation after the crisis of 2007-2009 raise the question of what is the relation between financial regulators and competition authorities. Should competition authorities play a role in financial regulation? Should they co-operate with financial regulators? Or should they keep at a distance? The paper gives an overview over some of the issues that are involved in the discussion. Drawing on the experience of the network industries, the first part of the paper discusses the relation between competition authorities and sector-specific regulators more generally. Whereas competition policy involves the application of legal norms involving prohibitions that are formulated in abstract terms, sector-specific regulation involves authorities actually prescribing desired modes of behavior. The ongoing nature of relations makes regulators more prone to capture than competition authorities. In the financial sector, the potential for capture is particularly great because everyone is tempted by the idea that banks should fund their pet projects. Following an overview over the evolution of regulation and competition in the financial industry, the paper discusses various issues that are relevant for competition policy: Technological and regulatory barriers to entry, distortions of competition by explicit or implicit government guarantees, distortions of competition by bailouts making for artificial barriers to exit. Guarantees and bailouts in particular pose special challenges for merger control and for state aid control.
K21|Concentration in US Labor Markets: Evidence from Online Vacancy Data|Using data on the near-universe of online US job vacancies collected by Burning Glass Technologies in 2016, we calculate labor market concentration using the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) for each commuting zone by 6-digit SOC occupation. The average market has an HHI of 3,953, or the equivalent of 2.5 recruiting employers. 54% of labor markets are highly concentrated (above 2,500 HHI) according to the DOJ/FTC guidelines. Highly concentrated markets account for 17% of employment. All plausible alternative market definitions show that more than 33% of markets are highly concentrated, suggesting that employers have market power in many US labor markets.
K21|How EU Markets Became More Competitive Than US Markets: A Study of Institutional Drift|Until the 1990's, US markets were more competitive than European markets. Today, European markets have lower concentration, lower excess profits and lower regulatory barriers to entry. We document this surprising outcome and propose an explanation using a model of political support. Politicians care about consumer welfare but also enjoy retaining control over industrial policy. We show that politicians from different countries who set up a common regulator will make it more independent and more pro-competition than the national ones it replaces. Our comparative analysis of antitrust policy reveals strong support for this and other predictions of the model.
K21|Firm Scope and Spillovers from New Product Innovation: Evidence from Medical Devices|When firms span related product categories, spillovers across categories become central to firm strategy and industrial policy, due to their potential to foreclose competition and affect innovation incentives. We exploit major new product innovations in one medical device category, and detailed sales data across related categories, to develop a causal research design for spillovers at the customer level. We find evidence of spillovers, primarily associated with complementarities in usage. These spillovers imply large benefits to multi- vs. single-category firms, accounting for nearly one quarter of sales in the complimentary category (equivalent to four percent of revenue in the focal category).
K21|How effective are remedies in merger cases? A European and national assessment| Remedies form an essential tool of any enforcement action and need to be devised with great caution from National Competition Authorities (NCAs). If the remedy is ineffective, the enforcement action does not reach the desired objective and resources will have been wasted. If the remedy is disproportionate, the decision is put at risk in a possible subsequent appeal. Remedies either behavioural or structural imposed by competition authorities seek to eliminate unilateral or/and coordinated effects as a result of the merger and restore competition on the relevant market(s) to the status quo ante. Moreover, remedy packages have typically included extensive structural divestments to remove competition concerns. The scope of this paper is to examine various issues relating to the imposition of remedies in merger cases focusing on the gas and electricity sectors (i.e. commodity and capacity release programmes, customer release schemes, network related remedies). This study relies on the energy sector with a view to developing general principles for imposing effective remedies in other sectors as well. Given the nature of competition in energy markets, particularly effective remedies are those that involve gas release programmes, the sale of price-setting generation plants, network assets, and controlling stakes in merging parties’ competitors.
K21|A Recent Development in Civil Enforcement of Competition Law in Ireland: Section 14B Court Orders|A new more effective civil enforcement tool – a Section 14B Court Order – was introduced in 2012 to enhance Ireland’s competition law. Breaching such an order is contempt of court. Fines can be imposed by the courts for contempt, but not for civil breaches of competition law. Notwithstanding the advantages of Section 14B Court Orders, since 2012 the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, Ireland’s competition agency, has only used such orders on only one occasion – in 2012. There have, however, been a number of other cases where the evidence, albeit limited, suggests that such orders would have been a credible option.
K21|Cartel Sentencing in Ireland: Criminal Standards of Proof, But Civil Sanctions|On 20 June 2018 the Court of Appeal in Ireland’s first bid-rigging case determined that the €7,500 fine imposed by the lower court on a corporate officer was unduly lenient. It was increased to €45,000. The €10,000 fine on the undertaking was not varied. The effect of the Court’s judgment, if followed in future cartel cases, is that for cartels in Ireland the criminal standard of proof remains, but the only sanction is a fine, what in many EU jurisdictions is regarded as a civil sanction. No gaol sentence was imposed and no justification provided. This is likely to undermine the effectiveness of the Cartel Immunity Programme, a vital tool for cartel detection and prosecution. Fines based on the cartel induced price rise are not only seriously underestimated by the Court, by a factor of around five, but imposed on the wrong target (i.e. the corporate officer not the undertaking). Ignorance as a defence has been revived. Victims are blamed. Bid-rigging cartels appear – unjustifiably - to be of lesser importance than other types of hard core cartels. Major arguments made by the Director of Public Prosecutions in the appeal were simply ignored by the Court with no explanation offered. The prospect for competition law enforcement in Ireland is grim, particularly with respect to bid-rigging cartels which the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has made an enforcement priority.
K21|Optimal leniency programe for cartel abuses - an US and European perspective|Leniency is a program which gives immunity from fines or reduction of fines in cartel cases for those companies which decide to cooperate with antitrust agencies. The leniency program significantly reduces the difficulties, time and administrative costs of evidence of cartel violations, as the antitrust bodies receives assistance through leniency applications and further cooperation of cartel participant during the administrative procedure. Thanks to this, the antitrust bodies can detect and punish more cartels focusing on other abuses.Recently leniency programs are being misused because the same companies apply for leniency many times without being punished. Therefore, the program needs changes. The paper analyses US and European leniency programs and tries to find optimal solution for elimination of misuse of leniency.
K21|Common-Ownership Concentration and Corporate Conduct|The question of whether and how partial common-ownership links between strategically interacting firms affect firm objectives and behavior has been the subject of theoretical inquiry for decades. Since then, the growth of intermediated asset management and consolidation in the asset-management sector has led to more pronounced common ownership links at the beneficial-owner level. Recent empirical research has provided evidence consistent with the literature’s prediction that common ownership concentration (CoOCo) can affect product market outcomes. The resulting antitrust concerns have received worldwide attention. However, because CoOCo can change the objective function of the firm, the potential implications span all fields of economics that involve corporate conduct, including corporate governance, strategy, industrial organization, and financial economics. This article connects the papers establishing the theoretical foundations, reviews the empirical and legal literatures, and discusses challenges and opportunities for future research.
K21|Horizontal Mergers and Innovation|This paper discusses the effects of horizontal mergers on innovation. We rely on the existing academic literature and our own research work to present the various positive and negative effects of mergers on innovation. Our analysis shows that, even in the absence of technological spillovers and R&D complementarities, the overall impact of a merger on innovation may be positive. We derive a number of policy implications regarding the way innovation effects should be handled by competition authorities in merger control and highlight the differences with the analysis of price effects.
K21|How EU Markets Became More Competitive Than US Markets: A Study of Institutional Drift|Many European markets today appear more competitive than their American counterparts. We document this surprising reversal of history and propose an explanation. Our model of political support predicts that a supranational regulator enforces free markets beyond the preferences of any individual country. We find that European institutions are indeed more independent and enforce competition more strongly than any individual country ever did. Countries with ex-ante weaker institutions benefit more from the delegation of competition policy to the EU level. Our model also explains why political and lobbying expenditures have increased more in America than in Europe.
K21|The Effectiveness of Leniency Programs when Firms choose the Degree of Collusion|An antitrust authority deters collusion using nes and a leniency program. It chooses the probability of an investigation. Firms pick the degree of collusion: The more they collude, the higher are pro ts, but so is the probability of detection. Firms thus trade-o higher pro ts against higher expected nes. If rms are suciently patient, leniency is ine ective; it may even increase collusion. Increasing the probability of an investigation at low levels does not increase deterrence. Increasing the probability of an investigation at high levels reduces collusion, yet never completely.
K21|Minority Share Acquisitions and Collusion: Evidence from the Introduction of National Leniency Programs|There is a growing concern that minority shareholding (MS) in rival firms may facilitate collusion. To examine this concern, we exploit the fact that leniency programs (LPs) are generally recognized as a shock that destabilizes collusive agreements and study the effect that the introduction of an LP has on horizontal MS acquisitions. Using data from 63 countries over the period 1990-2013, we find a large increase in horizontal MS acquisitions in the year in which an LP is introduced, especially in large rivals. The effect is present however only in countries with an effective antitrust enforcement and low levels of corruption and only when the acquisitions involve stakes of 10% - 20%. These results suggest that MS acquisitions may stabilize collusive agreements that were destabilized by the introduction of the LP.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

K21|Common ownership and market entry: Evidence from the pharmaceutical industry|Common ownership - where two firms are at least partially owned by the same investor - and its impact on product market outcomes has recently drawn a lot of attention from scholars and practitioners alike. Theoretical and empirical research suggests that common ownership can lead to higher prices. This paper focuses on implications for market entry. To estimate the effect of common ownership on entry decisions, we focus on the pharmaceutical industry. In particular, we consider the entry decisions of generic pharmaceutical firms into drug markets opened up by the end of regulatory protection in the US. We first provide a theoretical framework that shows that a higher level of common ownership between the brand firm (incumbent) and potential generic entrant reduces the generic's incentives to entry. We provide robust evidence for this prediction. The effect is large: a one-standard-deviation increase in common ownership decreases the probability of generic entry by 9-13%. We extend our basic theoretical framework and allow for multiple entrants. Our model shows that for sufficiently high levels of common ownership, the classical idea of entry decisions being strategic substitutes can be reversed into being strategic complements. Our empirical results provide some support for these predictions.
K21|Price or Variety? An Evaluation of Mergers Effects in Grocery Retailing|Assortment decisions are key strategic instruments for firms responding to local market conditions. We assess this claim by studying the effect of a national merger between two large Dutch supermarket chains on prices and on the depth as well as composition of assortment. We adopt a difference-in-differences strategy that exploits local variation in the merger’s effects, controlling for selection on observables when defining our control group through a matching procedure. We show that the local change in competitive conditions due to the merger did not affect individual products’ prices but it led the merging parties to reposition their assortment and increase average category prices. While the low-variety and low-price target’s stores reduced the depth of their assortment when in direct competition with the acquirer’s stores, the latter increased their product variety. By analyzing the effect of the merger on category prices, we find that the target most likely dropped high priced products, while the acquirer added more of them. Thus, the merging firms reposition their product offerings in order to avoid cannibalization and lessen local competition. Further, we show that other dimensions of heterogeneity, such as market concentration, whether a divestiture was imposed by the Dutch competition authority, and the re-branding strategy of the target stores, are important for explaining the post-merger dynamics. A simple theoretical model of local-market variety competition explains most of our findings.

K21|Patent Protection and Threat of Litigation in Oligopoly|In recent years, the increasing awarding of patents has captured the attention of scholars operating in different fields. The economic literature has studied the causes of this proliferation; we propose an entry game focusing on one of the consequences, showing how an incumbent may create a patent portfolio in order to control market entry and to collude. The incumbent fixes the level of patent protection and the threat of denunciation reduces the entrant's expected profits; moreover, if the entrant deviates from collusion, the incumbent can strengthen punishment suing the competitor for patent infringement, reducing her incentive to deviate. Our analysis suggests that antitrust authorities should pay attention to the level of patent protection implemented by the incumbent and note whether the holder of a patent reacts to entry by either suing or not suing the competitor. In the model, we use completely general functional forms in analyzing the issues, and this allows us to obtain general results not depending on the assumptions about the kind of oligopolistic competition.
K21|Pouvoirs économiques privés et ordre concurrentiel : Une application à l’économie numérique|This paper analyses how competition law and economics tackles the issue of private economic power. Through a historical approach based on the evolutions of the economic thoughts and courts decisional practices, we stress a tension between recommendations based on a definition of the competitive order as a guarantee of access to market or of pluralism, and normative prescriptions based the consumer welfare maximisation, as the competition law enforcement unique criterion. We illustrate this debates with examples provided by digital markets and we open the discussion to the media sector.

K21|Sanzioni antitrust e vaglio giurisdizionale: uno sguardo alla tecnica di quantificazione|Da una disamina ad ampio spettro della casistica antitrust italiana in tema di intese e abuso di posizione dominante Ã¨ emersa unâ€™elevata propensione del giudice amministrativo nazionale a rideterminare (nel 52% dei casi) lâ€™importo delle sanzioni pecuniarie comminate dallâ€™AutoritÃ Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato (AGCM). Tale considerazione sembra confermata, in ottica comparativa, dal basso tasso di ricorsi accolti (10%) presso la Corte di Giustizia dellâ€™Unione Europea in tema di contenzioso antitrust. Da tale evidenza emergono alcuni quesiti. Il Giudice, quando esercita il suo sindacato di merito, si attiene alla stessa metodologia su cui si basa lâ€™AutoritÃ ? Modificando la sanzione, incide sulla funzione deterrente della stessa. Quindi: emerge un rischio di inficiare la capacitÃ deterrente della sanzione? Su tale sfondo, il presente lavoro indaga le modalitÃ con cui il giudice amministrativo italiano motiva e lega, nel dispositivo, lâ€™accolto con lâ€™effettiva rideterminazione eseguita. Lâ€™analisi sui casi parte da un dataset composto da n. 524 sanzioni AGCM comminate per abuso di posizione dominante e intese nel periodo 2000-2015. Per analizzare lâ€™approccio implementato dal giudice amministrativo si sono vagliati tutti i casi (n. 119) di procedimenti con sanzioni rideterminate a seguito di ricorso giurisdizionale. Le risultanze dellâ€™analisi condotta portano a ritenere fondato il timore che lâ€™opera del Giudice possa occasionalmente, tramite lâ€™attivitÃ di ridetermina, incidere sullâ€™efficienza ed efficacia complessiva dellâ€™apparato sanzionatorio antitrust. Tale rischio, andatosi attenuando nel tempo, puÃ² derivare da una incertezza metodologica alla base del calcolo della sanzione. Incertezza che si ritiene tanto piÃ¹ ampia quanto maggiore Ã¨ il distacco logico dalla tecnica tracciata nelle guidelines.
K21|Standards of proofs in sequential merger control procedures|We model merger control procedures as a process of sequential acquisition of information in which mergers can be cleared after a ?first phase of investigation. We fi?nd that the enforceability of clearance decisions at the end of the fi?rst phase is unattractive to the extent that it prevents the authorities to use their expectations as to whether evidence gathered in the fi?rst phase will be confi?rmed in the second phase. This deprives the ?first phase of its potential as an effective screening mechanism. We also fi?nd that when clearance decisions in the fi?rst phase are enforceable, a different (higher) standard in the fi?rst phase is only desirable when Phase I decisions are captured by merging parties (as opposed to complainants).

K21|How procedures shape substance: institutional design and antitrust evidentiary standards|Abstract This paper studies the relative impact of public and private competition law enforcement on the optimal evidence threshold for antitrust liability with asymmetric information on the true type of the defendant. We also determine how to set monetary transfers (award to plaintiff and payment by defendant) in complement to the optimal standard of evidence. We obtain that stronger public enforcement always leads to a lower optimal standard of evidence. This may only enhance welfare if the information available is good enough.
K21|Rent sharing to control noncartel supply in the German cement market|A challenge for many cartels is avoiding a destabilizing increase in noncartel supply in response to having raised price. In the case of the German cement cartel that operated over 1991â€“2002, the primary source of noncartel supply was imports from Eastern European cement manufacturers. Testimonies in a private enforcement case have claimed that the cartel sought to control imports by sharing rents with intermediaries in order to discourage them from sourcing foreign supply. Specifically, cartel members would allow an intermediary to issue the invoice for a transaction and charge a fee even though the output went directly from the cartel member's plant to the customer. We investigate this claim by first developing a theory of collusive pricing that takes account of the option of bribing intermediaries. The theory predicts that the cement cartel members are more likely to share rents with an intermediary when the nearest Eastern European plant is closer and there is more Eastern European capacity outside of the control of the cartel. Estimating a logit model that predicts when a cartel member sells through an intermediary, the empirical analysis supports both predictions.
K21|Settlements and Appeals in the European Commission’s Cartel Cases: An Empirical Assessment|Abstract The introduction of the European Union (EU) Settlement Procedure in 2008 aimed at promoting the speed and efficiency of cartel investigations by the European Commission (EC). We use a data set that consists of 575 firm groups that were convicted by the EC for cartelization from 2000 to 2015 to investigate the impact of the settlement procedure on the probability to file an appeal. Based on the estimation of a model of a firm’s decision to appeal in the pre-settlement era, we subsequently run out-of-sample predictions to estimate the number of hypothetical appeals cases in the settlement era absent the settlement procedure. Comparing these estimates with the actual number of appeals, we find a settlement-induced reduction in the number of appeals of about 53%.

K21|Competition policy issues in mobile network sharing: a European perspective|Network sharing agreements have become increasingly widespread in mobile telecommunications markets. They carry undeniable advantages to operators and consumers alike, but also the potential for consumer harm. We emphasize that not all NSAs are created equal: the assessment of harms and counterweighing benefits to customers due to an NSA is a complex endeavour. In this paper, we present a framework for the competitive assessment of NSAs, detailing the possible concerns that may arise, the main factors that influence their seriousness, ways to mitigate the concerns and the principles of assessing efficiency benefits.
K21|Concentration in US Labor Markets: Evidence From Online Vacancy Data|Using data on the near-universe of online US job vacancies collected by Burning Glass Technologies in 2016, we calculate labor market concentration using the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) for each commuting zone by 6-digit SOC occupation. The average market has an HHI of 4,378, or the equivalent of 2.3 recruiting employers. 60% of labor markets are highly concentrated (above 2,500 HHI) according to the DOJ/FTC guidelines. Highly concentrated markets account for 20% of employment. For manufacturing industries, we show that labor market concentration is distinct from product market concentration, and is negatively correlated with wages in each industry’s top occupation.
K21|Dynamic Vertical Foreclosure|This paper shows that vertical foreclosure can have a dynamic rationale. By refusing to supply an efficient downstream rival, a vertically integrated incumbent sacrifices current profits but can exclude the rival by depriving it of the critical profits it needs to be successful. In turn, monopolising the downstream market may prevent the incumbent from losing most of its future profits because: (a) it allows the incumbent to extract more rents from an efficient upstream rival if future upstream entry cannot be discouraged; or (b) it also deters future upstream entry by weakening competition for the input and reducing the post-entry profits of the prospective upstream competitor.
K21|The innovation theory of harm: an appraisal|In its recent decision on the Dow-DuPont case, the European Commission has adopted an innovation theory of harm (IToH), which holds that even horizontal mergers whose static effects are benign may be regarded as anticompetitive in a dynamic perspective, as mergers generally stifle innovation. This paper critically assesses the IToH, arguing that its theoretical foundations are too fragile to be the basis for radical policy changes. Antitrust authorities and the courts should continue to consider the impact of horizontal mergers on innovation, bearing in mind that the effect can go either way.
K21|Toward a coherent policy on cartel damages|The focus of cartel damages law is on the recovery of the cartel overcharge. Parties other than purchasers are often neglected, not only as a matter of judicial practice, but also due to legal restrictions. We argue that a narrow concept of standing - which excludes parties that supply either the cartel or the firms that purchase from the cartel with complementary product components - falls short of achieving effective antitrust enforcement and corrective justice in the best possible way. We provide a framework with two complementary products and show that under neither competition nor cartelization do the allocation and the distribution of surpluses depend on the market organization in place. Thus, we argue that prima facie producers of complements should be treated alike, regardless of whether they purchase from the cartel or supply the cartel or the cartel's customers. Moreover, based on various factors that determine the enforcement effect of antitrust damage claims and their role as an instrument to achieve corrective justice, we show that a broad concept of standing is, indeed, the preferable legal solution. While its implementation required a change of the position by the U.S. federal courts, we submit that it would amount to a consistent completion of the legal framework within the EU.
K21|Striking a Balance of Power between the Court of Justice and the EU Legislature: The Law on Competition Damages Actions as a Paradigm|The framework of EU law on cartel damages actions consists in part of rules established by the ECJ based on arts 101 and 102 TFEU in conjunction with the principle of effectiveness. These rules are an integral part of EU primary law. The notion of institutional balance, however, requires the Court to consider its own inherent limits on democratic legitimacy, accountability and expertise. In particular, the Court has to ensure that adequate scope remains for the EU legislature to exercise its legislative power pursuant to art.103 TFEU. It is argued that the ECJ has disregarded these restrictions and overstretched the principle of effectivenessâ€“â€“for instance, in its adjudication on liability for umbrella pricing and on access to leniency files, respectively. Consequently, the EU legislature must not consider itself bound by these standards.
K21|Common Ownership Concentration and Corporate Conduct|The question of whether and how partial common-ownership links between strategically interacting firms affect firm behavior has been the subject of theoretical inquiry for decades. Since then, consolidation and increasing concentration in the asset-management industry has led to more pronounced common ownership concentration (CoOCo). Moreover, recent empirical research has provided evidence consistent with the literature's key predictions. The resulting antitrust concerns have received much attention from policy makers worldwide. However, the implications are more general: CoOCo affects the objective function of the firm, and therefore has implications for all subfields of economics studying corporate conduct -- including corporate governance, strategy, industrial organization, and all of financial economics. This article connects the papers establishing the theoretical foundations, reviews the empirical and legal literatures, and discusses challenges and opportunities for future research.

Die bundesgerichtliche Rechtsprechung gef?hrdet die Koh?renz des Kartellgesetzes: W?hrend im Bereich der Fusionen und unangemessenen Preise ein ?Laissez faire?-Ansatz praktiziert wird, wird bei den Abre-den eine ?usserst interventionistischen Politik verfolgt. Den Unternehmen werden dadurch starke Anreize gesetzt, das harte Kartellverbot durch Fusionen zu umgehen.
K21|Coopération, dépendance et éviction - Quelle appréhension concurrentielle des liens inter-entreprises dans les écosystèmes de téléphonie mobile ?|This contribution aims at analysing the potential effects of competition law based decisions in the mobile operating systems domain, considering their two-sided structure. Based on the notion of complementary investments, it proposes to investigate the relationships between the pivotal player and its partners. After establishing the economic and technical grounds underlying their contractual relationships, we assess them under the length of competition laws requirements. We show that, despite the gains that can result from these relationships, their asymmetrical nature may induce abuses of dominance or anticompetitive takeovers. However, we stress that competition law based remedies may be poorly efficient to address these issues. View the English version of this paper Cette contribution porte sur les effets des décisions concurrentielles dans le domaine des systèmes d’exploitation mobiles en regard de leur structure de plateforme biface. S’appuyant sur la notion d’investissement complémentaire, elle se propose d’analyser les relations entre la firme pivot de chaque système et ses partenaires. Il s’agit d’évaluer en termes concurrentiels les dispositifs techniques et financiers qui les lient. Au-delà de cette question liée à l’évaluation de leur effet net sur la concurrence, il s’agit également de s’interroger sur les possibles abus d’exploitation et d’éviction qui peuvent résulter de telles relations complémentaires mais asymétriques. Cette contribution discute enfin les possibles effets de remèdes concurrentiels portant sur ces relations.
K21|Optimal enforcement of competition policy: the commitments procedure under uncertainty|Abstract The introduction of a commitments procedure in EU antitrust policy (Article 9 of Council Regulation 1/2003) has entitled the the European Commission to extensively settle cases of alleged anticompetitive conduct. In this paper, we use a formal model of law enforcement to identify the optimal procedure to remedy cases in a context of partial legal uncertainty (Katsoulacos and Ulph in Eur J Law Econ 41(2):255–282, 2016). We discuss in particular the merits of a policy of selective commitments where firms either take strong commitments or are investigated under the standard infringement procedure.
K21|Autonomous Algorithmic Collusion: Q-Learning Under Sequantial Pricing|A recent and prominent concern within competition policy and regulation is whether autonomous machine learning algorithms may learn to collude on prices. We show in a simulated environment that when algorithmic competitors update prices sequentially, Q-learning (a simple but well-established self-learning algorithm) coordinates on high fixed-price equilibria or profitable asymmetric price cycles. This occurs even though the algorithm does not communicate and does not receive any instructions to collude. We show that results are robust to changes to the learning parameters and timing and discuss how more advanced algorithms could deal with practical limitations.
K21|Horizontal Mergers and Innovation|This paper discusses the effects of horizontal mergers on innovation. We rely on the existing academic literature and our own research work to present the various positive and negative effects of mergers on innovation. Our analysis shows that the overall impact of a merger on innovation may be either positive or negative and sheds light on the circumstances under which each of these scenarios is likely to arise. We derive a number of policy implications regarding the way innovation effects should be handled by competition authorities in merger control and highlight the differences with the analysis of price effects.
K21|How Accurate is the Coordinate Price Pressure Index to Predict Mergers’ Coordinated Effects?|The Coordinate Price Pressure Index (CPPI) measures the incentives of two competitors to engage in a particular type of Parallel Accommodating Conduct (PAC). Specifically, it measures the incentives of a leader firm to initiate a unilateral percentage price increase, with the expectation that a follower firm will match it. Using a large set of simulated markets, we measure the accuracy of the index in terms of predicting the impact of a merger on firms’ incentives to engage in PAC. Results suggest that the CPPI only displays a fair performance when predicting an increase in firm’s incentives to engage in PAC, and only in mergers in which the diversion ratio between the target and the acquiring firm is low. However, the index displays a poor performance when predicting mergers with a significant anticompetitive effect.
K21|Mergers and Investments in New Products|We investigate the impact of a horizontal merger between two competitors on their incentives to develop new products. We show that a merger raises the incentives to innovate if and only if the merged entity's incremental gain from a second innovation is larger than the individual profit of an innovator when both firms innovate in the no-merger scenario. Applying this result to the Hotelling model, we find that a merger spurs innovation and can be beneficial to consumers if the degree of product differentiation is positive but not too high.
K21|The Effectiveness of Leniency Programs when Firms choose the Degree of Collusion|An antitrust authority deters collusion using fines and a leniency program. It chooses the probability of an investigation. Firms pick the degree of collusion: The more they collude, the higher are profits, but so is the probability of detection. Firms thus trade-off higher profits against higher expected fines. If firms are sufficiently patient, leniency is ineffective; it may even increase collusion. Increasing the probability of an investigation at low levels does not increase deterrence. Increasing the probability of an investigation at high levels reduces collusion, yet never completely.
K21|Local market structure and consumer prices: Evidence from a retail merger|This paper analyzes the effects of a merger between a German supermarket chain and a soft discounter on consumer prices. We exploit geographic variation in prices within retail chains and brands and use a difference-in-differences estimator to compare regional markets with a change in market structure to a control group in unaffected markets. Our results indicate that both insiders and outsiders raised average prices after the merger, particularly in regions with high expected change in retail concentration. In contrast, we estimate price declines in regions that did not experience a rise in concentration but were potentially affected by cost savings within the merged entity. We also provide evidence that remedies imposed by competition authorities were not sufficient to o set anti-competitive effects.
K21|Competition, collusion and spatial sales patterns: Theory and evidence|We study competition in markets with significant transport costs and capacity constraints. We compare the cases of price competition and coordination in a theoretical model and find that when firms compete, they more often serve more distant customers that are closer to plants of competitors. By means of a rich micro-level data set of the cement industry in Germany, we provide empirical evidence in support of this result. Controlling for other potentially confounding factors, such as the number of production plants and demand, we find that the transport distances between suppliers and customers were on average significantly lower in cartel years than in non-cartel years.
K21|Patent Protection and Threat of Litigation in Oligopoly|In recent years, the increasing awarding of patents has captured the attention of scholars operating in di?erent fields. Economic literature has studied the causes of this proliferation; we propose an entry game focusing on one of the consequences, showing how an incumbent may create a patent portfolio in order to control market entry and to collude. The incumbent fixes the level of patent protection and the threat of denunciation reduces the entrant’s expected profits; moreover, if the entrant deviates from collusion, the incumbent can strengthen punishment suing the competitor for patent infringement, reducing her incentive to deviate. Our analysis suggests that antitrust authorities should pay attention to the level of patent protection implemented by the incumbent and note whether the holder of a patent reacts to entry by either suing or not suing the competitor. In the model, we use completely general functional forms in analyzing the is- sues, and this allows us to obtain general results not depending on the assumptions about the kind of oligopolistic competition.

The giants of the internet are expanding into every corner of the economy, politics and our lives.

K21|Die Ministererlaubnis als Element der deutschen Wettbewerbsordnung: eine theoretische und empirische Analyse|Das Instrument der Ministererlaubnis ist ein viel diskutierter Sonderfall in der deutschen Wettbewerbspolitik, bei welchem der Bundeswirtschaftsminister einen vom Bundeskartellamt (BKartA) untersagten Zusammenschluss bei Vorliegen besonderer Gründe im Nachhinein doch noch erlauben kann. Im vorliegenden Beitrag werden sowohl die Ausgestaltung, als auch die Sinnhaftigkeit des Instrumentes an sich aus ökonomischer Sicht beleuchtet, indem zunächst die im Gesetz verankerten Gründe für eine Erlaubnis auf einen Konflikt mit dem Schutz des Wettbewerbs, als übergeordnete Aufgabe des BKartA, untersucht werden. Nach einer Analyse der bisherigen 22 FälleZum Zeitpunkt der Beitragsannahme im Jahr 2018 war die hier angegebene Zahl aktuell und damit auch die weitere Analyse der Fälle und Gründe vollständig. Seit Mai 2019 gibt es nun mit Miba/Zollern einen weiteren Ministererlaubnis-Fall, welcher hier jedoch logischerweise nicht berücksichtigt werden konnte., bezogen auf die jeweiligen Begründungen und Erfolge, werden abschließend fünf Möglichkeiten zur Novellierung des Instrumentes diskutiert. Dabei kommen die Autoren zu dem Schluss, dass eine Anpassung des Gesetzes, sowohl hinsichtlich des entscheidenden Gremiums, als auch bezüglich der zulässigen Begründungen für eine Ministererlaubnis, notwendig wäre, um das Bestehen des Instrumentes wohlfahrtsökonomisch rechtfertigen zu können.
K21|Modern industrial organization theory of media markets and competition policy implications|This paper outlines the modern industrial organization theory of media markets including competition policy implications. After recapturing fundamentals of industrial organization theory in a non-technical way, the state of the art of (i) modern platform economics, (ii) the economics of the so-called sharing economy, and (iii) the economics of data-based business models and data-driven markets is summarized in a detailed way and illustrated by modern media examples.
K21|The new media economics of video-on-demand markets: Lessons for competition policy|"The markets for audiovisual content are subject to dynamic change. Where once ""traditional"" (free-to-air, cable, satellite) television was dominating, i.e. linear audiovisual media services, markets display nowadays strong growth of different types of video-on-demand (VoD), i.e. nonlinear audiovisual media services, including both Paid-for VoD like Amazon Prime and Netflix and Advertised-financed VoD like YouTube. Competition policy decisions in such dynamic markets are always particularly challenging. The German competition authority was presented such a challenge when, at the beginning of the 2010s, German television providers sought to enter online VoD markets with the help of cooperative platforms. We review the antitrust concerns that were raised back then in an ex post analysis. In doing so, we first discuss the dynamic development of the German VoD markets during the last decade. In the second part of this paper, we derive four aspects, in which the previous antitrust analysis cannot be upheld from today's perspective. First, relevant implications of modern platform economics were neglected. Second, some inconsistencies in the assessment of the two projects appear to be inappropriate. Third, the emerging competitive pressure of international VoD providers was strongly underestimated. Fourth, the question of market power in online advertising markets looks very different at the end of the decade."
K21|Competition policy reform in Europe and Germany - Institutional change in the light of digitization|The ubiquitous process of digitization changes economic competition on markets in several ways and leads to the emergence of new business models. The increasing roles of digital platforms as well as data-driven markets represent two relevant examples. These developments challenge competition policy, which must consider the special economic characteristics of digital goods and markets. In Germany, national competition law was amended in 2017 in order to accommodate for digitization-driven changes in the economy and plans for further changes are already discussed. We review this institutional change from an economics perspective and argue that most of the reform's elements point into the right direction. However, some upcoming challenges may have been overlooked so far. Furthermore, we discuss whether European competition policy should follow the paragon of the German reform and amend its institutional framework accordingly. We find scope for reform particularly regarding data-driven markets, whereas platform economics appear to be already well-established.
K21|The brave new world of digital personal assistants: Benefits and challenges from an economic perspective|The paper applies economic theories to give an overview of the emerging phenomenon of digital personal assistants (DPAs). A DPA is an intelligent automated system that interacts with the user through a dialogue in natural language, and meanwhile applying third-party services to obtain information and perform various actions. We analyze the benefits of increasing usage of DPAs, such as reduction of transaction costs, enhanced organization efficiency, procompetitive effects, and boosting the e-commerce economy. Besides benefits, however, adopting DPA in life may also contain some risks and downsides, which may reduce the positive welfare effects or even lead to decreasing welfare: biased services, market power on the DPA market and economic dependence on a dominant DPA, potential leveraging of DPA suppliers' market power into neighboring markets, personalized data (ab)use and privacy, media bias and manipulation of public opinion.
K21|Salience and Online Sales: The Role of Brand Image Concerns|We provide a novel intuition for the observation that many brand manufacturers have restricted their retailers’ ability to resell brand products online. Our approach builds on models of salience according to which price disparities across distribution channels guide a consumer’s attention toward prices and lower her appreciation for quality. Thus, absent vertical restraints, one out of two distortions - a quality or a participation distortion - can arise in equilibrium. The quality distortion occurs if the manufacturer provides either an inefficiently low quality under price salience or an inefficiently high quality in order to prevent price salience. The participation distortion arises as offline sales might be entirely abandoned in order to prevent prices from becoming salient. Both distortions are ruled out if vertical restraints are imposed. As opposed to the current EU legislation that considers a range of vertical restraints as being hardcore restrictions of competition per se, we show that these constraints can be socially desirable if salience effects are taken into account.
K21|Competition agency guidelines and policy initiatives regarding the application of competition law vis-à-vis intellectual property: An analysis of jurisdictional approaches and emerging directions|Competition agency guidelines, policy statements and related advocacy are an important vehicle for policy expression and the guidance of firms across the full spectrum of anti-competitive practices and market conduct. The role of guidelines and policy statements has, arguably, been particularly important in the context of the competition policy treatment of intellectual property rights, given the complexity of this area, the importance that competition agencies attach to it, and its importance for innovation, technology transfer and economic growth. As such, this important normative material also provides a useful empirical foundation for mapping relevant trends and the evolution of policy thinking over time and across jurisdictions. In this light, the paper examines the competition agency guidelines, policy statements and related initiatives regarding intellectual property (IP) of the following three sets of jurisdictions: (i) the United States, Canada, the European Union and Australia; (ii) Japan and Korea; and (iii) the BRICS economies (Brazil, China, India, Russia, and South Africa). It focuses, to the extent possible, on a common set of issues addressed in one way or another in the majority of these jurisdictions, comprising: (i) the treatment of licensing practices, including refusals to license; (ii) anti-competitive patent settlements; (iii) issues concerning standard-essential patents (SEPs); (iv) the conduct of patent assertion entities (PAEs); and (v) competition advocacy activities focused on the IP system. Additionally, while the primary focus of the paper is on competition agency guidelines, policy statements and advocacy activities relating to IP, reference is also made to enforcement and case developments where they are helpful in illustrating relevant approaches and trends. Overall, the analysis suggests, firstly, that, in contrast to the situation prevailing twenty or thirty years ago, interest in the systematic application of competition law vis-à-vis IP certainly is no longer a preoccupation of only a few traditional developed jurisdictions. Secondly, we find evidence of significant cross-jurisdictional learning processes and partial policy convergence across the jurisdictions surveyed. Thirdly, the analysis also reveals the continuing potential for coordination failures in regard to the approaches taken by national authorities in this area, for example where jurisdictions take different approaches to specific practices such as refusals to license and/or give differing weights to industrial policy as opposed to consumer welfare or other objectives in their policy applications.
K21|Penalising on the basis of the severity of the offence: A sophisticated revenue-based cartel penalty|In Katsoulacos et al. (2015) we examined the welfare properties of a number of monetary penalty regimes for tackling cartels, including revenue-based penalties, the most widely used regime. We showed that for a typical industry overcharge–based penalties welfare-dominate the others. However these penalties are subject to criticisms on the grounds of high implementation costs and lack of transparency/uncertainty. In this paper we propose a new sophisticated revenue-based penalty regime in which the penalty base is the revenue of the cartel but the penalty rate increases in a systematic way with the cartel overcharge. Thus, the proposed regime formalises how revenue can be used as the base while taking into account the severity of the offence. We show that this hybrid regime can replicate the desirable welfare properties of overcharge-based penalties while having relatively low levels of implementation costs and of uncertainty, concluding that the proposed penalty regime deserves very serious attention from Competition Authorities.
K21|Collusive Benchmark Rates Fixing|Benchmark rates, such as Libor and Euribor, are proven vulnerable to manipulation. We analyze benchmark rate collusion, which is challenging due to varying and opposing trading interests of the subset of market participants that determine the rates. Our theory is based on two mechanisms. We define front running as information sharing that allows cartel members to optimally adjust their portfolios ahead of the market. To support the joint-profit maximizing rate, designated traders engage in costly manipulation of their submissions. We find that observed episodic recourse to independent quoting is part of a feasible continuous collusion equilibrium and that all panel members would want to participate in the scheme. Our model suggests that high rate volatility may be indicative of collusion. Further protocol reforms to broaden the class of transactions eligible for submission and to average over fewer middle quotes can unintentionally facilitate collusion.
K21|Application of time series techniques in relevant market delimitation|A key issue in the analysis of mergers in antitrust is the relevant market definition. The application of time-series techniques can be useful in this process, since only prices are required for the analysis, allowing for relatively rapid estimates. The objective of this work is to make an overview of the main time-series techniques used in the delineation of the relevant markets and make a qualitative analysis of the votes and technical notes of the cases involving the discussion of the application of time series in the relevant market definition submitted to the Brazilian Antitrust Authority (CADE). In this analysis, despite of its importance, there is a clear need for a careful assessment so the model can deliver robust and believable results. In addition, the importance of the hypothetical monopolist test and simulation methodologies for merger impact analysis are hardly replaced by time series techniques accordingly to Cade’s recent decisions.
K21|Entry and merger policy|This note examines merger policy towards new entrants. We show that the optimal policy is driven by a simple sufficient statistic and that, under certain conditions, competition authorities should commit to being more lenient towards successful, rather than unsuccessful, entrants.
K21|Challenges and Pitfalls in Cartel Policy and Fining|We analyze significant challenges and pitfalls faced by antitrust authorities in the implementation of competition policies particularly against naked cartels and propose measures principled in economic theory to circumvent these issues. We review leniency programs in different jurisdictions, the private versus public control of cartels, as well as the determination of cartel fines and other punishment instruments. Regarding cartel fines, we first discuss the sometimesconflicting objectives of restitution and deterrence, then the economic-based versus legal- and proportional-based punishment. Moreover, we assess the proper modeling of cartel dynamics including the probability of detection and conviction, the relevant cartel duration, and the estimation of but-for prices and cartel overcharges.
K21|The rise of economics in competition policy: A Canadian perspective|Competition policy in Canada and elsewhere has changed remarkably over the last 50 yearsin large measure due to advances in economics. In this article, we trace the impact of developments in industrial organization on the three central areas of competition policy: cartels, single firm conduct and mergers. We focus on Canadian competition policy but draw comparisons with developments in the United States and Europe.
K21|Vertical foreclosure and multi-segment competition|This paper analyzes a supplier’s incentives to foreclose downstream entry when entrants have stronger positions in different market segments, thus bringing added value as well as competition. We first consider the case where wholesale contracts take the form of linear tariffs, and characterize the conditions under which the competition-intensifying effect dominates, thereby leading to foreclosure. We then show that foreclosure can still occur with non-linear tariffs, even coupled with additional provisions such as resale price maintenance.
K21|Removing geo-blocking: What are the effects on innovation for vertically differentiated goods?|At present, there is a wide debate on regulating geo-blocking, an online practice that prevents consumers from buying or having access to products and services from another country. This practice is not only used by retailers, but is also of great importance in the market for digital visual broadcasting. We develop a model to identify the cases, in which firms have an incentive to include geo-blocking clauses in their licensing agreements. In addition, we analyze the effects of restricting geo-blocking on the level of innovation of two vertically differentiated goods and on the overall product variety. Our results show that the market outcome primarily depends on the level of competition between the two goods. For instance, regulatory changes do not have any impact if competition is very low or very high. However, if competition is sufficiently high, the removal of geo-blocking decreases the level of innovation of the good that is traded. The product quality of the other firm, instead, increases - as long as R&D costs are sufficiently high. Putting both effects together, it becomes evident that the quality gains do not compensate for the quality losses. In addition, the removal of geo-blocking affects the product variety as well - a lower level of competition increases the product variety and vice versa.
K21|The Effect of Competition Law on Brunei’s Small and Medium Enterprises|Brunei must enact an effective competition policy in order to participate as a member in regional trading blocs like the APEC, ASEAN and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. What effect would Brunei’s Competition Order have on Brunei – and specifically its small and medium enterprises or SMEs (the motor of non-petrol led growth)? We develop an indication of the scope of competition policy – and use that indicator in cross-country analysis to figure out competition’s effect on Brunei’s SMEs. Using back-of-the-envelope calculation methods, increasing competition under the status quo would likely cost Brunei US$100 million. Yet, if serious innovation policy tags along with Brunei’s expanding competition policy, Brunei’s SMEs could experience a $10 billion jump in GDP. Without policies to boost the effectiveness of the US$1.5 billion in Wawasan innovation spending, increased competition could harm Brunei’s SMEs. We identify the lack of Competition Commission independence and information dissemination.
K21|Potenziale von Standards für die deutsche Wirtschaft|Der fortschreitende technologische Wandel im Zuge der Digitalisierung bietet enorme Chancen für die deutsche Volkswirtschaft. Er beinhaltet jedoch ebenfalls zahlreiche Herausforderungen. Um die Chancen zu nutzen und gleichzeitig den Herausforderungen zu begegnen, muss der Weg in die digitalisierte Wirtschaft aktiv gestaltet werden. Dazu sind Standards prädestiniert. Über sie kann eine einheitliche digitale Infrastruktur und Sprache für die Unternehmen geschaffen und die Schnittstellenproblematik erheblich gemildert werden. Dadurch wird die Vernetzung von Wertschöpfungsketten auch über Unternehmensgrenzen hinweg erheblich erleichtert. Zur Beleuchtung der Bedeutung und Chancen von Standardisierung für die deutsche Wirtschaft wird gezeigt, dass einheitliche Standards Marktunvollkommenheiten beseitigen, die Ausnutzung von Skaleneffekten ermöglichen und positiv auf den internationalen Handel sowie Innovationen wirken. Die positiven Auswirkungen von Standards lassen sich zudem quantifizieren. Allein Normen tragen derzeit einen zweistelligen Milliardenbetrag zum Wachstum des deutschen Bruttoinlandsprodukts bei. Im Zuge der digitalen Transformation, die durch eine zunehmende Vernetzung sowie Interoperabilität über Unternehmensgrenzen hinweg geprägt ist, wird die Bedeutung von Standards noch weiter zunehmen. Die Analyse ihrer spezifischen Wirkungsweise erlaubt es dabei, gezielt Handlungsempfehlungen zur Stärkung der deutschen Wirtschaft abzuleiten. Für die Hebung der Potenziale der digitalen Transformation bedarf es einer Anstrengung aller Beteiligten. Die Unternehmen müssen auch durch eine unternehmensübergreifende Kooperation die Potentiale des technologischen Wandels heben und ihn mittels Normen sowie Standards aktiv gestalten. Die Politik muss dafür geeignete Rahmenbedingungen schaffen und die Unternehmen gegebenenfalls unterstützen, während die Normungsinstitute den Normenbestand sowie den Normungsprozess an die Erfordernisse der Digitalisierung anpassen müssen.
K21|Zwischen Kooperation und Wettbewerb: Industrie 4.0 und europäisches Kartellrecht|Im Zusammenhang mit der Digitalisierung von Prozessen vernetzen sich Unternehmen untereinander zunehmend. Dies hat viele Vorteile, wie eine Steigerung von Effizienz oder Produktivität, birgt aber auch Herausforderungen, weil die geltenden deutschen und europäischen Kartellrechtsvorgaben zu beachten sind. Vor diesem Hintergrund analysiert das vorliegende Papier, inwieweit die Kooperation von Unternehmen im Rahmen von Industrie 4.0 gestattet ist und wo die Grenzen liegen. Dabei wird zwischen der Vernetzung innerhalb eines Unternehmens, der vertikalen Zusammenarbeit entlang einer Wertschöpfungskette sowie der horizontalen Kooperation etwa mit Wettbewerbern unterschieden. Gerade letzterem sind enge Grenzen gesteckt, um einen fairen Wettbewerb sicherzustellen und einen Missbrauch von Marktmacht zu verhindern. Unternehmen, welche die enormen Potentiale von Industrie 4.0 nutzen wollen, sollten sich dieser bestehenden Grenzen bewusst sein, denn andernfalls drohen für die verantwortlichen Personen sowie die beteiligten Unternehmen empfindliche kartellrechtliche Strafen. Neben einer Berücksichtigung des Kartellrechts bei der Digitalisierung von Prozessen ist daher Compliance ein wesentliches Zukunftsthema für digitalisierte Unternehmen.
K21|Sind Wettbewerbe im Profisport Rattenrennen?|Eine Reihe von Autoren - vor allem im deutschsprachigen - Raum begründet die Notwendigkeit regulatorischer Eingriffe in Profisportmärkte damit, dass der Wettbewerb auf diesen Märkten systematisch versage. Als wesentliche Ursache für Wettbewerbsprobleme innerhalb dieser Ligen oder Meisterschaften gilt dem-nach das Auftreten eines ruinösen Wettbewerbs in Form von Rattenrennen à la Akerlof. Der vorliegende Beitrag untersucht die Frage, ob Rattenrennenmodelle eine geeignete Erklärung des ökonomischen Wettbewerbs in einer Sportliga darstellen und legt regulatorische Implikationen dar.
K21|Die Medienökonomik personalisierter Daten und der Facebook-Fall|Im Internet erfreut sich ein Geschäftsmodell erheblicher Beliebtheit, bei welchem den Nut-zern Dienstleistungen oder Inhalte (in traditionellen Geldeinheiten) unentgeltlich zur Verfügung gestellt werden und stattdessen die auf dem Wege der Nutzung durch die Nutzer (bewusst oder unbewusst) bereitgestellten persönlichen Daten profitabel verwertet werden, sei es für gezielte Werbung, die Personalisierung und Individualisierung von Produkten und Dienstleistungen oder für datenbasierte Preisdiskriminierung. Im Kontext dieser innovativen Unternehmensstrategien können beim Vorliegen von Marktmacht auch neuartige Formen des Missbrauchs dieser Marktmacht zu Lasten der Nutzer auftreten. So geht beispielsweise derzeit das Bundeskartellamt dem Verdacht nach, dass der dominierende Anbieter von Soziale-Medien-Dienstleistungen, Facebook, seine Marktmacht missbrauche, indem er den Nutzern zu weit reichende Nutzungsrechte an persönlichen Daten abverlangt. Der vorliegende Beitrag nimmt diesen aktuellen Fall zum Anlass, die neuere ökonomische Forschung zur Rolle personalisierter Daten auf Onlinemärkten fallbezogen zusammenzufassen und exemplarisch auf Facebook anzuwenden. Dabei werden mögliche Missbrauchsstrategien auf ihre Plausibilität untersucht. Dabei wird deutlich, dass auch auf Märkten bzw. Plattformseiten, auf denen kein Geld im Sinne der gesetzlichen Währung fließt, dennoch Ausbeutungsmissbrauch möglich und vorstellbar ist. Dies wäre auch im Falle Facebook denkbar, wobei hierzu ohne eine empirische Analyse interner Daten (welche den Autoren nicht vorliegen) keine endgültige Aussage möglich ist.
K21|Wettbewerbsregeln für das Digitale Zeitalter - Die Ökonomik personalisierter Daten, Verbraucherschutz und die 9. GWB-Novelle|Die Digitalisierung der Wirtschaftsbeziehungen stellt die Wettbewerbspolitik vor erhebliche Herausforderungen. Um diesen zu begegnen, soll das Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen (GWB) mit Hilfe der 9. Novelle fit gemacht werden für das digitale Zeitalter. Der vorliegende Beitrag gibt eine Übersicht über die wesentlichen Änderungen der deutschen Wettbewerbsregeln und diskutiert ausgewählte, die digitale Ökonomie betreffende Änderungen vor dem Hintergrund des aktuellen Standes der Wirtschaftstheorie. Dabei wird deutlich, dass die 9. Novelle in einigen Bereichen eine Verbesserung der Wettbewerbspolitik in digitalisierten Märkten ermöglicht, in anderen Bereichen jedoch zu kurz greift. Schließlich werden drei Bereiche des andauernden Digitalisierungsprozesses skizziert, von denen zu erwarten ist, dass sie die Wettbewerbspolitik in den nächsten Jahren vor neue Herausforderungen stellen werden.
K21|Four cases in sports competition policy: Baseball, judo, football, and motor racing|Practices and conducts in professional and even amateur sports can be subject to competition laws as soon as commercial activities are involved. From an economic perspective, this implies that both directly commercial activities like the sale of broadcasting/media rights and indirectly commercial activities like defining and enforcing the rules of the games can be hit by competition policy interventions. Setting and enforcing the rules of the game is an activity with commercial effects because it influences attractiveness and marketability of the sports in question. After discussing fundamental issues, this contributions reviews selected landmark cases in sports competition policy from an economic perspective. This includes the U.S. baseball antitrust exemption, access rules to Judo tournaments, sale systems of media rights in European football as well as a unique combination of long-run exclusivity contracts, skewed allocation of common revenues, and special influences on rule-setting by some competitors in Formula One motor racing. Eventually, the areas of state aid to football clubs and mergers in Danish football are sketched.
K21|Market-internal financial regulation in sports as an anticompetitive institution|"Financial regulation in sports is usually discussed in the context of representing an instrument against ""financial doping"". Notwithstanding the merits of this discussion, this paper takes the opposite perspective and analyses how market-internal financial regulation itself may anticompetitively influence sporting results. Virtually every regulative financial intervention distorts sporting competition to some extent and creates beneficiaries and losers. Sometimes, the actual winners and losers of financial regulation stand in line with the (legitimate) goals of the regulation like limiting financial imbalances or preventing distortive midseason insolvencies of teams. However, financial regulation may also display unintended side-effects like protecting hitherto successful teams from new challengers, cementing the competitive order, creating foreclosure and entry barriers, or serving vested interests of powerful parties. All of these effects may also be hidden agendas by those who are implementing and enforcing market-internal financial regulation or influencing it. This paper analyses various types of budget caps (including salary caps) with respect to potentially anticompetitive effects. UEFA's so-called Financial Fair Play Regulations are highlighted as an example. Furthermore, the paper discusses allocation schemes of common revenues (like from the collective sale of broadcasting rights) as another area of financial regulation with potentially anticompetitive effects. Eventually, the effects of standards for accounting, financial management, and auditing are discussed."
K21|Salience in Retailing: Vertical Restraints on Internet Sales|We provide an explanation for a frequently observed vertical restraint in e-commerce, namely that brand manufacturers partially or completely prohibit that retailers distribute their high-quality products over the internet. Our analysis is based on the assumption that a consumer's purchasing decision is distorted by salient thinking, i.e. by the fact that he overvalues a product attribute -- quality or price -- that stands out in a particular choice situation. In a highly competitive low-price environment like on an online platform, consumers focus more on price rather than quality. Especially if the market power of local (physical) retailers is low, price tends to be salient also in the local store, which is unfavorable for the high-quality product and limits the wholesale price a brand manufacturer can charge. If, however, the branded product is not available online, a retailer can charge a significant markup on the high-quality good. As the markup is higher if quality rather than price is salient in the store, this aligns the retailer's incentives with the brand manufacturer's interest to make quality the salient attribute and allows the manufacturer to charge a higher wholesale price. We also show that, the weaker are consumers' preferences for purchasing in the physical store and the stronger their salience bias, the more likely it is that a brand manufacturer wants to restrict online sales. Moreover, we find that a ban on distribution systems that prohibit internet sales increases consumer welfare and total welfare, because it leads to lower prices for final consumers and prevents inefficient online sales.
K21|The application of competition policy vis-à-vis intellectual property rights: The evolution of thought underlying policy change|This paper examines the evolution of national competition (antitrust) policies and enforcement approaches vis-à-vis intellectual property rights (IPRs) and associated anti-competitive practices in major jurisdictions over the past several decades. It focuses especially on the underlying process of economic learning that has, the authors suggest, driven relevant policy changes. Part 2 of the paper outlines the breakthroughs in understanding that have underpinned the evolution of competition policy approaches toward intellectual property licensing arrangements in the US, Canada and the EU. Part 3 elaborates the foundational insights that have motivated competition policy interventions with respect to 'newer' issues such as anti-competitive patent settlements and hold-ups in relation to standard setting processes, in addition to the modern focus on mergers that potentially lessen incentives for innovation and on abuse of dominance/single firm exclusionary practices in IP-intensive network industries. Part 4 outlines some of the core policy concerns and insights driving the increased emphasis that leading competition authorities now devote to policy advocacy and research in relation to the scope and definition of IP rights. Overall, the analysis suggests, firstly, that competition policy applications in the intellectual property sphere are matters of fundamental importance for economic advancement and prosperity, having a direct bearing on innovation, growth and the diffusion of new technologies. Indeed, the roles of IP and competition policy are now sufficiently intertwined and interdependent that neither can be well understood or applied in an optimal fashion in the absence of the other. Secondly, the thought evolution described herein implies that successful policy applications require careful study of market structure and behaviour, not in the abstract but with reference to the particular markets affected. Thirdly, it augurs favourably for the prospects of continuing gradual and incremental convergence in national approaches in this area, even spanning developed and developing countries, on the basis of continual learning and informed self-interest.
K21|When Do Firms Leave Cartels? Determinants And The Impact On Cartel Survival|We use a dataset of 615 firms which participated in 114 illegal cartels – convicted by the European Commission between 1999 and 2016 – to investigate the determinants of the duration of a firm’s participation in a cartel. Applying a piecewise-constant exponential proportional hazard model with a particular focus on the impact of internal and external time-varying determinants, we find that firms show a higher probability to leave a cartel if prior exits occurred as well as in periods of high demand growth. However, we find a lower exit probability in situations of prior entries to the cartel or in periods of high interest rates. Additional estimations at the cartel level further suggest that firm exits increase the probability of a cartel breakdown substantially.
K21|Patterns of entry and exit in the deregulated German interurban bus industry|We study patterns of entry and exit in the German interurban bus industry in the first three years after its deregulation in January 2013. Using a comprehensive data set of all firm and route entries and exits, we find that the industry grew much quicker than originally expected – with particularly a few new entrants being most successful in quickly extending their route networks from regional to national coverage. Although the clear majority of routes is operated on a monopoly basis, competition does play a key role on routes with a sufficiently large base of (potential) customers. From a spatial perspective, three years after deregulation, the entire interurban bus network connects 60 percent of all 644 larger German cities – with the intensity of entry being dependent on the number of inhabitants, average income, the share of under 24 years old and the presence of intermodal competition by intercity railway services.
K21|Hunting Unicorns? Experimental Evidence on Predatory Pricing Policies|We study the anti-competitive effects of predatory pricing and the efficacy of three policy responses. In a series of experiments where an incumbent and a potential entrant interact, we compare prices, market structures and welfare. Under a laissez-faire regime, the threat of post-entry price cuts discourages entry, and allows incumbents to charge monopoly prices. Current U.S. policy (Brooke Group) does not help. A policy suggested by Baumol (1979) lowers post-exit prices, while Edlinâ€™s (2002) proposal reduces pre-entry prices and encourages entry. While both policies show outcomes after entry that are less competitive than under Laissez-Faire, they nevertheless increase consumer welfare.
K21|How Antitrust Enforcement Can Spur Innovation: Bell Labs and the 1956 Consent Decree|We study the 1956 consent decree against the Bell System to investigate whether patents held by a dominant firm are harmful for innovation and if so, whether compulsory licensing can provide an effective remedy. The consent decree settled an antitrust lawsuit that charged Bell with having foreclosed the market for telecommunications equipment. The decree forced Bell to license all its existing patents royalty-free. The compulsory licensing increased follow-on innovation building on Bell patents by 17%. This effect is driven mainly by young and small companies. Yet, innovation increased only outside the telecommunications equipment industry, suggesting that compulsory licensing without structural remedies is ineffective in ending market foreclosure.
K21|Salience in Retailing: Vertical Restraints on Internet Sales|We provide an explanation for a brand manufacturer's rationale to prohibit retailers to distribute its products over the internet, based on the assumption that a consumer's purchasing decision is distorted by salient thinking. We find that banning online distribution of the branded good aligns retailers’ incentives with the manufacturer's interest to make quality the salient product attribute and allows it to charge a higher wholesale price than under free distribution.

K21|Whistleblowers on the Board? The Role of Independent Directors in Cartel Prosecutions|"Stock market reactions to news of cartel prosecutions are muted when indicted firms have a high proportion of independent directors on their boards. This finding is robust to self-selection and is pronounced when independent directors hold more outside directorships and fewer stock options -when those directors have fewer economic ties to indicted firms. Results are even stronger when independent directors' appointments were attributable to SOX, preceded their CEO's own appointment, or followed class action suits|when directors have fewer ties to indicted CEOs. Independent directors serving on indicted firms are penalized by losing board seats and vote support in other firms. Firms with more independent directors are more likely to cooperate with antitrust authorities through leniency programs. They are also more likely to dismiss scandal-laden CEOs after public indictments. Our results show that cartel prosecution imposes significant personal costs onto independent directors and that they take actions to mitigate those costs. We argue that understanding these incentive-compatible dynamics is key in designing strategies for cartel detection and prosecution."
K21|Dynamic Vertical Foreclosure|This paper shows that vertical foreclosure can have a dynamic rationale. By refusing to supply an efficient downstream rival, a vertically integrated incumbent sacrifices current profits but can exclude the rival by depriving it of the critical profits (or sales) it needs to be successful. In turn, monopolising the downstream market may prevent the incumbent from losing its future profits because: (a) it allows the incumbent to extract rents from an efficient upstream rival if future upstream entry cannot be discouraged; or (b) it also deters future upstream entry by weakening competition for the input and reducing the post-entry profits of the prospective upstream competitor.
K21|Buyer Group and Buyer Power When Sellers Compete|We study how the formation of a buyer group affects buyer power when sellers compete and buyers operate in separate markets. Previous research (Inderst and Shaffer, 2007, and Dana, 2012) has considered a buyer group that can commit to an exclusive purchase and has found that the formation of a buyer group strictly increases buyer power unless buyers have identical preferences. In contrast, we assume that no commitment to exclusive purchases is possible. We find that the formation of a buyer group has no effect if each seller's cost function is concave. If it is strictly convex, the buyer group strictly reduces the buyers'total payoff as long as the Pareto-dominant equilibrium for sellers is played when a buyer group is formed.
K21|Secret contracting in multilateral relations|We develop a general but tractable framework of multilateral vertical contracting between upstream and downstream Örms, without any restriction on tari§s, and yet taking into account their impact on downstream competition. In equilibrium, tari§s are cost-based and replicate the outcome of a multi-brand oligopoly, a Önding in line with the analysis of a recent merger. To illustrate its versatility, we use this framework to analyze the e§ect of vertical restraints (resale price maintenance and retail price parity clauses) and of alternative business models (resale vs. agency). Finally, we extend the framework so as to endogenize the market structure.
K21|Abuse of Dominance and Antitrust Enforcement in the German Electricity Market|In 2008, the European Commission investigated E.ON, a large and vertically integrated electricity company, for the alleged abuse of a joint dominant position by strategically withholding generation capacity. The case was settled after E.ON agreed to divest 5,000 MW generation capacity as well as its extra-high voltage network. We analyze the effect of these divestitures on German wholesale electricity prices. Our identification strategy is based on the observation that energy suppliers have more market power during peak periods when demand is high. Therefore, a decrease in market power should lead to convergence between peak and off-peak prices. Using daily electricity prices for the 2006 - 2012 period and controlling for cost and demand drivers, we find economically and statistically significant convergence effects after the implementation of the Commission’s decision. Furthermore, the price reductions appear to be mostly due to the divestiture of gas and coal plants, which is consistent with merit-order considerations. Placebo regressions support a causal interpretation of our results.
K21|Collusive Benchmark Rates Fixing|The fixing of the Libor and Euribor benchmark rates has proven vulnerable to manipulation. Individual rate-setters may have incentives to fraudulently distort their submissions. For the contributing banks to collectively agree on the direction in which to rig the rate, however, their interests need to be sufficiently aligned. In this paper we develop cartel theory to show how an interbank lending rates cartel can be sustained by preemptive portfolio changes. Exchange of information facilitates front running that allows members to reduce conflicts in their trading books. Designated banks then engage in eligible transactions rigging to justify their submissions. As the cartel is not able to always find stable cooperative submissions against occasional extreme exposure values, there is episodic recourse to non-cooperative quoting. Periods of heightened volatility in the rates may be indicative of cartelization. Recent reforms to broaden the class of transactions eligible for submission may reduce the level of manipulation, but can lead to more frequent collusive quoting.
K21|Three Economist’s Tools for Antitrust Analysis: A Non-Technical Introduction|The importance of economics to the analysis and enforcement of competition policy and law has increased tremendously in the developed market economies in the past forty years. In younger and developing market economies, competition law itself has a history of twenty to twenty-five years at most – sometimes much less – and economic tools that have proven useful to competition law enforcement in developed market economies in focusing investigations and in assisting decision makers in distinguishing central from secondary issues are inevitably less well understood. This paper presents a non-technical introduction to three economic tools that have become widespread in competition law enforcement in general and in the analysis of proposed mergers in particular: critical loss analysis, upward pricing pressure, and the vertical arithmetic.
K21|Strategic capacity withholding through failures in the German-Austrian electricity market|In electricity day-ahead markets organized as uniform price auction, a small reduction in supply in times of high demand can cause substantial increases in price. We use a unique data set of failures of generation capacity in the German-Austrian electricity market to investigate the relationship between electricity spot prices and generation failures. Differentiating between strategic and non-strategic failures, we find a positive impact of prices on non-usable marginal generation capacity for strategic failures only. Our empirical analysis therefore provides evidence for the existence of strategic capacity withholding through failures suggesting further monitoring efforts by public authorities to effectively reduce the likelihood of such abuses of a dominant position.
K21|Communication in vertical markets: Experimental evidence|An upstream monopolist supplying competing downstream firms may fail to monopolize the market because it is unable to commit not to behave opportunistically. We build on previous experimental studies of this well-known commitment problem by introducing communication. Allowing the upstream firm to chat privately with each downstream firm reduces total offered quantity from near the Cournot level (observed in the absence of communication) halfway toward the monopoly level. Allowing all firms to chat together openly results in complete monopolization. Downstream firms obtain such a bargaining advantage from open communication that all of the gains from monopolizing the market accrue to them. A simple structural model of Nash-in-Nash bargaining fits the pattern of shifting surpluses well. Using third-party coders, unsupervised text mining, among other approaches, we uncover features of the rich chat data that are correlated with market outcomes. We conclude with a discussion of the antitrust implications of open communication in vertical markets.
K21|L’économie des plateformes : dissipation ou concentration de la rente?|The platforms-based economy seems to be the opposite of the rent-based one. On its non-profit acceptation, a platform may participate to the sharing economy, favouring non-market transactions in order to mutualise assets or to share services. On its for-profit acceptation, it provides more efficient matching services and helps to bypass regulations, sometimes harmful in terms of prices and of quality of services. However, a platform might be less a tool of rent dispersion than a vector of its polarisation. High dominance levels based on data and algorithms may allow platforms to implement perfect price discrimination strategies. If these ones may be welfare-enhancing, they involve surplus transfers between economic agents. We discuss the contestability level of these dominant operators by taking into account the counter-strategies of market participants, the extended rivalry hypothesis and the disruptive potential of blockchain.
K21|Algorithmes de prix, intelligence artificielle et équilibres collusifs|Algorithmic pricing can help competitors to collude. Big Data, real-time pricing, and predictive analysis can allow a tacit collusion agreement and a durable equilibrium to be reached quickly. Artificial intelligence poses a specific challenge because the algorithm may autonomously discover the possible gains associated with this kind of non-aggression agreement and also because it is particularly difficult to analyse its decision-making process. Hence sanctioning this on the grounds of prohibiting anti-competitive practices is not straightforward. This paper explores the alternative ways of regulation, through audits or the implementation of liability rules. JEL Codes: K21, K24, L41
K21|Algorithmes de prix et discrimination parfaite : Une théorie concurrentielle en voie de trouver sa pratique ?|The increasing data availability on consumers’ characteristics and behaviour and their capacity of treatment by algorithms make a first-degree price discrimination possible. If this one has not any clear-cut effect on total welfare, it leads to a wealth transfer among market agents. This contribution aims at analysing the capacity to undertake this type of strategy in the digital economy and considers the possible remedies from both competition authorities and consumers.
K21|The Impact of Merger Legislation on Bank Mergers|We study the impact on bank merger activity of the strengthening in merger control legislation introduced in Europe between 1989 and 2004. We find that strengthening merger control increases the abnormal returns on bank target stocks in the days around the merger announcement by 7 percentage points relative to before the new legislation.We discuss several potential explanations for this effect of the change in legislation by studying changes in merger characteristics. We find a weak increase in the pre-merger profitability of target banks, a decrease in the size of acquirers and a decrease in the share of transactions in which banks are acquired by other banks. Other merger properties, including the size and risk profile of targets, the geographic overlap of merging banks and the stock market response of rival banks in the country appear unaffected. The evidence is consistent with legislation changes leading to transactions being undertaken that are more profitable and more pro-competitive.
K21|Économie des algorithmes et ordre concurrentiel - Réflexions sur les abus d'exploitation et les collusions fondés sur des algorithmes de prix|Il s'agit de s'interroger sur les problèmes concurrentiels qui peuvent procéder de l'utilisation d'algorithmes de prix. La masse des données disponibles et les capacités de traitement des algorithmes (notamment via l'intelligence artificielle) rendent possibles des stratégies de discrimination parfaite par les prix, qui peuvent se traduire par des abus d'exploitation et peuvent favoriser l'émergence et le maintien d'équilibres de collusion tacite. Nous montrons les difficultés que peuvent rencontrer les règles de concurrence pour contrecarrer de tels risques et considérons d'autres types de réponses tenant à une régulation publique ou à l'exercice de contrepoids par les consommateurs.
K21|Du virage économique au virage technologique en matière de décision concurrentielle|L'application des règles de concurrence au niveau de l'Union Européenne n'a que très tardivement convergé vers une approche par les effets. Cette adoption tardive s'est en grande partie appuyée sur la volonté de fonder les décisions concurrentielles sur des bases économiquement solides de façon à renforcer la sécurité juridique des opérateurs et de limiter le risque d'annulation des décisions dans le cadre du contrôle juridictionnel. Cependant, la rapide montée en puissance d'une économie fondée sur les algorithmes rend particulièrement difficile l'appréhension par les outils fournis par l'économie des pratiques de marché et la définition de remèdes concurrentiels adéquats. De façon croissante, la régulation des algorithmes semble devoir passer par une régulation par les algorithmes. Le virage vers une approche plus économique pourrait donc devoir être très rapidement suivi par un virage vers une approche plus technologique.
K21|Enforcement vs Deterrence in Merger Control: Can Remedies Lead to Lower Welfare?|This paper deals with the enforcement of merger policy, and aims to study how merger emedies affect the deterrence accomplished by controlling mergers. We determine the optimal frequency of investigations launched by the agency, and identify situations where the introduction of remedies can lead to a lower welfare. We find that the potential for remedies can make it less likely that the worst mergers are deterred. Even if the worst mergers are deterred, the potential for remedies can lead to more mergers with a negative impact to be proposed, and eventually to more decision errors by the antitrust authorities.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
K21|Merger Control on Two-Sided Markets: Is There Need for an Efficiency Defense?|We study horizontal mergers on two-sided markets between horizontally differentiated platforms. We provide a theoretical analysis of the merger's price effect based on the amount of cost savings it generates, the behavior of outsider platforms, and the size of cross-group network effects. We point out differences as compared with the standard, one-sided merger analysis, and also discuss the merger control policy implications.
K21|Les droits et libertés fondamentaux à l'épreuve de l'efficacité économique : une application à la politique de la concurrence|La place croissante que revêt l'analyse économique dans le contentieux juridique, y compris dans le contentieux constitutionnel, pose la question de son impact sur les droits et libertés fondamentaux. Ces derniers peuvent être mis en balance avec la logique de l'efficacité. Dans le droit de la concurrence de l’Union Européenne, la mise en oeuvre d'une approche plus économique (ou approche par les effets) et la montée en puissance des procédures négociées (souvent justifiée par des gains d'efficience en termes procéduraux) constituent un exemple d'évolution de la pratique décisionnelle pouvant mettre en jeu non seulement les droits de propriété et la liberté contractuelle des firmes mais aussi le contrôle juridictionnel lui-même. Cet exemple nous conduit à nous interroger sur l'analyse économique de ces deux droits fondamentaux. Nous insistons sur la diversité des approches économiques en la matière en confrontant les approches de l'analyse économique du droit à celles du vieil institutionnalisme et de l'approche autrichienne.

K21|Algorithmes de prix et discrimination parfaite. Une théore concurentielle en voie de trouver sa pratique ?|L’accroissement des données disponibles sur les caractéristiques et les comportements des consommateurs ainsi que celui des capacités de traitement de ces dernières par des algorithmes ouvre la voie au développement de stratégies de discrimination tarifaire de premier degré. Si les effets de celles-ci sont ambigus sur le surplus total, elles induisent un transfert de bien-être entre agents économiques. Cette contribution analyse la possibilité de mettre en œuvre de telles stratégies dans l’économie numérique et interroge les possibles réponses tant des pouvoirs publics, que des consommateurs eux-mêmes.
K21|La régulation du secteur des jeux entre Charybde et Scylla|La libéralisation du secteur des jeux de hasard et d'argent initiée en France par la loi du 12 mai 2010 a essentiellement répondu à des contraintes extérieures émanant du développement d'offres illégales en lignes et des règles de concurrence de l'Union européenne. Dans un contexte marqué par des critiques du cadre régulatoire actuel, émanant de la Cour des comptes et de l'Assemblée Nationale, il s'agit de développer une analyse du cadre régulatoire applicable au secteur.
K21|Minority share acquisitions and collusion: Evidence from the introduction of national leniency programs|There is a growing concern that minority shareholding (MS) in rival firms may facilitate collusion. To examine this concern, we exploit the fact that leniency programs (LPs) are generally recognized as a shock that destabilizes collusive agreements and study the effect that the introduction of an LP has on horizontal MS acquisitions. Using data from 63 countries over the period 1990-2013, we find a large increase in horizontal MS acquisitions in the year in which an LP is introduced, especially in large rivals. The effect is present however only in countries with an effective antitrust enforcement and low levels of corruption and only when the acquisitions involve stakes of 10%-20%. These results suggest that MS acquisitions may stabilize collusive agreements that were destabilized by the introduction of the LP.
K21|Online RPM and MFN Under Antitrust Law and Economics|Abstract The legal framing of a firm’s pricing strategy can determine whether it constitutes online resale price maintenance (RPM) or online most favored nation (MFN). Together, cases that involve online RPM and MFN can be viewed as a natural experiment of how antitrust economics and law may adapt to an online world. Thus far, legal theories that have been inconsistent with economic theories have dictated enforcement across jurisdictions, which has led to confusion that thwarts potentially efficient business practices. This paper distinguishes issues of online RPM from traditional RPM and online RPM from online MFN. We apply the economics learning to RPM and analyze the antitrust cases of online RPM and MFN to date in the United States, Europe, and Australia. Finally, we offer policy recommendations that reduce the confusion in current legal doctrine.
K21|The Lingering Effect of Capacity Coordination on Firm Behavior in Post-depression Periods: Evidence from a Laboratory Experiment|This study experimentally examines whether capacity coordination in depression, which is sometimes allowed under antitrust laws, influences the firm behavior in periods after demand recovers. Following Hampton and Sherstyuk (2012), we conducted a series of laboratory experiment by adopting the two-stage capacity-price decision-making duopoly setting. We adopted three treatments in terms of capacity coordination: no coordination, weak coordination, and strong coordination. Under the strong coordination treatment, the subjects cannot deviate from the coordinated capacity, which they can do so under the weak coordination treatment. The results of the experiment indicate that the experiences of success and failure of coordination influence subjects’ capacity choices during periods after demand recovers even if capacity coordination is not allowed in those post-depression periods. In particular, capacity may be greater in the post-depression periods than in the pre-depression periods under the weak coordination.
K21|Merger Paradox in a Network Product Market: A Horizontally Differentiated Three-Firm Model|Using a horizontally differentiated three-firm model, we reconsider the merger paradox and externalities, i.e., the profitability of a merger, in a network product market where network externalities and compatibilities between products exists. Investigating the effect of a merger on the profits of the insider (participant) and outsider (nonparticipant) firms, we demonstrate the conditions under which the merger paradox and externalities arise in the network product market. If the degree of the merger-related network compatibility is sufficiently large, the merger paradox never arises.
K21|Analysis of Merger Control in a Network Products Market|Using a horizontally differentiated three‐firm model, we consider horizontal mergers and antitrust policy in a network products market, where network externalities and compatibilities between products and services are observed. In particular, we focus on the role of merger‐related network compatibility. That is, if the degree of the net degree of merger‐related network compatibility is larger than the degree of product substitutability, consumer surplus is higher than in the premerger case. In this case, the proposed merger is allowed by antitrust authorities based on a consumer welfare standard. Furthermore, relating to a merger externality on an outsider, we examine the American Online and Time Warner case.
K21|Collusion, Managerial incentives and antitrust fines|"Based on a duopoly price competition model, this paper argues that collusion on managerial incentive compensations may have the equivalent effects to collusion on prices. This paper also provides an analysis of the effect of different antitrust fines regimes in the context of a game between two companies each composed of two-level of decision making (the board of directors and the sales manager). The contribution of this paper is two-fold: it identifies"" backstage arrangements"" that may be used by companies in order to achieve monopoly pricing outcome without entering into explicit price-fixing practices. It also highlights the inefficiency of fining regimes based on sales when companies have a multi-layer decision-making structure"
K21|Verdrängungspreise an Tankstellen?|Das Wettbewerbsrecht unterschiedlicher Länder kennt vielfältige Tatbestandsmerkmale. Ein sehr umstrittener Tatbestand ist die Margin-Squeeze-Preissetzung (MSP) oder das Setzen negativer Margen. Um den Wettbewerb auf dem Kraftstoffmarkt zu erhöhen hat der deutsche Gesetzgeber das Setzen negativer Margen als Tatbestand in das Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen (GWB) aufgenommen. In Folge dessen begann eine umfangreiche Diskussion zu den vermeintlichen Preissetzungsproblemen auf dem deutschen Kraftstoffmarkt. Dieser Beitrag untersucht die Preissetzungsstrategien der Kraftstoffunternehmen, Konzerne wie auch das der unabhängigen Tankstellen. Der vorliegende Beitrag ist einer der wenigen, die das Auftreten von Margin-Squeeze-Fällen empirisch testet. Die Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass die Margin-Squeeze-Preissetzung keine Strategie ist, die von Wettbewerbern auf dem deutschen Kraftstoffmarkt genutzt wird. Darüber hinaus zeigt der vorliegende Beitrag, dass das fehlende MSP-Verhalten nicht nur die Folge von gesetzestreuem Verhalten der Unternehmen ist und diese auch die enge Definition des deutschen Gesetzgebers nicht umgehen, indem sie niedrige Margen setzen, die es für kleinere Unternehmen nicht profitabel machen, auf dem Markt aktiv zu bleiben. Vielmehr lässt sich MSP empirisch nicht nachweisen, sodass keine gesetzliche Regelung notwendig ist.
K21|Entry deterrence due to brand proliferation: Empirical evidence from the German interurban bus industry|In 2016, the largest operator in the German interurban bus industry, Flixbus, acquired its major rival, Postbus. We study the effects of that takeover using route-level data covering more than 6,000 routes. We find that Flixbus, on average, provided a lower frequency of bus rides and slightly decreased prices after the takeover. This indicates that Flixbus pursued a strategy of preemption: to decrease residual demand for Postbus, Flixbus offered a high number of bus rides. After the takeover, Flixbus decreased the supply of transportation services and lowered the prices to compensate the consumers for the resulting increase in inconvenience costs.
K21|The Law and Economics of List Price Collusion|Firms sometimes violate competition laws by agreeing on increases of list prices. The economic effects of such list price collusion are far from clear because the cartel firms might deviate secretly from the elevated prices by granting their customers discounts. This article presents case evidence suggesting that agreements on list prices are not infrequently observed in cartel cases. It also reviews theoretical, empirical, and experimental literature in economics showing under what conditions such list price collusion causes the discounted transaction prices to rise. This is relevant for competition authorities in developing a theory of harm when prosecuting cartels, and also for the customers of the cartel firms when suing the conspirators for the repayment of damages.
K21|Rights on Data: Competition, Innovation, and Competition Law: Dissecting the Interplay|The digital revolution has reinvigorated the discussion about the problem how to consider innovation in the application of competition law. This raises difficult questions about the relationship between competition and innovation as well as what kind of assessment concepts competition authorities should use for investigating innovation effects, e.g., in merger cases. This paper, on one hand, reviews briefly our economic knowledge about competition and innovation, and claims that it is necessary to go beyond the limited insights that can be gained from industrial economics research about innovation (Schumpeter vs. Arrow discussion), and take into account much more insights from innovation research, evolutionary innovation economics, and business and management studies. On the other hand, it is also necessary to develop much more innovation-specific assessment concepts in competition law (beyond the traditional product market concept). Using the example of assessing innovation competition in merger cases, this article suggests to analyze much more systematically the resources (specialized assets) that are necessary for innovation. This concept is directly linked to the new discussion about the Dow/DuPont case in the EU and about data as necessary resource for (data-driven) innovation.
K21|Compliance Programs, Signaling and Firms' Internal Coordination|Fines imposed on firms for corporate infringements such as cartels reduce these infringement's profitability. When a manager knows when a violation is unprofitable he can prevent violations committed by an uninformed employee by investing in compliance programs (CPs). Investments can be interpreted as signals. The paper shows that there exists a separating equilibrium where high investments in CPs induce the employee to obey the law. However, if CPs are too expensive the signal is not credible. The manager can also show personal commitment to compliance ('tone-at-the-top'). Coordination on an efficient outcome will then be achievable if commitment is costly. Imposing high, individual sanctions on the manager disturbs a firm's internal coordination because he is unable to credibly signal that an infringement does not pay off for the firm. However, imposing sanctions on the employee unambiguously deters violation.
K21|The Impact of Incentive Pay on Corporate Crime|This paper presents a moral hazard model analyzing the agent's incentive to commit corporate crime. The principal can only observe profits which the agent can increase by committing crime or exerting effort. It is shown how different incentive contracts, i.e., thresholdlinear, capped bonus and linear contracts, can be adjusted in order to promote agent's law abiding behavior. Any adjustment implies a loss in internal efficiency which decreases in individual sanctions imposed on the agent.
K21|Input price discrimination and upstream R&D investments|We study the welfare effects of input price discrimination when an upstream supplier that secretly contracts with two cost-asymmetric downstream firms undertakes R&D investments. We show that a ban on input price discrimination increases (decreases) the level of upstream R&D investments when downstream cost-asymmetry is relatively low (high). Nevertheless, we find that welfare always decreases after the ban. Thus, input price discrimination should be welcomed rather than prohibited even when it stifles the upstream supplier’s incentives to engage in cost-reduction activities.
K21|Big Data, Competition and Market Power|Big data are considered ate same time a promising driver of economic development and a concern for possible manipulation and privacy intrusion. Data diffusion and their uncertain appropriability can make property rights for data less precise. The paper reviews some economic features of data. In many digital markets data can be considered a relevant input but hardly an essential facility. Many data are collected in two-sided market platform and in one side they are used to personalize services and to add quality while on the other side of the platform they contribute to make advertising collection more efficient. So the transfer of personal data can be considered an implicit price for many free information services. Consumers usually are unaware of subsequent pervasive use of their personal data, and therefore give away easily their data. Big data can amplify competitive advantages and related dominant positions, leveraging on information asymmetries. A dominant position obtained through collection and processing of big amount of personal data allow practices such as first degree price discrimination, personalized advertising, artificial degradation of services that sometimes can be considered competitive abuse, but it is difficult that data alone allow such position.
K21|Whistleblowers on the Board? The Role of Independent Directors in Cartel Prosecutions|Stock market reactions to news of cartel prosecutions are muted when indicted firms have a high proportion of independent directors serving on their boards. This finding is robust to self-selection and is more pronounced when those directors hold more outside directorships and have fewer stock options — when they have fewer economic ties to the indicted firms. Results are stronger when independent directors’ appointments were attributable to SOX, preceded the CEO’s appointment, or followed class action suits — when they have fewer direct ties to indicted CEOs. Independent directors serving on indicted firms are penalized by losing board seats and vote support across their directorships in other firms. Moreover, firms with more independent directors are more likely to cooperate with antitrust authorities through leniency programs and to dismiss CEOs after cartel indictments. Our results show that cartel prosecution imposes significant personal costs onto independent directors and that they take actions to reduce those costs. Understanding these incentives is key for antitrust authorities in designing strategies for cartel prosecution.
K21|Disclosure Rules and Declared Essential Patents|Many standard setting organizations (SSOs) require participants to disclose patents that might be infringed by implementing a proposed standard, and commit to license their “essential” patents on terms that are at least fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND). Data from these SSO intellectual property disclosures have been used in academic studies to provide a window into the standard setting process, and in legal proceedings to assess the relative contribution of different parties to a standard. We develop a simple model of the disclosure process to illustrate the link between SSO rules and patent-holder incentives, and examine the model's core predictions using a novel dataset constructed from the disclosure archives of thirteen major SSOs. The central message of the paper is that subtle differences in the rules used by different SSOs can influence which patents are disclosed, the terms of licensing commitments, and ultimately long-run citation and litigation rates for the underlying patents.
K21|The structure and performance of U.S. research joint ventures: inferences and implications from the Advanced Technology Program| Research joint ventures (RJVs) are projects that combine the research resources of different firms. A sample of RJVs supported by the U.S. Advanced Technology Program shows that the projects yield revenues that are far less than costs. Related to this point, the RJVs are subject to commercialization delays, loss of intellectual property, and product market competition. Partner firms undertake joint research, but if they commercialize at all, they do so separately, to avoid splitting of revenues from new products. Ultimately, difficulties with the RJVs occur because frequently, firms are potential competitors.
K21|Search Engines and Data Retention: Implications for Privacy and Antitrust|"This paper investigates whether larger quantities of historical data affect a firm's ability to maintain market share in Internet search. We study whether the length of time that search engines retained their server logs affected the apparent accuracy of subsequent searches. Our analysis exploits changes in these policies prompted by the actions of policymakers. We find little empirical evidence that reducing the length of storage of past search engine searches affected the accuracy of search. Our results suggest that the possession of historical data confers less of an advantage in market share than is sometimes supposed. Our results also suggest that limits on data retention may impose fewer costs in instances where overly long data retention leads to privacy concerns such as an individual's ``right to be forgotten."""
K21|Competition, Regulation and Institutional Quality|"Regulation and competition policy are two alternative modalities by which the state intervenes in the market. In order for either to deliver welfare gains, there must first be a pre-existing market failure. We first present different varieties of market failures and identify those for which regulation is best address (cooperation failures such as The Fishing Game and the Public Goods Game, scale economies-based failures such as a Natural Monopoly and Meta-Market Failures) and those where competition policy works better (market power-based failures such as an artificial monopoly or cartel). We also discuss those market failures which cannot be remedied by an imperfect state. We show graphically the welfare outcomes of various industrial organizations (monopoly, duopoly, Walrasian limit) under the symmetric Cournot competition. We also deal with the welfare implications of imperfect substitutability. We then discuss some welfare implications of the Bertrand competition, its effect on innovation and on the formation of ""trusts"". We present reasons why competition policy is better than regulation in jurisdictions where institutions are weak. The reasons are: information intensity and asymmetry being greater with regulation, the greater ease of capture of the organs of regulation and, finally, the presence of private players who serve as allies of the competition agency and help monitor abuse of market power."
K21|Three Economist’s Tools for Antitrust Analysis: A Non-Technical Introduction|The importance of economics to the analysis and enforcement of competition policy and law has increased tremendously in the developed market economies in the past forty years. In younger and developing market economies, competition law itself has a history of twenty to twenty-five years at most – sometimes much less – and economic tools that have proven useful to competition law enforcement in developed market economies in focusing investigations and in assisting decision makers in distinguishing central from secondary issues are inevitably less well understood. This paper presents a non-technical introduction to three economic tools that have become widespread in competition law enforcement in general and in the analysis of proposed mergers in particular: critical loss analysis, upward pricing pressure, and the vertical arithmetic.
K21|Royalty stacking in the U.S. freight railroads: Cournot vs. Coase|Monopolists selling complementary products charge a higher price in a static equilibrium than a single multiproduct monopolist would, reducing both the industry profits and consumer surplus. However, firms could instead reach a Pareto improvement by lowering prices to the single monopolist level. We analyze administrative nationally-representative pricing data of railroad coal shipping in the U.S. We compare a coal producer that needs to ship from A to C,with the route passing through B, in two cases: (1) the same railroad owning AB and BC and (2) different railroads owning AB and BC. We find no price difference between the two cases, suggesting that the complementary monopolist pricing inefficiency is absent in this market. For our main analysis, we use a specification used by previous literature; however, we confirm our findings using propensity score blocking and machine learning algorithms. Finally, we confirm the results by using a difference-in-differences analysis to gauge the impact of a merger that made two routes wholly-owned (switched from case 2 to case 1). Our results have implications for royalty stacking and patent thickets, vertical mergers, tragedy of anti-commons, and mergers of firms selling complements.
K21|Why Countries Shouldn't Sell Their Natural Resources To Foreigners|Years ago, I recommended that my City, my Polis, Gloucester, MA, never sell its natural resources to any outsider. Last year, with the passing of Fidel Castro, I saw a possibility for Cuba to become finally free. Naturally, I urged Cubans not to repeat the errors made by Russia and China at the collapse of communism; I urged Cubans not to sell their natural resources to the oligarchs, whether local or foreign. This time around, I also urged Cubans not to repeat the political errors of the past, namely trying to correct horrors of the left with horrors of the right; this time around I urged Cubans and anyone else who might want to hear to achieve a revolution from the center of the political system. With the forthcoming elections in Kenya, in the hope of averting the bloodshed that followed the 2007 elections there, I recently felt impelled to enlarge my focus to appeal to every nation in Africa, and the rest of the world for that matter, not to sell their natural resources to foreigners. The financial resources to achieve this goal are the same the world over: One must organize local financial resources, through: 1. Any such instrument as a Local Interdependence Fund; and 2. A reform of central bank operations to issue a) loans only to create real wealth; b) loans at cost; c) loans to benefit as many people as possible, hence loans to individual entrepreneurs, cooperatives, corporations with ESOPs and/or CSOPs, and to public agencies with taxing power to fund public works projects.

K21|Sentencing in Ireland's First Bid-Rigging Cartel Case: An Appraisal|The paper argues that the sentences imposed on 31 May 2107 by the Central Criminal Court in the commercial flooring bid-rigging cartel case and the methodology used in setting those sentences seriously undermines the effective enforcement of competition law in Ireland. The sentence imposed on the individual responsible for initiating and participating for 2 years and 4 months in the bid-rigging cartel was only three weeks wages or €7,500. No gaol sentence was imposed. The undertaking was fined €10,000; the value of the rigged tenders it won totalled €556,000. The Court’s reasoning did not justify the low sanctions. Current sentencing norms indicate a custodial sentence and much higher fines for both the individual and the undertaking. This is consistent with the application of EU and US Sentencing Guidelines to the facts of the commercial flooring bid-rigging cartel case. If the sentences imposed by the Central Criminal Court are not successfully appealed as being unduly lenient and appropriate sentencing guidelines developed, then the prospect for competition law enforcement in Ireland is grim. In particular, the effectiveness of the Cartel Immunity Programme, a vital tool for cartel detection and prosecution, will be severely damaged.
K21|The Amazon Monopoly: Is Amazon’s Private Label Business the Tipping Point?|The purpose of this paper is to consider if Amazon’s increase in private label brands is the tipping point for transforming the e-commerce giant into a monopoly. To lay the foundation, we initially explore the culture, leadership, and business practices which are unique to Amazon that enabled the company to become one of the U.S.’s largest and fastest growing e-commerce websites. Introduced in 2009, Amazon’s private label business has further propelled Amazon’s growth while creating a competitive advantage for the company by offering high quality products to their customers at low cost options. In considering whether private label brands affect Amazon’s status as a monopoly, we first examine exactly what a monopoly is and if Amazon can be classified as one in its current state. We then take a deep dive into Amazon’s private label strategy, analyzing past performance to make educated assumptions about the future. Our research provided evidence indicating that Amazon’s actions are threatening the cooperative nature of its Marketplace by creating substantial barriers to entry and increasing Amazon’s market share. With this knowledge we make predictions about Amazon’s future and whether it will ever be seen as a monopoly under the economic, legal, and/or social definitions. While Amazon’s case is unprecedented, this paper sources leading economists, journalists, and other academic research to support our theory.
K21|How Antitrust Enforcement Can Spur Innovation|We study the 1956 consent decree against the Bell System to investigate whether patents held by a dominant firm are harmful for innovation and if so, whether compulsory licensing can provide an effective remedy. The consent decree settled an antitrust lawsuit that charged Bell with having foreclosed the market for telecommunications equipment. The terms of the decree allowed Bell to remain a vertically integrated monopolist in the telecommunications industry, but as a remedy, Bell had to license all its existing patents royalty-free. Thus, the path-breaking technologies developed by the Bell Laboratories became freely available to all US companies. We show that in the first five years compulsory licensing increased follow-on innovation building on Bell patents by 17%. This effect is driven mainly by young and small companies. Yet, innovation increased only outside the telecommunications equipment industry. The lack of a positive innovation effect in the telecommunications industry suggests that market foreclosure impedes innovation and that compulsory licensing without structural remedies is ineffective in ending it. The increase of follow-on innovation by small and young companies is in line with the hypothesis that patents held by a dominant firm act as a barrier to entry for start-ups. We show that the removal of this barrier increased long-run U.S. innovation, corroborating historical accounts.
K21|An Index of Regulatory Practices for Financial Inclusion in Latin America|The index assesses and compares the quality of regulations that influence financial inclusion in 8 Latin American countries.

K21|Advertising Competition in the Free-to-Air TV Broadcasting Industry|This paper empirically investigates the advertising competition in the French broadcast television industry within a two-sided market framework. We use a unique dataset on the French broadcast television market including audience, prices, and quantities of advertising of twenty-one TV channels from March 2008 to December 2013. We specify a structural model of oligopoly competition and identify the shape and magnitude of the feedback loop between TV viewers and advertisers. We also implement a simple procedure to identify the conduct of firms on the market. We find that the nature of competition in the French TV advertising market is of the Cournot type. Further, we provide empirical evidence that the price-cost margin is not a good indicator of the market power of firms operating on two-sided markets. Finally, we provide a competition analysis. The counterfactual simulation suggests that the merger of advertising sales houses would not have significantly affected the equilibrium outcomes in this industry because of the strong network externalities between TV viewers and advertisers. These results provide a critical evaluation of the 2010 decision of the French competition authority to authorize the acquisition of two broadcast TV channels by a large media group under behavioral remedies.
K21|Abuse of Dominance and Antitrust Enforcement in the German Electricity Market|In 2008, the European Commission investigated E.ON, a large and vertically integrated electricity company, for the alleged abuse of a joint dominant position by strategically withholding generation capacity. The case was settled after E.ON agreed to divest 5,000 MW generation capacity as well as its extra-high voltage network. We analyze the effect of these divestitures on German wholesale electricity prices. Our identification strategy is based on the observation that energy suppliers have more market power during peak periods when demand is high. Therefore, a decrease in market power should lead to convergence between peak and off-peak prices. Using daily electricity prices for the 2006 - 2012 period and controlling for cost and demand drivers, we find economically and statistically significant convergence effects after the implementation of the Commission’s decision. Furthermore, the price reductions appear to be mostly due to the divestiture of gas and coal plants, which is consistent with merit-order considerations. Placebo regressions support a causal interpretation of our results.
K21|An Index of Regulatory Practices for Financial Inclusion in Latin America: Enablers, Promoters, and Preventers|This paper constructs an index of regulatory quality for improving financial inclusion for the purpose of assessing and comparing the quality of rules and regulations in a sample of eight Latin American countries. The index comprises 11 regulatory practices classified into three categories: those that determine the overall quality of the financial environment where providers of financial services that meet the needs of the poor operate (the enablers); those that deal with specific types of market frictions and regulate the provision of specific financial products and services (the promoters) to large segments of the population; and those that, albeit unintentionally, create distortions and barriers that adversely affect financial inclusion (the preventers). An important novelty of the index is that the assessment of individual regulatory practices not only takes into account accepted standards, but also recognizes that there are important interactions between regulations for financial inclusion as well as between these regulations and other type of government interventions. Among the countries in the sample, by mid-2017, Peru ranked first in this index, followed closely by Mexico. Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, and Uruguay obtained lukewarm results, although there were wide differences among these countries’ individual results. Argentina and Brazil were the two countries with the lowest overall scores. An additional contribution of the paper is that, throughout the analysis, countries’ specific areas of strengths and weakness in financial regulatory practices for improving financial inclusion are identified.
K21|Challenges and Pitfalls in Cartel Policy and Fining|We analyze significant challenges and pitfalls faced by antitrust authorities in the implementation of competition policies particularly against naked cartels and propose measures principled in economic theory to circumvent these issues. We review leniency programs in different jurisdictions, the private versus public control of cartels, as well as the determination of cartel fines and other punishment instruments. Regarding cartel fines, we first discuss the sometimes-conflicting objectives of restitution and deterrence, then the economic-based versus legal- and proportional-based punishment. Moreover, we assess the proper modeling of cartel dynamics including the probability of detection and conviction, the relevant cartel duration, and the estimation of but-for prices and cartel overcharges.

K21|Discounts as a Barrier to Entry|To what extent can an incumbent manufacturer use discount contracts to foreclose efficient entry? We show that off-list-price rebates that do not commit buyers to unconditional transfers--like the rebates in EU Commission v. Michelin II, for instance--cannot be anticompetitive. This is true even in the presence of cost uncertainty, scale economies, or intense downstream competition, all three market settings where exclusion has been shown to emerge with exclusive dealing contracts. The difference stems from the fact that, unlike exclusive dealing provisions, rebates do not contractually commit retailers to exclusivity when signing the contract.
K21|Naked Exclusion and the Volatility of Innovation|The analysis shows that the volatility of a potential entrant's innovation is an important parameter that shapes an incumbent supplier's exclusivity strategy. Higher volatility encourages the incumbent supplier to adopt an accommodation strategy rather than a pure exclusion strategy. When volatility is above a threshold, the incumbent always chooses accommodation regardless of the expected size of the entrant's innovation. And since an accommodation strategy merely redistributes surplus without blocking efficient entry, it may not warrant a prohibition of exclusivity contracts by the antitrust authorities.
K21|On the Use of Price-Cost Tests in Loyalty Discounts and Exclusive Dealing Arrangements: Which Implications from Economic Theory?|Recent cases in the US (Meritor, Eisai) and in the EU (Intel ) have revived the debate on the use of price-cost tests in loyalty discount cases. We draw on existing recent economic theories of exclusion and develop new formal material to argue that economics alone does not justify applying a price-cost test to predation but not to loyalty discounts. Still, the latter contain features (they reference rivals and allow to discriminate across buyers and/or units bought) that have a higher exclusionary potential than the former, and this may well warrant closer scrutiny and more severe treatment from antitrust agencies and courts.

K21|Effective European Antitrust : Does EC Merger Policy Generate Deterrence?|We estimate the deterrence effects of European Commission (EC) merger policy instruments over the 1990–2009 period. Our empirical results suggest phase-1 remedies uniquely generate robust deterrence as - unlike phase-1 withdrawals, phase-2 remedies, and preventions - phase-1 remedies lead to fewer merger notifications in subsequent years. Furthermore, the deterrence effects of phase-1 remedies work best in high-concentration industries, that is, industries where the Herfindahl Hirschman Index is above the 0.2 cut-off level employed by the EC. Additionally, we find phase-1 remedies do not deter clearly pro-competitive mergers, but do deter potentially anti-competitive mergers in high-concentration industries.

K21|Ex-post Merger Evaluation in the U.K. Retail Market for Books|This paper evaluates the price effects of the merger of two major UK book retailers. We use a dataset containing monthly scanner data on a sample of 200 books in 50 local markets for four years around the merger. We compare the price changes after the merger in shops located in areas where both chains were present before the merger and in areas where only one chain was present. We also investigate the country-wide effect of the merger. We find that the merger did not result in any price increase either at the local or at the national level.
K21|Ex post Merger Evaluation in the U.K. Retail Market for Books|This paper empirically evaluates the price effects of the merger of two major book retail chains in the UK: Waterstone’s and Ottakar’s. We employ differences-in-differences techniques and use a rich dataset containing monthly scanner data information on a sample of 200 books sold in 60 stores in 50 different local markets for a period of four years around the merger. Since retail mergers may have either local or national effects (or both) according to the level at which retail chains set prices, we undertake an ex-post assessment of the impact of the merger at both levels. At the local level, we compare the changes in the average price charged before and after the merger in the shops located in overlap areas –i.e. areas where both chains were present before the merger– and in non-overlap areas –i.e. areas where only one chain was present before the merger. At the national level, we employ two distinct control groups to evaluate the merger, namely the competitors and the top-selling titles. We find that the merger did not result in an increase in prices either at the local or at the national level. We also perform heterogeneous treatment effects estimations in order to assess whether the effect of the merger differs along various dimensions of heterogeneity that are present in our data.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
K21|Empirical Evidence on Conditional Pricing Practices|Conditional pricing practices allow the terms of sale between a producer and a downstream distributor to vary based on the ability of the downstream firm to meet a set of conditions put forward by the producer. The conditions may require a downstream firm to accept minimum quantities or multiple products, to adhere to minimum market-share requirements, or even to deal exclusively with one producer. The form of payment from the producer to the downstream firm may take the form of a rebate, marketing support, or simply the willingness to supply inventory. The use of conditional pricing practices is widespread throughout many industries, and the variety of contractual forms used in these arrangements is nearly as extensive as the number of contracts. This paper reviews empirical evidence on these arrangements.
K21|Optimal fines for cartel agreements: the case of Slovakia|The paper deals with theoretical and empirical aspects of optimal fines for cartel agreements with a special focus on the practices of the Antimonopoly Office of the Slovak Republic. First, we discuss the theoretical requirements in order to make fines for cartel agreements effective in the sense of preventive and repressive function. Then, we review the current literature on the empirics of fines for cartel agreements. In the empirical part, we evaluate the fines for cartel agreements in the Slovak Republic. The analysis is based on a unique dataset collected from publicly available information on cartel agreements cases of the Antimonopoly Office of the Slovak Republic.

Then we study how to dissuade him/her from colluding.?Beyond administrative fines and detection by competition authorities, we analyse solutions inside the firm which contribute to better deter managers from engaging into these illegal practices, and the role of public policy, in the broad sense of the term, in preventing these behaviors.

In return, the generic company receives a consideration in the form of a payment from the originator.?After a presentation of the evaluation grid that is made of these agreements combining intellectual property and competition issues, we examine to which extent the use by the competition authorities of a truncated analysis based on the size of payments really helps to shed light on the most likely anti-competitive agreements or, conversely, if this is equivalent to the way a drunk uses a lamppost, namely for support rather than illumination.

K21|The Impact of Retail Mergers on Food Prices: Evidence from France|This paper analyzes the impact of a merger in the French retail sector on food prices, using a consumer panel data. We perform a di fference-in-diff erences analysis by comparing price changes in stores for which the local market structure is aff ected by the merger to unaff ected stores. In addition, we empirically investigate economic forces behind the observed price changes. On average, we fi nd that the merger signifi cantly raised competitors' prices contemporaneously with merging firms' price increases. Further, we show that competitor prices increase more in local markets that experience larger structural changes in concentration and chain diff erentiation.
K21|Fighting collusion by permitting price discrimination|We investigate the effect of a ban on third-degree price discrimination on the sustainability of collusion. We build a model with two firms that may be able to discriminate between two consumer groups. Two cases are analyzed: (i) Best-response symmetries so that profits in the static Nash equilibrium are higher if price discrimination is allowed. (ii) Best-response asymmetries so that profits in the static Nash equilibrium are lower if price discrimination is allowed. In both price discrimination scenarios, firms’ discount factor has to be higher in order to sustain collusion in grim-trigger strategies than under uniform pricing.
K21|Corporate Restructuring And The Unlawful Competition|"In the field of economy, transactions represent one of the fastest means available for improving any company’s commercial and strategic position in the market. The context of technological developments in recent years and the trend of globalization have largely influenced work in the fields of goods and services. Currently, geographical factors are no longer an obstacle and companies can expand their production without being influenced by state frontiers. International mergers and acquisitions are, most often, joined by a true ""cultural shock""] [ Bogdan Anastasia ""Fenomene culturale in achizitiile si fuziunile internationale (Cultural Phenomena in International Acquisitions and Mergers)""- Intercultural Management - Volume II, Issue 3/2000, ISSN 1454-9980] and must comply with regulations on competition both nationally and internationally. Since the penalties imposed by authorities in charge of competition regulations are substantial, both internationally and nationally, this means that, when making mergers, one should be very cautious."
K21|Can collusion promote sustainable consumption and production?|Several competition authorities consider the exemption of horizontal agreements among firms from antitrust liability if the agreements sufficiently promote public interest objectives such as sustainable consumption and production. We show that when consumers value sustainable products and firms choose investments in sustainability before choosing output or prices, coordination of output choices or prices boosts investments in sustainability and may even enhance consumer surplus when products are sufficiently close substitutes and the marginal cost of investment in sustainability is relatively low. By contrast, coordination of investments in sustainability leads to lower investments and harms consumers.
K21|"Grantbacks, Territorial Restraints and the Type of Follow-On Innovation: The ""But for..."" Defence"|We analyse the effect of grantback clauses in licensing contracts. While competition authorities fear that grantback clauses might decrease the licensee?s ex post incentives to innovate, a standard defence is that grantback clauses are required for the patent-owner to agree to license its technology in the first place. We examine the validity of this ?but for? defence and the equilibrium effect of grantback clauses on the innovation incentives of the licensee for both non-severable and severable innovations. Under the 2004 EU Technology Transfer Guidelines , and the guidelines for some other jurisdictions, grantback clauses that apply to ?non - severable? (read ?infringing?) innovations are considered to be less controversial than clauses that apply to ?severable? innovations. We show, to the contrary, that grantback clauses do not increase the patent- holder?s incentives to license when non-severable innovations are at stake but they do when severable innovations are concerned ? suggesting that the ?but for? defence might be valid for severable innovations but not for non-severable ones. Moreover we show that, for severable innovations, grantback clauses can increase the range of parameters for which follow-on innovation by the licensee occurs.
K21|Vertical Information Restraints: Pro- and Anti-Competitive Impacts of Minimum Advertised Price Restrictions|We consider vertical contracts where the retail market may involve search frictions. Minimum advertised price restrictions (MAP) act as a restraint on customers’ information and so can increase search frictions in the retail sector. Such restraints, thereby, soften retail competition—an impact also generated by resale price maintenance (RPM). However, by accommodating (consumer or retailer) heterogeneity, MAP can allow for higher manufacturer profits than RPM. We show that they can do so through facilitating price discrimination among consumers; encouraging service provision; and facilitating manufacturer collusion. Thus, welfare effects may be positive or negative compared to RPM or to the absence of such restrictions.
K21|Unternehmenszusammenschlüsse im Lebensmitteleinzelhandel verringern die Produktvielfalt|Over the past decades the grocery retail sector underwent a significant restructuring process throughout Europe. While competition from hard-discounters has grown, in most European countries concentration has also increased as a consequence of mergers and acquisitions among already powerful retail chains. These considerationslead antitrust authorities to very cautiously enforce competition policy in this sector with the aim of preventing the market getting worryingly concentrated. Ina study for the Dutch Autoriteit Consument & Markt (ACM), we examined the effects of a series of three national mergers in the Dutch grocery markets between 2009 and 2012 that have been approved by the ACM subject to divestitures. We find that the mergers did not have significant effects on prices. However, we find that the last mergersignificantly reduced the depth of products’ assortment and, consequently, reduced consumers’ choice. Moreover, the divestitures imposed by the ACM were onlypartially able to outweigh the reduction in variety caused by the mergers. In den letzten Jahrzehnten hat der Lebensmitteleinzelhandel in ganz Europa einen erheblichen Restrukturierungsprozess durchlaufen. Während der Wettbewerbsdruck durch die Billigdiscounter gestiegen ist, nahm gleichzeitig in weiten Teilen Europas die Marktkonzentration durch Fusionen und Übernahmen unter Einzelhandelsketten zu, die bereits vorher über eine erhebliche Marktmacht verfügten. Aus diesem Grund achten die Wettbewerbsbehörden in dieser Branche besonders sorgfältig auf die Einhaltung wettbewerbspolitischer Regelungen, damit die Marktkonzentration nicht ein besorgniserregendes Maß annimmt. In einer Studie für die niederländische Autoriteit Consument & Markt (ACM), haben wir die Auswirkungen dreier nationaler Unternehmenszusammenschlüsse im niederländischen Lebensmittelmarkt zwischen 2009 und 2012 untersucht, welche von der ACM unter der Auflage, Filialen zu verkaufen, genehmigt wurden. Wir kommen zu dem Ergebnis, dass die Zusammenschlüsse keine erheblichen Auswirkungen auf die Preise hatten. Allerdings reduzierte der letzte Zusammenschluss in signifikantem Maße die Breite des Sortiments und damit die Auswahlmöglichkeiten der Konsumenten. Die von der ACM angeordneten Filialverkäufe konnten die negativen Folgen durch die Zusammenschlüsse nur teilweise begrenzen.

K21|Upward pricing pressure as a predictor of merger price effects|We use Monte Carlo experiments to evaluate whether “upward pricing pressure” (UPP) accurately predicts the price effects of mergers, motivated by the observation that UPP is a restricted form of the first order approximation derived in Jaffe and Weyl (2013). Results indicate that UPP is quite accurate with standard log-concave demand systems, but understates price effects if demand exhibits greater convexity. Prediction error does not systematically exceed that of misspecified simulation models, nor is it much greater than that of correctly-specified models simulated with imprecise demand elasticities. The results also support that UPP provides accurate screens for anticompetitive mergers.
K21|Structural remedies as a signaling device|We analyze the effects of structural remedies on merger activity when the Antitrust Agency (AA) cannot observe a proposed merger’s efficiency type. Provided the AA follows a consumer surplus standard, an efficient merger type is doomed to over-fix with its divestiture proposal in a pooling equilibrium, which is also possible under separation.
