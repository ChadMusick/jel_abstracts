J52|Simple methods for consistent estimation of dynamic panel data sample selection models|We analyse the properties of generalised method of moments-instrumental variables (GMM-IV) estimators of AR(1) dynamic panel data sample selection models. We show the consistency of the first-differenced GMM-IV estimator uncorrected for sample selection of Arellano and Bond (1991) (a property also shared by the Anderson and Hsiao,1982, proposal). Alternatively, the system GMM-IV estimator (Arellano and Bover, 1995, and Blundell and Bond, 1998) shows a moderate bias. We perform a Monte Carlo study to evaluate the finite sample properties of the proposed estimators. Our results confirm the absence of bias of the Arellano and Bond estimator under a variety of circumstances, as well as the small bias of the system estimator, mostly due to the correlation between the individual heterogeneity components in both the outcome and selection equations. However, we must not discard the system estimator because, in small samples, its performance is similar to or even better than that of the Arellano-Bond. These results hold in dynamic models with exogenous, predetermined or endogenous covariates. They are especially relevant for practitioners using unbalanced panels when either there is selection of unknown form or when selection is difficult to model.
J52|Oh Mother: The Neglected Impact of School Disruptions|Temporary school closures (TSC) represent a major challenge to policymakers across the globe due to their potential impact on instructional time and student achievement. A neglected but equally important question relates to how such closures affect the labor market behavior of parents. This paper provides novel evidence on the effect of temporary school closures on parental labor market behavior, exploiting the prevalence of primary school teacher strikes across time and provinces in Argentina. We find clear evidence that temporary school closures negatively impact the labor market participation of mothers, in particular lower-skilled mothers less attached to the labor force and mothers in dual-income households who face a lower opportunity cost of dropping out of the labor force. This effect translates into a statistically significant and economically meaningful reduction in labor earnings: the average mother whose child is exposed to ten days of TSCs suffers a decline in monthly labor earnings equivalent to 2.92% of the mean. While we do not find any effects among fathers in general, fathers with lower predicted earnings than their spouses also experience negative labor market effects. This suggests that the parental response to TSCs depend, at least in part, on the relative income of each parent. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggest that the aggregate impact of TSCs on annual parental earnings is more than $113 million, and that the average mother would be willing to forego 1.6 months of labor earnings in order to ensure that there are no TSCs while her child is in primary school.
J52|Bargaining and hold-up: the role of arbitration|This paper analyses arbitration as a surrogate for complete contracts. We embed this idea in a simple model of a long-term relationship between a firm and its workforce, in which they can make productive-enhancing, relationship-specific investments, and then negotiate over the division of the resultant surplus. It is shown that the mere presence of the arbitrator (in the background of negotiations) may enhance investment incentives ex ante by minimizing each party’s ability to engage in hold-up behaviours ex post. Furthermore, we highlight notably that the partners should optimally commit to call an arbitrator ensuring a compromise by awarding a reasonable share of the surplus to the worker. Indeed, this type of arbitrator would harmonize the parties’ bargaining powers and then weight their investment incentives optimally.
J52|Strikes and Lockouts in Sweden: Reconsidering Raphael’s List of Work Stoppages 1859-1902|This paper presents and discusses a recently digitized, dataset of strikes and lockouts in Sweden for the period 1859-1902. The dataset, which originally was collected by Axel Raphael by retrospectively browsing through newspapers, pre-dates the Swedish official statistics on work stoppages that began in 1903. Whereas Raphael’s data have been used to illustrate the long-run development of strikes, labour historians have been hesitant or completely dismissive towards the usefulness of his work. This paper reviews, and deepens previous assessments of Raphael’s data and compares his data with the official statistics for the period after 1903. This renewed assessment leads to three conclusions. Firstly, the coverage of the data is much better after 1885 than before. Trends and fluctuations in conflict frequency obtained from Raphael’s data for the later period are probably accurate. Secondly, there are also in the later period a lot of missing information in how conflicts are described, for example with regard to number of participants and outcomes. Thirdly, there are good opportunities to complement, and enhance, Raphael’s dataset by browsing through more newspapers or consulting other sources.
J52|Works Councils and Organizational Gender Policies in Germany|While education and labor force participation of women have been increased, there is still a substantial gender gap in labor market opportunities. This gives rise to the question of what factors lead employers to promote work-family balance and gender equality. We address this question by examining the influence of works councils on the gender policies of establishments in Germany. Using data of the IAB Establishment Panel, we find that the incidence of a works council is associated with an increased likelihood that an establishment provides family-friendly practices and promotes equal opportunities of men and women. This finding also holds in a recursive multivariate probit model that accounts for potential endogeneity of works council incidence.
J52|From Ultima Ratio to Mutual Consent: The Effects of Changing Employment Protection Doctrine|In many countries, the termination of employment contracts has to be either on employer initiative or on employee initiative. Furthermore, the cost of the procedure is borne mainly by the contracting party who takes the initiative and there is little room for sharing costs. The implicit doctrine is that employment termination has to be the last resort, the ultima ratio. In 2008, the French government initiated a change in doctrine: it became possible to terminate employment contracts by mutual consent, at lower costs. Building on firm-level data, we develop an event analysis which reveals that the reform was followed by a decline in dismissals as well as by a significant rise in overall separation rates. By promoting separation by mutual consent, the reform reduced labor litigation risks, boosted workers' flows, but, eventually, we do not detect any effect on firms' employment levels.
J52|Designing Good Labour Market Institutions: How to Reconcile Flexibility, Productivity and Security?|The world of work is in constant change. Demographic shifts, technological innovation, institutional reforms and global economic integration affect the way people work. Technological innovations have a major impact on occupations and industries, changing the ways economies in different world regions, in both developed and developing countries, work along with new division of labour that are facilitated by global economic integration. This paper is based on the joint work within the International Panel on Social Progress. It highlights three main areas of attention: a) skill formation, d) the challenges to collective bargaining, and e) social protection and labour market policies. Based on an assessment of the existing evidence, the paper suggests some policy principles and concrete policy options that might further those objectives, not ignoring some tensions that might exist between flexibility and security in the different labour markets. The ultimate direction of reforms in line with an idea of social progress lies in institutional arrangements that facilitate the reconciliation of flexibility and productivity with access to decent jobs and social protection. We argue that distinct policy options are available that can be implemented more globally in order to achieve these goals simultaneously.
J52|The Political Economy Consequences of China's Export Slowdown|We study how adverse economic shocks influence political outcomes in authoritarian regimes in strong states, by examining the 2013-2015 export slowdown in China. We exploit detailed customs data and the variation they reveal about Chinese prefectures’ underlying exposure to the global trade slowdown, in order to implement a shift-share instrumental variables strategy. Prefectures that experienced a more severe export slowdown witnessed a significant increase in incidents of labor strikes. This was accompanied by a heightened emphasis in such prefectures on upholding domestic stability, as evidenced from: (i) textual analysis measures we constructed from official annual work reports using machine-learning algorithms; and (ii) data we gathered on local fiscal expenditures channelled towards public security uses and social spending. The central government was subsequently more likely to replace the party secretary in prefectures that saw a high level of “excess strikes”, above what could be predicted from the observed export slowdown, suggesting that local leaders were held to account on yardsticks related to political stability.
J52|Is Declining Union Membership Contributing to Low Wages Growth?|The union membership rate has declined steadily in Australia since the 1950s. Some have suggested that this decline has caused a fall in the bargaining power of workers, which in turn has contributed to low wages growth in recent years. We test this hypothesis using a newly available source of micro data, covering all enterprise agreements federally registered between 1991 and 2017. We find that changing unionisation patterns are unlikely to account for much of the recent low wages growth. This conclusion reflects three key results. First, there has been no decline in the share of employees covered by enterprise agreements negotiated with union involvement even as union membership has declined. Second, the 'union wage growth premium' in the private sector has been stable over time. Third, spillover effects from union involvement in enterprise agreement negotiations onto wage outcomes in other enterprise agreements exist, but have not changed materially over time.
J52|When Particulate Matter Strikes Cities: Social Disparities and Health Costs of Air Pollution|Socio-economic characteristics can determine large differentials in exposure and vulnerability to air pollution, generating environmental inequality. In this paper we investigate unequal effects of daily particulate matter (PM) concentrations on Italian hospitalizations by exploiting daily episodes of public transportation strikes as an instrumental variable for pollution exposure. We show that hospitalizations resulting from higher pollution are not only more likely to occur, but are also more complex to deal with. Moreover, our predictions show that conditional on PM exposure levels, hospitalization costs follow a strong socio-economic gradient, with the health burden being larger for the young, less educated individuals and migrants from low income countries. These inequality mechanisms imply that the effects of air pollution should be addressed not only by environmental and health actors, but should be coordinated with other sectors, such as education and transport, shaping a common policy approach.

J52|The Employment Effects of Collective Bargaining|This paper studies the wage and employment effects of Italian collective bargaining. For this purpose, it analyses monthly data derived from administrative archives on the population of private-sector employees, matched with extensive information on contractual pay levels settled in industry-wide agreements bargained by trade unions' and employers' representatives at the national level. The research design is based on a generalised differences-in-differences method, which exploits the numerous contrasts generated by the Italian wage setting rules and controls for space-specific sectoral unobserved time-varying disturbances in a fully non-parametric way. Results show that a growth in contractual wages produced sizeable increases in actual pay levels for all workers, determining at the same time strong and negative effects on employment. The resulting confidence interval of the implied own-price labour demand elasticity ranged between -0.4 and -1.2, and it was even slightly more negative among incorporated companies. Studying interactions of this parameter with firm-level outcomes â€“value added per worker, size, the labour share and capital intensity - we found associations broadly consistent with Hicks-Marshall laws and with traditional models of centralized wage bargaining. Further analyses carefully document the presence of dynamic employment adjustments to contractual wage levels and assess the overall robustness of the results.

J52|Labor Conflict at the Workplace: Do Dismissal Regulations Matter?|Using data on more than 13000 European establishments over the 2009-2013 period, I analyze the relationship between discharge regulation and industrial actions. I introduce a simple theoretical framework allowing for both positive and negative effects of dismissal constraints on the occurrence of labor disputes, and empirically answer the question as whether stricter dismissal laws make EU establishments experience more frequent and intense industrial actions (work-to-rule, strikes and occupation). I find that a change from employment at-will to a regime with very strict dismissal constraints is associated with an increase in the likelihood of observing an industrial action at the establishment-level ranging between 10.5 and 14.8 percentage points, and that this effect reduces to around 6.7 percentage points when only company-specific industrial actions are considered. Discharge constraints effects on industrial actions are then confirmed through a difference-in-differences analysis, by exploiting quasi-experimental variations in national dismissal regulations. My findings show that less strict discharge regulations moderate labor conflicts in EU establishments, by disciplining workers and restraining unions' activism.
J52|Plädoyer für eine neue Tarifpolitik: Kritische Situationsanalyse und Diskussion einer alternativen Gestaltungsvariante|Es gibt gute Gründe, die jahrzehntelang eingespielten Muster der Tarifpolitik kritisch zu hinterfragen. Für einen besonders problematischen Aspekt liefert das aktuelle Jahr 2019 ein gutes Beispiel: Die Ergebnisse von Tarifvertragsverhandlungen weisen aus betriebswirtschaftlicher Sicht ein kontraproduktives zeitliches Muster auf. Die höchsten Tarifabschlüsse werden nämlich oftmals in Jahren getätigt, in denen sich die Wachstumsraten der Wirtschaft deutlich reduzieren. Unternehmen bräuchten in dieser Phase eigentlich eine Kostenentlastung. Stattdessen gehen sie mit sockelwirksam erhöhten Personalkosten in eine Abschwungphase. Diese kontraproduktive Antizyklik kann potenziell zu einer Gefährdung der Arbeitsplätze in einzelnen Betrieben führen. Die Zahl der Betriebe in Kurzarbeit belegt dies deutlich. Weitere problematische Aspekte der üblichen tarifpolitischen Mechanismen sind: Kosten und Störpotenzial von Arbeitskämpfen, Belastung des öffentlichen Lebens und des Betriebsfriedens durch Streiks, Inflexibilität von Tarifverträgen, Kompliziertheit und Antiquiertheit von Verhandlungsritualen, finanzielle Überforderung einzelner Unternehmen durch Betriebsferne der Tarifverträge. Die Diskussion aller Aspekte führt zur Schlussfolgerung, dass die Suche nach alternativen Mechanismen in der Tarifpolitik sinnvoll ist. Es wird dazu ein Lastenheft entwickelt. Im Ergebnis wird ein neues Paradigma in der Tarifpolitik vorgeschlagen und diskutiert, das im Dauerbetrieb stärker durch eine betriebswirtschaftlich sinnhafte Zyklik, Standardisierung, Automatisierung und Einfachheit geprägt ist. Im Kern besteht der Ansatz aus zwei Komponenten. Alle Beschäftigten erhalten zunächst in jedem Jahr automatisch einen Ausgleich für die Inflationsrate. Dies schafft Kaufkraftstabilität. In einem nächsten Schritt wird die Gesamtbelegschaft dann zu einem langfristig vereinbarten Prozentsatz automatisch am Vorjahresgewinn des eigenen Unternehmens beteiligt. Dieses zweite Element sichert eine höhere Flexibilität der Personalkosten und führt zu betriebsnäheren Tarifergebnissen. Im Detail sind dabei eine Fülle von Einzelfragen zu diskutieren, unter anderem muss eine Lösung für nicht gewinnorientierte Organisationen gefunden werden.

J52|Assessing the Legal Value Added of Collective Bargaining Agreements|Abstract: How much value does collective bargaining add to the working conditions already established in general labour law? In this paper we propose a methodology to address this question: we compare the specific contents of collective agreements (except minimum wages) to their equivalent norms set by base law. We illustrate this approach by analysing in detail about 400 norms from six collective agreements in Portugal and then comparing them to the country’s Labour Code. We find that as many as 62% of those collective bargaining norms are exactly or virtually equal to the Labour Code; only 25% (an average of 16 norms per convention) are more favourable for the worker; and 12% (8) are more favourable for the employer. We conclude that collective bargaining in Portugal has a relatively small role as a source of effective labour law. We also present several potential explanations for our findings, including the wide range of base law, which may reduce the negotiating space of bargaining.
J52|Tarifpolitischer Bericht 1. Halbjahr 2019: Viele Warnstreiks, lange Laufzeiten|Der vorliegende Report berichtet über ausgewählte Tarifverhandlungen im 1. Halbjahr 2019. Wie schon im Vorjahr stand neben den Entgeltforderungen der Wunsch nach neuen Wahlmodellen auf der tarifpolitischen Agenda der Gewerkschaften. Bei diesen Wahlmodellen handelt die Gewerkschaft eine zusätzliche Entgeltkomponente aus, die wahlweise auch in Freizeit getauscht werden kann. In der Eisen- und Stahlindustrie setzte die IG Metall ein zusätzliches Urlaubsgeld von 1.000 Euro durch, welches die Arbeitnehmer in maximal fünf freie Tage umwandeln können. Auch in der westdeutschen Textilindustrie und im Bankgewerbe wurde über Wahlmodelle diskutiert. Hier konnten sich die Gewerkschaften aber nicht durchsetzen. In der ostdeutschen Textilindustrie ging es um eine Verkürzung der Wochenarbeitszeit. Die IG Metall erreichte in den Verhandlungen, dass die Arbeitszeit bis 2027 stufenweise von derzeit 40 auf 37 Stunden reduziert wird. Bei den Klinikärzten an den kommunalen Kliniken setzte der Marburger Bund eine exaktere Erfassung der geleisteten Arbeitsstunden und zwei arbeits- und bereitschaftsfreie Wochenenden pro Monat durch. Die Entgeltforderungen lagen zwischen 5,0 und 6,5 Prozent. Ver.di verlangte im Handel und im Öffentlichen Dienst außerdem überdurchschnittliche Anhebungen der unteren Lohngruppen. Dies konnte die Gewerkschaft vor allem im Öffentlichen Dienst, aber auch im Einzelhandel durchsetzen. In den meisten Tarifabschlüssen wurden stufenweise Lohnanpassungen bei langen Laufzeiten vereinbart. Im Öffentlichen Dienst addieren sich die drei Erhöhungsstufen auf 7,8 Prozent (zweimal 3,2 und einmal 1,4 Prozent) bei einer Laufzeit von 33 Monaten. Die Klinikärzte erhalten für denselben Zeitraum insgesamt 6,5 Prozent mehr. In der Druckindustrie wurden sogar 36 Monate Laufzeit beschlossen. Dort steigen die Löhne ebenfalls in drei Stufen um insgesamt 5,4 Prozent. Im Bankgewerbe einigten sich die Tarifparteien auf zwei Erhöhungen von jeweils 2 Prozent bei einer Laufzeit von 29 Monaten. Kürzere Laufzeiten gab es mit 18 Monaten in der Papiererzeugenden Industrie - die Löhne steigen in diesem Zeitraum einmalig um 3 Prozent - und vor allem beim Kabinenpersonal von Eurowings. Dort wurde im Rahmen der Verhandlungen über den Manteltarifvertrag zwischen ver.di und dem Unternehmen auch vereinbart, für die bei ver.di organisierten Flugbegleiter eine Lohnerhöhung von 2 Prozent für neun Monate zu übernehmen, die zuvor bereits die Flugbegleiter-Organisation UFO ausgehandelt hatte. Im Vergleich zum gleichen Vorjahreszeitraum legte die Konfliktintensität - sie misst, wie stark die Tarifverhandlungen durch Streikdrohungen, Verhandlungsabbrüche oder Warnstreiks eskalieren - deutlich zu: Im 1. Halbjahr 2018 fielen im Durchschnitt je Verhandlung 6,7 Punkte an, im 1. Halbjahr 2019 waren es 10,8 Punkte. Die Druckindustrie kam auf 44 Punkte, gefolgt vom Bankgewerbe mit 33 und den Klinikärzten mit 19 Punkten. Konfliktfrei ging es in drei Branchen zu: in der Papiererzeugenden Industrie, in der ostdeutschen Textilindustrie und bei der Deut-schen Post. Dort werden künftig wieder alle Paketzusteller nach dem Haustarifvertrag vergütet. Im zweiten Halbjahr drohen vor allem Konflikte im Flugverkehr durch UFO. Anstehende Verhandlungen in der Chemischen Industrie und im Bauhauptgewerbe (Anpassung des branchenspezifischen Mindestlohns) dürften hingegen eher konfliktfrei verlaufen. In der Chemischen Industrie sind selbst Streikdrohungen selten.
J52|Tarifpolitischer Bericht 2. Halbjahr 2018: Vielfach stockende Verhandlungen|Der vorliegende Report berichtet über die Tarifverhandlungen im 2. Halbjahr 2018. Im 1. Halbjahr hatte es bereits Tarifverhandlungen in wichtigen Branchen gegeben, beispielsweise in der Metall- und Elektro-Industrie, im Öffentlichen Dienst (Bund und Kommunen) und im Bauhauptgewerbe. Im 2. Halbjahr 2018 stand vor allem der Verkehrssektor im Fokus der Tarifauseinandersetzungen. Dabei gab es bei der Deutschen Bahn und in der Luftfahrt eine Reihe von Warnstreiks, die erhebliche Auswirkungen auf Drittbetroffene hatten. In der Luftfahrt schwelten verschiedene Tarifkonflikte bei der irischen Fluggesellschaft Ryanair, die sich nach der Insolvenz von AirBerlin zu einem zentralen Akteur im deutschen Flugverkehr entwickelt hat. Die Verhandlungen mit den Piloten eskalierten dabei ebenso wie die Verhandlungen mit dem Kabinenpersonal. Es gab mehrfach Warn- oder Tagesstreiks. Im November 2018 konnten für beide Berufsgruppen Eckpunkte vereinbart werden, auf deren Basis nun erstmals für das Unternehmen Tarifverträge für das in Deutschland stationierte Personal entwickelt werden. Auch bei Eurowings kam es im Streit um einen neuen Manteltarifvertrag für das Kabinenpersonal zu Warnstreiks. Dieser Konflikt wurde noch nicht beigelegt. Bei der Deutschen Bahn kam es ebenfalls zu einem Warnstreik, der bundesweit fast den gesamten Zugverkehr zum Erliegen brachte. Zum Ausstand hatte nicht die Gewerkschaft Deutscher Lokführer (GDL), sondern die konkurrierende Eisenbahn- und Verkehrsgewerkschaft (EVG) aufgerufen. Nach diesem Warnstreik einigten sich EVG und Deutsche Bahn auf einen neuen Tarifabschluss, der auch half, die zwischenzeitlich abgebrochenen Verhandlungen zwischen Bahn und GDL wieder aufzunehmen und zum Abschluss zu bringen. Auch in anderen Wirtschaftszweigen verliefen die Verhandlungen eher stockend. In der Druckindustrie schwelt ein Grundsatzkonflikt. Dort hatten die Arbeitgeber den Manteltarifvertrag gekündigt. Die Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft (ver.di) lehnt aber jedwede Verschlechterung von Arbeitsbedingungen ab. Für die Gebäudereinigung fordert die IG Bauen-Agrar-Umwelt (IG BAU) ein 13. Monatsgehalt. Dies lehnen wiederum die Arbeitgeber strikt ab. In keiner der beiden Branchen deutet sich trotz monatelanger Verhandlungen derzeit eine Kompromisslinie an. Schwierig waren auch die Verhandlungen bei T-Systems, einer Tochter der Deutschen Telekom. Hier wurden die Verhandlungen dadurch belastet, dass das Management angekündigt hatte, massiv Stellen abbauen zu wollen. Im Durchschnitt von insgesamt 22 analysierten Tarifverhandlungen, die entweder im Jahr 2018 beendet wurden oder 2018 begannen, lag die Konfliktintensität bei 10,5 Punkten. Die Auseinandersetzung zwischen Ryanair und den Piloten führte zu 53 Konfliktpunkten, der Tarifkonflikt in der Metall- und Elektro-Industrie zu 35 Punkten und der in der Druckindustrie zu 31 Punkten. Harmonisch ging es hingegen in der Chemischen Industrie zu. Dort einigten sich die Sozialpartner konfliktfrei. Aufgrund der guten Arbeitsmarktlage könnte auch das Jahr 2019 konfliktreich werden. Nach wie vor liegen die Forderungen der Gewerkschaften bei 5,5 bis 6 Prozent, obwohl sich die Konjunktur abgekühlt hat. Allerdings wird 2019 eher ein kleines Tarifjahr. In vielen Branchen wird es Entgeltsteigerungen geben, die bereits 2018 ausgehandelt wurden.
J52|Reflections on wage-setting|Central banks need to be concerned about wages since they are a major driver of inflation. Rising wages are needed to signal directions for market adjustments to ensure growth. Wage growth is driven by relative scarcity, labor productivity and expectations about inflation and future growth. Migration plays a significant role to balance wages across regions and countries. Wage growth has been low in most developed economies because of underutilized labor if properly measured. Germany seems to be an exception, but the scarcity of workers has been tamed by internal flexibility resulting from more decentralized wage setting and labor market reforms.
J52|Industrial relations reform, firm-level bargaining and nominal wage floors|Decentralised bargaining is an important wage setting mechanism that promotes wage flexibility which in turn determines how earnings and employment are affected by economic shocks. We investigate the impact of the 2011 industrial relations reform in Greece that allowed firms with less than 50 employees to participate in firm-level bargaining. Matching administrative contractual data with longitudinal firm-level data we identify treated and non-treated firms. We find that during the first post-reform year, treated firms with less than 50 employees experienced a 4.8 percent increase in firm-level bargaining and a 12 percent drop in wage floors relative to non-treated firms. We also document a positive employment impact.
J52|Firm Wage Premia, Industrial Relations, and Rent Sharing in Germany|This paper investigates the influence of industrial relations on firm wage premia in Germany. OLS regressions for the firm effects from a two-way fixed effects decomposition of workers’ wages by Card, Heining, and Kline (2013) document that average premia are larger in firms bound by collective agreements and in firms with a works council, holding constant firm performance. RIF regressions show that premia are less dispersed among covered firms but more dispersed among firms with a works council. Hence, deunionization is the only among the suspects investigated that contributes to explaining the marked rise in the premia dispersion over time.
J52|Tarifpolitischer Bericht - 1. Halbjahr 2018: Arbeitszeit zurück auf der Agenda|"Der vorliegende Report berichtet über die Tarifverhandlungen im 1. Halbjahr 2018. Neben dem Entgelt stand in einigen Verhandlungen auch das Thema Arbeitszeit auf der Agenda. In der Metall- und Elektro-Industrie setzte die IG Metall eine ""kurze Vollzeit"" durch, die Arbeitnehmern in Vollzeit das Recht einräumt, die Wochenarbeitszeit vorübergehend für maximal zwei Jahre auf bis zu 28 Stunden zu reduzieren. Dieser Anspruch ist mit dem Recht verbunden, wieder zur Vollzeit zurückzukehren. Im Gegenzug erhalten die Unternehmen der Branche mehr Möglichkeiten, mit Mitarbeitern, die dies wollen, längere Wochenarbeitszeiten als die tariflich geregelten 35 Stunden zu vereinbaren. Bei der Deutschen Post wurde ein Wahlmodell eingeführt: Die Beschäftigten entscheiden selbst, ob sie lieber Lohnerhöhungen oder mehr Freiheit haben möchten. Obwohl die Gewerkschaften zumeist 6 Prozent mehr Geld für zwölf Monate forderten, fielen die Abschlüsse sehr differenziert aus. Auf den ersten Blick erzielte die IG Bauen-Agrar-Umwelt mit einem Lohnzuwachs für 2018 von 5,7 Prozent im Westen und 6,6 Prozent im Osten einen Rekordabschluss. Dieser relativiert sich aber, wenn die lange Laufzeit mitberücksichtigt wird. Insgesamt hat die Tariflohndynamik in den ersten Monaten dieses Jahres gegenüber dem Vorjahr spürbar zugenommen. Im März und April stiegen die Tarifverdienste um 2,8 Prozent, im Mai sogar um 4,0 Prozent. 2017 lag der Zuwachs noch bei durchschnittlich 2,1 Prozent. Die neue Dynamik wird sich wohl auch im 2. Halbjahr 2018 fortsetzen. Im Vergleich zum Vorjahr verliefen die Tarifverhandlungen weniger kooperativ. Besonders konfliktreich ging es in der Metall- und Elektro-Industrie zu. Hier verursachten die verschiedenen Konflikthandlungen wie Streikdrohungen, Warnstreiks oder juristische Klagen insgesamt 35 Konfliktpunkte. Das ist der höchste Wert seit 2003, dem Jahr des gescheiterten Arbeitskampfes zur Einführung der 35-Stunden-Woche in Ostdeutschland. Im Durchschnitt der 15 analysierten Tarifverhandlungen lag die Konfliktintensität bei 6,7 Punkten. Das ist deutlich höher als der Jahresdurchschnitt im letzten Jahr. 2017 fielen im Durchschnitt 3,5 Punkte je Konflikt an. Diese Tendenz zu weniger kooperativen Verhandlungen könnte sich im zweiten Halbjahr 2018 fortsetzen. Dann drohen vor allem in der Druckindustrie und bei der Fluggesellschaft Ryanair Konflikte. Spannend werden auch die Tarifverhandlungen bei der Deutschen Bahn, wo sich weiterhin keine Kooperation zwischen den rivalisierenden Gewerkschaften andeutet."
J52|Tarifkonflikte im Jahr 2017: Kooperation statt Konfrontation|Eine Auswertung von 178 Tarifkonflikten zeigt, dass das Tarifjahr 2017 das friedlichste seit dem Jahr 2000 war. Die maximale Eskalationsstufe - sie gibt auf einer Skala von 0 bis 7 an, bis zu welcher Stufe ein Tarifkonflikt eskaliert - erreichte im Durchschnitt der 16 ausgewerteten Tarif-verhandlungen einen Wert von 1,2 und die Konfliktintensität - sie ist die bereinigte Summe aller während einer Tarifverhandlung aufgetretenen Konflikthandlungen - lag bei 3,5 Punkten. Im Streikrekordjahr 2015 lag die durchschnittliche maximale Eskalationstufe noch bei 3,5 und die Konfliktintensität bei 17,8 Punkten. Ein Grund für die gute Jahresbilanz 2017 war, dass wichtige Konflikte in der Luftfahrt und bei der Deutschen Bahn ohne größere Eskalation beigelegt werden konnten. Außerdem wurde in der Chemischen Industrie, in der Süßwarenindustrie im Bauhaupt-gewerbe und bei den Klinikärzten des Marburger Bundes konfliktfrei verhandelt. Konfliktreich ging es hingegen im Einzelhandel zu. Dort summierten sich die Konfliktpunkte auf 26 bei einer maximalen Eskalationsstufe von 4 (Warnstreik). Eine Auswertung nach Gewerkschaften zeigt: Über den gesamten Zeitraum hinweg verhandelte die IG Bergbau, Chemie, Energie am kooperativsten. Die Vereinigung Cockpit und die Lokführer-gewerkschaft GDL erreichten die höchsten Konfliktintensitäten und die Flugbegleiter-Organisation UFO sowie die Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft ver.di im Einzelhandel die höchsten maximalen Eskalationsstufen. Das laufende Tarifjahr dürfte wieder konfliktreicher als 2017 verlaufen. In der Metall- und Elektro-Industrie spitzte sich der inzwischen beigelegte Tarifkonflikt stärker zu als bis zu den in den Vorjahren üblichen Warnstreiks, da die Arbeitgeber juristische Mittel gegen die Rechtmäßigkeit der Tagesstreiks einlegten (Eskalationsstufe 5). Im Öffentlichen Dienst und bei der Deutschen Post gab es bereits erste Warnstreiks und im Bauhauptgewerbe standen die Tarifverhandlungen zuletzt kurz vor dem Scheitern. Konfliktrisiken bergen auch die anstehenden Tarifver-handlungen in der Telekommunikation, in der Druckindustrie und bei der Deutschen Bahn.
J52|The Painful External Costs of Bargaining - Evidence from a Railway Strike|Evidence is presented that the number of traffic deaths and traffic injuries increased significantly due to a railway strike in Germany. While the number of slightly and seriously injured people increased on all road types, the number of fatally injured people increased only on roads out of town. The data suggest that the timing of a strike plays a crucial role in the effect on traffic injuries. Effects are stronger on weekends (Friday to Sunday) than on weekdays.
J52|Paros, piquetes y contrato social|Ya se ha convertido en una imagen casi habitual la del piquete que obstruye la circulación en la ciudad luego de haberse declarado un día de paro y aún en casos de no existir tal declaración. Esta situación puede ser considerada como una violación de un contrato social que, aún de manera implícita y también hipotética, regula (o debería regular) la relaciones entre los habitantes de un país o de una ciudad. En el comportamiento que habitualmente siguen los llamados piqueteros se observa una evidente violación de principios que suelen ser aceptados como normas de convivencia ciudadana. En términos más precisos podemos decir que se trata de un quebrantamiento del “contrato social”. Para ello será necesario identificar sin ambigüedades que se entiende por contrato social y como el mismo sería reiteradamente vulnerado en las actividades de los piquetes. El principio de la vigencia de un “contrato social” es evitar la llamada “guerra de todos contra todos” y ceder para ello el monopolio de la fuerza al estado. La limitación de la libertad propia encontraría su contrapartida en la protección de todos sus miembros dentro de un marco de convivencia social, independiente de las respectivas ideas y creencias de los integrantes.

J52|Strikes, employee workplace representation, unionism, and industrial relations quality in European establishments|This paper investigates the relationship between different types of workplace representation and strikes using the 2009 European Company Survey. It also examines the role of the workplace climate, union organization, and collective bargaining. Our principal finding is that works councils are associated with reduced strike activity. But this result is sensitive to the union status of work councilors: where union members make up a majority of works councilors any beneficial effect of the entity on strike incidence is no longer evident in the data. Not only do union-dominated works councils experience greater strike activity than their counterparts with minority union membership, but also more strikes than establishments with union workplace representation where union members are in a minority. Dissonance between the parties, as indexed by degree of divergence between the opinions of employer and employee representative survey respondents as to the state of industrial relations at the workplace, is associated with elevated strike activity. If our measure of dissonance is exogenous, this result suggests that industrial relations quality may be key to strike reduction independent of workplace representation. Finally, there is some indication that union density at the workplace is directly associated with strike incidence, as well as evidence that strikes are more likely when collective bargaining occurs at higher than company level.
J52|The Sources of the Union Wage Gap: The Role of Worker, Firm, Match, and Jobtitle Heterogeneity|Using matched employer-employee-contract data for Portugal – a country with near-universal union coverage – we find evidence of a sizable effect of union affiliation on wages. Gelbach's (2016) decomposition procedure is next deployed to ascertain the contributions of worker, firm, match, and job-title heterogeneity to the union wage gap. Of these the most important is the firm fixed effect, followed at some distance by union workers gaining from elevated job titles and/or more generous promotion policies. For its part, unobserved worker quality plays only a very weak role, while there is even less suggestion that improved match quality bolsters the union premium.
J52|Employment Protection Legislation, Labor Courts, and Effective Firing Costs|Labor courts may influence firing costs. Apart from the procedural costs, there is the likelihood that labor courts declare firings as unfair or nil, which significantly increase severance payments over those established for fair dismissals by Employment Protection Legislation. In this paper we model the determinants of the wedge between mandated and effective firing costs arising from labor courts resolution of dismissals, and show how it is affected by EPL reforms, looking at recent EPL reforms in Spain (implemented in 2010 and 2012) that significantly widened the definition of fair economic dismissals.
J52|From Conflict to Compromise: The importance of mediation in Swedish work stoppages 1907-1927|Institutions for prevention and resolution of labor market conflicts were introduced all over the world in the early twentieth century. In this paper we analyze the impact of mediation on compromise outcomes in Swedish labor market conflicts, using a dataset of geo-coded strikes and lockouts from 1907 to 1927. Causality is identified by using the distance from the mediator's residence to the conflict as an instrument. Despite their limited authority and access to economic resources, the presence of mediators in a conflict resulted in about 30 per cent higher probability of a compromise outcome. Mediation was more likely to work as intended in settings where conflicting parties recognized each other and struggled over a prize that could be divided. The results suggest that mediation could have paved the way for a cooperative atmosphere in local labor markets. At the national level such an atmosphere was clearly manifested in the General Agreement in 1938 and with the rise of the Swedish Model.
J52|Information and Bargaining through Agents: Experimental Evidence from Mexico’s Labor Courts|While observers agree that courts function poorly in developing countries, a lack of data has limited our understanding of the causes of malfunction. We combine data from administrative records on severance cases filed in the Mexico City Labor Court with interventions that provide information to parties in randomly selected cases on predicted case outcomes and conciliation services. We first use the data to document a set of stylized facts about the functioning of the court. The interventions nearly double the overall settlement rate, but only when the plaintiff herself is present to receive the information directly. Administrative records from six months after the treatment indicate that the treatment effects remain unchanged over that period, even though an additional one in three cases in the control group settle in that period. The post-treatment results indicate that lawyers do not convey the information provided in the intervention to their clients. A simple analytic framework rationalizes the experimental results. Analysis of settlements induced by the interventions suggests that the provision of information is welfare-improving for the plaintiffs. The experimental results replicate over two phases conducted in different sub-courts, showing robustness.
J52|The One Constant: A Causal Effect of Collective Bargaining on Employment Growth?|A large number of articles have analysed 'the one constant' in the economic effects of trade unions, namely that collective bargaining reduces employment growth by two to four percentage points per year. Evidence is, however, mostly related to Anglo-Saxon countries. We investigate whether a different institutional setting might lead to a different outcome, making the constant a variable entity. Using linked-employer-employee data for Germany, we find a negative correlation between being covered by a sector-wide bargaining agreement or firm-level contract and employment growth of about one percentage point per annum. However, the correlation between employment growth and collective bargaining is not robust to the use of panel methods. We conclude that the results of the literature using cross-section data might be driven by selection.
J52|Cinquanta anni di contrattazione di secondo livello: che cosa impariamo dal caso Lamborghini?|In the last fifty years, the nature and quality of industrial relations in Italy has changed considerably. The national bargaining process has been severely weakened and social dialogue between the parties has been questioned on several occasions. Corporate bargaining in the Fiat automotive group marked a season where the test of strength between company management and the Trade Union seemed to be played out on the ground of economic development based on a waiver of workers' rights, and where the global dimension of industrial relations in a multinational company could not be questioned because it was not an issue relevant to corporate bargaining. In this context, the existence of some divergent situations, such as that of Lamborghini, is extremely interesting, due to the particular context of regional development in which it is located and to the turning point in its ups and downs when, in 1998, it was acquired by the Audi VW group. A longitudinal analysis of the bargaining at company level offers cues for tracing a periodisation of the issues at the centre of the comparison between the parties, and the methods in which the comparison takes place. Based on the original body of bargaining from 1968 to 2016, the analysis proposed in this essay uses the results of automatic text analysis for a critical reflection that flanksthe reading of documents. In addition to identifying an effective periodisation of the issues at the heart of corporate bargaining, the conclusions underline the link between the national level and the corporate level of bargaining.
J52|Capital Structure and a Firm’s Workforce|While businesses require funding to start and grow, they also rely on human capital, which affects how they raise funds. Labor market frictions make financing labor different than financing capital. Unlike capital, labor cannot be owned and can act strategically. Workers face unemployment costs, can negotiate for higher wages, are protected by employment regulations, and face retirement risk. I propose using these frictions as a framework for understanding the unique impact of a firm’s workforce on its capital structure. For instance, high leverage often makes managing labor more difficult by undermining employees’ job security and increasing the need for costly workforce reductions. But firms can also use leverage to their advantage, such as in labor negotiations and defined benefit pensions. This research can help firms account for the needs and management of their workforce when making financing decisions.
J52|Inter-Industry Wage Inequality: Persistent differences and turbulent equalization|Persistent inter-industry wage differentials are an enduring puzzle for neoclassical economics. This paper applies the classical theory of ‘real competition’ to inter-industry wage differentials. Theoretically, we argue that competitive wage determination can be decomposed into equalizing, dispersing and turbulently equalizing factors. Empirically, we show graphically and econometrically for 31 U.S. industries in 1987-2016 that wage differentials, like regulating profit rates, are governed by turbulent equalization. Furthermore, we apply a fixed effects OLS as well as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model and find that the link between regulating profit rates and wage differentials is positive, significant and robust.
J52|Collective bargaining through the magnifying glass: A comparison between the Netherlands and Portugal|Since the global financial crisis, sector-level bargaining has come under renewed scrutiny. While in Southern Europe, the crisis raised concerns about the role of collective bargaining as an obstacle to labour market adjustment, in Northern Europe it was perceived more favourably and, according to some, may even have helped to weather the fallout of the crisis more easily. This paper seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of sector-level bargaining systems and their role for labour market performance. We compare two countries with seemingly similar collective bargaining systems, the Netherlands and Portugal, and document a number of features that may affect labour market outcomes, including: i) the scope for flexibility at the firm or worker level within sector-level agreements; ii) the emphasis on representativeness as a criterion for extensions; iii) the effectiveness of coordination across bargaining units; and iv) pro-active government policies to enhance trust and cooperation between the social partners.
J52|Organised Decentralisation of Collective Bargaining: Case studies of Germany, Netherlands and Denmark|This paper investigates different varieties of so called organised decentralisation of collective bargaining in Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark. Organised decentralisation occurs within the framework of sector agreements, which explicitly allow determination of terms and conditions at company level, and often set certain (minimum) level standards as well as procedure that have to be respected. German decentralisation is based on its dual-channel system and extensive use of opening clauses, which make workplace derogation from sector-level agreements possible. Dutch decentralisation is based on the dual-channel system and on framework agreements that allow company level bargaining as long as minimum stipulations are observed. Finally, Denmark combines a single-channel system with framework agreements setting minimum levels. Germany stands out as the least organised of the three. Opening and derogation clauses mean that terms and conditions in multi-employer agreements can be undercut. Vertical control over these derogations has suffered from the dual-channel representation in which works councils have a new role. The Netherlands exhibit some, very limited, elements of disorganisation and stable bargaining coverage. Decentralisation has mainly happened through framework agreements setting minimum levels or through the organised transfer of competencies to works councils. The Danish system leaves a lot of scope for local bargaining, the minimum levels are generally observed and bargaining coverage has not suffered. Based on these findings, we draw the conclusion that organised decentralisation requires articulation that preserves a regulatory function of multi-employer agreements. Preservation of multi-employer agreements in turn requires high bargaining coverage.
J52|From Autonomy to Subordination? Relations Between the State and the Representations of Interests on the German Labor Market|The main aim of the article is to assess the functioning and outcomes of tripartite structures of cooperation consisting of trade union federations, employers' organizations and the state in Germany on the background of the evolution of the welfare state. In the historical description, which was carried on chronologically covering 50 years from late 1960s, tools of institutional analysis and comparison were used. Main results indicate that state policy initially supported trade unions and employers' organizations as institutions of mediation and collective bargaining centers, but over time the sphere of social security has become a source of tensions between labor and capital. Due to generating unemployment, buying social peace became dysfunctional and impossible to finance in the long run thus the government had to reform the labor market, social sphere and consequently the German welfare state.
J52|When Labor Disputes Bring Cities to a Standstill: The Impact of Public Transit Strikes on Traffic, Accidents, Air Pollution, and Health|Many governments have banned strikes in public transportation. Whether this can be justified depends on whether strikes endanger public safety or health. We use time-series and cross-sectional variation in powerful registry data to quantify the effects of public transit strikes on urban populations in Germany. Due to higher traffic volumes and longer travel times, total car hours operated increase by 11 to 13 percent during strikes. This effect is accompanied by a 14 percent increase in vehicle crashes, a 20 percent increase in accident-related injuries, a 14 percent increase in particle pollution, and an 11 percent increase in hospital admissions for respiratory diseases among young children.
J52|Housing Supply Elasticity and Rent Extraction by State and Local Governments|Governments may extract rent from private citizens by inflating taxes and spending on projects benefiting special interests. Using a spatial equilibrium model, I show that less elastic housing supplies increase governments' abilities to extract rents. Inelastic housing supply, driven by exogenous variation in local topography, raises local governments' tax revenues and causes citizens to combat rent seeking by enacting laws limiting the power of elected officials. I find that public sector workers, one of the largest government special interests, capture a share of these rents through increased compensation when collective bargaining is legal or through corruption when collective bargaining is outlawed.
J52|Labour market adjustment in Europe during the crisis: microeconomic evidence from the Wage Dynamics Network survey|Against the backdrop of continuing adjustment in EU labour markets in response to the Great Recession and the sovereign debt crisis, the European System of Central Banks (ESCB)conducted the third wave of the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN)survey in 2014–15 as a follow-up to the two previous WDN waves carried out in 2007 and 2009. The WDN survey collected information on wage-setting practices at the firm level. This third wave sampled about 25,000 firms in 25 European countries with the aim of assessing how firms adjusted wages and employment in response to the various shocks and labour market reforms that took place in the European Union (EU) during the period 2010–13. This paper summarises the main results of WDN3 by identifying some patterns in firms’ adjustments and labour market reforms. It seeks to lay out the main lessons learnt from the survey in terms of both the general response of EU labour markets to the crisis and how these responses varied across the countries that took part in the survey.

J52|Collective bargaining and skill formation: evidence from mixed methods|The standard economics view suggests that steps to improve a country’s competitiveness include a general emphasis on deregulation and decentralization of industrial relations. In this paper, we contribute to this debate by studying how firm-level collective agreements affect workplace training, a key ingredient to competitiveness. Theoretically, firm-level bargaining may affect workplace training in many ways, but quantitative analysis is usually ill equipped to provide an adequate account of them. This is where our paper mostly contributes. In the spirit of opening the “black box” of firm-level bargaining, we mix together quantitative and qualitative strategies. Following a sequential research design, our results suggest that decentralized collective agreements favor workplace training inasmuch as they grant to employers the access to dedicated financing schemes.

J52|The Long-run Effects of Teacher Strikes: Evidence from Argentina|This is the first paper to estimate the effect of teacher strikes on student long-run educational attainment and labor market outcomes. We exploit cross-cohort variation in the prevalence of teacher strikes within and across provinces in Argentina in a difference-in-difference framework to examine how exposure to teacher strikes during primary school affects long-run outcomes. We find robust evidence that teacher strikes worsen the labor market outcomes of these individuals when they are between the ages of 30 and 40: being exposed to the average incidence of teacher strikes during primary school (88 days) reduces annual labor market earnings by 2.99 percent. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that this amounts to an aggregate earnings loss of $712 million in Argentina annually. This is equivalent to the cost of raising the average annual employment income of all primary school teachers in Argentina by 19 percent. We also find evidence of a decline in hourly wage, an increase in unemployment, an increase in the probability of not working or studying and a decline in the skill levels of the occupations into which students sort. Examining short- and long-run educational outcomes suggests that the labor market effects are driven, at least in part, by a reduction in educational attainment. Our analysis further identifies significant intergenerational treatment effects. Children of adults who were exposed to teacher strikes during primary school also experience adverse educational attainment effects.
J52|Judicial decision making under changing legal standards: The case of dismissal arbitration|The paper analyses how government actions affect judicial decision making in Australian labour courts arbitrating dismissal disputes. We isolate two channels through which these effects materialise: statutory reforms, which change legal standards, and strategic appointments, which change court composition. We analyse the probability of plaintiff success in courts using a panel of 81 judges and 2223 judicial decisions made between 2001 and 2015. We test for and subsequently exploit the randomised matching of labour court judges with unfair dismissal cases. We find significant effects from both channels: judges’ work background and changes to legal standards are strong predictors of case outcomes. Furthermore, we find evidence of compensating effects: judges with a progressive background rule more often in favour of dismissed employees if legal reforms adversely affect their chance of success in court.
J52|Are Dynamic Stochastic Disequilibrium models Keynesian or neoclassical?|Dynamic Stochastic Disequilibrium (DSDE) models share the micro-foundations of Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models based on inter-temporal optimization and rational expectations. Yet, it features the principle of effective demand which is at the core of Traditional Post-Keynesian (TPK) models and follows from the perception that the wage inflation is a policy variable rather than a labor-market clearing variable. In order to locate the DSDE model among the traditions of economic thought, the paper compares DSDE first-order conditions of optimal behavior with TPK rule-of-thumb behavior. It further compares the economic propagation of a DSDE model to those of a DSGE and TPK model as well as a Synthetic Neoclassical (SNC) model which features TPK behavioral assumptions and labor-market clearing. We arrive at two core conclusions: First, apart from assumptions regarding expectation formation, orthodox micro-foundation is, to a considerable extent, consistent with the behavioral hypotheses underlying TPK models. Second, the economy characterized by the DSDE model is essentially post-Keynesian rather than neoclassical because it features the principle of effective demand.
J52|From conflict to compromise: The importance of mediation in Swedish work stoppages, 1907-27|"""Institutions for prevention and resolution of labor market conflicts were introduced all over the world in the early twentieth century. We analyze the first 20 years of mediation in the Swedish labor market. The Swedish mediators were personally appointed, enjoyed high levels of social prestige, and were responsible for conflict prevention and resolution within geographical districts. Despite limited authority and access to economic resources, we estimate that the presence of mediation in a conflict resulted in about 30 per cent higher probability of a compromise outcome. Mediation was more likely to work as intended in settings where conflicting parties recognize each other and struggle over a prize that can be divided. By constructing a geocoded panel dataset consisting of all reported work stoppages in Sweden 1903-27, we aim to disentangle the causal effect of mediation at the local level. Our results suggest that mediation could have paved the way for a cooperative atmosphere in the local labour market. At the national level such an atmosphere was clearly manifested in the General Agreement in 1938 and with the rise of the Swedish Model."""
J52|Regional Purchasing Groups and Hospital Medicine Prices: Evidence from Group Creations|This paper estimates the impact of group purchasing on medicine prices in French hospitals, taking advantage of the entry of hospitals into regional purchasing groups between 2009 and 2014. I use a new database providing the average annual prices paid for all innovative and costly medicines in public hospitals. Using a fixed effects model that controls for hospitalsâ€™ medicine-specific bargaining abilities and medicine-specific price trends, I find that group purchasing reduces prices of medicines in oligopoly markets, but has no impact on the prices of medicines with no competitors.
J52|Labor Market Regulation, International Trade and Footloose Capital|I examine the effects of globalization in countries where the employed workers support the unemployed and the governments control wages by regulating the workers' relative bargaining power. I use a general oligopolistic equilibrium model of two integrated countries with two inputs: labor and potentially footloose capital. National competition for jobs by labor market deregulation creates a distortion with suboptimal wages. The mobility of capital aggravates that distortion by increasing the wage elasticity of labor demand, which decreases wages and welfare even further. The delegation of labor market regulation to an international agent eliminates that distortion, increasing wages and aggregate welfare.
J52|Upward Nominal Wage Rigidity|In Portugal, as in many other countries in continental Europe, the collective wage agreements between trade unions and employer associations that define wage floors for specific job titles are systematically extended to the whole industry. This means that many firms are obliged to increase the wages of their workforce in order to comply with the newly-agreed bargained wages. With some trepidation, we call this phenomenon upward nominal wage rigidity, in close symmetry with the Keynesian notion of downward nominal wage rigidity. In this paper we provide evidence that firms that are more heavily affected by the change in the bargained wage floors decrease their hiring rates and, more importantly, significantly increase their separation rates. As a complement to our analysis, we suggest the estimation of a measure that attempts to disentangle the strength of internal and external wage conditions. Based on this measure we show that firms whose wages are more influenced by external wages exhibit much lower net job creation rates.
J52|The dog that barks doesn’t bite: coverage and compliance of sectoral minimum wages in Italy|Abstract This paper provides a comprehensive portrait of the level and compliance with sectoral minimum wages in Italy between 2008 and 2015. The results show that wage floors in Italy are relatively high both in absolute terms and relative to the median wage. However, non-compliance rates are not negligible: on average, around 10% of workers are paid 20% less than the minimum wage established in their reference collective agreement. Non-compliance is particularly high in the South and in micro and small firms, and it affects especially women and temporary workers. Overall, wages in the bottom of the distribution appear to be largely unaffected by minimum wage increases. More effective enforcement practices are therefore needed to safeguard a level playing field for firms and ensure that minimum wage increases are effectively reflected in pay increases for workers at the bottom of the distribution.

J52|Strikes, Employee Workplace Representation, Unionism, and Trust: Evidence from Cross-Country Data|This paper investigates the determinants of industrial conflict in companies, using a multi-country workplace inquiry for 2009 and 2013 and various measures of strike activity. The principal goal is to address the effect of formal workplace representation on strikes, distinguishing in the first instance between works councils on the one hand and broadly equivalent trade union based entities on the other. The role of unionism is also central to this inquiry, not only with respect to the degree to which workplace representation is union dominated but also and more familiarly perhaps through workplace union density and the level at which collective bargaining is conducted. Attention is also paid to the quality of industrial relations, as reflected in dissonance, namely divergent assessments of managers and employee workplace representatives as to the state of industrial relations. Although country effects do matter, it is reported that works councils are associated with reduced strike activity. However, any such effect is sensitive in particular to the union status of work councilors and time. There is also some indication that collective bargaining at levels higher than the company can exacerbate strike activity but this effect does not persist, possibly because of decentralization and the development of hybrid bargaining structures. For its part, good industrial relations appears key to strike reduction, independent of workplace representation.
J52|How Asymmetrically Increasing Joint Strike Costs Need Not Lead to Fewer Strikes|Abstract The joint costs model states that increasing union and firm strike costs lead to fewer strikes. This paper shows that strike incidence need not decrease when joint strike costs increase. The innovation is to raise union and firm joint strike costs in an asymmetric way. The results indicate that increasing either party’s strike costs can have ambiguous effects on strike incidence. This ambiguity explains why higher strike costs need not always lead to fewer strikes, and thus accounts for the mixed success observed in studies that empirically test the joint costs model with strike incidence data.
J52|Workplace Employee Representation and Industrial Relations Performance: New Evidence from the 2013 European Company Survey|Using cross-country data from the European Company Survey, we investigate the relationship between workplace employee representation and management perceptions of the climate of industrial relations, sickness/absenteeism, employee motivation, and staff retention. For a considerably reduced subset of the data, a fifth indicator – strike activity – is also considered alongside the other behavioral outcomes. From one perspective, the expression of collective voice through works council-type entities may be construed as largely beneficial, especially when compared with their counterpart union agencies either operating alone or in a dominant position. However, if heightened distributional struggles explain these differential outcomes in workplace employee representation, it should not go unremarked that the influence of formal collective bargaining is seemingly positive.
J52|The German Model of Industrial Relations: (Where) Does It Still Exist?|Using data from the representative IAB Establishment Panel, this paper charts changes in the two main pillars of the German IR model over the last 20 years. It shows that collective bargaining coverage and worker representation via works councils have substantially fallen outside the public sector. Less formalized and weaker institutions such as voluntary orientation of uncovered firms towards sectoral agreements and alternative forms of employee representation at the work-place have partly attenuated the overall erosion in coverage. Multivariate analyses indicate that the traditional German IR model (with both collective agreements and works councils) is more likely found in larger and older plants, and it is less likely in plants managed by the owner, in single and foreign-owned plants, in individually-owned firms or partnerships, and in exporting plants. In contrast, more than 60 % of German plants did not exhibit bargaining coverage or orientation or any kind of worker representation in 2015. Such an absence of the main institutional features of the German IR model is mainly found in small and medium-sized plants, in particular in the service sector and in eastern Germany, and its extent is increasing dramatically.
J52|Revisiting Interregional Wage Differentials: New Evidence from Spain with Matched Employer-Employee Data|This study examines wage differences across Spain's regions along the entire wage distribution based on matched employer-employee microdata from 2006 to 2014. Unlike previous studies, we control for differences in regional purchasing power parities, which are very large in practice. Although many of the raw wage differences observed are explained by differences between regional productive structures and, to a lesser extent, in labour forces, noteworthy regional differences net of composition effects remain after controlling for a broad set of individual and firm characteristics. Unexplained wage differences are generally very similar throughout the wage distribution and are strongly persistent over time, despite significant changes in both economic cycle and labour regulations that occurred in Spain during the examined period. This evidence suggests the presence of common mechanisms in the generation of regional wage differentials that affect the whole labour force and that are strongly persistent over time, which is consistent with a key role of collective bargaining
J52|Foreign Ownership and Intra-Firm Union Density in Germany|From a theoretical viewpoint the relationship between foreign ownership and unionization is ambiguous. On the one hand, foreign owners have better opportunities to undermine workers' unionization. On the other hand, workers of foreign-owned firms have an increased demand for the protection provided by unions. Which of the two opposing influences dominates can vary according to moderating circumstances. This study shows that firm size and industry-level bargaining play a moderating role. The relationship between foreign ownership and unionization is negative in larger firms whereas it is positive in smaller firms. Coverage by industry-level collective bargaining makes a positive relationship both stronger and more likely.
J52|The Twin Track Model of Employee Voice: An Anglo-American Perspective on Union Decline and the Rise of Alternative Forms of Voice|We present a simple framework for analyzing decline in union voice in the Anglo-American world and its replacement by non-union, often direct, forms of worker voice. We argue that it is a decline in the in-flow to unionisation among employers and workers, rather than an increase in the outflow rate, that accounts for this decline. We show how union decline is predicted by experience good and cost-disease models of trade unionism and is linked to specific institutional and policy constraints on union organizing in the Anglo-American world. We show how the co-existence of union and non-union forms of worker voice is predicted by transaction cost economics, while the growth in non-union forms of worker voice is aided by declining costs of employers ''making'' voice mechanisms. We draw on ''spurt'' theories of unionisation to help understand factors underpinning union decline, including falling costs of employer opposition to unionisation as density falls, as discuss possibilities for ''bottom-up'' growth in union-like forms of worker voice implied by ''spurt'' theories.
J52|Statutory Minimum Wages in the EU: Institutional Settings and Macroeconomic Implications|This paper analyses some macroeconomic implications of the statutory minimum wage in the member states of the European Union and assesses how its institutional design influences these outcomes. First, the paper looks at the institutional dimensions of statutory minimum wage setting. On the basis of this information, an indicator of institutional stringency is built to characterise the degree of predictability of minimum wage setting. Second, it explores the impact of minimum wage changes on employment, prices, consumption, and poverty.
J52|Social preferences, accountability, and wage bargaining|Abstract We experimentally test preferences for employment in a collective wage bargaining situation with heterogeneous workers. We vary the size of the union and introduce a treatment mechanism transforming the voting game into an individual allocation task. Our results show that highly productive workers do not take employment of low productive workers into account when making wage proposals, regardless of whether only union members determine the wage or all workers. The level of pro-social preferences is small in the voting game, but it increases if the game becomes an individual allocation task. We interpret this as an accountability effect.
J52|A Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic Disequilibrium model for business cycle analysis|A Dynamic Stochastic Disequilibrium (DSDE) model is proposed for business cycle analysis. Unemployment arises from job rationing due to insucient aggregate spending. The nominal wage is taken as a policy variable subject to a collective Nash bargaining process between workers and rms with the state of the labor market a ecting the relative bargaining power. A precautionary saving motive arising from an uninsurable risk of permanent income loss implies an equilibrium relation between consumption, income and wealth. The DSDE model di ers from the corresponding Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model with labor market clearing in important respects: (i) Output is determined from the demand side and not from the supply side; (ii) The steady-state interest rate cannot be interpreted as a natural rate; (iii) It has to be smaller than the rate of economic growth in order for a steady state to exist; (iv) Determinacy of the solution requires the monetary policy response to in ation to be high (low) at low (high) steady-state interest rates; (v) Fighting in ation is stabilizing in the active monetary policy regime but destabilizing in the passive monetary policy regime; (vi) Macroeconomic responses to monetary policy and productivity shocks are similar to those of the DSGE model but give more weight to quantity adjustment and predict the real wage to increase with productivity.
J52|Jevons’s Ideal Role for Labor Unions as a Form of Co-operation|This research examines the ideas about labor unions found in William Stanley Jevons's works. I focus on the collaborative role Jevons envisioned for these organizations as part of a broader cooperative vision between workers and capitalists. Even though Jevons was not a supporter of labor unions and regarded them as monopolies with limited power to increase wages, on the one hand, and with great potential for generating dead losses of wages due strikes, on the other, he did not consider indispensable their elimination as long as they were guided to co-operate with business. This study concludes that there is more than one form of co-operation in Jevons’s thought. One explicit, from capitalist to workers, via profit sharing, and a second one, implicit, through the collaboration of workers to capitalists via their participation in labor organizations different than traditional labor unions. A major implication of this scheme is that both forms of co-operation have to be present for it to be beneficial for both classes. The latter, however, would not ensure that they are equally beneficiated.
J52|Inequality as Lack of Co-operation in Economic Thought|This study is about the notion of co-operation by economic thinkers of the 19th century in the United Kingdom. It presents a comparison and contrast of their ideas as well as an analysis of the relationship between co-operation and economic and social inequality. Two approaches of such relationship are identified. First, an economic-centered view, found in Charles Babbage and William Stanley Jevons, where the benefits of co-operation are linked to profit sharing, the increase of productivity and the expansion of the economic system. Second, Robert Owen’s and John Stuart Mill’s ideas on co-operation, even though with different implications, are mainly socially-oriented. Here, it is possible to see a broader social concern that led them to suggest reforms that could have implications in terms of social (e.g., education and gender), and not only economic inequality. Marx’s analysis of co-operation does not belong to any of these approaches. In his view, under capitalism, the effect of some forms of co-operation may generate or reinforce inequality.
J52|Labour market and collective bargaining in Iceland: sharing the spoils without spoiling the shares|Iceland has high living standards, low poverty, high inclusiveness and one of the most sustainable pension systems. It is the most highly unionised country in the OECD and, in the past, successful social pacts have protected the lowest paid workers during crises, and on occasion helped fight inflation. Nevertheless, Iceland experiences recurrent bursts of social tensions and labour unrest that often result in large wage awards, particularly in times of economic boom. Iceland is prone to accentuated economic cycles, and the pro-cyclical nature of collective bargaining aggravates these harmful dynamics. Social partners often have disagreements over what has been agreed in the past and they can have differing views on the state of the economy. Trust among the social partners has been undermined and wage co-ordination is low. There is a large number of unions, many of them very small, and wage demands are often not consistent with macroeconomic stability. Labour unrest frequently originates in the public sector as wages lag behind the private sector. Fostering trust and increasing wage co-ordination would make collective bargaining more effective and help sustain the benefits of the system for future generations. A technical committee should be established to provide reliable and impartial information to wage negotiators. Wage negotiations could start with “wage guidelines” issued by the major labour and employer confederations. State mediator should have greater powers in order to improve wage co-ordination and support the “wage guidelines”. This working paper relates to the 2017 OECD Economic Survey of Iceland (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-iceland.htm).
J52|Decentralized Bargaining and the Greek Labour Relations Reform (Law 4024/2011)|We investigate decentralized collective bargaining in Greece (2002-2016) under the industrial relations reform implemented in 2011. We match administrative data on firm-level contracts with non-participating firms to estimate determinants of decentralized bargaining before and after the reform. Decentralized bargaining increased in the post-reform period depending on firm size, industry and location. Nominal wage floors downgraded after 2011 in contacts signed by association of persons rather than trade unions. A base wage premium of 22 percent is found in favour of trade unions. Firm-level bargaining with trade unions is expected to promote decentralized bargaining with outcomes linked to firm-specific characteristics.

J52|Upward Nominal Wage Rigidity|In Portugal, as in many other countries in continental Europe, the collective wage agreements between trade unions and employer associations that define wage floors for specific job titles are systematically extended to the whole industry. This means that many firms are obliged to increase the wages of their workforce in order to comply with the newly-agreed bargained wages. With some trepidation, we call this phenomenon upward nominal wage rigidity, in close symmetry with the Keynesian notion of downward nominal wage rigidity. In this paper we provide evidence that firms that are more heavily affected by the change in the bargained wage floors decrease their hiring rates and, more importantly, significantly increase their separation rates. As a complement to our analysis, we suggest the estimation of a measure that attempts to disentangle the strength of internal and external wage conditions. Based on this measure we show that firms whose wages are more influenced by external wages exhibit much lower net job creation rates.
J52|The Twin Track Model of Employee Voice: An Anglo-American Perspective on Union Decline and the Rise of Alternative Forms of Voice|"We present a simple framework for analyzing decline in union voice in the Anglo-American world and its replacement by non-union, often direct, forms of worker voice. We argue that it is a decline in the in-flow to unionisation among employers and workers, rather than an increase in the outflow rate, that accounts for this decline. We show how union decline is predicted by experience good and cost-disease models of trade unionism and is linked to specific institutional and policy constraints on union organizing in the Anglo-American world. We show how the coexistence of union and non-union forms of worker voice is predicted by transaction cost economics, while the growth in non-union forms of worker voice is aided by declining costs of employers ""making"" voice mechanisms. We draw on ""spurt"" theories of unionisation to help understand factors underpinning union decline, including falling costs of employer opposition to unionisation as density falls, as discuss possibilities for ""bottom-up"" growth in union-like forms of worker voice implied by ""spurt"" theories."
J52|Foreign Ownership and Intra-Firm Union Density in Germany|From a theoretical viewpoint the relationship between foreign ownership and unionization is ambiguous. On the one hand, foreign owners have better opportunities to undermine workers' unionization. On the other hand, workers of foreign-owned firms have an increased demand for the protection provided by unions. Which of the two opposing influences dominates can vary according to moderating circumstances. This study shows that firm size and industry-level bargaining play a moderating role. The relationship between foreign ownership and unionization is negative in larger firms whereas it is positive in smaller firms. Coverage by industry-level collective bargaining makes a positive relationship both stronger and more likely.
J52|Regional Purchasing Groups and Hospital Medicine Prices: Evidence from Group Creations|This paper estimates the impact of group purchasing on medicine prices in French hospitals, taking advantage of the entry of hospitals into regional purchasing groups between 2009 and 2014. This paper uses a new database providing the average annual prices paid for all innovative and costly medicines in public hospitals. Using a fixed effects model that controls for hospitals' medicine-specific bargaining abilities and medicine-specific price trends, I find that group purchasing reduces prices of medicines in oligopoly markets, but has no impact on the prices of medicines with no competitors.
J52|Sources of the Union Wage Gap: Results from High-Dimensional Fixed Effects Regression Models|We estimate the impact of union density on wages using matched employer-employee contract data for Portugal. We extend omitted variable bias decomposition procedure of Gelbach (2016) to obtain the contribution of worker, firm, and job-title heterogeneity to the union wage premium. The principal result is the dominance of the allocation or workers among firms with different wage policies. The unobserved skills of union workers have a modest impact on wages; unions do not place their members into higher job-titles along the job career hierarchy; the wage cushion enables firms to partially undo the bargained wage; and, while fringes matter, matching does not.
J52|Discoordination and miscoordination caused by sunspots in the laboratory|This paper combines two strands of the experimental sunspot literature. It extends the rare literature that focuses experimentally on the coordination problems caused by sunspot variables. It also extends the literature that focuses on coordination games that have a payoff-dominant and a divergent risk-dominant equilibrium. To achieve this, we use a repeated three-player stag hunt game with fixed groups. In our experiment, a sunspot variable points randomly at the risk-dominant or the payoff-dominant choice. We find out-of-equilibrium behavior (discoordination) caused by the sunspot variable in the short run. In the long run, the sunspot variable can lead to coordination of the payoff-dominated equilibrium (miscoordination). If the sunspot-generating process points more frequently to the risk-dominant choice, some groups converge to the sunspot equilibrium.
J52|Productivity and distribution effects of codetermination in an efficient bargaining|Codetermination can be regarded as an extreme regulatory intervention of the legislator in the labor market which might affect the efficiency of production and the bargaining power of labor. Based on a model that covers both efficient bargaining and employment bargaining a simple equation is derived that is suited to empirical testing. The empirical test is based on German data and includes years before and after the extension of German codetermination law in 1976. The estimates determine the productivity of labor and relative bargaining power of capital and labor. It turns out that codetermination does not affect productivity, but leads to a significant increase in workers' bargaining power and the distribution of rents.
J52|The impact of trade shocks on collective wage bargaining agreements|We study the impact of international trade on firm-level wage bargaining using a unique administrative firm-level dataset for French manufacturing. Exports have a positive effect on the probability of signing firm-level wage agreements, while offshoring has no significant effect. Results are consistent with the predictions of rent-sharing models of the export wage-premium.
J52|Drivers and effects of labour market reforms: Evidence from a novel policy compendium|Abstract The paper analyses the determinants and short-term effects of labour market reforms, using information from a novel policy compendium that covers 110 developed and developing economies between 2008 and 2014. We find that the approval of reforms is positively associated with the unemployment rate, the simultaneous implementation of fiscal consolidation measures and the presence of a fixed exchange rate regime. Differences in the results are explored by looking at the direction of reforms (i.e. increasing or decreasing legislation), temporal horizon (i.e. temporary or permanent measures) and coverage (i.e. complete or two-tier reforms); while also analysing separately reforms’ determinants across domains of labour legislation (e.g. permanent contracts, collective dismissals). Finally, we find that deregulatory labour market reforms tend to increase the unemployment rate in the short run when they are approved during contractionary periods—while they have a non-significant effect when approved during periods of economic stability or expansion.

J52|Collective bargaining systems and macroeconomic and microeconomic flexibility: the quest for appropriate institutional forms in advanced economies|Abstract This paper addresses the design of the machinery of collective bargaining from the perspective of microeconomic and macroeconomic flexibility. In the former context, somewhat greater attention is given over to enterprise flexibility than external adjustment. In the latter context, close attention is also paid to changes in collective bargaining along the dimensions of bargaining coverage, structure, and coordination. Support is adduced for the German, contemporary Scandinavian, and British models. The role of trust in securing micro and macro flexibility also receives attention, suggesting that the polder or Dutch model might also be expected to populate the firmament of fit-for-purpose collective bargaining arrangements.

J52|The 2011 Industrial Relations Reform and Nominal Wage Adjustments in Greece|Abstract This study investigates nominal contractual base-wage adjustments in Greece associated with the 2011 industrial relations reform which re-defined the limits within which base wages could oscillate and allowed workers’ associations to negotiate for wages at the firm level. The assessment covers the period 2010–2013 and is based on information extracted from the universe of firm-level contracts signed in this period. We found that firm-level contracts increased dramatically shortly after the reform, now covering a larger pool of workers, especially in larger firms, and are associated with higher base-wage reductions in the post-reform period. At the firm level, wage reductions are higher when workers are represented by a workers’ association rather than a typical trade union. In addition, a heterogeneous effect is uncovered regarding the factors that shape base-wage adjustments (firm size, profitability, structure of bargaining body and aggregate unemployment) between new and traditional forms of workers’ representation in collective bargaining.
J52|Institutions, regulatory framework and labour market outcomes in Nigeria|Abstract This paper examines the impact of two major pronounced institutional and regulatory measures, minimum wage and labour union, on labour market outcomes in Nigeria with particular focus on aggregate employment and unemployment, as well as sectoral employment and wage effects. The effect of minimum wage is captured using aggregate and sectoral Kaizt-type minimum wage index, while that of labour union is measured by union density. Static and dynamic analytical methods involving cointegration and error correction model techniques are used on annual data from 1970 to 2012. Results show that minimum wage has positive relationship with unemployment and negative relationship with aggregate employment. Similarly, union density has positive effect on unemployment. The effects of minimum wage and union density on employment and wages across sectors are mixed. It is argued that design and implementation of institutional and regulatory framework need caution, as they may yield unintended results.

J52|Employment Protection Reform, Enforcement in Collective Agreements and Worker Flows|Differential enforcement of employment protection by explicit design of the legislation, for example through exemptions for small firms, has been exploited in a growing body of research. However, little is known about the effects of differential enforcement that is not defined by the letter of the law, presumably due to the lack of data. Our study incorporates aspects of both types of differential enforcement as we combine the evaluation of a partial reform with information on the more difficult-to-observe enforcement of the same reform in collective agreements. We analyse a reform of notice periods for employer-initiated separations in Sweden, which reduced the notice periods for newly hired older workers substantially but implied minor or no changes in the notices for younger workers. The reform was initiated at different times depending on collective agreement. These circumstances provide ample opportunity for the identification of its effects. Our findings indicate heterogeneous effects across collective agreements. Despite differences in terms of dynamics and size, a positive effect on hirings is found for all agreements. In most cases, our results also show an increase in separations, indicating an increase in employment turnover. A salient feature of the results is that the estimated effects increase with the treatment dose, i.e., the size of the reduction in notice periods across different age groups.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J52|Flexibility of new hires’ earnings in Ireland|The rigidity of the net present value of wages for newly hired workers from unemployment is one of the key ingredients to generate realistic volatility of (un)employment in standard search and matching models. With Nash bargaining or if wage contracts are long-term, this net present value is affected by wages of new hires. Yet data on wages of new hires are rare and, in the few papers that distinguish between new hires from unemployment and job changers, the findings vary. For the U.S., two influential papers reach the opposite conclusions, and the findings for the few European countries are mixed. We combine administrative tax data on earnings with the Household Finance and Consumption Survey for Ireland and find that earnings of new hires from non-employment are substantially more flexible compared to earnings of incumbent workers or job changers. The findings are robust. Earnings of new hires from non-employment are more procyclical for workers with less valuable outside options.
J52|Sick pay reforms and health status in a unionised labour market|We theoretically analyse the effects of sick pay and employees’ health on collective bargaining, assuming that individuals determine absence optimally. If sick pay is set by the government and not paid for by firms, it induces the trade union to lower wages. This mitigates the positive impact on absence. Moreover, a union may oppose higher sick pay if it reduces labour supply sufficiently. Better employee health tends to foster wage demands. If the union determines both wages and sick pay, we identify situations in which it will substitute wages for sick pay because adverse absence effects can be mitigated.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J52|No Extension Without Representation? Evidence from a Natural Experiment in Collective Bargaining|In many countries, notably across Europe, collective bargaining coverage is enhanced by government-issued extensions that widen the reach of collective agreements beyond their signatory parties to all firms and workers in the same sector. This paper analyses the causal impact of such extensions on employment using a natural experiment in Portugal: the immediate suspension by the government that took office in 21 June 2011 of the (until then) nearly automatic extensions. The combination of this suspension and the time needed for processing the extension applications resulted in a sharp and unanticipated decline in the extension probability of agreements signed several months earlier, around 1 March 2011. Our results, based on a regression discontinuity design and matched employer-employee-agreement panel data, suggest that extensions had a negative impact on employment growth. Moreover, the effects tend to be concentrated amongst non-affiliated firms. The lack of representativeness of employer associations is a potentially important factor behind the adverse effect of extensions. Another is the role of retro-activity in combination with the administrative delay in processing extensions. This is particularly relevant in the context of a recession.
J52|La influencia de la iglesia y la prensa en el movimiento obrero de Popayán: 1900- 1950|En 1900 Popayán había perdido el empuje que la había caracterizado como centro económico del occidente del país el siglo anterior, esta desaceleración económica vino acompañada de otras particularidades como su afinidad con el partido conservador y la iglesia, lo cual ayudó a configurar un movimiento obrero especial, de poco alcance y visibilidad nacional, y muy ligado a corrientes políticas. El objetivo del presente texto es determinar la conexión de la iglesia y la prensa en la configuración del movimiento obrero en Popayán. El periodo de análisis es la primera mitad del siglo XX, no sólo por acotar el tema, sino también porque es un periodo pionero en cuestión sindical.
J52|Institutional conditioning of the German labour market in the face of the global economic crisis 2008–2009|Aim: The scientific objective of this study is an attempt to clarify the institutional aspects of the functioning of the labour market in Germany that are relevant to the response to the global economic crisis of 2008–2009. Motivation: The reaction of German labour market was totally different than during previous recessions and the explanation of the sources of this response constitutes the main motivation to undertake this study. The considerations rely on the thesis that it could be attributed to the institutional infrastructure combined with clever economic policy of the state and responsible behaviour of social partners. The economic theory suggests how an isolated institution functions, but in the real world they works in the whole institutional network. Therefore the broader context and some linkages are mentioned. Results: After a brief review of the main macroeconomic indicators and selected labour market institutions in Germany in comparison to the OECD countries, the labour market reforms undertaken in the period between 2002 and 2007 will be discussed. Then, selected on the basis of literature studies, institutional buffers of the labour market mitigating shocks are examined with particular emphasis on the instruments of internal flexibility, social partners’ behaviour and institutional connections of labour markets with other domains of economic order. The elements of institutional framework are subject to qualitative analysis backed up by available official statistical data.

J52|Crony Capitalism and the Targeting of Violence: Labor Repression During Argentina's Last Dictatorship|Well-known dictatorships have justified massive human rights violations on the grounds that they were aimed at attacking crony capitalism (governance based on favoring firms that are connected to the regime). So far, however, there is no systematic study examining whether this justification should be believed. We address this gap in the literature in the context of one of the best-known episodes of human rights violations in modern history, the repression following the coup in Argentina on March 24, 1976. Specifically, we examine the logic driving the choice of firm level union representatives who were subjected to violence following the coup. Using an original dataset assembled and digitized by us, we find that political, business and social connections to the regime are associated with an increase of 2 to 3 times in the number of firm level union representatives arrested and/or disappeared. This is the case even after controlling for a battery of firms' characteristics that capture alternative explanations for the targeting of violence. The effect is particularly pronounced in privately owned (as opposed to state-owned) firms, suggesting that the correlation is driven by cronyism for financial gain rather than ideology or information transmission. We also show that connected firms benefited from violence against union representatives by subsequently having less strikes and a higher market valuation. Our findings highlight the pervasiveness of ties to the government, even in cases where one of the main stated goals of the regime is to curb cronyism.
J52|Linking Cooperative Health Insurance Service Characteristics to Expatriates’ Satisfaction: Mediating Role of Customer Knowledge|Extant empirical research has established a significant and positive relationship between cooperative health insurance (CHI) service characteristics and expatriates’ satisfaction. The present study investigated the psychological mechanism underlying these relationships by incorporating customer knowledge as a mediating variable. A self-report survey-based was used to collect data from 384 expatriates employed by both service and manufacturing organizations located in five main regions of Saudi Arabia, representing Central region, the Eastern region, the Western region, the Northern region and the Southern region. Using partial least squares structural equation modeling, we found a significant positive relationship between availability of CHI service is positively related to expatriates’ satisfaction. Similarly, the results indicated that perceived service quality of CHI had a significant positive relationship with expatriates’ satisfaction. As expected, customer knowledge was found to mediate the relationship between availability of CHI service and expatriates’ satisfaction. In addition, we also found customer knowledge to be a significant mediating variable between perceived service quality of CHI and expatriates’ satisfaction. Implications of the study in the Saudi Arabian context have been discussed.
J52|Endogenous labour market imperfection, foreign direct investment and external terms-of-trade shocks in a developing economy|This theoretical paper shows that developing countries possess an inherent shock-absorbing mechanism that stems from their peculiar institutional characteristics and can lessen the gravity of detrimental welfare consequence of international terms-of-trade disturbances in terms of a static two-sector, full-employment general equilibrium model with endogenous labour market distortion. The supply of foreign capital in the economy is a positive function of the return to capital. Subsequently, it has been verbally explained why the main result of the full-employment model would remain valid even in a two-sector specific-factor Harris-Todaro type model with urban unemployment. The analysis leads to a couple of important policies that should be adhered to preserve this in-built system. Finally, it offers three important statistically testable hypotheses which would pave the way for future empirical research in this area.
J52|Does public transit reduce car travel externalities? Quasi-natural experiments' evidence from transit strikes|One of the unanswered questions in the field of urban economics is to which extent subsidies to public transit are justified. We examine one of the main benefits of public transit, a reduction in car congestion externalities, the so-called congestion relief benefit, using quasi-natural experimental data on citywide public transit strikes for Rotterdam, a city with mild congestion levels. On weekdays, a strike induces travel times to increase only marginally on the highway ring road (0.017min/km) but substantially on inner city roads (0.224min/km). During rush hour, the strike effect is much more pronounced. The congestion relief benefit of public transit is substantial, equivalent to about 80% of the public transit subsidy. We demonstrate that during weekends, travel time does not change noticeably due to strikes. Furthermore, we show that public transit strikes induce similar increases in number of cyclists as number of car travelers suggesting that bicycling-promoting policies to reduce car congestion externalities might be attractive in combination with first-best congestion pricing.

J52|How Do Labor Representatives Affect Incentive Orientation of Executive Compensation?|Contrary to previous literature we hypothesize that labor's interest may well – like that of shareholders – aim at securing the long-run survival of the firm. Consequently, employee representatives on the supervisory board could well have an interest in increasing incentive-based compensation to avoid management's excessive risk taking and short-run oriented decisions. We compile unique panel data on executive compensation over the periods 2006 to 2011 for 405 listed companies and use a Hausman-Taylor approach to estimate the effect of codetermination on the compensation design. Finally, codetermination has a significantly positive effect on performance-based components of compensation, which supports our hypothesis.

J52|Does Less Wage Compression Lead to Less Training in Germany? An Expansion of Acemoglu and Pischke's Model of Training in Imperfect Labor Markets|We expand Acemoglu and Pischke's seminal model of training in imperfect labor markets by including the system of collective wage bargaining and the components of firms' training costs. Thus we can adapt their model to institutional changes that occurred since the 1990s. The model and the empirical developments we present show that firms compensate lower returns of apprenticeship training by changing training procedures towards more training at the work place and thus by decreasing net training costs. Therefore, more decentralized wage bargaining does not result in a reduction of firms' supply of training positions.
J52|A Sequential Decomposition of the Drop in Collective Bargaining Coverage|Union representation has been in strong decline in most OECD countries with potentially important consequences for wages. What drives this decline? We try to answer this question by developing and implementing a detailed Fairlie decomposition approach. Using linked employer-employee data from the German Structure of Earnings Survey for 2001 and 2006, we document a sharp drop in collective bargaining coverage that amounts to 17 percentage points for males and 20 percentage points for females in West, and 8 and 14 percentage points, respectively, in East Germany. We find that neither changes in the characteristics nor changes in the coefficients associated with the characteristics as a whole provide an explanation for the drop in collective bargaining coverage. The drop in coverage is the result of an unexplained time trend.
J52|The Gender Pay Gap in Italy: Some Evidence on the Role of Decentralized Collective Bargaining /La brecha salarial de género en Italia: Algunas evidencias sobre el papel de la negociación colectiva descentralizada|This paper aims to contribute to the existing literature on Gender Pay Gap (GPG), by using data collected by ISTAT with the Structural Earnings Survey (SES) for 2002, 2006 and 2010. The analysis focuses on the source of this wage gap in 2010, pointing out the role of bonuses related to performance in shaping gender gap in earnings. The analysis is carried out in three steps. After having assessed the existence of GPG in the Italian labour market with a descriptive analysis, the contribution of individual characteristics and institutional features (including decentralized collective bargaining at enterprise level) are pointed out over time. The analysis proceeds by isolating the subset of employees receiving performance pay (PP) in order to assess the role of PP in the gender gap in earnings. The analysis ends by pointing out the contribution of individual, job and firm characteristics to the probability of receiving PP. Can decentralized collective bargaining be considered as an element to promote an equal distribution of wages? Is PP the component of wage that gives the highest return on human capital? Este trabajo trata de contribuir a la literatura existente sobre la brecha salarial de género mediante el uso de los datos recogidos por el ISTAT con la Encuesta de Ingresos Estructural (SES) por los años 2002, 2006 y 2010. En la primera parte, se evalúa la existencia de GPG en el mercado de trabajo italiano con un análisis descriptivo a lo largo de los años 2002-201 subrayando el papel desarrollado tanto por las características individuales como por las características institucionales del mercado laboral y de l economía (incluyendo la negociación colectiva descentralizada a nivel de empresa). En la segunda el análisis evaluando el papel del PPD en la diferencia salarial de género. El trabajo se concluye destacando la influencia en la probabilidad de recibir PPD relacionada con las características individuales, profesionales y de las empresas. ¿La negociación colectiva descentralizada, puede ser considerada un elemento para promover una distribución equitativa de los salarios?. ¿Es el PPD el componente del salario que le da más alto rendimiento al capital humano?.
J52|Employment and Skills in Finland|Employment fosters equity and economic inclusiveness because those out of work face the highest risk of poverty, and it generates the tax receipts on which the social safety net depends. Further enhancing education and life-long learning would lower hurdles to employment, which are high for the low-skilled. Policies to speed up tertiary graduation, improve work incentives and activation of the unemployed and postpone labour market exit are necessary to bring the employment rate closer to the level of other Nordics. Easing employment regulations and allowing more flexible wage setting would increase both employment and productivity. This working paper relates to the 2016 OECD Economic Survey of Finland (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-finland.htm). Emploi et Compétences en Finlande L’emploi est facteur d’équité et d’inclusion économique car ceux qui en sont exclus sont les plus exposés au risque de pauvreté ; il est également générateur de recettes dont dépend le financement du filet de protection sociale. De nouvelles mesures en faveur de l’éducation et de la formation tout au long de la vie permettraient d’abaisser les obstacles à l’emploi, plus difficiles à surmonter pour les moins qualifiés. Il faut mettre en place des mesures pour accélérer les délais d’obtention des diplômes dans l’enseignement supérieur, améliorer les incitations à travailler et l’activation des chômeurs et retarder la sortie du marché du travail pour rapprocher les taux d’emploi avec ceux des autres pays nordiques. Enfin, l’assouplissement de la législation sur l’emploi et la mise en place de procédures plus souples de fixation des salaires devraient permettre des gains en termes à la fois d’emplois et de productivité.

J52|Conflict Management|The conflict may have a dysfunctional character, with serious repercussions on the results andthe organizational climate including the professional satisfaction, but viewed from the perspectiveof strategies that contribute to better knowledge of the needs of employees and the factor thatfavors evolution, organizational development, it becomes functionally with positive impact on theOrganization's staff and results. The objective of this paper is to highlight the root causes of conflict in organizations and topresent the optimal methods to solve them. Conflicting statuses can be caused by dissatisfaction with the way the Division of duties,perceptions and misinterpretations, the absence of open and honest communication, interpersonalrelations. It is advisable to tackle conflicts as part of organizational life. It is necessary to be aware thatan employee brings with itself at different work values, and strategies of the individual workingunder these conditions conflict opportunities are numerous.
J52|Trades unions, real wages and full employment|A core proposition of Keynes’s General Theory is that money wages do not determine real wages or employment at the aggregate level in a closed economy. What then is the macroeconomic role of trades unions in the determination of real wages and employment? What are the mechanisms through which bargaining power takes effect? The paper argues that trades unions play important roles in countering employer monopsony as well as in determining the non-wage terms and conditions of employment and the incidence of risk between capital and labour. In the former role, it is the money wage that is relevant, while the latter role is a factor in the determination of aggregate real income and profit, yet the aggregate real wage itself and the wage share are residuals. Trades unions have the potential to support the promotion of full employment with price stability as part of a policy of demand management through the adoption of co-ordinated wage bargaining institutions.
J52|Syndicalisme Québécois Face à l'Enjeu des Partenariats Public-Prive : Le Cas de la Sous-traitance<BR>[Unionism Quebecers Facing the Public-Private Partnerships: The Case of Outsourcing]|Recent developments in labor relations in Quebec inclined several controversies. The public sector has undergone major changes and has had to adapt and reposition. Like the private sector, subcontracting is normalized with the progress of the neoliberal discourse in public space. This article compares the existing literature between public-private partnerships and outsourcing, trying to prove potential links. A theoretical design is appropriate to support the thesis of reconfiguration of labor markets. The article shows that outsourcing in the public sector is simply a pledge of confusion and inconsistency. Far from achieving its objectives, it has served a factor of tension and conflict between the Quebec government and the unions.
J52|The Efficacy of Hybrid Collective Bargaining Systems: An Analysis of the Impact of Collective Bargaining on Company Performance in Europe|Individual and company bargaining has increasingly supplanted sector and country collective bargaining leading to increasingly perforated and multi-layered national collective bargaining systems. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive categorization of bargaining and argue that both the bargaining level and the degree of integrative interaction between bargaining units matters for efficacy. This idea is tested using representative company level data for the European Union. We find that the efficacy of coordinated sector and multi-level systems is higher than for all other forms of bargaining. Policy implications are discussed as these results challenge current attempts to reform collective bargaining in Europe.
J52|Analysis of Contracts in Various Formats of Blockchain|One of the important features of Blockchain is that it allows the hosting and execution of contracts. Such a contract in the digital world is known as a Smart Contract. But the process and consequences of a contract vary radically from one format of Blockchain to another. One of the formats (and the most common at present) is the Unregulated Blockchain (like Bitcoin and Ethereum) with no government supervision whatsoever. Another format is the Controlled Blockchain which is managed and guaranteed by the Government. It is this difference that is vital in understanding the impacts and consequences of entering into and abiding by Smart Contracts. Firstly, the concept of cryptocurrencies (also referred to as cryptocoins in this paper) is explained. Then the concept of Regulated and Sovereign Backed Cryptocurrencies (RSBCs) is discussed. Later on, I explain how contracts vary between the two Blockchain formats. Finally, the paper concludes as to how smart contracts can be best executed and on which format of Blockchain.

The essay focuses on Mueller-Jentsch’s concept of Konfliktpartnerschaft (conflictual partnership), conceived to characterise the current state of industrial relations under the “German model”, against the background of their history since the beginning of the twentieth century.)
J52|Die neue Konfliktformation. Klassen-Kaempfe in fragmentierten Arbeitsbeziehungen (The new conflict formation: Class conflicts in the age of fragmented labour relations)|Der Beitrag setzt sich mit Walther Mueller-Jentschs Soziologie industrieller Beziehungen auseinander. Er argumentiert, dass die Transformation des einstigen Sozialkapitalismus zwei Welten sozialer Regulation hervorgebracht hat, deren ‘Grenzregime’ zunehmend umkaempft ist. Es handelt sich, so die These, um Klassen- Auseinandersetzungen in fragmentierten Arbeitsbeziehungen. Bewegungen, die von der einen in die andere Regulationswelt fuehren, lassen sich, wie auch Wolfgang Streeck feststellt, mit dem Konzept der Konfliktpartnerschaft nicht mehr angemessen verstehen. Deshalb gehoert auf den Pruefstand, was in der Soziologie industrieller Beziehungen lange als gesichertes Wissen galt. (The paper discusses Walther Mueller-Jentsch’s sociology of industrial relations. He contends that the transformation of erstwhile social capitalism has produced two distinct worlds of regulation, the ‘border regime’ of which is increasingly contested. It argues that what we are witnessing are class conflicts in the context of fragmented labour relations. As Wolfgang Streeck also notes, the movements that stretch from one world of regulation to the other can no longer be adequately grasped by the concept of ‘conflict partnership’. We must therefore reconsider some of the ideas that have long been taken for granted in the sociology of industrial relations.)
J52|Interorganisationale Netzwerke und tarifpolitische Fragmentierung: Hebt Mehr-Arbeitgeber-Beschaeftigung die Tarifeinheit aus den Angeln? (Inter-organisational networks and the fragmentation of collective bargaining: Do multi-employer work arrangements undermine ‘Tarifeinheit’?)|Der Aufsatz stellt die Auswirkungen einer netzwerkfoermig reorganisierten Wertschoepfung auf das System der Tarifpolitik zur theoretischen und empirischen Diskussion. Im Vordergrund steht die These, nach der eine solche (Re-)Organisation interorganisational segmentierte Belegschaften schafft, und zwar auch in den traditionellen Kernzonen industrieller Wertschoepfung. Von diesem Prozess werden verschiedene Dimensionen des etablierten Tarifsystems beruehrt: (1) Im Hinblick auf die Kollektivakteure entstehen neuartige Vertretungsluecken und -konkurrenzen, (2) die Prozesse der Aushandlung sind aufgrund der Vervielfaeltigung der Verhandlungsbeziehungen von einem Auseinanderfallen von Regelfindung und -durchsetzung betroffen und (3) die Ergebnisse der Tarifpolitik verschieben sich neben der Absenkung von Verguetungen und der Entstehung tariflicher Parallelwelten in Richtung von Regelambiguitaet und Regelkonflikt. Fasst man diese Entwicklungen unter dem Oberbegriff tarifpolitischer Fragmentierung zusammen, wird deutlich, dass Tarifeinheit in ihren organisationsbezogenen Grundlagen herausgefordert wird, was netzwerkadaequate Handlungsoptionen der Sozialpartner jenseits etablierter Praktiken erforderlich werden laesst. (This article puts the networked form of value creation and its impact on the German collective bargaining system centre stage. Here, we are primarily concerned with the hypothesis that a network-based reorganisation of value creation creates interorganisationally segmented workforces, even within the traditional core of manufacturing. This process affects various dimensions of the established collective bargaining system: (1) With respect to the collective actors, new representation gaps and representational competition emerge, (2) negotiation processes are marked by a gap between rule definition and rule enforcement because of the multiplication of relationships, and (3) apart from wage reduction and parallel wage standards, collective bargaining outcomes move in the direction of rule ambiguity and rule conflict. Summarising these developments in wage-setting arrangements under the term ‘fragmentation”, it becomes obvious that the organisational foundations of ‘Tarifeinheit’ are challenged. This triggers a need for social partners to develop network-adequate responses beyond traditional practices in collective bargaining.)
J52|Konflikt ohne Partnerschaft? Arbeitsbeziehungen im Dienstleistungssektor (Conflicts without any kind of partnership? Industrial relations in the service sector)|Der Beitrag setzt sich mit der These von Wolfgang Streeck auseinander, nach der das Konzept der Konfliktpartnerschaft von Mueller-Jentsch an Erklaerungskraft verloren hat. Mit Blick auf den privaten Dienstleistungssektor wird hier argumentiert, dass der empirischen Diagnose von Streeck in weiten Teilen zuzustimmen ist. Mittelfristig ist mit der Herausbildung einer stabilen Konfliktpartnerschaft in diesem Bereich der Arbeitsbeziehungen nicht zu rechnen. Vielmehr gewinnen staatsnahe Akteure an Bedeutung. Das Konzept von Mueller-Jentsch bleibt aber relevant als analytischer Bezugsrahmen und begriffliche Heuristik, um Wandlungsprozesse zu untersuchen. (This contribution reflects on Wolfgang Streeck’s argument that the concept of ‘conflict partnership” developed by Walther Mueller-Jentsch has lost its descriptive and explanatory power today. With regards to the private service sector, I agree with Streeck that we won’t witness the evolution of a stable conflict partnership in the service sector for the next decades ahead. But this does not mean that the theoretical concept of ‘conflict partnership” is no longer relevant. It is still useful as a heuristic and analytical tool to analyse processes of transformation in the industrial relations system.)
J52|Konfliktpartnerschaft – still alive. Veraenderter Konfliktmodus in der verarbeitenden Industrie (Conflict partnership – still alive. The changed conflict mode in the manufacturing industry)|Die deutschen industriellen Beziehungen haben sich in den letzten drei Jahrzehnten strukturell in drei Welten der Arbeitsbeziehungen segmentiert. Zugleich hat sich der Konfliktmodus in der ersten Welt, die durch die exportorientierte Industrie gepraegt ist, stark modifiziert: Durch komplexe Systeme der feinjustierten Interessenverarbeitung ist der oeffentlich wahrnehmbare Grosskonflikt die Ausnahme geworden, dezentrale Konflikte sind dagegen der Regelfall. Mit Bezug auf das von Mueller-Jentsch pointierte Konzept der Konfliktpartnerschaft wird die These vertreten, dass auch mit diesem veraenderten Konfliktmodus weiterhin von einer Konfliktpartnerschaft, die ein spezifischer Modus der Sozialpartnerschaft ist, in der exportorientierten Industrie gesprochen werden koenne. (Over the last three decades, the German industrial relations have segmented into three worlds of labour relations. At the same time the conflict mode in the first world, which is dominated by the export-oriented industry, has changed. Due to the complex system of adjusted knowledge processing, big, publicly observable conflicts are rather the exception whereas decentralised conflict solutions are the rule. According to Mueller-Jentsch’s concept of conflict partnership it is argued here that despite the changed environment and conflict modes, the term conflict partnership is still an appropriate mode in the export-oriented economy.)
J52|Traditionelle und neue intermediaere Akteure in den Arbeitswelten hochqualifizierter Solo-Selbststaendiger (Traditional and new intermediary actors in the labor markets of the highly-skilled solo self-employed)|Auf dem Arbeitsmarkt laesst sich eine wachsende Anzahl hochqualifizierter Solo-Selbststaendiger beobachten, fuer die angenommen wird, dass sie ihre Arbeitsbedingungen individuell aushandeln. In jedem Fall zeichnet sich deren Verguetung durch eine vergleichsweise hohe Heterogenitaet aus. Gleichzeitig laesst sich eine Verschiebung im Gefuege kollektiver Interessenvertretungsorgane beobachten, die sich darin zeigt, dass neben Gewerkschaften neue intermediaere Akteure (z.B. Agenturen, Genossenschaften) relevant werden. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist das Ziel des vorliegenden Beitrags, die Rolle traditioneller und neuer intermediaerer Akteure in den Aushandlungen der Arbeitsbedingungen, wie der Verguetung, von hochqualifizierten Solo-Selbststaendigen zu eruieren. Die empirische Basis des Beitrags bildet eine qualitative Studie mit Solo-Selbststaendigen sowie Vertretern/innen von Gewerkschaften, Berufsverbaenden, Agenturen und Genossenschaften in den Branchen Filmwirtschaft, IT-Dienstleistungen und Medizin. In der Analyse der Interviews wird deutlich, dass die hochqualifizierten Solo-Selbststaendigen ihre Verguetung nicht per se individuell aushandeln. Vielmehr wird die Aushandlung von Arbeitsbedingungen durch traditionelle und neue intermediaere Akteure gepraegt, die Beratungsangebote fuer Solo-Selbststaendige bereithalten und die Entwicklung und Verbreitung von Standards foerdern. (Solo self-employed people in Germany represent a growing part of the flexible workforce in knowledge-intensive services with highly heterogeneous income situations. This article challenges the common assumption that their working conditions are negotiated individually by exploring the role of traditional intermediary actors (unions, professional associations) and new intermediary actors (staffing agencies, cooperatives) in pay determination. The empirical basis is a qualitative interview study of solo-self-employed and representatives of unions, professional associations, staffing agencies and cooperatives in film, IT and medicine. The analysis illuminates the contribution of traditional and new intermediary actors to individual negotiations, but also to the development and diffusion of collective standards.)
J52|Konfliktpartnerschaft und andere Spielarten industrieller Beziehungen (Conflict partnership and other species of industrial relations)|Die nachstehende Replik geht nach einer Praezisierung des Konzepts der Konfliktpartnerschaft auf die wesentlichen Kritikpunkte ein, die die Beitraeger zur Kontroverse Konfliktpartnerschaft erhoben haben. Sie greift deren Hinweise auf die Fragmentierung der deutschen industriellen Beziehungen in zwei bzw. drei Regulierungswelten auf und argumentiert, dass unbeschadet dessen die Konfliktpartnerschaft immer noch als das praegende Modell fuer die deutschen industriellen Beziehungen anzusehen sei, wenn auch fuer einen – im Vergleich zu frueheren Dekaden – eingeschraenkteren Bereich. (The following reply starts with a detailed definition of the concept of conflict partnership and addresses the main criticisms of the contributors about the controversy of this concept in former issues. It takes up their suggestions concerning the fragmentation of German industrial relations into two or three worlds of regulation. Finally, it argues that conflict partnership remains the constitutive model for German industrial relations, albeit for a more limited field compared to earlier decades.)

J52|La rigidez del coste laboral y el crecimiento del empleo en España|Este artículo pretende estudiar el efecto de la negociación colectiva sobre el empleo a través de una vía indirecta: la rigidez que provoca el mecanismo para fijar los salarios. La negociación colectiva es una de las causas principales de la rigidez salarial del mercado laboral en España. Se propone la construcción de un “índice de rigidez del coste laboral” que refleja la falta de ajuste entre las diferencias en la productividad y las diferencias del coste laboral, el cual se emplea posteriormente para estimar un modelo que explique las variaciones del empleo durante 1995-2014. Los resultados indican que la rigidez del coste laboral afecta de forma negativa y significativa al crecimiento del empleo.
J52|Recensión del artículo “What happened to collective bargaining during the Great Recession?”, publicado en IZA Journal of Labor Policy|En junio de 2016 apareció en el IZA Journal of Labor Policy el artículo “What happened to collective bargaining during the Great Recession?”, realizado por Jelle Visser. Este autor es un experto en temas relacionados con la negociación colectiva y los sistemas de relaciones industriales. De hecho, ha desarrollado una base de datos que permite el análisis de la evolución de dichos aspectos denominada “Institutional Characteristics of Trade Unions, Wage Setting, State Intervention and Social Pacts” (ICTWSS). Esta base de datos, en su versión 5.0 disponible desde agosto de 2015, cubre 38 países (los 34 miembros actuales de la OCDE más Bulgaria, Lituania, Letonia y Rumanía) y recoge información desde la década de 1960 hasta 2013/2014. El artículo utiliza información procedente de la misma, en particular variables sobre cobertura ajustada, extensión de regímenes, cláusulas de descuelgue, centralización y coordinación. La construcción de las variables y los datos se encuentran disponibles en el Amsterdam Insitute for Advanced Labour Studies (AIAS) (http://www.aias-uvanet.nl).
J52|Recensión del libro “Employment relations in an era of change. Multi-level challenges and responses in Europe”|Este libro, editado por Valeria Pulignano (KU Leuven), Holm-Detlev Köhler (Universidad de Oviedo) y Paul Stewart (Universidad de Strathclyde), y publicado en 2016 por ETUI (European Trade Union Institute), plantea un estudio de las relaciones entre trabajadores y empresarios y los mecanismos regulatorios y las instituciones, que están sufriendo un profundo cambio en las sociedades capitalistas contemporáneas (y, en particular, las europeas). Por un lado, la globalización ha creado inestabilidad a través de la competencia salarial, la descentralización de la negociación colectiva y la desregulación de las condiciones laborales, socavando las relaciones entre empresarios, sindicatos y el estado tanto en el ámbito nacional como en el sectorial. Por otro lado, al abrir el espacio a la transnacionalización, el proceso de integración europea ha aumentado la complejidad del mapa de las relaciones industriales. La reciente crisis económica ha revelado profundas fisuras dentro del proyecto europeo, con enormes implicaciones de desintegración para las relaciones laborales en Europa.
J52|Nuevas funciones de la negociación colectiva y alteración de su marco normativo|El sistema de negociación colectiva en España tiene características que contrastan con otros países: su universalidad, una baja afiliación y un alto grado de presión sindical en la fijación de los salarios. La alta cobertura de la negociación colectiva, generada por la regulación de dicho sistema, está íntimamente relacionada con estos factores. El objetivo del artículo es analizar la cobertura de la negociación colectiva en España, atendiendo especialmente a la legislación que la sustenta. Además, se pretende fundamentar las razones por las que dicha cobertura es tan alta y analizar el problema existente en torno a la medición de las tasas de cobertura. Para ello, se construye una tasa alternativa que tiene en cuenta los trabajadores excluidos del derecho a negociación colectiva usando datos de la Encuesta de Población Activa. Esto permitirá tener en cuenta algunos matices legislativos al establecer comparaciones internacionales o conclusiones sobre los efectos de la negociación colectiva en España.
J52|Análisis de las inaplicaciones de convenios tras la reforma laboral|La reforma laboral de 2012 incorporó un mecanismo sencillo para la inaplicación de un convenio colectivo, con el objetivo de que las empresas en crisis pudieran ajustar los costes salariales para evitar recortes más profundos en el empleo. Desde esa fecha, las inaplicaciones no han sido muy frecuentes en la práctica, situándose el porcentaje de trabajadores afectados por las mismas por debajo del 1% (con la excepción del año 2013, en que se elevó al 1,5%). El análisis de una muestra de 447 empresas que inaplicaron un convenio colectivo en el periodo 2012-2013, ha permitido observar cómo, tras el profundo deterioro de los ingresos de explotación, los resultados y la rentabilidad económica que tuvo lugar al inicio de la crisis, los tres indicadores mencionados se han ido recuperando ligeramente a partir de 2012, primer año en que las inaplicaciones fueron posibles. Lo mismo ha sucedido (con un año de retraso) con el nivel de empleo, aunque no con el coste laboral medio, que sólo ha comenzado a recuperarse en 2014. También se ha podido constatar que las empresas que inaplican presentan una elasticidad del empleo ante cambios en los salarios de -0,37.
J52|La crisis económica, las reformas laborales y la negociación colectiva|El objetivo principal del artículo es analizar si la crisis económica y las reformas laborales aprobadas a lo largo de la crisis han tenido alguna incidencia sobre la capacidad negociadora de los distintos interlocutores sociales. Para ello, se explica cómo las consecuencias de la crisis, no contrarrestadas por la recuperación económica que se produce desde mediados de 2013, han podido influir en la capacidad de los trabajadores y los sindicatos para negociar las condiciones de trabajo y salariales, dificultándolas, aparte de que la recuperación económica ha ido acompañada de una mayor precarización del empleo, lo que parece que va en la misma dirección de debilitar la posición de los trabajadores. Por otro lado, las reformas laborales aprobadas en los últimos años, como las que se producen en materia de despido y de modificación de las condiciones de trabajo y, sobre todo, en la regulación de la negociación colectiva, refuerzan las razones que van en el mismo sentido que la crisis económica de empeorar la posición de los trabajadores. Y ese debilitamiento de la negociación colectiva de los trabajadores tiene como consecuencia más relevante la devaluación salarial.
J52|Mediation In The Offences From The Special Laws|Changes in Romanian penal laws coming into force from 1st February 2014 brought an increasing number of offenses for which it is possible a penal mediation, including the offenses from the special laws (not included in the main Penal Code), for which the withdrawal of the advance complaint or the reconciliation of the parties removes the penal responsibility. These offences from the special laws are reviewed and detailed by the author with the mark of the removal mode of the penal responsibility, achieving a practical table for practitioners. Mediation procedure in the special laws crimes is similar into the general criminal mediation, but the application of the most favourable in time law may require special attention.
J52|Kodeks etyczny samorzadu zawodowego. Gwarancja bezpieczenstwa czy pulapka latwowiernosci?/Ethical Code of Professional Association. Security Guarantee or the Credulity Trap?|Representatives of business ethics examine the economic challenges of our time. They believe that in the use of ethics they are able to keep under control this sphere of human activity. Alas, this attempt meets the following obstacle. This ethical claim does not work as an objective criterion for measuring good vs evil as long as it is not supported by epistemological evidence (on its validity). Therefore business ethicists focus their attention on the codes of ethics which they see as the expected solution to the problem. A code of ethics is drawn up by an economic organisation which – in this way – declares its acceptance. Meanwhile, this declaration leads to the question of how to sift the ethical guarantees from empty promises? Can the social addressee of an ethical code trust its author? This doubt relates in particular to professional associations. Having a legal prerogative they are expected to recognize their fiduciary duty of loyalty to their social interlocutor. When they do not want to meet these obligations, they may use a code of ethics as a tool of manipulation. Under those circumstances, the code is something opposite to what is expected.
J52|The Spanish Productivity Puzzle in the Great Recession|While Spain has traditionally underperformed its European neighbors in terms of labor productivity, this trend reverses after 2007. Part of the explanation for this reversal is likely to be the direct impact of decreasing labor inputs relative to capital. Using a longitudinal sample of Spanish manufacturing and services companies between 1995 and 2012, we show that the recent increase in Spanish aggregate productivity is also driven by the behavior of firm-level total factor productivity (TFP), and by composition effects. By combining firm-level information on balance sheet items, collective agreements and imports/exports, we document that firm TFP is positively correlated to firm-specific collective agreements and access to external markets during the whole period. In addition, our estimates indicate that firm TFP was negatively correlated to the proportion of temporary workers during the expansionary period (1995-2007), but positively correlated during the crisis (2008-2012).
J52|Employment protection legislation and labor court activity in Spain|Labor courts may introduce a significant wedge between “legal” firing costs and “effective” (post-trial) firing costs. Apart from procedural costs, there is uncertainty over judges’ rulings, in particular over the likelihood of a “fair” dismissal ultimately being ruled as “unfair”, which may increase firing costs significantly. In 2010 and 2012, reforms of Employment Protection Legislation widened the definition of fair economic dismissals in Spain. In this paper we look at Labor Court rulings on dismissals across Spanish provinces before and after the EPL reforms (2004-2014). We make this comparison taking into account a set of co-variates (local labor market conditions, characteristics of the Labor Courts, pre-trial conciliations, congestion of Labor Courts) which may determine the selection of dismissal cases ruled by Labor Courts. Our results suggest that, despite the 2010 and 2012 EPL reforms, the proportion of economic redundancies being ruled as fair by Labor Courts has not substantially increased, although it is now less negatively associated with the local unemployment rate than in the pre-reform period.
J52|The Unexpected Appearance of a New German Model|Most Continental European labour markets and welfare states underwent a substantial transformation over the last two decades moving from a situation of low employment and limited labour market inequality to higher employment, but also more inequality. Germany is a case in point as it exhibits growing employment figures and growing shares of low pay and non-standard work. Furthermore, the German labour market has been remarkably resilient during the recent crisis. How can this be explained? The paper claims that changes in labour market institutions such as unemployment benefits, active labour market policies and employment protection play a major role, but changes in industrial relations at the sectoral level and individual firms' staffing practices are equally important in explaining actual labour market outcomes. Regarding labour market institutions, the pattern found in Germany shows sequences of de- and re-regulatory reforms of employment protection and increasing or decreasing unemployment benefit generosity, both mostly addressing the margins of the labour market, i.e. 'outsiders', and contributing to a growing dualisation of the employment system. The institutional status of 'insiders' was hardly affected by legislative changes. This dualisation trend was reinforced by micro-level dynamics in industrial relations and company employment practices where we can observe growing reliance on mechanisms of internal flexibility for the skilled core work force and increasing use of non-standard types of employment in less specifically skilled occupations.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J52|La acción sindical en el conflicto salarial de la Argentina post-convertibilidad (2006-2010)|Luego de las transformaciones científico-técnicas ocurridas en el capitalismo global des­de mediados de la década del setenta del siglo pasado, diversos autores cuestionaron la centralidad del trabajo (y las organizaciones de los trabajadores), como categoría rele­vante para estudiar el conflicto social y su dinámica. Mediante el análisis estadístico con base en datos de conflictos laborales para el período 2006-2010, y la construcción de las categorías acción sindical y no sindical, el presente trabajo objeta este argumento al de­mostrar que la acción sindical no sólo es responsable del incremento del conflicto laboral en Argentina, sino que lo sostiene en momentos claves como el de negociación colectiva y vacaciones de los trabajadores, al tiempo que favorece la conformación de una nueva organización gremial.
J52|The Spanish productivity puzzle in the Great Recession|While Spain has traditionally underperformed its European peers in terms of labor productivity, the trend reverses after 2007. The evolution of aggregate productivity in Spain during the Great Recession is shaped largely, albeit not exclusively, by the adverse conditions in the labor market. Using a longitudinal sample of Spanish manufacturing and services companies between 1995 and 2012, we show that the recent increase in Spanish aggregate productivity is also responsive to the behavior of total factor productivity (TFP) and to composition effects. By combining the information at firm level on balance sheet items, collective agreements and imports-exports, we are able to establish that a collective agreement at the firm level and access to external markets are positively related to TFP performance during the whole period. In addition, our estimates indicate that firm TFP was negatively correlated to the proportion of temporary workers during the expansionary period, 1995-2007, whereas the sign of that correlation reversed during the crisis, 2008-2012. Finally, we relate this sign reversal to the changing composition of temporary workers in the labor market.
J52|Mediating Effects of Cash Management in Relationship between Capital Structure and Liquidity in Small and Medium Enterprises|This study attempts to establish the relationship that exists between capital structure, cash management and liquidity in some selected small and medium enterprises in Jimeta, Adamawa State, Nigeria. It also investigates the mediating effect of cash management in the association of capital structure and liquidity. A total of 365 copies of questionnaire were administered to 366 small and medium scale enterprise but a total 310 copies of questionnaire were returned fully and appropriately filled. The study made use of but primary and secondary method in collecting data. A cluster sampling method was used in this study and purposive sampling was also used to choose units of analysis in all clusters. Descriptive and inferential statistic such as frequencies mean, and standard deviation including Pearson’s correlation coefficient, multiple regression and sobel test were employed to obtain results. The results indicate that there is a positive significant relationship between capital structure and cash management, capital structure and liquidity, liquidity and cash management at a correlation of 0.657, 0.657 and 0.640 respectively, significant at 0.01 level (2-tailed) and df = 309. To support the correlation analysis, the regression analysis was also used to see the variability in the relationship and it indicates that 43.1% and 43% of the variability in both cash management and liquidity can be explained by the capital structure of the firm and also 41% of the variability in liquidity can be explained by cash management. The sobel test and the Kenny and Baron approach were used to test the mediating effect of cash management in the relationship between capital structure and liquidity and it indicate a partial mediation between the variables. A single research methodology approach was used and the findings from this research are cross sectional, future research through other methods could be undertaken to triangulate and also should be taken across time. The study recommends that chief financial officers exercise caution while choosing the amount of debt to use in their capital structure since a positive relationship exist between capital structure, liquidity and cash management.
J52|The impact of the 2014 platinum mining strike in South Africa: An economy-wide analysis|In this paper we measure the economy-wide impact of the 2014 labour strike in South Africa's platinum industry. The strike lasted 5months, ending in June 2014 when producers reached an agreement with the main labour unions. The immediate impacts on local mining towns were particularly severe, but our research shows that the strike could also have long lasting negative impacts on the South African economy as a whole. We find that it is not the higher nominal wages itself that caused the most damage, but the possible reaction by investors in the mining industry towards South Africa. Investor confidence is likely to be, at least, temporarily harmed, in which case it would take many years for the effects of the strike to disappear. We conduct our analysis using a dynamic CGE model of South Africa.
J52|State dependence in the incidence of strikes: Evidence from Canadian contract data using Heckman’s dynamic probit model|This paper considers whether there is state dependence in strike incidence using longitudinal contract data from Canada. I obtain my estimates using Heckman’s estimator for dynamic probit models and find that there is no state dependence in strike incidence.
J52|Behavioral spillovers from freeriding in multilevel interactions|We study multilevel interactions using experimental methods. Does the efficiency of a production team suffer from the freeriding behavior of some team members at the firm level? Can we identify behavioral spillovers affecting teams? We isolate common tasks that teams must complete – coordination and cooperation – and model each of them using a simple experimental game that is designed to avoid identification problems. By observing a team's efficiency before and after the firm-level event, we identify the behavioral spillovers of freeriding to team-level cooperation and coordination. We demonstrate that team composition with respect to freeriding behavior of individual members during the firm-level conflict conditions behavioral spillovers. In particular, the efficiency of heterogeneous teams decreases after a firm-level conflict, whereas homogeneous teams can improve their performance.
J52|Incidencia y resultados de la reforma laboral sobre la negociación colectiva en Euskadi|The article analyzes the incidence and outcome of the labor reform of 2012 in collective bargaining of the CAPV in the three most important aspects. First the decay of the agreements and the impact on the rate of coverage of collective bargaining as a result of the new limitation of the ultraactivity of the agreements are studied. Secondly, the emergence of new bargaining units because of the priority given to enterprise agreements is analyzed, all this in a context marked by blocking sectoral collective bargaining and the decay of sectoral agreements. Thirdly the non-application of agreements by size of company, economic sector and subjects is examined.
J52|The one constant: a causal effect of collective bargaining on employment growth? Evidence from German linked‐employer‐employee data|A large number of articles have analysed ‘the one constant’ in the economic effects of trade unions, namely that collective bargaining reduces employment growth by 2–4% points per year. Evidence is, however, mostly related to Anglo‐Saxon countries. We investigate whether a different institutional setting might lead to a different outcome, making the constant a variable entity. Using linked‐employer‐employee data for Germany, we find a negative correlation between being covered by a sector‐wide bargaining agreement or firm‐level contract and employment growth of about 1% point per annum. However, the correlation between employment growth and collective bargaining is not robust to the use of panel methods. We conclude that the results of the literature using cross‐section data might be driven by selection.
J52|Transforming Leaders Through Cultural Intelligence|Developing charismatic leaders in the 21st century must include fostering the cultural awareness skills for effectively managing employees from many new and unique backgrounds. The purpose of this quantitative study was to determine if there was a correlation between cultural intelligence (CI) and transformational leadership (TL) attributes of managers at American Fortune 500 companies. The data results indicated that there was a statistically significant positive relationship between the CI and the TL abilities of managers. The conclusion drawn from the findings provide new information to theory of cultures when CI and TL constructs are compared. It is recommended that American Fortune 500 leaders continue to strengthen culture-specific awarenessâ€™s through educational and personal pursuits.
J52|A Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic Labor-Market Disequilibrium model for business cycle analysis|A Dynamic Stochastic Labor-Market Disequilibrium (DSLMD) model is proposed for Keynesian business cycle analysis. It shares the type of micro-foundation known from neoclassical Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models but characterizes economic mechanisms consistent with Traditional Post-Keynesian (TPK) models. Wage inflation is perceived as a non-market-clearing policy variable which may be subject to a collective Nash bargaining process with the state of the labor market affecting the relative bargaining power. The core insights are twofold: First, apart from assumptions regarding expectation formation, the DSGE-type of microfoundation is, to a considerable extent, consistent with the behavioral hypotheses underlying TPK models. Second, the economy characterized by the DSLMD model is post-Keynesian rather than neoclassical.
J52|Unions and Collective Bargaining in the Wake of the Great Recession|This paper provides the first definitive estimates of union density in Portugal, 2010-2012, using a unique dataset. The determinants of union density at firm level are first modeled. Next, estimates of the union wage gap are provided for different ranges of union density. Since these estimates fully reflect the reality of an industrial relations system in which collective agreements are extended to nonunion workers and firms, the final issue examined is contract coverage. The pronounced reduction in the number of industry-wide agreements and extension ordinances in recent years has been uncritically equated with a fall in coverage. However, the authors show that the number of workers covered by new and existing agreements has remained largely unaffected by economic crisis. The reduced frequency of new agreements and extensions is instead attributed to downward nominal wage rigidity in deflationary times, rather than (as yet) the expression of a crisis in collective bargaining.
J52|Dismissal Laws in Australia: Reforms and Enforcement by Labour Courts|The paper analyses the arbitration of dismissal disputes by Australian labour courts over a 15 years' time span characterized by two major legal reforms to unfair dismissal statutes. We isolate two channels by which we think the social values of the Federal government affected the decisions of the courts: (i) through changes to established rules (the legal standards guiding decisions) and (ii) through labour court appointments (changing the composition of decision-makers). We study these two questions by analysing the probability of plaintiffs' victory in Australian labour court, using a panel of 81 judges and 2,223 decisions. We test for and subsequently exploit the randomized matching of labour court judges with unfair dismissal cases. We also test for and address the Priest-Klein selection effect, which is known to potentially invalidate analysis of trial cases. Using several model specifications we find significant effects from both channels: statutory reforms and judges' work background have strong and significant effects on case outcomes.
J52|On the Impact of Quotas and Decision Rules in Ultimatum Collective Bargaining|We conduct multi-person one-shot ultimatum games that reflect important aspects of collective bargaining. In all treatments a proposer has to divide a pie among herself and six recipients that are divided into two groups of three. The proposer cannot discriminate among, but across group members. Acceptance decisions are taken by a committee of three representatives from one or both groups. In a 2x2 design we vary (i) representation in the decision committee (one vs. both groups) and (ii) the decision rule (unanimity vs. majority voting). We find that (i) representation of a group in the committee is crucial for receiving a significant share, (ii), proposals are more balanced if both groups have veto power (iii) acceptance rates are only high when the environment gives a clear idea of what an appropriate proposal is. Non--binding communication reduces rejection rates and proposer shares.
J52|Perverse effects of two-tier wage bargaining structures|Debate over labor market flexibility focuses mainly on firing costs, while largely ignoring wage determination and the need for collective bargaining reform. Most countries affected by the euro debt crisis have two-tier bargaining structures in which plant-level bargaining supplements national or industrywide (multi-employer) agreements, taking the pay agreement established at the multi-employer level as a floor. Two-tier structures were intended to link pay more closely to productivity and to allow wages to adjust downward during economic downturns, while preventing excessive earning dispersion. However, these structures seem to fail precisely on these grounds.
J52|Performance-related pay and labor productivity|Many firms offer employees a remuneration package that links pay to performance as a means of motivation. It also improves efficiency and reduces turnover and absenteeism. The effects on productivity depend on the type of scheme employed (individual or group performance) and its design (commissions, piece-rate or sharing schemes). Individual incentives demonstrate the largest effect, while group or team incentives are smaller in magnitude. The case for government intervention through tax breaks and other financial incentives is highly debated due to differences across firms and the potential for economic inefficiencies.
J52|Unions and investment in intangible capital|Although coverage of collective bargaining agreements has been declining for decades in most countries, it is still extensive, especially in non-Anglo-Saxon countries. Strong unions may influence firms’ incentives to invest in capital, particularly in sectors where capital investments are sunk (irreversible), as in research-intensive sectors. Whether unions affect firms’ investment in capital depends on the structure and coordination of bargaining, the preference of unions between wages and employment, the quality of labor-management relations, and the existence of social pacts, among other factors.
J52|Observance Of The Principle Of Nondiscriminationon Grounds Of Ethnicity On The Labour Market|This paper aims to approach the problem of discrimination against the Roma people on the labor market in Romania. We will achieve above all a comparative presentation between the two legal concepts: discrimination-nondiscrimination, then we will make a brief presentation of European and national normative acts that regulate and promote the nondiscrimination principle in general and in particular, the nondiscrimination on grounds of ethnicity. The last part of the paper deals strictly with the situation of Roma people on the labor market in Romania, during the years 1992-2015,without neglecting for this period the degree of training and qualification which has serious implications on the possibility of their employment in Romania, and also the measures taken by the Government to integrate Roma people into the labor market.
J52|Tarifeinheit, Tarifpluralität und Spartengewerkschaften: Ein Plädoyer für gesetzgeberische Zurückhaltung|This paper critically discusses the reasoning and the consequences of a recent parliamentary bill which intends to restore the traditional principle of one collective bargaining agreement per business in Germany that has been overturned by the Federal Labour Court. It argues that the empirical evidence on the effects of allowing multiple bargaining agreements and of the recently emerged occupational unions on strikes, wages and transaction costs is weak and does not justify the encroachment on the freedom of association associated with this bill.
J52|Tarifpluralität fünf Jahre nach dem BAG-Urteil|This article examines the likely effects of a draft bill of the German government which aims at restraining multi-unionism in Germany. We argue that since 2010, when the Federal Labour Court eased restrictions on multi-unionism, hardly any signs of adverse effects of this court ruling can be observed. Furthermore, the draft bill would have strong negative consequences for small, mainly occupation-based, unions in Germany. Therefore, the bill does not seem to be a good instrument for regulating labour relations in Germany.
J52|Tarifeinheit per Gesetz – 10 Thesen zu den Plänen der Bundesregierung zur Wiedereinführung der Tarifeinheit|One basically has to welcome the plans of the German Government to legally clarify the questions arising from a collision of collective labour agreements caused by a revised jurisdiction. Companies need clear guidelines on how to handle the demands of several trade unions. Reciprocally, the trade unions, too, need legal security shown, for example, by the high compensation claims against the Air Traffic Controllers’ Union (GDF) jeopardising its existence. The legislator should no longer allow the collective labour system in the field of essential services to suffer from a growing discontent of the affected citizens being the main sufferers from the strikes.
J52|Spartengewerkschaften, Statuskonflikte und Gemeinwohl: Gesetzlicher Ordnungsrahmen statt Laissez-faire|In December 2014, the German Federal Government adopted a draft law on the exclusive applicability of collective agreements - the so-called Tarifeinheitsgesetz. Critics see this as an unacceptable interference to the freedom of association. They point out, that despite multi-unionism you can neither observe a substantial increase in new trade unions being set up nor an increase in labor disputes. Proponents of the legal regulation argue that the industrial peace obligation would be jeopardized by competing unions. Craft unions negotiated twice as intense as industrial unions. In industries with union competition, risk of conflicts would accumulate. In addition, the public interest would be harmed if unions battled out their rivalries during collective bargaining negotiations. The proposed law tackled these problems by providing stronger incentives for cooperation between competing unions.
J52|Regulation (Eu) No 1215/2012 On Jurisdiction And The Recognition And Enforcement Of Judgments In Civil And Commercial Matters With Special Reference To The Relationship Between The Regulation And Arbitration|The paper analyses the recent changes to the rules on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters adopted by Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012. The introductory part gives a brief overview of the Regulation and analyses the most important changes, whereas the second part deals with the segment of the Regulation regulating or “not regulating” arbitration; the exclusion of arbitration from the scope of the Regulation, the relationship of the courts (of Member States) and the arbitration agreement, arbitration as an incidental question in a dispute, the relationship between the Regulation and the 1958 New York Convention.
J52|Spoleczny system produkcji w Niemczech – model na przyszlosc?|The concept of social system of production is one of the research perspectives by which the institutional arrangements of modern market economies are being analyzed. On this basis considerations can be made on distinctive arrangements in given countries, in line with the thesis of Variety of Capitalism approach, as well as explorations can be undertaken of issues of sustainability of institutional configurations and of the complementarity of their components. The study raises these issues in theory and carries out their preliminary verification on the example of Germany's social system of production, with special regard to the labor market. Based on the critical literature review a set of specific features of the German model was selected, as proposed by the concept of the social system of production, divided in four main categories: institutions, organizations, social values and economic policy. Then, using a secondary statistical data and qualitative analysis, the trends affecting these elements are identified, in order to verify the thesis of complementarity and the stability of the German social production system.
J52|Uwarunkowania instytucjonalne niemieckiego rynku pracy wobec swiatowego kryzysu gospodarczego 2008-2009|The unemployment rate in Germany after reaching a peak of 12.1% in 2005 began to decline steadily, and the improvement of the situation on the labour market followed even in the face of the global economic crisis after 2007. These positive trends, especially in comparison with other EU countries, draw attention and are discussed in the literature. Reference is made to the exceptionally favourable macroeconomic configuration for the German economy: low interest rates (since autumn 2008), low oil prices and the weak euro (since mid-2014). Secondly, an active employment and the labour market policy is boasted in the face of crisis. Finally, the institutional aspects of the German labour market are emphasized: long-term effects of labour market reforms as part of the Hartz package of 2003-2005 and the specificity of the German model of industrial relations as an effective constellation of three key actors in the labour market: trade unions, employers' organizations and works councils. The objective of this study is an attempt to clarify the institutional conditions of the functioning of the labour market in Germany that are relevant to the response to the crisis. Accordingly, the buffers are examined to mitigate shocks with particular emphasis on instruments of internal flexibility, social partners behaviour and institutional connections of labour markets with other domains of economic order on the example of dual education system.
J52|Social system of production in Germany – a model for future?|The concept of a social system of production (SSP) is one of the cognitive perspectives by which the institutional arrangements of modern market economies could be analysed. It allows reflections on the autonomy of institutional arrangements in each country, in line with the assumption put by the Variety of Capitalism approach, as well as to investigate problems of stability of the given institutional configuration and the complementarity of their components. The following study raises these issues on theoretical basis and carries out their preliminary verification on the example of German SSP, with special regard to the labour market. Basing on the critical study of literature a set of specific features of the German model is proposed, structured according to the concept of SSP in four main categories: institutions, organizations, social values and economic policy. Then, using a secondary statistical data and qualitative analysis, some trends has been identified occurring within these elements in order to verify the thesis of complementarity and the stability of the German social production system.
J52|Endogenous Labour Market Imperfections, FDI and External Terms-of-Trade Shocks in a Developing Economy|This paper shows that developing countries possess an inherent shock-absorbing mechanism that stems from their peculiar institutional characteristics and can lessen the gravity of detrimental welfare consequence of exogenous terms-of-trade disturbances in terms of a two-sector, full-employment general equilibrium model with endogenous labour market distortion. The supply of foreign capital in the economy is a positive function of the return to capital and a decreasing function of the degree of prevailing restrictions in the economy in the process of free inflow of foreign capital. The analysis leads to a couple of important policies that should be adhered to preserve this in-built system. Finally, it offers three important statistically testable hypotheses, empirical validation of which might have an important bearing on formulation of developmental policies in these countries.
J52|Unions and Collective Bargaining in the Wake of the Great Recession|"This paper provides the first definitive estimates of union density in Portugal, 2010-2012, using a unique dataset. The determinants of union density at firm level are first modeled. Next, we draw upon a very recent study of the union wage premium to provide summary estimates of the union wage gap for different ranges of union density. Since these estimates fully reflect the reality of an industrial relations system in which collective agreements are extended to nonunion workers and firms, the final issue examined is contract coverage. Although there has occurred a pronounced fall in the number of new extension agreements in recent years, this decline has been uncritically linked with a fall in coverage. We show that the number of workers covered by new and existing agreements has been largely unaffected by economic crisis. The reduced frequency of new agreements and extensions is viewed as an aspect of downward nominal wage rigidity in deflationary times (the counterpart of ""upward nominal wage rigidity"" in more normal times) rather than the immediate expression of a crisis in collective bargaining per se."
J52|Sources of the Union Wage Gap: Results from High-Dimensional Fixed Effects Regression Models|This paper provides estimates of the union wage gap in Portugal, a nation until recently lacking independent data on union density at firm level. Having estimated nonlinear and linear estimates of the effect of union density on the wage gap, the next stage of the analysis seeks to account for the influence of worker, firm, and job-title permanent heterogeneity, using a three high dimensional fixed effects strategy. Gelbach's decomposition is used to determine the role of each as sources of the union wage gap. A generalization of this technique is applied for the nonlinear case. We find evidence of a substantial union wage gap in circumstances where the majority of the workforce is organized. There is also some clear indication of substitution effects among different types of compensation that favor of wage supplements (likely reflecting tax considerations) as bargaining power increases. The principal result of the decomposition exercise at the most aggregate level is that the union wage gap is mainly manifested through a firm fixed effect, suggesting that unions may force firms to reposition themselves as far as their wage compensation policies are concerned. A subsidiary result is that matching plays almost no role. More importantly, however, are the results obtained when a distinction is drawn between the (estimated) bargained wage and total earnings. Rising union density has a much greater influence upon the former and is negatively related to the difference between the two. This result is consistent with a wider literature indicating that firms have a 'wage cushion' enabling them to avoid some of the strictures of unionism bargaining power.
J52|Arbeit – Politik – Recht: Das Recht(ssystem) als Forschungsdesiderat in den Arbeitsbeziehungen – Einleitung zum Schwerpunktheft|Das deutsche System der industriellen Beziehungen weist im internationalen Vergleich gemeinhin ein hohes Mass an Verrechtlichung auf. Umso ueberraschender ist der Umstand, dass das Recht und seine Akteure, Institutionen und Verfahren in der Forschung ueber Arbeitsbeziehungen seit Jahrzehnten wenig explizite Aufmerksamkeit erfahren. Die Forschung ueber industrielle Beziehungen kann davon profitieren, diese rechtsbezogenen Prozesse des Wandels in den Blick zu nehmen. Mit dem hier vorgelegten Schwerpunktheft moechten wir dazu einladen, das Recht, seine Institutionen, Akteure und Verfahren, explizit als Bestandteil der Analyse industrieller Beziehungen zu verstehen. Wir versammeln Beitraege aus den verschiedenen Disziplinen, um einen Einstieg in die Debatte zu forcieren. Der Beitrag von Ulrich Walwei befasst sich mit dem Phaenomen der Verrechtlichung als Verstaatlichung und diskutiert aus einer klassischen „law-and-economics“-Perspektive, welche marktbezogenen Effekte von der politisch hoch umstrittenen Re-Regulierung des Arbeitsmarktes zu erwarten sind. Im Ergebnis raet er dazu, politische Hoffnungen oder Befuerchtungen in die eine oder andere Richtung nicht zu ueberhoehen. Norbert Cyrus und Markus Kip behandeln am Beispiel von Beschaeftigten mit prekaerem Aufenthaltsstatus das Problem der Rechtsmobilisierung. Welche Restriktionen lassen sich konstatieren, und welchen Beitrag koennen (und wollen) Gewerkschaften leisten, die Defizite zu ueberwinden? Die Frage der Rechtsmobilisierung adressiert das Phaenomen der Justizialisierung und duerfte insbesondere auch fuer die Debatte ueber die Revitalisierung der Gewerkschaften von grosser Relevanz sein. Auch Nadine Absenger und Daniel Seikel befassen sich mit dem Phaenomen der Justizialisierung. In einer interdisziplinaeren Kooperation aus Rechts- und Politikwissenschaft diskutieren sie die Frage, welche Auswirkungen die Rechtsprechung des EuGH auf das deutsche Tarifvertragssystem hat. Dabei kommen sie zu einem ambivalenten Befund. Waehrend individuelle Arbeitnehmerrechte haeufig gestaerkt werden, werden die kollektiven Selbstbestimmungsrechte und damit die Handelungsfreiheit der Tarifparteien empfindlich beschraenkt. Ralf Rogowski schliesslich widmet sich in seinem Beitrag der Herausbildung eines transnationalen oder globalen arbeitsrechtlichen Raumes. Mit der Idee des „reflexive labour law“ knuepft er dabei an die systemtheoretischen Traditionen der Rechtssoziologie an.
J52|Die Auswirkungen der EuGH-Rechtsprechung auf das Tarifvertragssystem in Deutschland (The impact of the case law of the European Court of Justice on the collective bargaining system in Germany)|Spaetestens seit den Urteilen des EuGH in den Faellen Laval (C-341/05), Viking (C-438/05), Rueffert (C-346/06) und Kommission gegen Luxemburg (C-319/06) ist deutlich geworden, dass die Rechtsprechung des Gerichtshofes erhebliche Auswirkungen auf die nationalen Systeme industrieller Beziehungen hat. Dieser Artikel untersucht aus politik- und rechtswissenschaftlicher Perspektive, welche Folgen die EuGH-Rechtsprechung auf das Tarifvertragssystem in Deutschland hat. Anhand von ausgewaehlten EuGH-Entscheidungen zeigen wir, dass die Rechtsprechung des Gerichtshofes haeufig Rechte und Handlungsmoeglichkeiten von Tarifparteien einschraenkt, angefangen beim Streikrecht bis hin zur Ausgestaltung und Geltung von Tarifvertraegen. Waehrend der EuGH im Bereich des individuellen Arbeitsrechts oft zugunsten der Arbeitnehmerinteressen entscheidet, gehen Urteile zum kollektiven Arbeitsrecht haeufig zu Lasten der Tarifautonomie. Kollektive Selbstbestimmungsrechte werden dadurch geschwaecht. (The rulings of the ECJ in the cases of Laval (C-341/05), Viking (C-438/05), Rueffert (C-346/06) and Commission v Luxembourg (C-319/06) have demonstrated that the Court’s adjudication has substantial effects on national systems of industrial relations. This article examines the consequences of the case law of the ECJ on the collective bargaining system in Germany from a law and political science perspective. We examine selected ECJ rulings and show that the Court’s adjudication restricts the rights and room for manoeuvre of social partners, affecting the right to strike as well as specific regulations in collective agreements. In the area individual labour law, the ECJ regularly rules in favour of employees. However, when it comes to collective labour law, the ECJ often decides to the detriment of collective bargaining autonomy. This weakens collective social rights.)
J52|Erneuerung durch Umstrukturierung? Zu den Auswirkungen von Gewerkschaftsfusionen (Revitalisation through restructuring? The effects of union mergers)|Gewerkschaftsfusionen gelten als eine Erneuerungsstrategie und sind oft mit dem Ziel der Staerkung von Organisationsmacht verbunden. Dennoch ist wenig erforscht, wie sich Fusionen tatsaechlich auf beteiligte Gewerkschaften auswirken und wie sie zu deren Erneuerung beitragen koennen. Dieser Aufsatz erlaeutert, dass die Auswirkungen einer Fusion anhand der Entwicklung der Mitgliederzahlen und der Organisierung neuer Bereiche, der tarifpolitischen Durchsetzungsfaehigkeit, des politischen Einflusses, der zwischengewerkschaftlichen Konkurrenz und organisationsinterner Synergien in der fusionierten Gewerkschaft eingeschaetzt werden koennen. Auswirkungen in diesen Bereichen werden in einer Fallstudie der Fusion zur Bildung der Vereinten Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft ver.di untersucht. Es zeigt sich, dass in den meisten Bereichen keine Verbesserungen nach der Fusion eingetreten sind. Dieses Ergebnis laesst erkennen, dass Fusionen an und fuer sich nicht zu Erneuerung fuehren, sondern dass die konkrete Umsetzung einer Fusion auf dieses Ziel ausgerichtet sein muss. (Trade union mergers are regarded as a revitalisation strategy and are often associated with the goal of increasing organisational power. But little is known about how mergers really affect the unions involved. This paper argues that the effects of a merger can be assessed on the basis of developments in the merged union regarding membership numbers and organising activities in new coverage areas, collective bargaining power, political influence, inter-union competition and synergies within the new organisation. These effects are examined through the case study of the merger to form the union ver.di. The paper shows that in most of these areas, improvements did not occur after the merger. This result implies that a union merger does not lead to revitalisation in and of itself, but rather that the concrete implementation of a merger needs to be oriented towards the goal of revitalisation.)
J52|Revitalisierung der Tarifpolitik durch den gesetzlichen Mindestlohn? (Revitalisation of collective bargaining through the statutory minimum wage?)|Seit Januar 2015 gilt in Deutschland ein gesetzlicher Mindestlohn von 8,50 € pro Stunde. Die Mindestlohneinfuehrung ist Teil eines Gesetzes zur Staerkung der Tarifautonomie, das darauf abzielt, die Tarifbindung wieder zu erhoehen und Allgemeinverbindlicherklaerungen zu erleichtern. In diesem Beitrag gehen wir der Frage nach, ob und inwieweit die in einigen anderen Laendern festgestellten ripple-Effekte – also Verhandlungen ueber hoehere Tarifloehne auf der Plattform des Mindestlohns – auch in Deutschland zu erwarten sind. Auf der Basis der Erfahrungen mit den branchenbezogenen Mindestloehnen nach dem Arbeitnehmer-Entsendegesetz und der uebertragung einer Laendertypologie auf unterschiedliche Branchen in Deutschland arbeiten wir systematische Gruende fuer moegliche Branchenunterschiede heraus und identifizieren Faktoren, die hierfuer von Bedeutung sind. Aus unserer Sicht ist noch offen, ob und inwiefern es gelingen wird, die auf der politischen Ebene angestrebte Staerkung des Tarifvertragssystems zu realisieren. Letztlich haengt vieles davon ab, ob die Durchsetzung des gesetzlichen Mindestlohns in Deutschland konsequent und ernsthaft betrieben wird. (In January 2015, Germany introduced a statutory minimum wage of € 8.50 per hour. The new Minimum Wage Act is part of a more extensive legislative package bearing the programmatic title of ‘Act on the Strengthening of Free Collective Bargaining’ with the aim to increase coverage by collective agreement and facilitate the process of declaring collective agreements generally binding. In this contribution, we explore whether and to what extent the so-called ‘ripple effects` detected in several other countries – i.e. bargaining on higher pay grades based on the platform of the minimum wage – can be expected in Germany too. Based on experience with sector-specific minimum wages and by transferring a country typology to different sectors in Germany, we identify systematic reasons and relevant factors for variation across sectors. In our view, it remains to be seen whether the politically intended promotion of free collective bargaining will be successful in practice. Finally, the effects of the statutory minimum wage largely depend on whether the enforcement of the statutory minimum wage is taken seriously and consequently.)
J52|Kollektive Lohnverhandlungen und der Gender Wage Gap: Befunde aus einer qualitativen Studie (Collective bargaining and the gender wage gap: Findings from a qualitative study)|Empirische Studien weisen darauf hin, dass der Gender Wage Gap – die geschlechtsspezifische Lohnluecke – im Tarifbereich geringer als im nicht-tarifgebundenen Bereich der Wirtschaft ausfaellt. Dennoch ist es eine weitgehend offene Frage, wie sich die Strukturen und der Ablauf von Tarifverhandlungen auf den Gender Wage Gap auswirken. Der vorliegende Beitrag geht dieser Frage anhand von Interviews mit Tarifexpertinnen und -experten von Arbeitgeberverbaenden und Gewerkschaften in vier Branchen nach. Die meisten Befragten sehen Tarifvertraege nicht als moegliche Quelle von Lohnunterschieden zwischen Maennern und Frauen an. Insgesamt schildern die Befragten auf der Ebene von Tarifverhandlungen auch nur bedingt Potential zur Verringerung der geschlechtsspezifischen Lohnluecke. Frauen sind den Aussagen nach in Entscheidungs- und vor allem in Verhandlungsgremien allerdings haeufig unterrepraesentiert. Ein Teil der Befragten ist der Auffassung, dass die bestehende Entgeltstruktur zu Lasten von frauendominierten Berufen geht. Veraenderungen bei der Arbeitsbewertung gelten jedoch aus verschiedenen Gruenden als schwierig. (Empirical studies indicate that the gender wage gap is lower under collectively negotiated contracts than in firms not bound by such contracts. However, it remains an open question as to how the organisation and the process of collective negotiations affect the gender wage gap. To shed light on this question, we conducted interviews with collective bargaining experts from employers' organisations and trade unions in four different industries. Most respondents did not consider collective agreements as a possible source of wage differences between men and women. Consequently, they saw only limited potential to reduce the gender pay gap at the level of collective bargaining. According to the interviewees, however, women were often under-represented in decision-making and especially in negotiating committees. Some of the respondents believed that the existing wage structure penalises female-dominated occupations. However, they named several reasons why a revised wage structure is difficult to implement.)
J52|Innovationspotenziale im Ablauf von Tarifverhandlungen|Die in Deutschland gaengigen Aushandlungsprozesse im Rahmen von Tarifverhandlungen sind kaum erforscht und stehen doch vielfach in der Kritik, „ritualhaft“ und damit – so der intendierte Vorwurf – ineffizient und gestrig zu sein. In diesem Buch wird zum einen die Substanz dieser weitverbreiteten Aussage systematisch geprueft. Zum anderen werden Ansaetze fuer Innovationen in diesem Bereich identifiziert und deren Umsetzbarkeit bewertet. Hierzu werden die spezifischen praktischen, rechtlichen und soziologischen Rahmenbedingungen eruiert, unter denen Tarifpolitik stattfindet und unter denen komplexe, heterogene Gruppeninteressen zu einer Uebereinkunft gefuehrt werden. So konnten Bewertungsmassstaebe entwickelt werden, anhand derer eine abstrakte Pruefung der neuen Ansaetze erfolgt
J52|Employment protection and collective bargaining during the great recession: a comprehensive review of international evidence|In this article, we present information from a unique database of labour market reforms implemented in 111 developed and developing countries between 2008 and 2014. We show that the number of reforms implemented each year has gradually increased up to 2012 and that the majority of reforms were passed in advanced economies – with some EU member states particularly hit by the crisis being the most active reformers (e.g. Spain, Greece, Italy). Moreover, the results show that permanent contracts and collective bargaining were the most popular areas of labour market policy interventions and that the majority of reforms decreased the strictness of employment protection legislation – although large disparities emerge across world regions in this respect. Finally, the article compares our database to different indicators of employment regulation in order to check the consistency of our results.
J52|Effective Labor Relations Laws and Social Welfare|Effective labor relations laws determine the allocation of bargaining power between the parties involved in labor disputes, and hence, influence social welfare. The right to strike, the types of legal strikes, and the right to hire replacement workers are fundamental components of labor relations laws in the public sector. Strikes by public school teachers, which are common in real-world settings, involve particularly high social costs. We theoretically study the social welfare effects of labor relations laws that permit the effective use of replacement teachers in case of strikes. These laws refer to the explicit right to hire replacement teachers and to the prohibition of intermittent strikes. We present a sequential bargaining game of incomplete information. Our model explicitly includes a law component, which captures the impact of effective labor relations laws. We conduct social welfare analysis and demonstrate that these laws reduce bargaining impasse and increase social welfare.
J52|Law and economics and tort litigation institutions: theory and experiments|In tort litigation, delayed settlement imposes high costs on the parties and society. An appropriate design of litigation institutions and tort reform requires a good knowledge of the factors that affect litigants’ behavior. Both theoretical and experimental law and economics, which represent the cornerstones of the application of the scientific method, enhance our understanding of the effects of litigation institutions and tort reform on settlement and deterrence. This chapter evaluates the interaction between theoretical and experimental law and economics in the study of tort litigation institutions. Special attention is devoted to liability, litigation and tort reform institutions, and behavioral factors that might affect an impasse. The analysis suggests a productive interaction between theoretical and experimental law and economics. In particular, findings from experimental economics work on litigation institutions indicate the presence and robustness of cognitive biases, and provide evidence of the effects of litigants’ biased beliefs on the likelihood of impasse.
J52|Corporate Social Responsibility and Social Dialogue in Human Resources Management in the Banking Sector in Greece: A Case Study of Elder Bank Employees|Corporate Social Responsibility constitutes a powerful tool for Greek Banks for the development and formulation of their public image. However, many times this does not conform to socially accepted practices in the management of their human resources. In this current phase of economic crisis and restructuring in the banking sector some crucial issues have emerged. A major one is the problem of supporting and encouraging the employment of elder employees in a framework of practices, principles and values, which embed internationally accepted standards emanating from CSR and HR management. Balancing the public image of banks in relation to a difficult social reality regarding the issue of elder bank employees goes through the formulation of a consultation and social dialogue system including all social factors involved. In this article we propose the development of a structured system for public consultation and social dialogue based on primary research on a weighted sample of elder employees and managers of banks, as well as trade unions heads. This system will comprehensively address the issue of active ageing in the banking sector by proposing effective actions and solutions per policy area: awareness, using awareness indicators, maintaining employment and supporting career pathways, combating stereotypes related to age, etc. The proposed consultation system aims to increase transparency, collegiality and quality in decision making processes. The consultation system is governed by general principles, stages, fields and levels of social dialogue and takes into account the conditions for the development of social dialogue mechanism. The authors believe that the system proposed is also applicable in other branches (provided necessary adaptations are made); therefore it provides a useful tool for applying a policy dealing with worsening labour relations in the context of current circumstances
J52|The Foreign Direct Investment And Arbitration In Albania|FDI into Albania has been rising steadily since the early 2000s. These investments are essentially in the oil, metal ore, infrastructure, construction and telephony sectors. Albania has applied a policy framework favorable to FDI, and has more recently introduced policies to support private sector development in general. In recent years, the government has enacted reforms to improve the overall business climate in the country by streamlining business procedures through e-government reforms and improved legislation in a variety of sectors. The government currently is drafting a new Law on Investment that will provide investment incentives and fast-track registration and licensing procedures for strategic foreign investors. The Albanian legal system does not discriminate against foreign investors. Albania has implemented a liberal foreign investment regime with the goal of increasing foreign direct investment. Additionally, in September 2010, the parliament approved several amendments to this law that provide special protection for foreign investment in the tourism, energy and agriculture sectors. Aiming at encouraging foreigners willing to invest in Albania, the law provides considerable guarantees to them, consisting of: Judicial protection of foreign investors with respect to the legal rights related to their investments. Foreign investors may bring disputes before an Albanian court, or refer the case to arbitration. The relevant provisions governing domestic and international commercial arbitration are incorporated in the Albanian Code of Civil Procedure.Investors in Albania are entitled to judicial protection of the rights related to their investment. The parties to a dispute may agree to submit disputes for consideration by an arbitration institution. In the event of a failure of such arbitration, foreign investors have the right to submit the dispute to an Albanian court or to the Arbitration Court in Tirana. In the event of a dispute regarding discrimination, transfer of assets, or indirect expropriation of foreign investment by the Government, the investor may submit the dispute to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). Ratified international agreements have legal superiority over domestic legislation in Albania in matters relating to FDI.
J52|Reciprocity and Workers’ Tastes for Representation|Using unique survey data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, this study examines the influence of reciprocal inclinations on workers’ sorting into codetermined firms. Employees with strong negative reciprocal inclinations are more likely to work in firms with a works council while employees with strong positive reciprocal inclinations are less likely to work in such firms. However, the results also show striking gender differences in the relationship between reciprocity and taste for representation. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
J52|Organisationsdefizite der deutschen Gewerkschaften|The results of the recently released German General Social Survey (ALLBUS) show that in 2014 the net density rate of trade unions in Germany declined to less than 18 per cent. This was the lowest level since German unification. An in-depth analysis of union membership reveals that unionisation of male, full-time and older employees is above average. The latest membership decline will continue if the unions do not succeed in organising more women, young people and white collar workers. Furthermore, unions have not yet been able to profit from scepticism towards liberal economic policies, which has slightly grown within the group of employees since 2004, as the index of economic freedom reveals.

J52|Does Public Transit reduce Car Travel Externalities?|One of the main unanswered questions in the field of urban economics is to which extent subsidies to public transit are justified. We examine one of the main benefits of public transit, a reduction in car congestion externalities, the so-called congestion relief benefit, using quasi-natural experimental data on citywide public transit strikes for Rotterdam. On weekdays, a strike induces car speed to decrease only marginally on the highway ring road (by 3 percent) but substantially on inner city roads (by 10 percent). During rush hour, the strike effect is much more pronounced. The congestion relief benefit is substantial, equivalent to about half of the public transit subsidy. We demonstrate that during weekends, car speed does not change noticeable due to strikes. Further, we show that public transit strikes induce similar increases in number of cyclists as number of car travelers suggesting that bicycling-promoting policies to reduce car congestion externalities might be attractive.
J52|Argentina’s Worker-Recuperated Enterprises, 2010- 2013: A Synthesis of Recent Empirical Findings|Argentina’s empresas recuperadas por sus trabajadores (worker-recuperated enterprises, ERTs) are formerly investor- or privately-owned businesses in crisis ultimately taken over and re-opened by their employees, most commonly as worker cooperatives. Since 2002, the Programa Facultad Abierta (Open Faculty Program) of the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature at the University of Buenos Aires has carried out a series of national studies of Argentina’s ERTs. The aim of this article is to present the conclusions of the fourth survey of Argentina’s ERTs carried out by the Facultad Abierta. This survey focused on ERTs that emerged between March 2010 and December 2013, providing the most complete and up-to-date database of the characteristics of Argentina’s ERTs, and showing evidence of a wave of new worker-recuperated enterprises emerging in the postcrisis years, especially since 2010. The key findings presented in this article include: the political economic reasons for the emergence of ERTs; the characteristics of the growing ERT movement today as compared to earlier ERTs; the nature of the conflicts and issues leading to the creation of Argentina’s new ERTs; a critical analysis of new legal frameworks for ERT firms, comparing and contrasting them to older legal outlets for their formation; and the involvement of unions with Argentina’s ERTs.
J52|The Italian Road to Creating Worker Cooperatives from Worker Buyouts: Italy�s Worker-Recuperated Enterprises and the Legge Marcora Framework|This paper highlights the first phase of a research program, completed in late 2014 and early 2015 that homes in on worker-recuperated enterprises (imprese recuperate dai lavoratori) in Italy. The paper specifically focuses on Italy�s worker buyouts (WBOs) facilitated by its Legge Marcora (Marcora Law) framework�the form of worker-recuperated enterprises predominating in Italy. The paper first offers a definition of WBOs as a subset of workerrecuperate enterprises. It also reviews the most common scenarios from which WBOs emerge globally. It then overviews Italy�s Legge Marcora�s legal and financial framework, and situates the emergence of WBOs since the early 1980s as direct responses to market failure, business closures, rising unemployment, and, with the most recent WBOs, coinciding with the Great Recession and subsequent austerity measures that continue to negatively impact the country. The paper then discusses key findings from our research on WBO creation in Italy, touching on their most salient demographic and geographic particularities. Throughout the paper distinguishes Italy�s WBOs as exemplar because of their resilience in times of crisis, and the inclusion of multiple stakeholders in its WBO framework, namely: workers, the cooperative sector, and the state.
J52|Monopsony Exploitation in Professional Sport: Evidence from Major League Baseball Position Players, 2000–2011| Some professional athletes still face monopsony power in labor markets, underscoring the importance of estimating players' marginal revenue product to assess its effects. We introduce two new empirical approaches, spline revenue functions and fixed‐effects stochastic production functions, into the standard Scully (1974) approach to marginal revenue product estimation and calculate Monopsony Exploitation Ratios (MERs) for position players in Major League Baseball over the 2001–2011 seasons. Estimates indicate that MERs are about 0.89 for rookie players, 0.75 for arbitration eligible players, and 0.21 for free agents. Recent collective bargaining agreements have reduced MERs for free agents, but had no effect on MERs for other players. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
J52|Strukturwandel des Arbeitskampfs: Deutschland im OECD-Ländervergleich|Mit jahresdurchschnittlich drei Ausfalltagen je 1.000 Beschäftigten gehört Deutschland nach wie vor zu den OECD-Ländern mit den stabilsten Arbeitsbeziehungen. Im Vereinigten Königreich fielen seit 2010 im Durchschnitt 26 Tage pro Jahr aus, in Frankreich 139 Tage. Dass im Ausland mehr gestreikt wird, hängt auch mit den politischen Massenstreiks zusammen, die im Zuge der Wirtschafts- und Finanzkrise zugenommen haben. In Deutschland ging die Krise nur mit wenigen Ausfalltagen einher, Regierung und Gewerkschaften näherten sich sogar wieder an. Insgesamt hat sich das Streikgeschehen hierzulande in den Dienstleistungssektor verlagert. Seit 2005 entfallen mehr als drei Viertel aller arbeitskampfbedingten Arbeitsausfälle auf den tertiären Sektor. Mit dieser Tertiarisierung des Streiks ist auch die Anzahl der Streikenden je bestreikten Betrieb von 583 (1995/1999) auf 64 (2010/2014) zurückgegangen. Dafür nahm die Streikdauer von durchschnittlich 0,9 Tagen auf 2,8 Tage zu.
J52|Does codetermination affect the composition of variable versus fixed parts of executive compensation?|Contrary to previous literature we hypothesize that interests of labor may well - like that of shareholders - aim at securing the long-run survival of the firm. Consequently, employee representatives on the supervisory board could well have an interest in increasing incentive-based compensation to avoid excessive risk taking and short-run orientated decisions. We compile unique panel data on executive compensation over the periods 2006 to 2011 for 405 listed companies and use a Hausman-Taylor approach to estimate the effect of codetermination on the compensation design. Finally, codetermination has a significantly positive effect on performance-based components of compensation, which supports our hypothesis.
J52|The Effects of Teacher Strike Activity on Student Learning in South African Primary Schools|This paper investigates whether teacher strikes affect student achievement at the primary school level in South Africa. A cross-subject analysis with student fixed effects is used to eliminate sources of endogeneity bias at the school and student level. Results indicate that teacher strike participation negatively affects learning for students in the poorest three quarters of schools in South Africa. A negative effect size as large as ten per cent of a standard deviation is observed. There is also evidence that more marginalised students, both in terms of socio-economic status and academic performance, are affected most negatively by strike action. However, application of a technique by Altonji, Taber and Elder (2005) indicates that it is not possible to rule out that measured strike effects may be driven by omitted variable bias. The student fixed effects strategy fails to adequately control for unobserved teacher characteristics that may influence both a teacherâ€™s decision to strike and student achievement.
J52|Patterns of innovation and organizational demography in emerging sustainable fields: An analysis of the chemical sector|This paper examines the patterns of environmental innovation in the chemical sector and focuses in particular on detecting whether the rise of sustainable chemistry technologies (SCT) has stimulated the emergence of new organizations. This question is important to assess the extent to which SCT are sustaining the technological advantage of industry incumbents or are creating opportunities for new firms aspiring to develop radically new environmental innovations. We found that SCT still represent a relatively low proportion of chemical technologies and that they have not stimulated, in a significant way, the emergence of new firms. However, the importance of new firms has grown in the last 20 years and their technologies seem to have a higher potential of radicalness than incumbents’ technologies. This indicates that, although incumbents’ advantage remains strong, a small group of young firms has started to weaken such advantage. Moreover, the important role played by research organizations in generating SCT may signal that technological opportunities are expanding and that some governments, in particular the US government, are committed to develop SCT. These results suggest that, if supported by effective policies, technological ferment in the field, which at the present appears still limited, has a potential of growth.
J52|How to stabilize inflation without damaging employment: Strenghtening the power of unions|The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of union bargaining power on inflation and employment in a case of efficiency bargaining, in a context of a strategic game between Central Bank and social partners.
J52|30,000 Minimum Wages: The Economic Effects of Collective Bargaining Extensions|Several countries extend collective bargaining agreements to entire sectors, therefore binding non-subscriber workers and employers. These extensions may address coordination issues but may also distort competition by imposing sector-specific minimum wages and other work conditions that are not appropriate for many firms. In this paper, we analyse the impact of such extensions along several margins drawing on firm-level monthly data for Portugal, a country where extensions have been widespread until recently. We find that both formal employment and wage bills in the relevant sector fall, on average, by 2% – and by 25% more across small firms – over the four months after an extension is issued. These results are driven by both reduced hirings and increased firm closures. On the other hand, informal work, not subject to labour law or extensions, tends to increase. Our findings are robust to several checks, including a falsification exercise based on extensions that were announced but not implemented.
J52|Trade unions in an emerging economy: The case of South Africa|This paper provides a historical overview of the South African trade union movement, followed by a brief discussion of the labour market legislation and institutions formed since 1994. Thereafter, a detailed evaluation of the impact of trade unions, legislation, and institutions on labour market outcomes in South Africa is provided, and it is found that despite a long history, trade union membership levels, their impact on average wage levels, and their pursuit of strike action, has resulted in relatively benign economic impacts within country and relative to other economies around the world. The political-economy effects shaping the countryâ€™s employment relations are then discussed.
J52|Implementing a Voluntary Wage Policy: Lessons from the Irish and Spanish Wages Policies before the Crisis|Despite the relevance given by the Post-Keynesian thought to wage and incomes policies, little attention has been paid to the institutional elements that would favour the unionsâ€™ acceptance of a voluntary moderation of wage claims. Recent wage policies have been implemented in European countries, like Ireland and Spain, which do not fulfil the requirements assumed by corporatist analysis for a successful implementation of wage policies. The success of wage policies in Ireland and Spain, in terms of economic performance and the length of current wage policies, offers a valuable insight on how wages policies can be implemented as a key piece of macroeconomic policy: It also helps our understanding of the institutional framework that favours the implementation of voluntary wages policies.
J52|The Effect of Labour Relations Laws on Union Density Rates: Evidence from Canadian Provinces|We provide evidence on the potential for reforms in labour law to reverse deunionization trends by relating an index of the favorability to unions of Canadian provincial labour relations statutes to changes in provincial union density rates between 1981 and 2012. The results suggest that shifting every provinceâ€™s 2012 legal regime to the most union-friendly possible could raise the national union density by up to 7 percentage points in the long run. This effect appears driven by regulations related to the certification of new bargaining units, the negotiation of first contracts and the recruitment of replacement workers. The effects of reform are largest for women, particularly university-educated women employed as professionals in public services. Overall, the results suggest a limited potential for labour relations reforms to address growing concerns about labour market inequality.
J52|Freie Gewerkschaften|Gewerkschaften werden oft von Liberalen und Libertären kritisiert. Dabei sind sie Ausdruck grundlegender Freiheitsrechte, insbesondere der Vereinigungsfreiheit. Auch das Streikrecht ist innerhalb gewisser Grenzen ein legitimes Freiheitsrecht. Eine freie Gesellschaft ist mehr als Marktwirtschaft und diese geht über Kapitalismus im Sinne der Herrschaft des Kapitals bzw. kapitalgeleiteter Unternehmen hinaus.
J52|Subways, Strikes, and Slowdowns: The Impacts of Public Transit on Traffic Congestion|Public transit accounts for 1 percent of U.S. passenger miles traveled but attracts strong public support. Using a simple choice model, we predict that transit riders are likely to be individuals who commute along routes with severe roadway delays. These individuals' choices thus have high marginal impacts on congestion. We test this prediction with data from a strike in 2003 by Los Angeles transit workers. Estimating a regression discontinuity design, we find that average highway delay increases 47 percent when transit service ceases. We find that the net benefits of transit systems appear to be much larger than previously believed.
J52|Relative deprivation and labour conflict during Spain’s industrialization: the Bilbao estuary, 1914–1936|What drove social conflict in Spain’s industrial areas in the period before the Spanish Civil War? This paper is concerned with contrasting the determinants of working-class conflict in northern Spain at the beginning of the twentieth century. Our hypothesis is that the key determinant of conflicts in emerging industrial areas during the interwar period was the struggle to obtain satisfactory family income in a context of combined high price fluctuation, unemployment and economic boom and bust. We suggest two new ways to decipher how economic factors interact with labour conflict. We introduce the family as the relevant income unit when considering wage struggles and relative deprivation. And secondly, we study the reactions to short-term variations of income on families by using monthly rather than quarterly or annual data.
J52|Wage Bargaining, Employment, and Union Power: The Right-to-Manage Approach|This paper analyzes the implications of right-to-manage wage bargaining between a producers' syndicate and a workers' union representing finite numbers of identical members in a monetary macroconomic model of the AS-AD type with government activity. At given prices and price expectations, nominal wages are set according to a Nash bargaining agreement. Producers then choose labor demand and commodity supply to maximize profits at given output prices. The commodity market clears in a competitive fashion. Unique temporary equilibria are shown to exist for each level of relative power of the union. These equilibria may exhibit under- or overemployment, depending on the level of union power. The paper presents a complete comparative-statics analysis of the temporary equilibrium, in particular of the role of union power on employment, wages, and income distribution, including a variety of different qualitative features compared to the situation under efficient bargaining. These differences arise primarily from a supply-side effect of union power under the right-to-manage approach as compared to a demand-side effect under efficient bargaining. In addition, the dynamic evolution under perfect foresight is monotonic with two co-existing balanced steady states, one of which is stable under certain conditions. These properties are qualitatively identical to those under efficient bargaining or under perfect competition.
J52|Judging Bias In Competitive Academic Debate: The Effects Of Region, Side, And Sex|" type=""main"" xml:lang=""en""> Debate is a “mind sport” that requires fair and impartial judging. This study examines debate rounds at the Tournament of Champions from 2004 to 2009. We use a binomial choice model to estimate the marginal effects of regional bias, sex bias, and side bias, using transitive predictions to control for idiosyncratic quality. We find evidence of region and side bias but not sex bias. These factors may explain the significant number of nontransitive outcomes in the data. Finally, we suggest some policy remedies to mitigate the impact of biases and further applications of our methodology. (JEL C25, J16, J52, J71, L83)"

There is a wage premium of 25% for hitters and 14% for pitchers filing for arbitration. Interestingly, there is an additional premium for exchanging offers for hitters but not for pitchers. The additional premium in salary for hitters who exchange offers with their clubs amounts to 7%. (JEL J31, J52)"
J52|Die Macht kleiner Gewerkschaften: Sollte der Einfluss der Spartengewerkschaften eingedämmt werden?|Mit den fortgesetzten Streiks bei der Deutschen Bahn und der Lufthansa wächst der Unmut über die Spartengewerkschaften. Sollte der Gesetzgeber die Tarifpluralität und das Handeln kleiner Gewerkschaften beschneiden? Norbert Berthold, Universität Würzburg, plädiert für Tarifpluralität statt Tarifeinheit. In einer wirtschaftlich heterogener werdenden Welt müssten sich die Institutionen ändern. Die adäquate Antwort auf heterogenere Unternehmen seien betriebliche Bündnisse für Arbeit: Tarifpluralität nicht Tarifeinheit sei die passende Antwort. Wer Angst vor Spartengewerkschaften habe, sollte dafür sorgen, dass der Wettbewerb auf den Absatzmärkten entfesselt werde und der (Sozial-)Staat die Budgetrestriktion der Unternehmen nicht aufweiche. Auch Claus Schnabel, Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, sieht kaum überzeugende Gründe, warum die Tarifpluralität durch den Gesetzgeber beschnitten werden sollten. Solange die Funktionsfähigkeit des deutschen Systems der Arbeitsbeziehungen und der Lohnfindung nicht wirklich in Gefahr sei, wofür es derzeit keine Anzeichen gebe, bestehe kein Grund für gesetzgeberischen Aktionismus. Für Hagen Lesch, Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft Köln, weist dagegen Gewerkschaftskonkurrenz verschiedene Nachteile auf. Es werden u.a. das Solidarprinzip geopfert und die Lohnungleichheit zunehmen. Michael Fuchs, CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion, unterstreicht, dass es bei der Frage nach einer Eindämmung der Macht der Spartengewerkschaften nicht darum geht, einzelne Betriebe vor Streiks zu schützen, sondern um den Schutz der Gesamtwirtschaft und der Bürger im Bereich der Daseinsvorsorge vor Kollateralschäden. Wenn das gesamtwirtschaftliche Gleichgewicht auf dem Spiel stehe, müsse die Koalitionsfreiheit zurücktreten. Deshalb sei es an der Zeit, die Tarifeinheit gesetzlich zu normieren. Klaus Dauderstädt, dbb beamtenbund und tarifunion, plädiert dagegen für die Koalitionsfreiheit und gegen eine gesetzlich auferlegte Tarifeinheit.
J52|Streiks im öffentlichen Nahverkehr: Negative Folgen für Verkehr, Umwelt und Gesundheit|Streiks in der Luftfahrt und bei der Deutschen Bahn haben in jüngster Vergangenheit zu großem Unmut in der Bevölkerung geführt. Denn Streiks in diesen Verkehrsunternehmen der Daseinsvorsorge betreffen nicht nur die bestreikten Unternehmen selbst, sondern große Teile der Gesellschaft. In einer aktuellen Forschungsstudie haben wir die negativen Auswirkungen von Streiks im öffentlichen Nahverkehr für die Bevölkerung untersucht. Dafür haben wir detaillierte Daten über 77 Streiks im Nahverkehr in den fünf größten deutschen Städten – Berlin, München, Hamburg, Köln, Frankfurt – in den Jahren 2002 bis 2011 gesammelt. Die Hauptergebnisse sind: Das Verkehrsaufkommen nimmt an Streiktagen im morgendlichen Verkehr um 6 % zu. Dadurch steigt das Stauvolumen an und die Pendler verbringen 11% mehr Zeit auf den Straßen auf ihrem Weg zur Arbeit. Hochgerechnet verlieren Auto-Pendler an einem Streikmorgen in jeder Stadt 26.289 Stunden. Verkehrsunfälle häufen sich durch das erhöhte Verkehrskommen während der morgendlichen Stoßzeiten um 20%. Umweltschäden zeigen sich unter anderem an erhöhter Feinstaubbelastung, welche morgens an Streiktagen um 26% höher liegt als an normalen Tagen. Diese erhöhte Schadstoffbelastung der Luft führt bereits kurzfristig zu Gesundheitsproblemen. Anhand von Krankenhausstatistiken sehen wir, dass an Streiktagen häufiger Atemwegsprobleme, vor allem bei kleinen Kindern, diagnostiziert werden. Insgesamt haben Streiks im öffentlichen Nahverkehr weitreichende Folgen für die Allgemeinheit, in Form von erhöhtem Verkehrsaufkommen, mehr Unfällen, höherer Umweltbelastung bis hin zu gesundheitlichen Problemen. Die Kosten von Streiks im öffentlichen Nahverkehr für die Allgemeinheit übersteigen die Kosten der bestreikten Unternehmen allein durch die Effekte, die wir in dieser Studie messen, um ein Vielfaches.

J52|Die betriebliche Altersversorgung durch Entgeltumwandlung: Regulierung, Verbreitung und verteilungspolitische Aspekte|Employees have a right to use occupational pension schemes through earnings conversion. This is one means to compensate the declining level of benefits of the statutory pension insurance. The article presents the regulation of these schemes, discusses problems of the interplay of public subsidies and the system of social insurance, summarizes empirical studies dealing with the use of these schemes and provides an overview of collective agreements. It is argued that the heterogeneous spread of schemes and different conditions of use as well as the consequences for the system of social insurance point to need for reform. Reform is needed especially since the Grand coalition aims at strengthening occupational pensions. Die betriebliche Altersversorgung durch Umwandlung von Bruttoentgelt stellt eine Möglichkeit dar, individuell die durch das sinkende Leistungsniveau der Gesetzlichen Rentenversicherung entstehende Versorgungslücke zu schließen. Der Beitrag stellt die einschlägigen Regelungen der betrieblichen Altersversorgung durch Entgeltumwandlung vor, zeigt Probleme des Zusammenspiels der Förderung der Entgeltumwandlung mit der öffentlichen Sozialversicherung auf, fasst aktuelle Forschungsergebnisse zur Verbreitung zusammen und gibt einen Überblick über tarifvertragliche Regelungen. Insbesondere die uneinheitliche Verbreitung und unterschiedliche Nutzungsbedingungen sowie die Rückkoppelung dieser Form der Altersvorsorge mit dem Sozialversicherungssystem deuten auf Reformbedarf hin. Reformen sind umso wichtiger, weil sich die Große Koalition vorgenommen hat, die betriebliche Altersversorgung zu stärken.
J52|Médiation. Un nouveau service public aux entreprises|Alongside commercial courts and in an economic and financial crisis context, the French State fosters and supports the integration of mediation between firms and their economic partners. Three types of organizations resulted in Mediation between firms and banks (Médiation du crédit), Mediation between firms (Médiation Inter-entreprises) and Mediation between firms and public procurement (Médiation des Marchés publics). First we ask: what is the importance of this recent phenomenon and how does it change the way of doing business? Then these three types of mediation are described, changes in relations between these economic partners are underlined and answers about the sustainability of this State's mission are suggested.

J52|Bargaining for health: A case study of a collective agreement-based health program for manual workers|This paper examines the short- and medium-term effects of the PensionDanmark Health Scheme, the largest privately administered health program for workers in Denmark, which provides prevention and early management of work-related injuries. We use a difference-in-differences approach that exploits a natural variation in the program rollout across collective agreement areas in the construction sector and over time. The results show only little evidence of an effect on the prevention of injuries requiring medical attention in the first 3 years after the program was introduced. Despite this, we find evidence of significant positive effects on several labor market outcomes, suggesting that the program enables some work-injured individuals to maintain their work and earnings capacity. In view of its low costs, the program appears to be cost-effective overall.
J52|A study of expressive choice and strikes|The conventional explanation for strikes is that they are caused by an asymmetry of information about the profitability of the firm — union members are uninformed whereas management are informed. Instead, this paper builds a model of strikes where a perception of unfairness provides an expressive benefit to vote for a strike. The asymmetry of information is now reversed such that management are uninformed about the emotionality of union members. The model predicts that larger union size increases both wage offers and the incidence of strikes. An empirical test using UK data provides support for the predictions. In particular, union size is positively correlated with the incidence of strikes and other industrial actions, even when asymmetric information regarding profitability is controlled for.
J52|The Economic Cost of General Strikes in Nepal|This paper reviews the key aspects of general strikes and analyses the economic cost of such strikes in Nepal. Data analysis shows that average direct cost of general strikes stood at NRs. 1.8 billion per strike day and NRs. 27 billion per year at current prices during 2008-2013. The lost output per year accounted for 1.4 percent of the annual gross output. The total accumulated output loss due to general strikes in the five-year period amounted to NRs. 117 billion. With such losses, general strikes decelerated annual GDP growth rates in a range between 0.6 percentage point and 2.2 percentage points during the study period. The impact of general strikes was quick and significant on inflation and tourist arrival rates. The monthly inflation rate jumped to over 9 percent as a result of two-day general strike while the strike called for three or more days led to an inflation of more than 10 percent. Similarly, tourist arrival declined over a lag. However, gross fixed capital formation and foreign direct investment appeared to be less affected by general strikes, which might be due mainly to their bottomed out levels.
J52|Monitoring and efficiency wage versus profit sharing in a revolutionary context|We propose to study the trade off between two incentive strategies (moni- toring and efficiency wage versus profit sharing), operated by one firm to induce more efforts among employees. We deal first with a normal context where shirkers bear the risk to be fired. We consider second a particular revolutionary context where employees, even when they go on infinite strikes, would not be dismissed as inspired by the tunisian revolution and more precisely by social movements and general strikes occurring among tunisian workers after revolution. We prove, in the first context, that the profit share to be distributed at equilibrium is pos- itive and depending on the monitoring strategy. In this first context, the two strategies are shown to be strategic complements for low values of risk aversion and strategic substitutes for high ones. We show in the second framework, the emergence of a particular case where the capital holder increases the profit share distributed to employees relative to the one in the first context. This equilibrium profit share is proven to be independent of the monitoring strategy.
J52|L’azione del sindacato sul territorio|Da tempo, la ricerca e l’osservazione empirica hanno messo in evidenza il fiorire di un variegato insieme di attività - promosse dal sindacato o cui esso partecipa - accomunate dal fatto di essere radicate trasversalmente sul territorio, anziché essere basate sull’azione negoziale di categoria o nei luoghi di lavoro. Basandosi sull’esperienza italiana, l’articolo esplora il campo, con l’obiettivo di incominciare a identificare le diverse forme che queste pratiche possono assumere e le logiche cui si ispirano. Vengono quindi brevemente discusse le ragioni teoriche per ritenere che questo possa non rimanere un fenomeno marginale. Si fa infine cenno ad alcune delle possibili opportunità che ne possono derivare per un rinnovamento della capacità sindacale di rappresentanza.
