H60|Outline of a redistribution-free debt redemption fund for the euro area|Public debts in the euro area have increased sharply due to the economic crisis, and remain at historically high levels in several countries. In a monetary union, high-debt members represent a permanent threat to financial stability, as they are subject – even if fundamentally solvent – to significant rollover risk. Given the tight financial and economic links between member states, a liquidity crisis in one of them would trigger area-wide turmoil. While prudent fiscal policies are essential to address the legacy debt problem, it takes time for them to bring the debt back to (at least) pre-crisis levels. Against this background, the paper explores the feasibility and desirability of transferring a share of national public debts to a European Redemption Fund. In exchange, each country would transfer a yearly flow of resources to the Fund. We show that it is possible to design such a scheme so that it does not entail any ex-ante cross-country redistribution, while the euro area as a whole would benefit as the lowering of member states’ annual refinancing needs would improve financial stability. The fraction of mutualized debt would be fully redeemed over a reasonable number of years. The scheme would not jeopardize national commitment to debt reduction; if anything, market discipline would become more effective at the margin.
H60|The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2019 to 2029|In CBOâ€™s projections, the federal budget deficit is about $900 billion in 2019 and exceeds $1 trillion each year beginning in 2022. Because of persistently large deficits, federal debt held by the public is projected to grow steadily, reaching 93 percent of GDP in 2029. Real GDP is projected to grow by 2.3 percent in 2019â€”down from 3.1 percent in 2018â€”as the effects of the 2017 tax act on the growth of business investment wane and federal purchases decline sharply in the fourth quarter of 2019.
H60|Long-Term Implications of the 2019 Future Years Defense Program|If the Department of Defense (DoD) implemented the plans described in its 2019 Future Years Defense Program, its base budget (which funds normal peacetime activities) would climb from the $617 billion requested for 2019 to $735 billion (in 2019 dollars) in 2033, CBO estimates. Most of that increase would result from increased costs for military personnel and operation and maintenance. Base-budget costs would substantially exceed the share of funding that DoD has previously received under the Budget Control Actâ€™s funding caps in both 2020 and 2021, the final years subject to those
H60|Expired and Expiring Authorizations of Appropriations: Fiscal Year 2019|CBO reports annually to the Congress on programs funded for the current fiscal year whose authorizations of appropriations have expired and on programs whose authorizations will expire during the current fiscal year.
H60|Costs of Submarine Maintenance at Public and Private Shipyards|Public shipyards, which are owned and operated by the Navy, conduct a large majority of all submarine maintenance. To reduce delays at public shipyards, the Navy sent 29 submarines to private shipyards for Docking Selected Restricted Availability (DSRA) overhauls between 1993 and 2017. During that period, 117 DSRA overhauls were done at public shipyards. The overhauls conducted at private shipyards have been 31 percent less expensive, on average, by CBOâ€™s estimate. That gap has narrowed in recent years, but CBOâ€™s data include only one overhaul at a private shipyard after 2010.
H60|Updated Budget Projections: 2019 to 2029|CBO estimates that the deficit for fiscal year 2019 will be $896 billion, which is $1 billion less than the agency estimated in January. If current laws generally remained unchanged, deficits would average 4.3 percent of gross domestic product over the 2020â€“2029 period. Other than the period immediately after World War II, the only other time the average deficit has been so large over so many years was after the 2007â€“2009 recession.
H60|The Personnel Requirements and Costs of New Military Space Organizations|In this report, CBO considers five ways in which the Department of Defense (DoD) might be reorganized to increase its focus on space. The Administration has proposed three of themâ€”creating a new military service within the Air Force, a new combatant command, and a new development agencyâ€”but has provided few details.
H60|The Cost of Replacing Todayâ€™s Army Aviation Fleet|The U.S. Army has about 4,300 piloted aircraft. The replacement of three large helicopter fleets (Apaches, Black Hawks, and Chinooks) dominates the Armyâ€™s future aviation procurement costs. Because the Army made considerable investments in aircraft between 2007 and 2016, CBO projects that the annual costs of replacing the aircraft in the Armyâ€™s current fleet would decline during the 2020s, from about $4 billion in 2018 to about $1.5 billion in 2027. It would then rise to a peak of about $4.7 billion in 2032 before drifting downward between 2035 and 2045.
H60|An Analysis of the Presidentâ€™s 2020 Budget|By CBOâ€™s estimates, the federal deficit under the Presidentâ€™s budget would increase from $896 billion in 2019 to $966 billion (equal to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product, or GDP) in 2020. The cumulative deficit under the Presidentâ€™s policies would total $9.9 trillion over the 2020â€“2029 period, $1.5 trillion less than in CBOâ€™s baseline. (The Administration projects smaller deficits, totaling $7.3 trillion over that period.) Measured relative to the size of the economy, deficits would average 3.8 percent of GDP over the 10-year period, CBO estimates.
H60|An Evaluation of CBOâ€™s Past Deficit and Debt Projections|In this report, CBO analyzes its baseline projections of deficits and debt held by the public that were made each spring beginning in 1984. Each of those projections spanned the fiscal year already under way and five or 10 subsequent years.
H60|The 2019 Long-Term Budget Outlook|If current laws generally remained unchanged, CBO projects, large budget deficits over the next 30 years would drive federal debt held by the public to unprecedented levelsâ€”from 78 percent of gross domestic product in 2019 to 144 percent by 2049. That level of debt would be the highest in the nationâ€™s history by far, and it would be on track to increase even more.
H60|Long-Term Implications of the 2020 Future Years Defense Program|As part of the Presidentâ€™s budget request, the Department of Defense (DoD) develops a plan called the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) that reflects DoDâ€™s expectations about its programs and costs over the next five years. According to CBOâ€™s projections, if the plans described in the 2020 FYDP were implemented, DoDâ€™s costs would increase from the $718 billion requested for 2020 to $776 billion (in 2020 dollars) by 2034.
H60|An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 2019 to 2029|CBO estimates that the federal budget deficit for 2019 will be $960 billion. Under current law, budget deficits are projected to average $1.2 trillion a year between 2020 and 2029, boosting debt held by the public to 95 percent of GDP in that yearâ€”its highest level since just after World War II. Economic output is projected to grow by 2.3 percent in 2019, supporting strong labor market conditions that feature low unemployment and rising wages. After 2019, in CBOâ€™s projections, economic growth averages 1.8 percent per year, which is less than the historical average.
H60|Budgetary Outcomes Under Alternative Assumptions About Fiscal Policy|In this report, CBO provides additional information about how its most recent budget projections would change under alternative assumptions about future fiscal policies and estimates the possible budgetary outcomes.
H60|Financial Regulation and the Federal Budget|Financial regulation affects the federal budget directly through spending for programs that support the stability of financial institutions and through the taxes and fees that those institutions pay. Regulation also affects the budget indirectly through its effects on the economy. Those effects generate a trade-off: Increased financial regulation may lower the likelihood of a financial crisis and mitigate the severity of any crisis that occurred, but it may also raise the cost of financing for investments.
H60|The Effect of Government Debt on Interest Rates: Working Paper 2019-01|Under current law, the level of federal debt relative to gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to rise significantly over the next decade. The relationship between debt and interest rates plays a key role in CBO's economic and budget projections (especially long-term projections) and for dynamic analyses of fiscal policy, where the sensitivity of interest rates with respect to changes in the level of debt is vitally important. In this analysis, we use a reduced-form regression to estimate the relationship between projected federal debt and expected long-term
H60|Identifying Global and National Output and Fiscal Policy Shocks Using a GVAR|The paper contributes to the growing global VAR (GVAR) literature by showing how global and national shocks can beidentified within a GVAR framework. The usefulness of the proposed approach is illustrated in an application to the analysis of the interactions between public debt and real output growth in a multicountry setting, and the results are compared to those obtained from standard single country VAR analysis. We find that on average (across countries) global shocks explain about one third of the long-horizon forecast error variance of output growth, and about one fifth of the long run variance of the rate of change of debt-to-GDP. Evidence on the degree of cross-sectional dependence in these variables and their innovations are exploited to identify the global shocks, and priors are used to identify the national shocks within a Bayesian framework. It is found that posterior median debt elasticity with respect to output is much larger when the rise in output is due to a fiscal policy shock, as compared to when the rise in output is due to a positive technology shock. The cross country average of the median debt elasticity is 1.58 when the rise in output is due to a fiscal expansion as compared to 0.75 when the rise in output follows from a favorable output shock.
H60|Dynamic fiscal competition: a political economy theory|I develop a political economy theory of dynamic fiscal competition via public spending and debt. With internationally mobile capital, strategic policies generate two cross-border externalities that voters in each country fail to internalize: (1) an increase in public spending that bolsters capital accumulation but also (2) a race to the top in public debt which crowds out capital. The relative size of these two externalities varies with the number of financially integrated countries and interacts with the domestic political conflict between young and old voters. Despite residence based taxation, capital tax rates are lower under strategic policies than under coordination. Furthermore, they may decline with financial integration. Strategic policies lead to lower long run output and welfare relative to coordination but are preferred by subse-quent generations of voters if the number of financially integrated countries is low or the political weight of the young is high.
H60|On the Equivalence of Private and Public Money|"We develop a generic model of money and liquidity that identifies sources of liquidity bubbles and seignorage rents. We provide suffcient conditions under which a swap of monies leaves the equilibrium allocation and price system unchanged. We apply the equivalence result to the ""Chicago Plan,"" cryptocurrencies, the Indian de-monetization experiment, and Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). In particular, we show why CBDC need not undermine financial stability."

H60|Why Do Fiscal Multipliers Depend on Fiscal Positions?|The fiscal position can affect fiscal multipliers through two channels. Through the Ricardian channel, households reduce consumption in anticipation of future fiscal adjustments when fiscal stimulus is implemented from a weak fiscal position. Through the interest rate channel, fiscal stimulus from a weak fiscal position heightens investors'concerns about sovereign credit risk, raises economy-wide borrowing cost, and reduces private domestic demand. The paper documents empirically the relevance of these two channels using an Interactive Panel Vector Auto Regression model. It finds that fiscal multipliers tend to be smaller when fiscal positions are weak than strong.
H60|On the Cyclicality of Social Expenditure: New Time-Varying evidence from Developing Economies|This paper provides a novel dataset of time-varying measures of social spending cyclicality for an unbalanced panel of 45 developing economies from 1982 to 2012. More specifically, we focus on four categories of government social expenditure: health, social protection, pensions and education. We find that social spending has generally been acyclical over time in developing countries, with the exception of spending on pensions.However, sample averages high marked heterogeneity across countries with the majority showing procyclical behaviour in different social spending categories. In addition,by means of weighted least squares panel regressions with country and time effects, we find that the degree of social spending [pro]cyclicality is generally negatively associated with financial deepening, the level of economic development, trade openness, government size as well as political constraints on the executive.
H60|Returns to Investment in Education: The Case of Turkey|This paper estimates private and social returns to investment in education in Turkey, using the 2017 Household Labor Force Survey and alternative methodologies. The analysis uses the 1997 education reform of increasing compulsory education by three years as an instrument. This results in a private rate of return on the order of 16 percent for higher education and a social return of 10 percent. Using the number of children younger than age 15 in the household as an exclusion restriction, the analysis finds that returns to education for females are higher than those for males. Contrary to many findings in other countries, private returns to those working in the public sector are higher than those in the private sector, and private returns to those who followed the vocational track in secondary education are higher than those in the general academic track. The paper discusses the policy implications of the findings.
H60|Liquidity, the government balance sheet, and the public sector discount rate|This paper provides a review of the modern finance literature examining how liquidity affects the private sector demand for real assets and financial securities. This literature shows that when firms evaluate risky investments they distinguish fundamental earnings risk and liquidity risks, and choose discount rates that link the discount rates they use to the liquidity and structure of their balance sheets. The government can mimic their behaviour by adopting a procedure that (i) ranks projects by discounting their expected costs and benefits by a low ‘fundamental earnings’ discount rate, perhaps 4 – 5 percent; and (ii) imposes a second ‘liquidity’ discount based on the government’s balance sheet structure and debt objectives that simultaneously determines the quantity of investments. By more closely copying private sector practice, this approach will directly link the quantity of investments that a government makes to the discount rates it uses. It will also enable the New Zealand government to reduce the discount rates it uses to evaluate long horizon investments without compromising its aim of ensuring the public and private sectors adopt a common method of evaluating investment projects.
H60|Practising Subnational Public Finance in an Emerging Economy: Fiscal Marksmanship in Kerala|Abstract Our paper analyses the subnational public finance practices in one of the States in India –Kerala- and estimate the fiscal marksmanship. Fiscal marksmanship is the analysis of fiscal forecasting errors. Kerala, though well known for its achievements in human development outcomes, is facing fiscal stress within the rule-based fiscal framework and innovating policy tools to achieve a revenue-led fiscal consolidation. We have examined the Budget Estimates, Revised Estimates and Actuals for the macro-fiscal variables from the Kerala State Budgets, during the period 2011-12 to 2016-17 to analyse the significant deviation between the projections and realizations of the State finances. We found that the magnitude of forecasting errors was relatively significant in case of tax revenue. While partitioning the sources of errors in the budgetary forecasting in Kerala, we found that the random components of the error were larger than the systematic components for all the macro-fiscal variables, except for own revenue, grants and capital expenditure. This has three macro policy implications. One, the volatility in intergovernmental fiscal transfers can affect the stability of finances at subnational level. Two, the State needs to identify innovative policy tools in Additional Resource Mobilisation (ARM) to maintain the human development achievements. Three, within the rule-based fiscal framework, State has to innovate financing strategies for strengthening growth-inducing capital infrastructure formation.
H60|The new ESCB methodology for the calculation of cyclically adjusted budget balances: an application to the Portuguese case|The analysis of public finance developments relies, amongst other indicators, on estimates of cyclically adjusted budget balances (CABs), which correct headline government balances for business cycle fluctuations. The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) endorsed in late 2018 a new aggregate methodology for the calculation of CABs, developed by Bouabdallah et al., 2019. This paper presents the application of this new cyclical adjustment methodology to the Portuguese case, providing details on the calculation of the underlying fiscal-to-base and base-to-output elasticities. Additionally, it describes the output gap estimations used to assess the cyclical position of the economy. The paper also presents the analytical tool developed by Bouabdallah et al., 2019 to disentangle the drivers of structural fiscal developments, providing details on its application to Portugal.
H60|Why Do Fiscal Multipliers Depend on Fiscal Positions?|The fiscal position can affect fiscal multipliers through two channels. Through the Ricardian channel, households reduce consumption in anticipation of future fiscal adjustments when fiscal stimulus is implemented from a weak fiscal position. Through the interest rate channel, fiscal stimulus from a weak fiscal position heightens investors’ concerns about sovereign credit risk, raises economy-wide borrowing cost, and reduces private domestic demand. We document empirically the relevance of these two channels using an Interactive Panel Vector Auto Regression model. We find that fiscal multipliers tend to be smaller when fiscal positions are weak than strong.
H60|Moving Into the Slow Lane|Growth in much of CESEE will remain healthy by post-crisis standards, but has passed its peak. We expect most economies to slow from here, reflecting weaker external demand and domestic capacity constraints. Global trade tensions, structural weakness in the eurozone and Brexit all pose downside risks to our forecasts.
H60|Cyclical Behavior of Fiscal Policy in the Western Balkans|This paper studies the cyclical behavior of fiscal policy in the Western Balkans region, investigating empirically the fiscal policy response to business cycles for the period 2003-2016. Although there is a large empirical literature which has found that fiscal policy in developing countries is pro-cyclical, not many studies are found on the Western Balkans region, with only a few done at country level. We apply the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter and other filters to measure the potential output and output gap for each of the respective Western Balkans countries. By performing country regressions we find that one of the main determinants fiscal pro-cyclicality in the WB6 region is the quality of the government. We conduct a series of structural vector auto-regressions (SVAR) for each of the countries in an attempt to obtain further evidence on the reaction of fiscal policy to the business cycle.
H60|Does the structural budget balance guide fiscal policy pro-cyclically? Evidence from the Finnish Great Depression of the 1990s|In this article, I evaluate the challenges related to the European Commission’s output gap method of calculating the structural budgetary position, and assess its bottom-up alternatives in the EU’s fiscal framework using the Finnish data for the years 1984-2014. The results reinforce the impression of the limited capacity of the output gap method to predict cyclical changes in real time and suggest that using the output gap method to steer fiscal policy tends to lead to a procyclical policy (stimulus in upturns and austerity in downturns). The bottom-up assessment methods that are based on discretionary fiscal policy measures appear to work better, and using them to steer the fiscal policy could make the policy more countercyclical.
H60|Der Wohlfahrtstaat als Grundbestandteil des modernen demokratischen Staatsgefüges<BR>[The welfare state as a basic component of the modern democratic state structure]|Defining the welfare state is not a simpleminded task. Actually, there are numerous definitions which try to reflect at least some of the basic characteristics of the welfare state or its objectives and its functions. For some, there is primarily an institutional parameter, for others there are functional issues which have to be firstly indicated and for others, the ideological and political factors determine the definition and the attitude towards the welfare state. Apart from all these crucial ascertainments, there are some basic fundamental characteristics and values of the welfare state which render it as a precondition of the existence of the modern state. Unquestionably, it reflects a distinct part of the state but most importantly, it comprises a prerequisite for its existence. This is the exact aim of this paper; to surpass the theoretical diversifications and to find the fundamental common ground which forms the indispensability for the existence of the welfare state.
H60|The Fallacy of Fiscal Discipline|Fiscal discipline is commonly evaluated on the basis of the debt-GDP ratio, which exhibits a stock variable measured relative to a flow variable. This way of monitoring debt solvency is arguably not consistent with transversality conditions obtained from optimizing macroeconomic frameworks. In this paper we consider a wealth-based sustainability index of government debt policy derived from a baseline endogenous growth model. We calculate the index from 1999 onwards for countries in which the after-growth real interest rate is positive, consistently with the theoretical setup. Results are radically different from common wisdom. We show that the fiscal position is sustainable for both Germany and Italy, and strongly unsustainable for both Japan and France. Policy implications of our findings are discussed.
H60|La convergence de la comptabilité de l’Etat avec les normes IPSAS. Le cas du Maroc<BR>[Convergence of state accounting with IPSAS standards. The case of Morocco]|The State's accounting system must have an accrual accounting system in order to prepare financial statements that record changes in the heritage value, explain and reflect the way in which the state budget is managed both in revenue and expenditure and thus reflect the exact financial situation of the state at a given time. Once the accounting system of the State reflects the exact financial situation it can serve as a source of reliable and transparent financial information addressed, published and accessible to any interested person (citizen, politician, international financial institution ...). This article proposes to examine the impact of the adoption of IPSAS on Moroccan public finances.
H60|State-Owned Enterprises Leverage as a Contingency in Public Debt Sustainability Analysis: The Case of the People's Republic of China|We reflect state-owned enterprises’ (SOE) leverage within the standard debt sustainability assessment framework. Based on company data and the interest coverage ratio as a measure of debt at risk, aggregate baseline projections and fan charts gauge SOE debt as a contingent liability to the public sector. We find that SOE leverage in the People’s Republic of China has grown to a large liability that deserves the urgent attention it has been receiving from the authorities. While there is no room for complacency, there is no need for panic either; even if authorities had to step into mop up as much as 20% of SOE debt at risk gone bad, this would appear to be manageable at roughly 2.7% of the gross domestic product in 2016 or 5.5% by 2021. These findings are reflective of discretionary assumptions about future developments in the SOE sector and the broader economy—including baseline conditions premised on preventive government action to slow borrowing—that are adjustable to reflect analysts’ prerogatives and expectations.
H60|Enhancing Credibility and Commitment to Fiscal Rules|The objective of this paper is to derive the characteristics of an effective fiscal governance framework, focusing on the incentives that ensure a commitment to the fiscal rules. We study this problem with the use of econometric tools, complementing this analysis with formal modelling through the lens of a dynamic principal-agent framework.
H60|Subnational government investment and dynamic fiscal rules|The paper tries to deal with issue how to increase local government investment finance without jeopardizing fiscal position of local government as well as overall macroeconomic stability. One of the key challenges is to resolve an everlasting conflict between central and subnational government tier related to different perspectives of each jurisdiction. Namely, central government level is more concerned for macroeconomic position and usually is more inclined to centralise debt management and limit borrowing powers of subnational government. On the other hand, subnational government utilizes borrowing for large local communal infrastructure needs but faces short-term perspective of political mandate, which demands control aimed for prevention of excessive borrowing. In addition, heterogeneity of local governments in terms of fiscal capacity and fiscal position makes general deficit sharing mechanisms as poor solution to intergovernmental fiscal management. General deficit sharing mechanisms usually base on fixed budgetary limits, which do not enable control for weak subnational government units and exert too high limitations for more progressive ones. Introduction of more precise dynamic fiscal rules, which account for specific fiscal standing of each local government and fiscal system, would provide incentive for more productive borrowing policies. Such mechanism overcomes short-term financing perspective that comes from short-term political horizon and mid-term focus of budgetary documentation. The results of the research brings clear policy recommendations. It is possible to replace existing deficit sharing mechanisms by more productive and efficient dynamic system. This would bring not just improved debt management control but provide incentive for more efficient borrowing.
H60|Paying for the Ageing Crisis : Who, How and When?|In many countries population ageing creates an implicit public debt. That is, if policies remain unchanged, the public debt will ultimately become unsustainable. This paper explores the optimal way to achieve debt sustainability. In particular, it asks when policy reforms should be made, how policies should be changed and which generations should make which contributions. As regards timing, we find that policy reform should anticipate future demographic change. As regards policy instruments, we find that optimal policy reform features changes in all available instruments. This implies less consumption of all types of goods; only pure public goods consumption may escape a reduction. The labour supply functions of the young and the old determine the allocation over policy instruments. In particular, the more elastic is the labour supply of the young, the smaller should be the increase in the tax rate on labour income; the more elastic is the labour supply of the old, the larger should be the reduction in transfers to the elderly. As regards generations, we find that the old share relatively little in the fiscal burden; future generations share more or less than the young, depending on future population size. In addition, we find that the change of the public debt is not a given, but a feature of optimal policies. In general,
H60|El sistema de transferencias fiscales sociales en Uruguay: un análisis de su composición y comportamiento cí­clico|In this paper, we analyze the performance over the economic cycle of different items of social-type fiscal expenditures in Uruguay during the period 1988:1 to 2015:4. The study is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a descriptive analysis of the regulations and composition governing the current system of public transfers in Uruguay. Section 3 analyses the performance of the structure of the tax-transfer system in Uruguay. Section 4 details the behavior of the different tax transfers for Uruguay, identifying their pro- or countercyclical nature. In section 5, we analyze how the way in which fiscal transfers have been updated or indexed has been able to influence the cyclical behavior of public transfers. Finally, section 6 outlines conclusions and policy recommendations.
H60|Towards a more comprehensive assessment of fiscal space|The prolonged sluggishness in the world economy since the global financial crisis has led to growing calls for a reorientation of macroeconomic policies toward more supportive fiscal measures. Such calls inevitably invite the question of how much fiscal space governments actually have. This paper provides a systematic review of the most popular definitions and measures of fiscal space. It examines the evolution of fiscal space measures and discusses the pros and cons of each measure. It then outlines several key factors that could help to further strengthen existing approaches and allow a more comprehensive assessment of fiscal space. By illustrating how different measures paint considerably different pictures of an economy’s fiscal space, the paper underscores the need to use a dashboard of indicators.
H60|Strong Growth Amid Increased Negative Risks|The outlook for growth in CESEE remains generally positive, but downside risks have increased significantly since our last forecast.

H60|How does democracy affect public debt? Evidence from the Arab world|This paper investigates the impact of democracy on public debt in the Arab world over the period 2002-2013. The results confirm the existence of an inverted-U relationship between democracy and public debt. This supports the hypothesis that some level of democracy is required to control public debt.
H60|Uniting European fiscal rules: How to strenghten the fiscal framework|The current European fiscal framework is highly complex. The multitude of fiscal rules and the discretion in their enforcement precludes an effective oversight and weakens the effectiveness of fiscal rules substantially. Against this background, we present a proposal for a careful refocusing of the framework to promote fiscal sustainability. The proposal is centered around an expenditure rule as an annual operational target supplemented by a debt-correction factor and a multi-purpose adjustment account which implements a medium-term structural balance rule. Together with a significant reduction in exemptions and escape clauses as well as less discretion in the imposition of sanctions, the proposal increases transparency and efficacy of fiscal rules at the European level.
H60|On the design of stabilising fiscal rules|"Utilising data of the EU28 Member States for the period 1996–2015, this paper confirms the findings of previous studies that the stipulation of fiscal rules reduces fiscal volatility and consequently contributes to macroeconomic stability. Yet, we document that this result only holds for rules which are designed to be unaffected by the current state of the business cycle, i.e. which are ""a-cyclical"". Those can, e.g. be budget balance rules that set ceilings in cyclically adjusted terms or expenditure rules that set a limit relative to potential instead of current output. Furthermore, the stringency of fiscal rules amplifies their stabilising effect. Actual year-to-year compliance with fiscal rules seems to play no systematic role, such that effects of the rules can be observed even if they are not complied with year-to-year. Overall, our paper suggests that strong, properly designed numerical rules act as an anchor for fiscal policy makers and contribute to more stable discretionary fiscal policy."
H60|The government spending multiplier, fiscal stress, and the zero lower bound|The recent sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone was characterized by a monetary policy, which has been constrained by the zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates, and several countries, which faced high risk spreads on their sovereign bonds. How is the government spending multiplier affected by such an economic environment? While prominent results in the academic literature point to high government spending multipliers at the ZLB, higher public indebtedness is often associated with small government spending multipliers. I develop a DSGE model with leverage constrained banks that captures both features of this economic environment, the ZLB and fiscal stress. In this model, I analyze the effects of government spending shocks. I find that not only are multipliers large at the ZLB, the presence of fiscal stress can even increase their size. For longer durations of the ZLB, multipliers in this model can be considerably larger than one.
H60|Curvas Laffer de la Tributación en Colombia|En este documento se estiman las curvas de Laffer para los impuestos al trabajo, al capital y al consumo en Colombia. Se utiliza un modelo neoclásico de crecimiento con capital humano del tipo insinuado por Trabandt y Uhlig (2011), el cual es calibrado con la información de las cuentas nacionales para el período 1994 a 2015. Los resultados permiten, por una parte, comparar las tarifas impositivas efectivas actuales sobre los factores de producción frente aquellas que maximizaría los recaudos del gobierno y, por consiguiente, derivar el espacio fiscal que eventualmente tiene el gobierno por el lado de los impuestos. Por otra, permiten simular ejercicios de la política fiscal mediante el uso de sus principales instrumentos y, finalmente, contrastar las tarifas tributarias efectivas y las curvas de Laffer en Colombia frente a la de los países de la OECD. **** This paper estimates the Laffer curves in Colombia for taxes on labor income, capital gains, and consumption. We used a neoclassical growth model with human capital, as that suggested by Trabandt and Uhlig (2011), inputting data from the national accounts system, for the period 1994 to 2015. The results permit to compare the current effective tax rates on the factors of production against that which would maximize the government's revenues, and therefore derive the government's possible taxrelated fiscal space. Furthermore, they help us perform some fiscal-policy simulations employing the policy's main tools, and they let us contrast Colombia's effective tax rates and Laffer curves with those of the OECD countries.
H60|Dynamic analysis of budget policy rules in Japan|We construct an endogenous growth model with public capital and endogenous labor supply and examine quantitatively the welfare effects of fiscal consolidation on the Japanese economy. We consider two modes of fiscal consolidation: the adjustment to a new lower target of the debt-to-GDP and deficit-to-GDP ratios. We find that the debt and deficit reduction rules based only on government consumption and investment expenditure cuts improve households’ welfare. This improvement in households’ welfare becomes large as the speed of fiscal consolidation rises. Further, reductions in the target debt-to-GDP or deficit-to-GDP ratio generate larger welfare gains. We also discuss the welfare effects of fiscal consolidation with tax increases and transfer payment decreases.
H60|Parameter heterogeneity, persistence and cross-sectional dependence: new insights on fiscal policy reaction functions for the Euro area|A number of novelties have emerged in the study of the discretionary fiscal policy within the Euro area during the last decade. Among the others, the availability of up-to-date information on fiscal indicators for the years following the Great Recession, the introduction of cutting-edge econometric methods, and a renewed interest about the sustainability of fiscal policy and public debt. The aim of this paper is to address the challenges posed by the estimation of the discretionary fiscal reaction function for the Euro area. We exploit recently introduced testing and estimation strategies for heterogeneous dynamic panels with cross-sectional dependence and propose a new parsimonious approach. Using real-time data over the period 1996-2016, we investigate whether the fiscal policy reaction function is still a benchmark after the Great Recession. We find evidence of strong cross-sectional dependence in the panel, and clear support to a valid cointegration relationship among the main determinants of the function. Newly added covariates, such interest rate spreads, come out to play a relevant role in explaining discretionary actions.
H60|Simulating U.S. Business Cash Flow Taxation in a 17-Region Global Model|This paper uses the Global Gaidar Model to simulate replacing a territorial corporate income tax with a wealth tax imposed in the form of a destination-based Business Cash Flow Tax. According to the model, the reform produces, over a decade, increases in the capital stock, GDP, and pre-tax wages for high- and low-skilled workers of 20.5 percent, 6.8 percent, 6.3 and 7.5 percent, respectively. Young workers benefit greatly from the change, and welfare loss for retirees is limited. The initially revenue neutral tax reform raises enough additional revenue over time to permit a reduction in personal income tax rates.
H60|Reforming fiscal institutions in resource-rich Arab economies: Policy proposals|This paper traces the evolution of fiscal institutions of Resource Rich Arab Economies (RRAEs) over time since their pre-oil days, through the discovery of oil to their build-up of oil exports. It then identifies challenges faced by RRAEs and variations in their severity among the different countries over time. Finally, it articulates specific policy reforms, which, if implemented successfully, could help to overcome these challenges. In some cases, however, these policy proposals may give rise to important trade-offs that will have to be evaluated carefully in individual cases.
H60|Budgetary Traffic Lights|In this paper, we develop a framework to assess and communicate short-term risks to the general government budget. The project is motivated by the need to keep budgetary developments under constant surveillance and to timely identify sources of fiscal stress, such that the government can mitigate or even eliminate these by taking appropriate measures. We consider a concept of fiscal risk defined in terms of the expected deviation of the budget balance from its fiscal target. Our framework consists of three parts. First, we collect data input from various sources and identify potential one-off effects. Second, we forecast end-of-year values for revenue and expenditure items of the budget. We design a forecasting method that combines a simple heuristic method of time series forecasting with expert assessments. Third, we use the forecasted output to evaluate and communicate the fiscal risk level for a current fiscal year. Specifically, we use a concept of traffic light colors to report expected deviations of fiscal outcomes from their budgeted targets.
H60|Expired and Expiring Authorizations of Appropriations|CBO reports annually to the Congress on programs funded for the current fiscal year for which authorizations of appropriations have expired, and programs for which authorizations of appropriations will expire during the current fiscal year.
H60|Cash and Accrual Measures in Federal Budgeting|The federal budget is a measure of the overall scope and magnitude of federal activities that involve the spending or collection of money. The net costs of those activities are shown in the budget mostly on a cash basis, but some transactions are recorded using accrual accounting. This report discusses the relative merits of cash and accrual measures and explores the implications of expanding the use of accrual measures for decisionmaking purposes.
H60|Federal Debt and the Statutory Limit, January 2018|After incorporating the anticipated effects of recent tax legislation and actual spending and revenue amounts in December into its calculations, CBO now projects that the Treasuryâ€™s ability to borrow additional funds using extraordinary measures will be exhaustedâ€”and it will most likely run out of cashâ€”in the first half of March 2018. If that occurred, the government would be unable pay its obligations fully, and it would delay making payments for programs and activities, default on its debt obligations, or both.
H60|The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028|If current laws governing taxes and spending generally remained unchanged, the federal budget deficit would grow substantially over the next few years, CBO projects, with accumulating deficits driving debt held by the public to nearly 100 percent of GDP by 2028. That amount would be far greater than the debt in any year since just after World War II. In CBOâ€™s projections, real GDP growth is relatively strong this year and next, as recent changes in fiscal policy add to existing momentum.
H60|An Analysis of the Presidentâ€™s 2019 Budget|The cumulative deficit under the Presidentâ€™s policies would total $9.5 trillion over the 2019â€“2028 period, $2.9 trillion less than in CBO's baseline. Over that period, the deficit would range from 3.2 percent to 4.5 percent of GDP, averaging 3.7 percent. As a result, federal debt held by the public would increase from 78 percent of GDP this year to 86 percent in 2028.
H60|The 2018 Long-Term Budget Outlook|In CBOâ€™s projections, federal budget deficits grow substantially over the next several years in relation to the size of the economy, stabilize for a few years, and then grow again over the rest of the 30-year period. If current laws generally remained unchanged, the growing deficits would raise federal debt held by the public from 78 percent of gross domestic product this year to nearly 100 percent by the end of the next decade and 152 percent by 2048.
H60|How Changes in Economic Conditions Might Affect the Federal Budget|To show the budgetary effects of scenarios in which economic conditions differ from those in the agencyâ€™s current economic forecast, CBO has developed â€œrules of thumbâ€ that provide a rough sense of how changes in four key economic variablesâ€”productivity growth, labor force growth, interest rates, and inflationâ€”would affect revenues, outlays, and deficits. The agency has released an interactive workbook along with the report that allows users to create their own alternative economic scenarios and see how those scenarios might affect the federal budget.
H60|The Deficit Reductions Necessary to Meet Various Targets for Federal Debt|CBO has examined various illustrative scenarios in which the federal government makes debt held by the public smaller than it would be if current laws remained generally unchanged. In those scenarios, the primary deficitâ€”that is, the deficit excluding net outlays for interestâ€”is reduced to make debt equal 41 percent, 78 percent, or 100 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) over the next 15 to 30 years. Two broad strategies are used: reducing the primary deficit by a constant share of GDP over time and reducing the primary deficit by an increasing share of GDP.
H60|Funding for Overseas Contingency Operations and Its Impact on Defense Spending|Since 2001, the Department of Defense (DoD) has received about $2.2 trillion to supplement the base-budget funding provided in its regular, annual appropriationsâ€”amounting to about 20 percent of DoDâ€™s appropriations over that time. Almost all of that sum has been designated for overseas contingency operations (OCO) that began after 9/11.
H60|The Long-Term Budget Outlook Under Alternative Scenarios for Fiscal Policy|In CBOâ€™s most recent extended baseline projections, federal debt held by the public rises from an amount equal to 78 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018 to 118 percent of GDP in 2038. This report expands on those projections by showing how the federal budget and the nationâ€™s economy would evolve under three alternative scenarios. In those scenarios, laws would be changed to continue certain policies now in place, leading to even higher debt.
H60|An Analysis of the Navy's Fiscal Year 2019 Shipbuilding Plan|Every year, the Navy submits a report that describes the planned inventory, purchases, deliveries, and retirements of the ships in its fleet for the next 30 years. The 2019 shipbuilding plan calls for expanding the fleet to 355 battle force ships. CBO estimates that the plan would cost an average of $28.9 billion per year (in 2018 dollars) over 30 yearsâ€”or 80 percent more than the $15.8 billion the Navy has received, on average, in annual appropriations in recent decades. CBOâ€™s estimate of the cost of the plan is higher than the Navyâ€™s.
H60|The Cost of Replacing Todayâ€™s Air Force Fleet|The U.S. Air Force has about 5,600 aircraft, which range in age from just-delivered to 60 years old. Many of those aircraft are nearing the end of their service life. In this report, CBO estimates that replacing those aircraft would cost an average of $15 billion a year in the 2020s. That figure would rise to $23 billion in the 2030s and then fall back to about $15 billion in the 2040s. In comparison, appropriations for procuring new aircraft averaged about $12 billion per year between 1980 and 2017 (in 2018 dollars).
H60|Options for Reducing the Deficit: 2019 to 2028|Since 2007, federal debt held by the public has more than doubled in relation to the size of the economy. The Congress faces an array of policy choices as it confronts the challenges posed by such large and growing debt. To help inform lawmakers, CBO periodically issues a volume of optionsâ€”this yearâ€™s installment presents 121â€”that would decrease federal spending or increase federal revenues over the next decade.
H60|CBO's Long-Term Social Security Projections: Changes Since 2017 and Comparisons With the Social Security Trustees' Projections|Each year, CBO updates its projections of the Social Security systemâ€™s finances. Compared with projections made in June 2017, the agencyâ€™s latest projections indicate a slight improvement in the financial outlook for Social Security. The projected 75-year actuarial balance remains at âˆ’1.5 percent of gross domestic product (that is, a deficit of 1.5 percent). As a percentage of taxable payroll, the projected actuarial balance has improved slightly from âˆ’4.5 percent to âˆ’4.4 percent. CBO also compares its projections with those of the Social Security Trustees.
H60|The ECB’s fiscal policy|Abstract While the ECB helped mitigate the euro crisis in the aftermath of Lehman, it has stretched its monetary mandate and moved into fiscal territory. This text describes and summarizes the crucial role played by the ECB in the intervention spiral resulting from its bid to manage the crisis. It also outlines ongoing competitiveness problems in southern Europe, discusses the so-called austerity policy of the Troika, comments on QE and presents two alternative paths for the future development of Europe.
H60|Paraguay: Is Good Macro Policy Enough to Ensure Adequate Resilience to Adverse External Shocks? How Does It Compare to Other Emerging Markets?|This paper assesses the resilience of Paraguay’s economic and financial stability to external shocks. To this end, the paper expands on previous work by Rojas-Suarez (2015) and constructs a resilience indicator that has two dimensions: the first refers to the capacity of an economy to withstand the impact of a shock while the second signals the capacity of national authorities to quickly respond to its adverse effects. By applying the methodology of the resilience indicator to 22 emerging market economies, this paper reaches two main conclusions for Paraguay. The first is that the authorities’ efforts to improve the country’s macroeconomic stance since 2003 have paid off and will continue to do so if a new adverse external shock hits the economy. From the perspective of the second dimension of resilience, just as in the pre-global crisis period, Paraguay is now one of the most resilient countries among emerging markets. The second conclusion is that the first dimension of resilience, the economy’s capacity to withstand the impact of a shock, was not very strong in the pre-global financial crisis period and, relative to other emerging markets, has not improved since then. In the absence of reforms, Paraguay’s relatively weaker performance in structural variables (export concentration, national savings ratio, tax revenue collection, and financial depth) will severely limit the benefits of a strong macroeconomic stance to deal with the adverse effects of external shocks.
H60|What Do We Know about the Effects of Austerity?|The literature on fiscal multipliers is far from having reached an agreed upon conclusion. One result, however, seems very robust: in OECD economies, fiscal consolidations based upon expenditure cuts are much less costly than those performed on the tax side. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we review recent evidence which considers multi-year fiscal plans. Analyzing multi-year plans is a better way of studying the effects of fiscal policy because governments typically adopt multi-year budget laws. Second, we illustrate alternative theoretical explanations for our findings and we discuss which ones seem more appropriate in different cases.
H60|The Optimum Quantity of Capital and Debt|In this paper we consider an optimal taxation problem in an incomplete markets model to study the optimal quantity of capital and debt. The government commits itself ex-ante to a tax schedule and government debt. In contrast to most of the existing literature these instruments are chosen to to maximize agents' discounted present value of lifetime utility. Whereas the literature mainly focuses on characterizing the steady state which maximizes welfare, we characterize and compute the optimal policy along the full transition path. In particular our characterization takes into account that the optimal long-run policy depends on capital, debt and taxation during the transition path. We show theoretically that it is optimal to equalize the pre-tax return on capital and the rate of time preference in the long-run, i.e. the capital stock satisfies the modified golden-rule. Quantitatively we find that the tax on capital is around 3 percent in the long-run. Labor is taxed at a much higher rate where the precise number depends on the labor supply elasticity. For standard choices for this elasticity we find a labor tax rate of almost 40 percent to be optimal in the long-run. The reason for such a hight tax rate on labor income is that labor income is risky. Taxing this risky income and redistributing it back through lump-sum transfers improves ex-ante welfare in the long-run. Transfers and the optimal level of debt along the transition are chosen to equalize the amount of redistribution over time. Initially capital is taxed higher than in the long-run since it is inelastically supplied whereas labor is taxed less than in steady state.
H60|Debt Sustainability and Welfare along an Optimal Laffer Curve|A recent literature on sovereign debt sustainability (see Trabandt and Uhlig (2011) and Mendoza et al. (2014)) has produced Laffer curve calculations for Eurozone countries. These calculations have been car- ried out mainly in a quasi-static fashion by considering policy experi- ments where individual tax rates are permanently set at a new value while keeping all others constant. However, such fiscal policy design disregards complementarities among tax instruments as well as the po- tential for altering tax rates during the transition to the steady-state in a manner which exploits expectations. Our paper addresses this issue by considering policy experiments where fiscal policy is set op- timally and fiscal instruments are jointly varied along the transition to steady-state. Through the Ramsey problem we map the maximum amount of tax revenues a government can further raise to the welfare costs of the associated tax distortions. We label this relation as the ‘optimal Laffer curve’. We show that tax revenue and welfare gains relative to the policy experiments examined by the previous literature are dramatic.
H60|Reforming Fiscal Institutions in Resource-Rich Arab Economies: Policy Proposals|This paper traces the evolution of fiscal institutions of Resource Rich Arab Economies (RRAEs) over time since their pre-oil days, through the discovery of oil to their build-up of oil exports. It then identifies challenges faced by RRAEs and variations in their severity among the different countries over time. Finally, it articulates specific policy reforms, which, if implemented successfully, could help to overcome these challenges. In some cases, however, these policy proposals may give rise to important trade-offs that will have to be evaluated carefully in individual cases.
H60|Enhanced Fiscal Integration in the EMU? Proceedings of the joint workshop, organised by the European Commission, the European Stability Mechanism and the German Council of Economic Experts on 19 September 2017|This volume presents the proceedings of the workshop organised by the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs (ECFIN) jointly with the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the German Council of Economic Experts (GCEE) on 19 September 2017 in Brussels. The workshop aimed at raising awareness about the fiscal policy architecture in Europe and its potential future developments and contributing to the expert debate on these issues. It consisted of two sessions with two panels each. Short presentations of expert or research contributions were followed by a debate with the audience. The first session was devoted to a review of the European experience with fiscal policy coordination and governance, including perspectives on the euro area fiscal stance. The second session focused on fiscal risk sharing and stabilisation in the euro area. It explored different options of a fiscal stabilisation function and their design.
H60|Public Assets: What's at Stake? An Analysis of Public Assets and their Management in the European Union|Based on a study conducted by a private consultant, this paper sheds light on a large selection of public assets across the EU and compares their management practices. The paper shows that these assets amount to around €16.5 trillion in 2015, of which 60% are non-financial assets while the rest consists of financial assets in the form of public stakes. A large number of these stakes are in fully public, domestic and unlisted firms and consist of public services and utility providers. As regards non-financial assets, after acknowledging important data gaps, the paper provides evidence on selected fixed assets and natural resources. A review of managerial practices reveals that central governments tend to maintain control of strategic decisions for most assets - although ownership can be shared with private investors and/or local governments - and that operational decisions may be taken by local governments or public companies. Regarding investment strategies, while financial asset portfolios are being reduced, the paper indicates that public investments in some strategic non-financial assets continue. As policy implications the paper underlines the need to improve data availability as well as enhance transparency in the management of these assets.
H60|Sovereign Default and Monetary Policy Tradeoffs|The paper is organized around the following question: when the economy moves from a debt-GDP level where the probability of default is nil to a higher level—the “fiscal limit”—where the default probability is non-negligible, how do the effects of routine monetary operations designed to achieve macroeconomic stabilization change? We find that the specification of the monetary policy rule plays a critical role. Consider a central bank that targets the risky rate. When the economy is near its fiscal limit, a transitory monetary policy contraction leads to a sustained rise in inflation, even though monetary policy actively targets inflation and fiscal policy passively adjusts taxes to stabilize debt. If the central bank targets the riskfree rate, on the other hand, the same transitory monetary contraction keeps inflation under control but leads output to contract for a prolonged period of time. The comparison shows that sovereign default risk puts into sharp relief the tradeoff between inflation and output stabilization.
H60|The Political Economy of Debt and Entitlements|This paper presents a dynamic political-economic model of total government obligations. Its focus is on the interplay between debt and entitlements. In our model, both are tools by which temporarily powerful groups can extract resources from groups that will be powerful in the future: debt transfers resources across periods; entitlements directly target the future allocation of resources. We prove five main results. First, debt and entitlement are strategic substitutes in the sense that constraining debt increases entitlements (and vice versa). Second, if entitlements are unconstrained, it is sometimes beneficial not to constrain debt (even in the absence of shocks that require smoothing). Third, if debt is unconstrained, it is beneficial to limit entitlements but not to eliminate them. Fourth, debt and entitlements respond in opposite ways to political instability and, in contrast with prior literature, political instability may even reduce debt when entitlements are endogenous. Finally, we identify a possible explanation for the joint growth of debt and entitlements.
H60|Structural Budget Balances in Oil-rich Countries: The Cases of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Russia|This study aims to analyze discretionary fiscal policy in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Russia for the period of 2003-2015 using structural fiscal balance (SBB). SBB takes into the consideration the permanent component of oil revenue and therefore clearly defines the discretionary fiscal position and the aggregate demand effect of fiscal policy. The structural balances in Azerbaijan and Russia experience deficit for the most of the analyzed period. The moderate level of SBB surplus is observed in Kazakhstan. The estimated SBBs also demonstrate that fiscal policies tend to be mainly pro-cyclical in Kazakhstan and Russia. Azerbaijan conducted counter-cyclical fiscal policy for the half of the investigated period. Moreover, governments gave more importance to economic stabilization in 2009 due to the global financial crises.

H60|Managing a Century of Debt|This paper provides a consistent series for the Irish national debt since the foundation of the state. It also provides a continuous series for bond yields over the same period. The paper examines the factors behind the fluctuations in the debt burden over almost a century. The management of the debt burden by the Irish authorities has evolved over time, seeking to minimise both the burden on the economy and the risks which the debt represented to the state. The paper also examines how the cost of borrowing for the Irish government compared to that for the UK and, since the break with sterling, for Germany. This cost of borrowing was, in turn affected by developments in the domestic economy.
H60|Come rifare Maastricht. L’Europa e la stampa|This work is fully integrated and unitary. It starts by analyzing the 2019 Stability Law and its financial accounts, which are illustrated, discussed and shared. How to reform the Maastricht parameters is then examined in some depth. One of its major conclusions is that the fiscal system should be reoriented toward a national model, similar to the one in vigour in Italy until the 1970s. Most of the work is concerned with this discussion, conducted by reporting all the articles, published and unpublished, sent to ItaliaOggi during this and the previous Legislature (2014-2018). Two papers follow, illustrating what the Bank of Italy should but cannot do, being “entangled” by BCE policy. The papers had in fact been sent to important seminars held in the Bank of Italy (2017 and 2018), but they were both rejected. Then other papers, published in Mondoperaio, Nuovi Lavori, and various newspapers, essentially delve deeper into the macroeconomic question. Here, following Keynes, it is shown that investment and amortisation are now more or less equal in the major European nations, so that net saving equates with the sum of trade surpluses and/or public deficits. This is a fundamental question, since trade surpluses are unsustainable, so public deficits become necessary and the rate of interest is compelled to zero, both in the public and the private system. A period of serious reforms is advocated, following what was thought and taught during most of the past century by the Italian School of public finance. This is illustrated by discussing my comments in a book edited by GORINI, LONGOBARDI, VITALETTI, entitled “Economia, Politica, Cultura nell’Italia del XX Secolo. Il pensiero critico di Sergio Steve”, FrancoAngeli, 2018.
H60|The Policy Mix in the US and EMU: Evidence from a SVAR Analysis|We use a SVAR approach to the effects of fiscal and monetary policies, as well as their interactions (policy mix) for the US and the Euro Area (EMU). Overall, our results show that these two cases are different from each other. First, while in the case of the US there is evidence of Keynesian monetary policy, the same is not true in the case of the EMU. Second, considering the effects of the global economic and financial crisis, there is evidence of non-Keynesian fiscal policy in the case of the EMU (expansionary fiscal consolidation), while it does not hold in the case of the US. Third, there is evidence supporting the traditional inverse relationship between monetary policy interest rates and inflation in the case of the US, whereas in the case of the EMU there is a price puzzle (frequent in SVAR studies). Fourth, the baseline model seems to be robust in the case of the US, when considering the effects of the economic and financial crisis 2007-2009, while the opposite holds in the case of the EMU. However, in both cases, the policies seem to act as complements. Another similarity appears when analysing the relationship between public spending and taxation, where there is evidence supporting a fiscal retrenchment.
H60|On the design of stabilising fiscal rules|"Utilising data of the EU28 Member States for the period 1996-2015, this paper confirms the findings of previous studies that the stipulation of fiscal rules reduces fiscal volatility and consequently contributes to macroeconomic stability. Yet, we document that this result only holds for rules which are designed to be unaffected by the current state of the business cycle, i.e. which are ""a-cyclical"". Those can, e.g. be budget balance rules that set ceilings in cyclically adjusted terms or expenditure rules that set a limit relative to potential instead of current output. Furthermore, the stringency of fiscal rules amplifies their stabilising effect. Actual year-to-year compliance with fiscal rules seems to play no systematic role, such that effects of the rules can be observed even if they are not complied with year-to-year. Overall, our paper suggests that strong, properly designed numerical rules act as an anchor for fiscal policy makers and contribute to more stable discretionary fiscal policy."
H60|Empirical analysis of the decisions of German citizens for environmental protection distinguishing between reward and public award: Results from a survey among citizens in a small German city|The core questions of this paper are: What are the determinants for the provisions of some public goods like environmental protection work by citizens and how can this work be delegated to the citizens? On the basis of a survey's micro data, we show which motives are relevant to the choice between a public award with no monetary value and a symbolic payment of €10. For these purposes, we apply the binary choice models. The results reveal several significant impacts where the age as continuous variable shows a stable quadratic-like shape with firstly decreasing and then increasing vigilance for moneyless participation in environmental protection regarding the age of a person. The intrinsic motivation itself seems to be another crucial positive factor. For example, the higher planed hypothetic free time measured in hypothetic hours for environmental protection, the higher the probability that this individual indeed would do it. Moreover, the one's reputation may influence positively the honorary contribution to environmental protection. On the other hand, the probability for an active honorary environmental protection is smaller by young people in training and in absence of social situations. Interestingly, we found that the gender plays no significant role in this context. Hence, we can provide an elaboration of an incentive system for environmental commitment of Kassel's citizens which can be a base for further regional economic policy in this context.
H60|Has Fiscal Rule changed the Fiscal Marksmanship of Union Government?|We analyse the fiscal marksmanship of the macro-fiscal variables of Union Government ex-ante and ex-post to the formulation of fiscal rules in India. The fiscal marksmanship is the accuracy of budgetary forecasting. The fiscal rules have been legally mandated in India in the form of fiscal responsibility and budget management Act (FRBM Act) in 2003, with a criteria of fiscal-deficit to GDP threshold ratio of 3 per cent and gradual phasing out of revenue deficit. Using Theil's inequality coefficient (U) based on the mean square prediction error, the paper estimates the magnitude of errors in the budgetary forecasts in India during the period ex-ante and ex-post to fiscal rules, and also decomposed the errors into biasedness, unequal variation and random components. The decomposition of errors is to analyze the source of error in both the regimes. Our results found that in both regimes, the proportion of error due to random variation has been significantly higher, which is beyond the control of the forecaster. In other words, the error due to bias of the policy maker in preparing the Union Budget has been negligible in the period ex-ante and ex-post to fiscal responsibility and budget management (FRBM) Act in India. This result has significant policy implications especially in the context of repeal of 2003 FRBM Act in India and the Union Government has announced clauses for a `New FRBM Act' in India in the Finance Bill 2018.
H60|Costa Rica: Restoring fiscal sustainability and setting the basis for a more growth-friendly and inclusive fiscal policy|Consecutive years of primary deficits have led to mounting public debt of almost 50% of GDP, one of the fastest increases in Latin America over the last decade. Government attempts to restore fiscal health have been undermined by a gridlocked Congress. While only minor reforms have been enacted to contain spending, efforts to curb tax evasion and increase the efficiency of the tax administration are commendable. However, increases in tax revenue have been unable to match mandated increases in spending. As a consequence, sovereign debt ratings have declined to below investment level, and the negative outlook on Costa Rica’s debt signals increasing financing costs. Against this backdrop, the risk of a fiscal crisis is increasing, particularly as global financial conditions become less favourable and debt structure has shifted towards increased reliance on floating rates and dollar-denominated bonds. Enacting a three year fiscal consolidation programme of one percentage point of GDP each year, will enable debt to stabilise at current levels by 2032. The current draft bill to strengthen public finances – Ley de Fortalecimiento de las Finanzas Públicas – proposes a comprehensive fiscal reform package, with measures on both the revenue and the spending side, as well as a fiscal rule. It needs to be complemented with additional measures to contain revenue earmarking. In addition, reducing excessive fragmentation of the public sector would allow the Ministry of Finance to regain control of the budget. There is also room to reduce expenditure on remuneration of public sector workers, one of the fastest growing expenditure items and a source of income inequality. The proposed fiscal rule should be strengthened, including introducing a multi-year expenditure framework and a fiscal council. Debt management should be modernised by stepping up communication with markets and reducing the number of benchmark securities. Over time, improving social spending efficiency and quality as well as modifying the tax structure away from social security contributions and enlarging the tax base would allow for a much stronger contribution of fiscal policy to growth and equity.
H60|The case for fiscal rules|This paper estimates the effects of fiscal institutions on fiscal policy outcomes, addressing issues related to measurement and endogeneity in a novel way. Recently developed indices, based on partially ordered set theory, are used to quantify the stringency of fiscal rules. Identification of their effects is achieved by exploiting the exogeneity of institutional variables (checks and balances, government fragmentation, inflation targeting), which are found to be relevant determinants of fiscal rules. Our two-stage least squares estimates for (up to) 74 countries over the period 1985–2012 provide strong evidence that countries with more stringent fiscal rules have higher fiscal balances (lower deficits), lower interest rate spreads on government bonds, and lower output volatility.
H60|The impact of fiscal rules on sovereign risk premia: International evidence|We examine whether adopting a numerical fiscal rule framework to guide fiscal policy helps reduce sovereign risk premia in a sample of advanced and developing countries for 1985–2012. We address the self-selection problem of policy adoption by applying propensity score matching methods. The results suggest that adopting fiscal rules reduces sovereign risk premia.
H60|Experience of Greece on Recapitalization of Banks, Marketing Management and Personnel Retraining in Conditions of Economic Recession|The article covers instruments which are aimed at strengthening of global and national financial and credit systems, encouraging banks recapitalization, techniques of marketing management of financial and credit sector development focused on ensuring financial stability of banks. The authors consider also basic methods of banking market services regulation, point out specific issues of bank management and human recourse management development in conditions of economic recession. Greek experience of anti-crisis measures has revealed key factors and peculiarities of the changes that were brought by the global financial crisis of 2008-2010 to development of banking systems of the countries implementing the model of “catch-up development”. The experience of Greece in development and application of regulatory instruments has shown that if in the period of long sustainable economic growth for countries having emerging markets an opportunity to use the methods and control systems of developed countries can be visible, then with the appearance of negative scenarios system limitations come to the fore and the risks associated with high degree of uncertainty are realized.
H60|Federalism, fiscal space, and public investment spending: do fiscal rules impose hard-budget constraints?|The core emphasis of rules-based fiscal legislation at the subnational level in India is to achieve debt sustainability through a numerical ceiling on borrowing and the use of borrowed resources for public capital investment by phasing out revenue deficits. Using the Arellano Bond Panel estimation, this chapter examines whether the application of fiscal rules has resulted in an increase in the fiscal space for public capital investment spending in major Indian states. This analysis shows that by controlling other factors, there is a negative relationship between fiscal rules and public capital investment spending at the state level during the rules-based fiscal regime.
H60|Extending the Public Sector in the ICES Model with an Explicit Government Institution| This paper aims to present an extension of the ICES model to capture the public sector. Departing from a demand system mainly derived from the GTAP model, ICES-XPS model disentangles the private and the public actors. The paper reviews the changes in both the database and the model equations following the existing literature and considering the availability of data as well. The model is then tested with a series of simple experiments to highlight its contribution to economic analysis in which the public sector may play an important role. Finally, we show the flexibility in the closure rule of the public sector that allows addressing different policy research questions.
H60|The Impact Of Public Debt On The Twin Imbalances In Europe: A Threshold Model|Recent empirical research rejecting twin deficits in indebted countries and current account imbalances adjustment in Europe led to the idea to test the twin imbalances at different public debt-to-GDP intervals. The analysis covers 14 EU countries over the time period 1995-2012. A panel data threshold model with fixed effects estimates two debt-toGDP thresholds (40.2% and 96.6%), which determine three debt-to-GDP intervals in the twin relationship. If public debtto-GDP is less than 40.2%, the model determines a negative relationship (twin divergence) between budget balance and current account. Twin deficits (surpluses) are confirmed exclusively if debt-to-GDP is in the interval between 40.2% and 96.6%. A twin divergence is also confirmed if public debt-to-GDP is more than 96.6% (e.g., as in Greece and Italy). The results confirm that increased indebtedness in European countries contributed to their current account imbalance adjustment.
H60|‘Till Debt Do Us Part’:Financial Implications of the Divorce of the Irish Free State from the UK, 1922-6|In this paper, we discuss the unresolved apportionment of national debt when Ireland exited the UK in 1922. Using archival sources and contemporary accounts, we estimate that the British claim on Ireland in 1925 amounted to between 80 and 100 per cent of GNP at a time when the political stability of Ireland was already fragile. We describe the process of how this contingent liability, arising from the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, was ultimately waived in a Financial Agreement in 1925 at the expense of an unchanged border with Northern Ireland. The Irish government also sought, but failed, to secure protection against discrimination for Catholics in Northern Ireland as part of the agreement. While for the Irish Government, this settlement may have represented a political failure, the economic outcome of the agreement transformed the economic position of the new Irish State from one of potential insolvency into one of viability.
H60|Financial Dependence Of Federal Transfers In The Municipalities Of Mexico, Dependencia Financiera De Las Transferencias Federales En Los Municipios De Mexico|The aim of this research is to analyze the relationship between financial dependence of municipalities, their degree of marginalization and debt. Through three indicators (own revenue, dependency and debt) and according to the degree of marginalization, the results show that the level of dependence increases for all municipalities in the study period, especially in the municipalities of very high marginalization however, in municipalities with lower degree of marginalization also increase the proportion of external financing
H60|Fiscal Rules: Towards a New Paradigm for Fiscal Sustainability in Small States|This study contends that Caribbean countries cannot adequately surmount their fiscal and debt challenges in the absence of binding rules that are geared toward entrenching fiscal discipline, curbing fiscal procyclicality, and improving budget transparency and credibility. Distilling global lessons and taking due cognizance of Caribbean countries' idiosyncrasies, the paper explores key technical, operational and institutional issues in the design, implementation, and monitoring of fiscal rules that might be relevant for Caribbean countries that currently do not have legislated rules. Results from simulations carried out to determine welfare effects and the extent of volatility of key macroeconomic variables under various fiscal rules scenarios suggest that of the different types of simulated fiscal rules, expenditure rules perform best in terms of reducing macroeconomic volatility, and in that regard, appear to be the most welfare-enhancing. This is believed to be the first study to carry out such a simulation exercise for Caribbean countries. The findings of the study evince useful insights for policymakers on how to improve the design and conduct of fiscal policy for better fiscal and, by extension, development outcomes.
H60|Fiscal Space under Demographic Shift|In this paper we quantitatively explore implications of ageing demographic structure for government revenue raising capacity through lens of fiscal space. We base our analysis on dynamic general equilibrium, overlapping generations model calibrated to data from Japan and USA.We first map out fundamental-based fiscal limit using the Laffer curve approach, and then compute fiscal space in terms of budgetary room between the current revenue and the maximum revenue defined by the peak of Laffer curves. We demonstrate that the evolution of underlying demographic structures plays an important role in shaping a country’s fiscal limit and fiscal space. There will be significant contractions in fiscal space in Japan and USA when the two countries enter their late stage of demographic transition in 2040. In particular, the results from the model calibrated to Japan indicates that an increase in old-age dependency ratio to over 70 percent can reduce Japan’s fiscal space by 36 percent. When factoring in the increased fiscal cost of existing commitments to the age pension program, the net fiscal space for Japan turns negative.
H60|Fiscal Stabilization and Growth: Evidence from Industry-level Data for Advanced and Developing Economies|Medium-term growth can be enhanced by fiscal stabilization. However, to date, no systematic effort has been made to study the specific channels through which fiscal stabilization affects growth. This paper examines the effect of fiscal stabilization on industrial growth and how this effect depends on different technological characteristics. It does so by applying a difference-in-difference approach to an unbalanced panel of 22 manufacturing industries for 55 advanced and developing economies over the period 1970-2014. The results suggest that fiscal stabilization fosters growth in industries with: i) higher external financial dependence and lower asset fixity; ii) higher degree of labor intensity; iii) higher investment lumpiness and relationship-specific input usage. These effects tend to be larger during economic recessions. The results are robust to different measures of fiscal stabilization and the inclusion of various interactions between a broad set of macroeconomic variables and production technologies.
H60|Public Investment and Golden Rule of Public Finance in an Overlapping Generations Model|This paper develops an overlapping generations model with debt-financed public investment. The model assumes that the government is subject to the golden rule of public finance and that households are Yaari-Blanchard type. It is shown that the growth-maximizing and utility-maximizing tax rates do not satisfy the Barro tax rule, which is equal to the output elasticity of public capital. Furthermore, we show that both tax rates positively depend on longevity, with an aging population increasing debt per GDP. This result captures a tendency of increasing debt per GDP under population aging in the real world.
H60|Is All Infrastructure Investment Created Equal? The Case of Portugal|In this paper we analyze the effects of infrastructure investment on economic performance in Portugal using a newly developed data set. We employ a vector autoregressive approach to estimate the elasticity and marginal products of investments on twelve different types of infrastructure investment on private investment, employment and output. We find that the largest long-term accumulated effects come from investments in railroads, ports, airports, health, education, and telecommunications. For all of these infrastructures, the output multipliers are sizable enough to suggest that these investments would pay for themselves in the form of additional tax revenues. We find also that for investments in airports and health infrastructures the bulk of the effects are short-term demand side effects while for railroads and health the bulk of the effects come from long-term supply side effects. Finally, investments in health and airports show a clear pattern of decreasing marginal returns with railroads, ports, and telecommunications showing a relative stable pattern. In terms of the other infrastructure assets, we find that the economic effects of investments in municipal roads, highways, and electricity and gas are not significant or relevant. Investments in national roads, waste and waste water, and refinery infrastructures have positive economic effects but not large enough to also have a positive budgetary effects. Clearly, not all infrastructure investments are created equal along several and rather relevant dimensions from a policy perspective.
H60|Is public debt harmful towards economic growth? New evidence from South Africa|The issue of whether public debt is useful or harmful towards economic growth is one of the most prevailing debates in the literature with no consensus existing on the subject matter. The study employs the ARDL model to examine the long-run and short-run effects of public debt on economic growth for South African data spanning a period between 2002:q2 to 2016:q4. Our sensitivity analysis consists of re-estimating our empirical regressions using two sub-samples dataset corresponding to the pre-crisis period (i.e. 2002:q1 to 2007:q2) and the post-crisis period (i.e. 2007:q3 to 2016:q4). All estimated regressions unanimously find negative long-run debt –growth relationship although the short-term effects are unclear with some evidence of a positive short-run relationship between the time series specifically in the post-crisis period. Overall, our empirical results have some useful ramifications towards policymakers.
H60|"Aging population in Asian countries |Lessons from Japanese experiences |"|Many Asian countries are facing a rapidly aging population. An aging population will cause social security expenditures in national budget to rise. Currently, fiscal conditions in Asian countries are relatively stable, but governments will be required to control social security expenditures to maintain fiscal soundness. Japan established universal health insurance and pension insurance systems in 1961. In 1973, the so called gfirst year of high-level social welfare h, free medical services for the elderly and the indexlinked pension system were started. Currently, in Japan, the aging rate, which measures the share of the population aged 65 years old or over, has reached 27%, while the country continues to face fiscal deficits and government debt has been accumulating. Other Asian countries have started to develop their countries f social security systems, so it is time to review the lessons that can be drawn from Japanese experiences relating to social security expenditures and national budget conditions. In this paper, we focused on Japanese social insurance systems, especially health insurance and pension insurance systems, and addressed some lessons to Asian countries. Lessons from health insurance system are: (1) It is important to determine public contributions f share of medical expenses not by patients f age, but based on their income and assets, (2) To establish universal health insurance system, it is important to ensure the stable financial revenues of insurers with subscribers who are unable to enroll with other insurers. Lessons from the pension insurance system are: (1) It is important for the government to manage sharp acceleration of inflation in such a way as to not increase pension benefits, thereby preventing the financial burdening of future generations, (2) The pension system should be designed based on the long-term projections of the population aging rate and total fertility rate, and policies should be adapted accordingly, (3) It would be preferable that the government take a gMacro-economic slide h pension system which is a fixed contribution schedule coupled with a mechanism to rebalance pension finances through automatic adjustment of benefits.
H60|Fiscal devaluation and economic activity in the EU|In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, a fiscal devaluation (hereafter: FD), understood as a shift in taxation from labor to consumption, has been debated as a possible tool of restoring competitiveness in peripheral countries of the Euro area. We contribute to this debate. Based on a set of panel and spatial panel models for the EU 27 over the period 1995 – 2014, we find that FD increases value added in exports, improves net exports, accelerates GDP and employment growth, and decelerates labour costs growth. These effects are nonlinear: stronger in the members of the Euro area and weaker in countries with either more coordinated or more centralised wage bargaining process, or more generous unemployment benefits. Most importantly, FD turns out not to be a beggar thy neighbour policy, at least in the EU. In our sample ‘cooperative effect’ of unilateral FD, which is beneficial for neighbouring countries, dominates by far ‘competitive effect’, which goes at the expense of other countries’ competitiveness. Admittedly, FD implemented in one country can benefit other countries, provided that they are strongly integrated in global value chains. These findings are robust to changes in the estimation methods, the sample composition, the set of explanatory variables and the selection of a spatial weight matrix.
H60|The effects of Fiscal Consolidations: Theory and Evidence|We investigate the macroeconomic effects of fiscal consolidations based upon government spending cuts, transfers cuts and tax hikes. We extend a narrative dataset of fiscal consolidations, finding details on over 3500 measures. Government spending and transfer cuts are much less harmful than tax hikes. Standard New Keynesian models match our results when fiscal shocks are persistent. Wealth effects on aggregate demand mitigates the impact of a persistent spending cut. Static distortions caused by persistent tax hikes cause larger shifts in aggregate supply under sticky prices. This channel explains different sizes of multipliers found in fiscal stimuli compared to consolidation plans.
H60|Malaysia’s economic success story and challenges|Malaysia has sustained over four decades of rapid, inclusive growth, reducing its dependence on agriculture and commodity exports to become a more diversified, modern and open economy. GDP per capita is now higher than in a number of OECD economies, while poverty and income inequality have declined considerably. Growth has also been remarkably resilient in the face of external shocks. Going forward, the Malaysian government's 11th Malaysia Plan (2016-20) emphasises the need for greater inclusiveness. Continued, gradual fiscal consolidation is a key policy priority, building on earlier energy and food subsidy rationalisation and on the introduction of a goods and services tax. So is continued prudent monetary and financial policy. Further reforms are needed for Malaysia to become a high-income nation around 2020: productivity growth needs to be reinvigorated through various structural reforms while growth needs to become more inclusive. Succès et défis économiques de la Malaisie La Malaisie a connu plus de quatre décennies de croissance rapide et inclusive, réduisant sa dépendance à l'égard de l'agriculture et des exportations de matières premières, pour devenir une économie plus diversifiée, moderne et ouverte. Le PIB par tête est désormais plus élevé que dans un certain nombre d'économies de l'OCDE, alors que la pauvreté et les inégalités de revenu ont considérablement reculé. La croissance s'est également montrée résiliente face aux chocs externes. Pour l'avenir, le 11ème plan du gouvernement malaisien (2016-2020) souligne l'importance d'une plus grande inclusion. La poursuite graduelle de la consolidation budgétaire est une priorité majeure, dans la foulée de la rationalisation des subventions énergétiques et alimentaires et de l'introduction d'une taxe sur les biens et services. La continuation d'une politique monétaire et financière prudente en est une autre. La Malaisie doit réformer plus avant pour devenir un pays à haut revenu autour de 2020: diverses réformes sont nécessaires pour stimuler la croissance de la productivité et pour une croissance plus inclusive.
H60|Spending reviews in Ireland – Learning from experience|This article examines the Irish experience of spending reviews and seeks to identify key lessons that should enhance the effectiveness of this process both in Ireland and in other OECD countries. Since the beginning of the economic and financial crisis, spending reviews have played an important role in Ireland’s efforts to restore expenditure policy to a more sustainable footing. However, the purpose of future reviews will move from improving the deficit position to ensuring all expenditure is considered when Government is making budget decisions. The purpose of spending reviews is to increase the fiscal space available to government for new, high priority, policies. By systematically examining baseline expenditure using available evidence and data, the increasing tendency to focus only on incremental improvements in expenditure can be countered. Spending reviews should be used to further embed the principles of expenditure efficiency and effectiveness into the wider budget process. This can be facilitated through extending the availability of relevant evaluations and performance information and ensuring such evaluations become central to the budgetary process.
H60|How do resource-driven economies cope with the oil price slump? A comparative survey of ten major oil-exporting countries|The oil price slump of about 50% since 2014 has had a detrimental effect on oil-exporting emerging market economies (EMEs), potentially threatening to trigger social unrest in countries that had benefited from the oil price boom for more than a decade. We provide a first descriptive account of the policy reactions of central banks and governments of eight important oil-exporting EMEs and compare them with those of two oil-exporting advanced economies, allowing us to distinguish three patterns: One group of countries has so far successfully defended its exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar, the reference invoicing currency (Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates). A second group gave up resistance to mounting market pressures and carried out step devaluations or switched to a floating exchange rate (Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Nigeria and Angola). A third group of countries continued to let their currencies float (Mexico, Canada and Norway), with the stable long-term relationship between the exchange rate and commodity export prices qualifying these currencies as “commodity currencies.” We conclude that EMEs featuring peg-like regimes and saddled with limited structural diversification, modest fiscal and external buffers as well as weak institutional conditions for capital controls are unlikely to be able to uphold their exchange rate choices if they suffer a major and sustained adverse terms-of-trade shock, and should opt for flexibility sooner rather than later. While declining oil prices may imply a degree of passive diversification, a proactive long-term strategy to develop a more diversified economic structure in good times could at least partly reduce the need for buffers.
H60|How would a fiscal shock in Germany affect other European countries? Evidence from a Bayesian GVAR model with sign restrictions|In this paper we analyze the international effects of a fiscal policy shock in Germany on other European countries. To that end we use a flexible version of a Bayesian global vector autoregression (GVAR) model and a dataset with broad country coverage comprising a wide range of macroeconomic and financial variables. Our results suggest a comparatively strong response in a majority of European economies to such a shock. In particular, we provide evidence that a deficit-financed expansionary government spending shock in Germany generates long-lasting positive cross-border output spillovers. In the case of the euro area periphery and Central, Eastern and Southeastern (CESEE) economies, these effects may be transmitted via the financial channel since financial variables such as equity prices and private sector credit significantly increase in response to the assumed fiscal shock in Germany. Upward effects on consumer prices, by contrast, are limited to core euro area countries. When looking at the effects of an expansionary tax cut shock instead of those of a spending-driven fiscal shock, we identify cross-border output spillovers of a similar magnitude but with a lower degree of persistence; in the case of CESEE economies, these results are also characterized by more estimation uncertainty. Finally, we also provide evidence for considerable cross-country heterogeneity in fiscal spillovers; for instance within CESEE, output responses to a fiscal shock in Germany are strongest in Croatia, Hungary and Slovenia.
H60|Natural Budget Deficit and Natural Political Cyclicality|In this paper we present a framework showing how governments use debt to flaunt competency and increase their votes and the chances of reelection; however, a cognitive bias, namely, the cyclist bias, would disrupt government’s computations. In this model the government’s budget deficit as well as changes in debt would be evaluated in a steady state. We show that debt is a double-edged sword and the more the government relies on debt to show its competency, the more the people understand the manipulations at work behind such measures. On equilibrium, due to cognitive bias in the behavior of individuals, the government will choose budget deficit which it is increasing, leading to the fall of the current incumbent and ultimately the opposition party would take over the power. The model can provide theoretical foundations for what the empirical study of Brender & Drazen (2008) concludes: expansive fiscal policies before elections won't increase reelection probability.
H60|Fiscal Instruments for Sustainable Development: The Case of Land Taxes|Economists argue that land rent taxation is an ideal form of taxation as it causes no deadweight losses and has therefore no adverse effects on growth. Nevertheless, pure land rent taxation is rarely applied and, if so, revenues collected remain rather small. Property taxes share some of the characteristics of land taxes and generate small revenues, inter alia also in developing countries. This report revisits the case of land taxation for developing countries that are often characterized by large informal sectors, low public spending and poor tax or land administration institutions. We first provide a comprehensive overview of direct and indirect welfare and development effects of land rent taxation, ranging from increased efficiency in the fiscal system and in financing infrastructure, over environmental effects due to changes in land use to distributional effects. Barriers and constraints of implementing land taxes are also discussed, particularly the existence of a land registry, the role of administrative costs, compliance, evasion and political economy aspects. We extend this review with an in-depth analysis of current land tax systems and reform options in six case study countries. For four countries, we provide an additional quantitative analysis based on micro-simulations with household data that allow us to quantify revenues and distributional effects of various land tax regimes. Our main finding is that land taxes provide a large and untapped potential for financing governments. Formalizing and securing land tenure by establishing a land registry is a pre-condition that further provides substantial co-benefits for various sustainable development objectives. Widespread concerns regarding the feasibility and costs of implementing land taxes are rarely valid, as land taxes are in these aspects comparable to other taxes. Political will and investment in the quality of administration are, however, decisive. Considering some key principles in designing the land tax can help reduce administrative costs, avoid adverse distributional effects and increase compliance.
H60|Effects of Fiscal Policy Shocks in CE3 Countries (TVAR Approach)|The real output deterioration, high fiscal deficits and increased sovereign debt burden represents key phenomena that affected the maneuverability of fiscal authorities in the early crisis years. Controversy between fiscal sustainability and fiscally driven economic recovery fueled a large number of academic and policy discussions about the appropriate response of governments to the crisis challenges. Empirical literature provides mixed evidence about the effects of fiscal policy adjustments on the macroeconomic performance. Moreover, pro-cyclical patterns in fiscal policies of many countries during the pre-crisis period did not reveal clear lessons learned that would be beneficial for fiscal authorities during the crisis years. In the paper we examine effects of the fiscal policy shocks in CE3 (the Slovak Republic, the Czech Republic and Hungary) within different stages of the business cycle by employing threshold vector autoregression (TVAR) model. We calculate fiscal multipliers and generalized impulse-response functions to assess the responsiveness of the real output to the fiscal policy adjustments. The main objective is to determine whether effects of the fiscal policy shocks differ during expansion and recession. Our results indicate that the size of fiscal multipliers and responsiveness of the real output are generally higher for spending fiscal shocks while effects of revenue fiscal shocks are much less dynamic in all three countries. Moreover, results differs between upper (expansion) and lower (recession) regime as well as for the per-crisis and crisis periods.
H60|Fiscal policy in developing countries: Do governments wish to have procyclical fiscal reactions?|This study aimed to analyze the intentionally fiscal position of the governments of developing countries. Our results suggest that a significant proportion of developing countries adopts counter-cyclical positions. However, forecasting errors weak their positions. Results lead to conclude that if developing countries want to increase the effectiveness of their fiscal policies, they must build the skills of their forecast offices, and enhance the political and institutional framework governing the budget process.
H60|Own or inherited? The effect of national fiscal rules after changes of government|In order to get to know more precisely the way national fiscal rules work, in our study we tried to differentiate the signaling function from the limiting one in regard to the operation of the rules. The former occurs when a government introduces fiscal rules to show its commitment to a disciplined fiscal policy, while the latter refers to the fact that rules constitute a true obstacle for budgetary policy. Through an empirical examination on our own database, we considered only the observations when the reigning government responsible for fiscal policy differed from the previous government responsible for its establishment; in this way we measured the effect of the limiting function the rules had. The results of our panel econometric study prove that fiscal rules can contribute to disciplined fiscal policy after a change in government, in times of economic upturn. All this, however, does not mean that the signaling function would be useless; quite the contrary. Our results, in line with the literature, indicate that the double functions of the rule complement one another. The government that introduces the rule is mostly already committed to a disciplined policy, and wishes to signal this in the short term. With the appearance of new governments, however, the rule changes its function and promotes disciplined economic activity efficiently in the long term.
H60|évaluation de l’espace budgétaire au Maroc : une analyse empirique à travers l’approche de l’effort fiscal<BR>[fiscal space in Morocco: an estimation of fiscal effort using panel data model]|This paper,investigate the question of the evaluation of the Moroccan fiscal space by the way of the notion of fiscal effort. This issue seems to be necessary in a context as that of Morocco where taxes generate most of the resources of the State budget. The fiscal effort is an unavoidable indicator because it simultaneously allows to assess the capacity to exploit fiscal resources and to situate actual government revenues in relation with level of levy determined by the structural factors. In order to do this, we used a random-effect model, during the 1990-2012 period, the main results: A positive fiscal effort reflects an actual levy level higher than the expected levy given the structural characteristics of the country. From this we can deduce that the revenue space is well exploited.
H60|The Econometrics of the EU Fiscal Governance: is the European Commission methodology still adequate?|Following the 2005 regulations emending the Stability and Growth Pact with the introduction of country-specific objectives in structural terms, the EU fiscal governance is based on the concept of Potential Output, the highest level of production an economy can sustain without incurring inflationary pressure. Potential Output is an unobservable quantity and, for this reason, it must be estimated. There are many techniques to obtain an estimate of the potential of an economy, each of which with pros and cons. The methodology adopted by the European Commission and EU Member States, while consistent with most of the recent economic and econometric theory, is still not robust enough to give a unique and irrefutable measure on which to base EU’s fiscal framework. In this paper, we challenge the EC's approach showing its failure to adequately capture the relation between inflation and cyclical unemployment, the Phillips curve, in estimating the trend unemployment. Should fiscal policy continue to be based on this concept, further extension of the methodology must be implemented in order to obtain more robust estimates.
H60|Is public debt harmful towards economic growth? New evidence from South Africa|The issue of whether public debt is useful or harmful towards economic growth is one of the most prevailing debates in the literature with no consensus existing on the subject matter. The study employs the ARDL model to examine the long-run and short-run effects of public debt on economic growth for South African data spanning a period between 2002:q2 to 2016:q4.

All estimated regressions unanimously find negative long-run debt –growth relationship although the short-term effects are unclear with some evidence of a positive short-run relationship between the time series specifically in the post-crisis period. Overall, our empirical results have some useful ramifications towards policymakers.
H60|Foreign and Public Investment and Economic Growth: The Case of Romania|In the last decades, there were many empirical studies regarding the role of private and public investment in the growth process. The aim of this paper is to examine, in the Romanian economy, the relationship among 5 macroeconomic variables: Gross Domestic Product, Foreign Direct Investment, Foreign Portfolio Investment, Foreign Other Investment and State Public Investment, using quarterly data over the period 2006Q1-2016Q2. A multiple regression model is used to investigate the effects of the selected independent variables (FDI, FPOI, FOI and SPI) on the endogenous variable (GDP). The results obtain from the multiple regression model show a positive relationship between Gross Domestic Product and Foreign Direct Investment, State Public Investment and Foreign Portfolio Investment (in this order) and a negative relationship between Gross Domestic Product and Foreign Other Investment. We hope that this paper can be a useful tool for government and policy makers in formulating the right investment policies in order to enhance economic development.
H60|Leverage and Capital Structure Determinants of Chinese Listed Companies|Total debt in the People’s Republic of China has increased significantly in recent years, mostly on account of nonfinancial corporate debt. Earning and the financial performance of corporate firms have weakened, and so has the asset quality of the financial sector. This paper assesses the financial fragility of the Chinese economy by looking at risk factors in the nonfinancial sector. We apply quantile regressions to a rich dataset of Chinese listed companies contained in Standard & Poor’s IQ Capital database. We find higher sensitivity over time of corporate leverage to some of its key determinants, particularly for firms at the upper margin of the distribution. In particular, profitability increasingly acts as a curb on corporate leverage. At a time of falling profitability across the Chinese nonfinancial corporate sector, this eases the brake on leverage and may contribute to its continuing increase.
H60|Does the Structural Budget Balance Guide Fiscal Policy Pro-Cyclically? Evidence from the Finnish Great Depression of the 1990s|In this article, I evaluate the challenges related to the European Commission's output gap method of calculating the structural budgetary position, and assess its bottom-up alternatives in the EU's fiscal framework using the Finnish data for the years 1984â€“2014. The results reinforce the impression of the limited capacity of the output gap method to predict cyclical changes in real time and suggest that using the output gap method to steer fiscal policy tends to lead to a procyclical policy (stimulus in upturns and austerity in downturns). The bottom-up assessment methods that are based on discretionary fiscal policy measures appear to work better, and using them to steer fiscal policy could make the policy more effective.
H60|More for less: What tax system for Poland?|When building a long-term economic policy in an important area – and the tax system is important – we begin by drawing up a list of key challenges, meaning particularly difficult problems that need to be addressed. The problems are usually of varying significance, so it’s necessary to indicate the problems that require particular attention. In the second stage of building a program, then, there is the need of drawing up a list of goals, as far as possible in order of their importance. Often, formulating the primary goal is particularly important. I will argue that in the case of tax policy for Poland, there is one goal that stands out in its significance. Finally, the third part of the program, the most important, is drawing up the methods of achieving the goals, and particularly the main one. Here it is also necessary to show, through argumentation and as far as possible quantitative estimates, that the proposed methods measure up to the challenges, i.e. that they are able to achieve the intended goals, particularly the primary goal. It is also necessary to demonstrate, or in any case to argue, that the proposed package of methods is economically and socially well justified – i.e. not worse, and rather better, than other packages.

H60|'Till Debt Do Us Part': Financial Implications of the Divorce of the Irish Free State from the UK, 1922-6|In this paper, we discuss the unresolved apportionment of national debt when Ireland exited the UK in 1922. Using archival sources and contemporary accounts, we estimate that the British claim on Ireland in 1925 amounted to between 80 and 100 per cent of GNP at a time when the political stability of Ireland was already fragile. We describe the process of how this contingent liability, arising from the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, was ultimately waived in a Financial Agreement in 1925 at the expense of an unchanged border with Northern Ireland. The Irish government also sought, but failed, to secure protection against discrimination for Catholics in Northern Ireland as part of the agreement. While for the Irish Government, this settlement may have represented a political failure, the economic outcome of the agreement transformed the economic position of the new Irish State from one of potential insolvency into one of viability.
H60|Endividamento Público e Crescimento Econômico: Evidências Para Países em Desenvolvimento|This paper analyzes the relationship between total public indebtedness and real per capita GDP growth in developing countries. Initially, an effort is made to review the literature, both empirically and theoretically, to understand the possible mechanisms for linking public indebtedness to economic growth. Afterward, empirical exercises are carried out by a panel composed of 69 countries in a 25-year interval (1988 - 2012). The first exercise is a descriptive statistics analysis where we find evidence of a negative relationship between the level of indebtedness and economic growth. After this, a brief econometric analysis is done estimating an augmented growth model with the debt variable via the pooled OLS estimator. The econometric results seem to confirm the existence of a negative linear relationship between public indebtedness and economic growth. Finally, evidence of non-linearity is also found in the relationship between indebtedness and economic growth, when the interaction between debt and interest rates or inflation are taken into account
H60|Who is this, who enters there? - Migration in Italy and its effect on fiscal sustainability and pensions|Our paper estimates the impact of immigration on the sustainability of the Italian public finances using the methodology of Generational Accounting. We take into account socio-economic differences between the main migrants’ communities resident in Italy and we present three possible scenarios to reflect the potential economic degree of integration of foreigners in the Italian territory. Moreover, for each scenario we propose several options for migrants concerning both the length of permanence in Italy and the possible collection of retirement benefits. Our results show that the burden of current fiscal policy reduces as integration of the foreign-born increases. If migrants’ children are economically perfectly integrated, the fiscal gap is reduced from 71.9 to -15.3 percent of GDP.
H60|Economic Challenges of Lagging Regions I: Fiscal and Macroeconomic Environment|The report analyses the fiscal and macroeconomic environment in the lagging regions and the relevant Member States of the EU, as a sound and sustainable macroeconomic framework is a necessary, but by itself not a sufficient precondition for investment and growth in the regions. It starts with identifying relevant indicators to highlight the macroeconomic environment in the lagging regions, assessing the performance of the regions across these indicators, and establishing a framework which sets out the potential causes of these imbalances. This sets the scene for further analysis of the transmission mechanisms which cause the regional discrepancies in these Member States between the lagging and the non-lagging regions, as well as exploring the differences between the low growth and low income lagging regions. The report concludes with a summary of these findings and how they could be used as a basis for policy recommendations which might improve the economic performance of the lagging regions.

It provides eight detailed country case studies, analysing the fiscal and macroeconomic environment in Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Spain and its effects on the development of the lagging regions in those countries.
H60|Fiscal Stabilization and Growth; Evidence from Industry-level Data for Advanced and Developing Economies|Medium-term growth can be enhanced by fiscal stabilization. However, to date, no systematic effort has been made to study the specific channels through which fiscal stabilization affects growth. This paper examines the effect of fiscal stabilization on industrial growth and how this effect depends on different technological characteristics. It does so by applying a difference-in-difference approach to an unbalanced panel of 22 manufacturing industries for 55 advanced and developing economies over the period 1970-2014. The results suggest that fiscal stabilization fosters growth in industries with: i) higher external financial dependence and lower asset fixity; ii) higher degree of labor intensity; iii) higher investment lumpiness and relationship-specific input usage. These effects tend to be larger during economic recessions. The results are robust to different measures of fiscal stabilization and the inclusion of various interactions between a broad set of macroeconomic variables and production technologies.
H60|Potraga za optimalnim i efikasnim javnim financijama u Hrvatskoj: od reformi do zaduživanja|U radu se analiziraju osnovni trendovi i tendencije u javnim financijama u Hrvatskoj u kontekstu potrage za optimalnim i efikasnim fiskalnim sustavom. Analiza je usmjerena na razdoblje od 1994. do 2016. godine. Prvo se analizira visina i struktura javnih prihoda, a zatim javnih rashoda. Analiza ukazuje na cikličku osjetljivost javnih prihoda, posebno indirektnih poreza, te nemogućnost adekvatne prilagodbe visine i strukture rashoda u uvjetima recesije. Bez obzira na niz reformi i promjena, posebno u segmentu poreznog sustava, fiskalne neravnoteže i proračunski manjkovi karakteriziraju hrvatski sustav javnih financija u gotovo cijelom promatranom razdoblju. Navedeno je utjecalo na rast javnog duga do razina fiskalne neodrživosti. Taj proces je pak utjecao na rast rizika zemlje što ima dugoročne posljedice na cjelokupno gospodarstvo, a ne samo na sustav javnih financija i problem refinanciranja javnog duga.
H60|Fiscal consolidations and heterogeneous expectations|We analyze fiscal consolidations using a New Keynesian model where agents have heterogeneous expectations and are uncertain about the composition of consolidations. We look at spending-based and tax-based consolidations and analyze their effects separately. We find that the effects of consolidations and the output multipliers are sensitive to heterogeneity in expectations before and after implementation of a specific fiscal plan. Depending on the beliefs about the type of consolidation prior to implementation, we show that heterogeneity in expectations may lead to optimism in the economy, improving thus the performance of a specific fiscal plan, or can work towards the opposite direction leading to pessimism, amplifying the contractionary effects of the consolidation. In general, we find that spending-based consolidations last longer and lead to deeper recessions when agents are boundedly rational compared to the rational expectations benchmark, while the opposite holds for tax-based consolidations.
H60|When and why do countries break their national fiscal rules?|This paper identifies determinants of compliance with various types of national numerical fiscal rules. Based on 51 fiscal rules in 20 EU member states from 1995 to 2015, the analysis identifies determinants among specific rule characteristics and their fiscal frameworks, as well as their political, (socio-)economic and supranational environments. While the average compliance across all rules and countries is around 50%, compliance with rules constraining stock (rather than flow) variables, set out in coalitional agreements, as well as rules covering larger parts of general government finances is significantly higher. Furthermore, independent monitoring and enforcement bodies (issuing real-time alerts) turn out to be significantly associated with a higher probability of compliance. Several theories of the deficit bias of governments due to government fragmentation, decentralization and political budget cycles are also significant with regards to compliance with fiscal rules. However, neither the economic environment or business cycle, nor forecast errors (except for an unexpectedly higher primary balance) on average seem to play a significant role.
H60|General equilibrium effects of public adaptation in agriculture in LDCs: Evidence from Ethiopia|Ethiopia is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. This is because its important economic sector, agriculture, is virtually rain-fed. The role of the sector in the current economic structure and the potency of the anticipated biophysical impacts of climate change necessitates proactive adaptation in agriculture. This, however, breeds questions of adaptation costs and adaptation finance. This study attempts to derive plausible range of planned adaptation costs in agriculture along with their economy-wide and regional effects in Ethiopia. It also assess the economy-wide and regional effects of the likely options available to a government of a least-developed country to finance adaptation in agriculture. The results show that planned public adaptation in agriculture puts pressure on government surplus, impedes on manufacturing and private services, and GDP of urbanized regions. As such, it may strain the current macroeconomic endeavors of the country which puts government driven structural transformation and reducing fiscal deficit relative to GDP at the center. Government of Ethiopia may reconcile this by laying out incentives to urban agriculture and private investment in agriculture. Besides, foreign support in the form of biotechnology transfer and debt-relief may help to control the side effects of grants on foreign exchange market and trade balance.
H60|Measuring fiscal spillovers in EMU and beyond: A Global VAR approach|This paper identifies and measures fiscal spillovers in the EU countries empirically using a global vector autoregression (GVAR) model. Our aim was to look at the sign and the absolute values of fiscal spillovers in a countrywise perspective and at the time profile (impulse response) of the impacts of fiscal shocks. We find moderate spillover effects of fiscal policy shocks originating in Germany and France. However, there is significant variation regarding the magnitude of the spillovers on individual destination countries and country clusters. Furthermore, we find some evidence that German or French fiscal spillovers are stronger on EMU than on non‐EMU countries.
H60|Balanced budget rules and fiscal outcomes: Evidence from historical constitutions|This paper studies the reduced-form effects of constitutional-level balanced budget rules (BBRs) on fiscal outcomes. Using historical data for a large set of countries dating back to the nineteenth century and applying a difference-in-difference design we find that the introduction of a constitutional BBR leads to a reduced probability of experiencing a sovereign debt crisis. We estimate that debt-to-GDP ratio decreases by around eleven percentage points on average, most of these consolidation being explained by decreasing expenditures rather than increasing tax revenues. Using the same methodology and sample, we do not find evidence that non-constitutional BBRs included in national legislation affect these variables. Additional estimates gained from applying the synthetic control method on nine selected case study countries in Africa, Europe, and Latin America are consistent with the main findings, but also highlight the importance of country specific circumstances when evaluating the success of BBRs.
H60|European Monetary Union reform preferences of French and German parliamentarians|We analyze data from an author-conducted survey of members of the French and German parliaments on European Monetary Union reform preferences. We consider three potential drivers of preferences: nationality, ideology, and personal characteristics. For European Monetary Union policies like Eurobonds, the Fiscal Compact and the European Central Bank asset purchase program we find a robust difference between parliamentarians of both countries if they belong to the same party family and controlling for individual characteristics. Based on our estimates, however, we predict agreement between German left-wingers and French conservatives even for ideological differences that are smaller than the current difference between the left and the right European party families. Our findings suggest that deeply-rooted national differences do not impose a prohibitive obstacle to a German-French parliamentary consensus on European Monetary Union policies.
H60|Extending the Public Sector in the ICES Model with an Explicit Government Institution|This paper aims to present an extension of the ICES model to capture the public sector. Departing from a demand system mainly derived from the GTAP model, ICES-XPS model disentangles the private and the public actors. The paper reviews the changes in both the database and the model equations following the existing literature and considering the availability of data as well. The model is then tested with a series of simple experiments to highlight its contribution to economic analysis in which the public sector may play an important role. Finally, we show the flexibility in the closure rule of the public sector that allows addressing different policy research questions.
H60|Markups and fiscal policy: analytical framework and an empirical investigation|The paper focuses on the effects of fiscal policy on the industry-specific profit margin of a sector of an economy. This is a deviation from the existing literature, which focuses mainly on the effects of fiscal policy on the profit margin of the economy as a whole. In this work the price cost margin at the industry level is expressed as a function of the fiscal balance and other market variables such as industry share and price which are usually absent in a macro-analysis environment. Using a panel of ten European Union member countries for the period 1988-2005 we obtain the statistical results that support the existence of a non trivial relationship between price cost margin and fiscal policy, as it is expressed by the fiscal balance of a country. There are differences, however, between countries as well as industries reflecting different production and labor market conditions.
H60|Expired and Expiring Authorizations of Appropriations|CBO reports annually to the Congress on programs funded for the current fiscal year for which authorizations of appropriations have expired, and programs for which authorizations of appropriations will expire during the current fiscal year.
H60|The 2017 Long-Term Budget Outlook|CBOâ€™s projections show a substantial imbalance looming in the federal budget over the next 30 years, with spending outpacing revenues by steadily increasing amounts. As a result, if current laws generally remained unchanged, federal debt would reach an unprecedented share of GDP, intensifying pressures on the federal budget, dampening economic growth, limiting the nationâ€™s ability to respond to unforeseen events, and increasing the likelihood of a fiscal crisis.
H60|An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 2017 to 2027|In CBOâ€™s baseline projections, the deficit in 2017 totals $693 billion, $134 billion more than CBO projected in January. If current law generally remained unchanged, the deficit would be on a path to rise over the next decade, with growth in revenues outpaced by growth in spending for large federal benefit programs and for interest payments on the debt.
H60|Federal Debt and the Statutory Limit, June 2017|On March 16, 2017, the debt limit was reset to match the amount of outstanding debt on that day, leaving the Treasury with no room to borrow under standard operating procedures. To avoid breaching the limit, the Treasury has used extraordinary measures that allow it to borrow additional amounts for a limited period.
H60|An Analysis of the Presidentâ€™s 2018 Budget|Under the Presidentâ€™s proposals, federal budget deficits would shrink relative to the size of the economy over the coming decade, ranging between 2.6 percent and 3.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) over that period. The cumulative federal deficit would be nearly one-third smaller than in CBOâ€™s baseline projections, but debt held by the public would end up slightly higher, as a percentage of GDP, than the ratio anticipated for the end of this year.
H60|Approaches to Changing Military Health Care|The Department of Defense (DoD) spends about $50 billion annually to provide health care to more than 9 million beneficiaries through a program known as TRICARE. CBO examined several illustrative approaches that might reduce DoDâ€™s rising health care costs, improve the quality of care provided at its facilities, or strengthen how well the departmentâ€™s medical establishment prepares for wartime missions. The report also describes the estimated budgetary effects of two specific options for making changes to TRICARE.
H60|Budgetary and Economic Outcomes Under Paths for Federal Revenues and Noninterest Spending Specified by Chairman Enzi, September 2017|CBO has analyzed the macroeconomic effects of the deficit reductions stemming from a set of paths for federal revenues and noninterest spending specified by Chairman Mike Enzi of the Senate Budget Committee. The agency has also estimated how those macroeconomic effects would, in turn, affect the federal budget. The estimates in this report do not represent an analysis of the economic effects of any specific policies that might underlie the Chairmanâ€™s paths.
H60|Trends in the Department of Defenseâ€™s Support Costs|From the mid-1980s to the early 1990s, the Department of Defenseâ€™s (DoDâ€™s) funding for support functions rose substantially relative to funding for forces. Four types of support functions experienced the largest increases: health care, DoD-wide management, communications and information infrastructure, and DoDâ€™s science and technology program. Increased spending in some of these areas may have improved efficiency (by helping meet military needs, boosting productivity, or reducing costs in other areas) but some increases may not have done so.
H60|Changes to CBOâ€™s Long-Term Social Security Projections Since 2016|This report explains the changes to CBOâ€™s long-term Social Security projections since last year. Compared with the projections made in July 2016, CBOâ€™s latest projections, published in March 2017, indicate a slight improvement in the financial outlook for Social Security. The projected 75-year actuarial balance has improved from âˆ’1.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to âˆ’1.5 percent of GDP.
H60|Federal Debt and the Statutory Limit, November 2017|Under current law, as of December 9, federal debt will be at the statutory limit and the Treasury will need to take certain â€œextraordinary measuresâ€ to continue to raise cash without breaching the debt ceiling. If the limit is not increased, those measures will probably be exhausted and the Treasury is likely to run out of cash sometime in late March or early April, leading to delays in payments for the governmentâ€™s programs and activities, a default on its debt obligations, or both.
H60|Analysis of the Long-Term Costs of the Administrationâ€™s Goals for the Military|CBO estimates that the inflation-adjusted costs for the Department of Defense would climb steadily from the $575 billion requested for the base budget in 2018 to $688 billion in 2027 if DoD pursues goals that Administration officials have articulated for improving readiness, modernizing equipment, and increasing the number of military personnel. Total costs for 2018 through 2027 would be nearly $700 billion more than CBOâ€™s projection of the Obama Administrationâ€™s final Future Years Defense Program.
H60|Engineering Crises: Favoritism and Strategic Fiscal Indiscipline|If people understand that some macroeconomic policies are unsustainable, why would they vote for them in the .first place? We develop a political economy theory of the endogenous emergence of fiscal crises, based on the idea that the adjustment mechanism to a crisis favors some social groups, that may be induced ex-ante to vote in favor of policies that are more likely to lead to a crisis. People are entitled to a certain level of a publicly provided good, which may be rationed in times of crises. After voting on that level, society votes on the extend to which it will be financed by debt. Under bad enough macro shocks, a crisis arises: taxes are set at their maximum but despite that some agents do not get their entitlement. Some social groups do better in this rationing process than others. We show that public debt .which makes crises more likely .is higher, as is the probability of a crisis, the greater the level of favoritism. If the favored group is important enough to be pivotal when society votes on the entitlement level, favoritism also leads to greater public expenditure. We show that the favored group may strategically favor a weaker state in order to make crises more frequent. Finally, the decisive voter when choosing expenditure may be different from the one when voting on debt. In such a case, constitutional limits on debt may raise the utility of all the poor, relative to the equilibrium outcome absent such limits.
H60|Essays on the Behavior of Firms and Politicians|Die vorliegende Dissertation besteht aus sechs eigenständigen Kapiteln, die vom Verhalten von Firmen und Politikern im weiteren Sinne handeln. Nach einer Einführung in die Thematik wird im ersten Teil der Dissertation ausgeführt, wie institutionelle und politische Rahmenbedingungen das Verhalten von Firmen beeinflussen. In Kapitel 2 werden die Einflussgrößen von Schenkungen von Betriebsvermögen in deutschen Familienunternehmen untersucht. Umfrageergebnisse zeigen, dass bei größeren Unternehmen und bei Unternehmen mit guter Geschäftslage die Schenkungswahrscheinlichkeit stieg. In Kapitel 3 wird untersucht, wie politische Unsicherheit Investitionsentscheidungen von Unternehmen beeinflusst, wofür Daten über realisierte Investitionsquoten, Investitionspläne und -revisionen verwendet werden. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die realisierten Investitionsquoten in den Jahren, in denen Landtagswahlen stattfanden im Durchschnitt niedriger waren als in Jahren, in denen keine Landtagswahlen stattfanden. Unternehmen schienen jedoch schon bei der Investitionsplanung die Wahlunsicherheit zu antizipieren, denn sie revidierten ihre Pläne kaum. In Kapitel 4 wird untersucht, ob politische Unsicherheit beeinflusst, wie Unternehmer ihre aktuelle Geschäftslage und zukünftige Geschäftsentwicklung wahrnehmen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Unternehmer erwarteten, dass ihr Geschäft sich besser vor Landtagswahlen und schlechter nach Landtagswahlen entwickeln wird. Der zweite Teil dieser Dissertation untersucht, wie ideologische Orientierung und Eigeninteresse von Politikern ihr Ethos und Verhalten prägen. Kapitel 5 beschreibt, wie ideologische Orientierung Einstellungen und Handlungen von Politikern in Deutschland prägt. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Worte und Taten deutscher Landespolitiker und -regierungen in Bezug auf Haushaltskonsolidierung und Schuldenbremsen voneinander abgewichen haben. In Kapitel 6 wird untersucht, ob Parteien Politiker, die in namentlichen Abstimmungen von der Parteilinie abweichen, bestrafen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen nicht, dass Parteien das Abstimmungsverhalten beachteten und Politiker bestraften, die gegen die Parteienlinie gestimmt haben. In Kapitel 7 wird untersucht, inwiefern unterschiedliche ideologische Orientierungen der deutschen Wirtschaftsforschungsinstitute die Politikberatung in der Gemeinschaftsdiagnose beeinflusst haben.
H60|Handelseffekte von Grenzkontrollen|Eine neue empirische Untersuchung des ifo Instituts zeigt, dass selbst bei einem vollständigen Zusammenbruch des Schengen-Raums das BIP in Deutschland lediglich zwischen 4 und 11 Mrd. Euro pro Jahr sinken würde; die weitaus realistischere Wiedereinführung von Kontrollen an den Flüchtlingsrouten würde zu Effekten zwischen 1 und 3 Mrd. Euro führen. Für Österreich liegen die Verluste bei 80 bis 210 Mio. Euro. Diese Kosten machen jedoch nur einen Bruchteil jener Belastungen aus, die durch fortgeführte ungeregelte Massenzuwanderung entstehen würden.
H60|Handelseffekte von Grenzkontrollen|Das am 26. März 1995 in Kraft gesetzte Schengener Abkommen hat einen Europäischen Binnenraum der Personenfreizügigkeit geschaffen und damit ein beispielloses kontinentales Integrationsziel erreicht. Die Bedrohung durch globalen Terrorismus sowie ein starker Anstieg der Flüchtlingszahlen in Europa seit Sommer 2015 haben eine Grundsatzdebatte darüber hervorgerufen, inwieweit offene Binnengrenzen politisch und ökonomisch haltbar sind. Diese Studie adressiert drei Fragestellungen: Wie stark wird die Reisezeit durch Grenzkontrollen beeinträchtigt? Beeinflusst die Abschaffung der Grenzkontrollen durch das Schengener Abkommen den grenzüberschreitenden Handel in Waren und Dienstleistungen? Welche Wohlfahrtseffekte sind aufgrund einer Veränderung internationaler Handelsvolumina in Folge einer Wiedereinführung von Grenzkontrollen im Schengen-Raum zu erwarten? Die Studie findet, dass die Überwindung von Ländergrenzen innerhalb des Schengen-Raumes um etwa 20 Minuten schneller gelingt als zwischen zwei Ländern, von denen mindestens eines nicht dem Schengen-Raum angehört. Eine Wiedereinführung der Grenzkontrollen im Schengen-Raum würde die bilateralen Warenexporte je Grenzübertritt um 2,7% reduzieren; entspricht einem Zolläquivalent von 0,54%. Die bilateralen Dienstleistungsexporte je Grenzübertritt würden um 4,2% reduziert; entspricht einem Zolläquivalent von 0,82%. Die deutschen BIP Einbußen durch einen vollständigen Zusammenbruch des Schengen-Raumes lägen zwischen 4 und 11 Mrd. Euro pro Jahr. Die weitaus realistischere Wiedereinführung von Kontrollen an den Flüchtlingsrouten würde für Deutschland zu BIP Effekten zwischen -1 und -3 Mrd. Euro jährlich führen. Ähnliche Analysen wurden für Bayern, Österreich und die Europäische Union durchgeführt.
H60|Die Zukunft der EU-Finanzen: Neue Wege der Finanzierung und der Verteilung?|Nicht zuletzt im Zusammenhang mit dem geplanten Austritt Großbritanniens aus der EU stellt sich die Frage nach neuen Wegen bei der Finanzierung des EU-Budgets und der Verwendung der Mittel. Für Thiess Büttner, Universität Erlangen- Nürnberg, erscheint es sinnvoll, die obsoleten Mehrwertsteuereigenmittel aufzugeben und sich auf die traditionellen Eigenmittel und die bewährten BNE-Eigenmittel zu beschränken. Da die EU weder ausschließlich noch überwiegend europaweite Aufgaben wahrnimmt, ist es nach Ansicht von Michael Broer, Ostfalia Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaft, Wolfsburg, auch nicht erforderlich, dass sich diese Institution mittels eigener Einnahmen finanziert. Erst wenn sich die EU vermehrt Aufgaben mit einem europäischen Mehrwert zuwende, gewinne der Gedanke an eine EU-Steuer an Bedeutung. Clemens Fuest, ifo Institut, legt dar, dass unter den derzeitigen institutionellen Einrichtungen der EU die Abschaffung der aktuellen Mehrwertsteuereigenmittel und der nationalen Rabatte sowie eine Reform der Ausgaben erhebliche Verbesserungen bringen könnten. Christian Waldhoff, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, stellt die Frage, ob es in dem derzeitigen juristischen Rahmen möglich wäre, der EU eigene Besteuerungsbefugnisse zu übertragen. Margit Schratzenstaller, Österreichisches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung, Wien, führt aus, dass das Potenzial von EU-Steuern als Instrumente zur Stärkung der Nachhaltigkeitsorientierung der Besteuerung in der EU bislang weitgehend vernachlässigt werde und plädiert für die Einführung von »nachhaltigkeitsorientierten steuerbasierten Eigenmittel«. Peter Becker, Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, Berlin, sieht das entscheidende Problem der derzeitigen EU-Haushaltspolitik in der einseitigen Fokussierung der Mitgliedstaaten auf eine rein fiskalische Kosten-Nutzen-Bilanz ihrer Mitgliedschaft anhand ihrer nationalen Nettosalden. Jörg Haas, Jacques Delors Institut, Berlin, möchte den Brexit als Chance für eine EU-Haushaltsreform nutzen, die eine Vereinfachung der Einnahmequellen und eine Fokussierung der Aufgaben auf europäische Gemeinschaftsgüter beinhalten sollte. Charles B. Blankart, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, schlägt ein sog. Eliminationsverfahren zur Finanzierung des EU-Haushalts nach dem Brexit vor.
H60|Countercyclical Income Risk and Portfolio Choices over the Life-Cycle|This paper presents a life-cycle model that incorporates the cyclical skewness of labor income shocks. Cyclical skewness can explain the limited stock market participation of households with modest financial wealth and the positive age trend in conditional equity shares. Structural estimation reveals that a relative risk aversion of 5 and a yearly participation cost of $290 fits the US data. Omitting cyclical skewness leads to a three-fold overestimation of participation costs and generates a counterfactual decline of conditional equity shares. As its portfolio implications are smaller for wealthy households, cyclical skewness reduces aggregate demand for equity by only 15%.
H60|Fiscal reaction function and fiscal fatigue: evidence for the euro area|This paper estimates a fiscal reaction function (FRF) framework for euro area countries and derives a novel approach to measure fiscal fatigue. As in previous studies, we find evidence that euro area sovereigns abide, on average, by (weak) sustainability constraints. The primary balance improves by about 0.03–0.05 for every 1 percentage point increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio after controlling for other relevant factors. The positive reaction of primary surpluses to higher debt strengthened over the crisis. Based on this framework, we propose a simple, practical measure of fiscal fatigue that can be used to assess the capacity of sovereigns to maintain primary surpluses over extended periods of time. This measure can be derived by comparing simulated primary balance paths in the context of debt sustainability analyses with countries’ track-record, adjusted for the change in debt with the estimated fiscal reaction coefficient. The evidence of fiscal fatigue in non-linear FRF specifications is weaker for our euro area sample. JEL Classification: H60, E62, F41, C33
H60|Indebtedness in the EU: a drag or a catalyst for growth?|We study the relationship between debt and growth in EU countries in the years 1995-2015. We investigate the debt-growth nexus in two alternative empirical set-ups: the traditional cross-county panel regressions and mean group estimations. We find evidence of a positive long-run relationship between private sector indebtedness and economic growth, and a negative relationship between public debt and long-run growth across EU countries. However, the more immediate impact of private sector debt on growth is found to be negative, and positive for the public sector debt. We find no conclusive evidence for a common debt threshold within EU countries, neither for the private nor for the public sector, but some indication of a non-linear effect of household debt. JEL Classification: O47, N14, H60
H60|Effects of Fiscal Rules on Budgetary Outcomes: The Case of the European Union Member States|The aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of fiscal rules on the budgetary outcomes in 27 European Union countries. In particular, the paper focuses on assessing whether the impact of fiscal rules is statistically significant and numerically meaningful. In order to assess the influence, we use a dynamic panel data model. In our baseline model, we introduce the fiscal rule index as an explanatory variable. Our estimation rests on the fiscal reaction function. The analysis shows that the fiscal rule index positively affects the cyclically-adjusted primary balance and the cyclically-adjusted balance.
H60|Spanish Public Finances through the Financial Crisis|Spain’s public finances have been under significant stress during the crisis, despite pre-crisis fiscal surpluses and low levels of public debt. The impact of the crisis and an initial phase of counter-cyclical activism exacerbated the existing (structural) fiscal vulnerabilities. To correct the fiscal imbalances, a significant number of bold policy actions were taken, affecting taxation, public spending, national fiscal rules and the structure of the public sector. In this paper we discuss the evolution of public finances in Spain during the financial crisis, framing crisis-related fiscal policy measures within medium-term economic trends and focusing on policy responses to the financial crisis. We also touch upon the main policy challenges ahead.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H60|Foreign holders of Italian government debt securities: new evidence|Drawing on data from the Eurosystem’s recent Securities Holdings Statistics (SHS) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS), the paper provides a detailed breakdown of foreign holders of Italian government securities by sector and geographical area. We estimate that euro-area investors held more than 60 per cent of the Italian general government securities held by non-residents at the end of 2015; the sector in the euro area holding the largest share was 'other financial intermediaries' (predominantly non-money market funds), followed by banks and the insurance industry and pension funds. We also show that foreign demand for Italian government debt was mainly driven by euro-area countries in 2014, while in 2015 it mostly reflected purchases made by investors outside the euro area.
H60|Beyond the austerity dispute: new priorities for fiscal policy|The workshop aimed at moving forward the fiscal policy debate, which in the crisis years was unavoidably focused on how to regain fiscal credibility and to implement sizable and fast consolidation plans. Four main themes have been proposed for the debate during the workshop. First, the two-way link between fiscal consolidation and inequality, with the idea that consolidation efforts cannot be successful in the long run if they entail a socially unsustainable increase in inequality. Second, the importance of preserving, even in contexts in which the fiscal policy stance is necessarily restrictive, growth-enhancing public investments. Third, the challenges posed to fiscal management by a low inflation context, taking into account that a subdued price dynamics not only makes the real burden of debt heavier, but it also has subtle effects, at least in the short term, on several budgetary items. Finally, the need for a simpler and more appropriate set of rules for the governance of the EMU. The latter topic was also the object of the high-level panel at the end of the workshop. While differences in emphasis emerged among the panellists, they agreed that the current framework could be streamlined, and – more importantly – that no set of rules can work if trust and a sense of sharing a common objective is not rebuilt among the Member States.
H60|Optimal Policy with General Signal Extraction|We study optimal policy when the planner has partial information in a general setup where observed signals are endogenous to policy. In this context, signal extraction and policy have to be determined jointly. We derive a general non-standard first order condition of optimality from first principles and we use it to find numerical solutions. This first order condition allows us to identify widely-used special cases in the literature in which the signal extraction and the optimal decision problems can be solved separately, using the well-known separation principle. Our general setup, which does not feature any separation, is relevant for most available dynamic models in macro. We apply our results to a model of fiscal policy and show that optimal taxes are often a very non-linear function of observed hours, calling for tax smoothing in normal times, but for a strong fiscal reaction to output in a deeper recession. This non-linearity arises because signal extraction interacts differently with optimal policy depending on the range of observed signals. The non-linearity is stronger near the top of the Laffer curve or near a debt limit. In a fully dynamic model taxes react with a delay to adverse deficit shocks due to partial information, and this can lead to larger low-frequency fluctuations.
H60|Debt Brakes in the German States: Governments’ Rhetoric and Actions|In 2009 a new law on German debt brakes was passed: state governments are not allowed to run structural deficits after 2020. Consolidation strategies initiated today influence if a state can comply with the debt brake in 2020. We describe to what extent government ideology predicts if state governments consolidate budgets and which fiscal adjustment path they choose. Attitudes towards budget consolidation, as expressed by politicians’ words in the public debate, differed among parties. Anecdotal evidence and descriptive statistics indicate that leftwing governments ran on average higher structural deficits than rightwing governments between 2010 and 2014. Primary deficits, however, hardly differed under leftwing and rightwing governments. Revenues of federal taxes were much higher than expected and facilitated budget consolidation. Leftwing governments did not need to run deficits to design generous budgets. It is conceivable that parties confirmed their identity by using expressive rhetoric, but responded to shifts in public opinion after the financial crisis and pursued more sustainable fiscal policies when in office.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H60|Real-Time Data And Fiscal Policy Analysis: A Survey Of The Literature|This paper surveys the empirical research on fiscal policy analysis based on real-time data. This literature can be broadly divided in three groups that focus on: (1) the statistical properties of revisions in fiscal data; (2) the political and institutional determinants of fiscal data revisions and of one-year-ahead projection errors by governments and (3) the reaction of fiscal policies to the business cycle. It emerges that, first, fiscal data revisions are large and initial releases are biased estimates of final values. Second, the presence of strong fiscal rules and institutions leads to relatively more accurate releases of fiscal data and small deviations of fiscal outcomes from government plans. Third, the cyclical stance of fiscal policies is estimated to be more ‘counter-cyclical’ when real-time data are used instead of ex-post data. Finally, more work is needed for the development of real-time datasets for fiscal policy analysis. In particular, a comprehensive real-time dataset including fiscal variables for industrialized (and possibly developing) countries, published and maintained by central banks or other institutions, is still missing.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H60|Sovereign Debt Relief and Its Aftermath|This paper studies sovereign debt relief in a long-term perspective. We quantify the relief achieved through default and restructuring in two distinct samples: 1920–1939, focusing on the defaults on official (government to government) debt in advanced economies after World War I; and 1978–2010, focusing on emerging market debt crises with private external creditors. Debt relief was substantial in both eras, averaging 21% of GDP in the 1930s and 16% of GDP in recent decades. We then analyze the aftermath of debt relief and conduct a difference-in-differences analysis around the synchronous war debt defaults of 1934 and the Baker and Brady initiatives of the 1980s/1990s. The economic landscape of debtor countries improves significantly after debt relief operations, but only if these involve debt write-offs. Softer forms of debt relief, such as maturity extensions and interest rate reductions, are not generally followed by higher economic growth or improved credit ratings.

H60|House prices and monetary policy|This paper analyzes global dynamics in an overlapping generations general equilibrium model with housing-wealth effects. It demonstrates that monetary policy cannot burst rational bubbles in the housing market. Under monetary policy rules of the Taylor-type, there exist global self-fulfilling paths of house prices along a heteroclinic orbit connecting multiple equilibria. From bifurcation analysis, the orbit features a boom (bust) in house prices when monetary policy is more (less) active. The paper also proves that booms or busts cannot be ruled out by interest-rate feedback rules responding to both inflation and house prices.
