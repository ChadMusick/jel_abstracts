C67|Tariffs, Domestic Import Substitution and Trade Diversion in Input-Output Production Networks: how to deal with Brexit|This paper challenges and complements existing studies on the economic impact of Brexit providing a discussion of the UK's decision to leave the EU and how it will affect international trade networks and value-added. Using the World Input-Output Database, we develop a multi-sector inter-country model that allows us to identify the channels through which the economic effects of Brexit would propagate. The inclusion of global value chains and indirect Brexit effects in the model leads to estimates that diverge with the results of the main literature. Indeed our findings, suggest that Brexit could be risky and costly not only for the UK but also for many EU countries. Furthermore, building on the Dietzenbacher and Lahr (2013) method of hypothetical expansion, we develop a second model and present the first empirical analysis on the consequences of domestic import substitution and trade diversion policies in Input-Output schemes. We found that allowing sectors and countries to partly substitute foreign products, leads to significantly lower losses for both macro-regions. In the second model, the UK and EU27 would lose, at worst, the 0.05 and 0.5 percent of value-added, respectively.
C67|Evaluating international impacts of China-specific shocks in an input-output framework|The slowing in China’s massive economy has wide implications. China plays an essential role in international production chains, so disturbances can spill over to other economies in the global production network. We evaluate the international transmission and impact of various China-specific shocks with an input-output framework applied to the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). We consider shocks to Chinese final demand at the aggregate level, bilateral import tariffs between the US and China and sector-specific shocks to Chinese final demand and supply. Our results suggest that aggregate level shocks, as well as certain sector-specific shocks originating in China, may have large impacts elsewhere. Transmission of shocks through the global production network, however, is mitigated by the relatively low import-intensity of Chinese production.
C67|Um modelo de equilíbrio computável incorporando o investimento inovativo|This study aimed to estimate the impact of R&D expenditures or subsidies, such as those revealed by the Survey of Innovation, on the Brazilian economy. The analysis based on general equilibrium approach (input-output and computable general equilibrium model) has the advantage of taking into account the sectoral interdependencies, in order to allow a systemic view of innovation and R & D expenditures on the Brazilian economy. The results show that R & D services are an important element of the economy's investment: 94% of the production of R & D services is used as investment, and only 6% as an intermediary input. Therefore, the impact of R & D occurs more intensely through investment and productivity channels than through multiplier effects on production.
C67|CO2 embedded in trade: trends and fossil fuel drivers|The amount of CO2 embedded in trade has substantially increased since 1990. We study the trends and some drivers over the period 1995-2009. We find that traded goods tend to have higher emission-intensities compared to average final demand. The second finding is that independently of sector structure, dirty countries tend to specialize in emissionintensive sectors. This finding suggests a comparative advantage mechanism for CO2 and lends support to the hypothesis that trade liberalization tends to increase global emissions. The third finding is that, on average, emission-intensive countries have shifted from trade deficits to surpluses, so a larger share of goods is now produced in emission-intensive countries, consequently increasing global emissions. Finally, our analysis points to coal abundance as an important driver for high levels of both domestic emissions per value added and Sector specialization into emission-intensive sectors. Hence coal abundance is an important driver of net CO2 exports.
C67|La estructura sectorial de Colombia: Un análisis insumo-producto|En los últimos años ha existido el consenso de que la economía colombiana es muy dependente del sector minero – energético, por lo cual se deben encontrar formas de transformar el aparato productivo. El análisis insumo-producto ayuda a identificar cuales pueden ser los sectores que pueden contribuir a una mayor diversificación de economía, además de la clasificación por clústeres, los cuales no han cambiado tanto en los últimos quince años.
C67|Generación de empleos y clústeres|En este trabajo se utiliza la metodología insumo – producto para analizar la creación del empleo desde la perspectiva sectorial, al utilizar los multiplicadores del empleo los multiplicadores del empleo y mostrar las relaciones del empleo entre e intra – clúster de la economía. Se encuentra que los clústeres más cercanos a la demanda final son los de agro – industria e industria y construcción. Si se realiza algún estímulo sobre la demanda de los productos finales de estos clústeres se va a generar una mayor absorción del trabajo, no solo dentro de cada clúster, sino en el sistema productivo en general. El efecto se refuerza si existen conexiones fuertes con clústeres proveedores netos de insumos, tales como el de servicios o el de industria minero – energética.
C67|Construcción de una Matriz de Contabilidad Social para Paraguay para el Año 2014|En este documento se describe detalladamente los pasos seguidos para la construcción de una matriz de contabilidad social (MCS) para Paraguay para el 2014, año más reciente para el cual se dispone de información suficiente de las nuevas cuentas nacionales. La documentación de los pasos seguidos será útil además para futuras actualizaciones de la MCS elaborada. La MCS que se describe en este trabajo está siendo utilizada para hacer operacional (o calibrar) el GEM-Core Paraguay, un modelo de Equilibrio General Computable (EGC) desarrollado para evaluar distintas cuestiones relacionadas con el desarrollo económico y que permitirá evaluar el impacto de las modificaciones tributarias planteadas actualmente en el país. La misma MCS puede utilizarse también para calibrar otros modelos de equilibrio general computable alternativos.
C67|Reaping gains from global production sharing: Domestic value addition and job creation by Indian exports|Is it in the interest of a country to promote strong local linkages for domestic industries or to participate in global production sharing (GPS) activities wherein linkages are globally dispersed? This paper informs this debate by empirically analyzing which one of these strategies would result in higher levels of domestic value added (DVA) and employment in a developing country, India. A higher level of participation in GPS entails that, for any given country, DVA per unit of exports is smaller than when most inputs are sourced locally. However, owing to the scale and productivity effects of producing for the world market, participation in GPS can lead to higher absolute levels of DVA and domestic job creation. We test this hypothesis using a unique panel data on DVA and jobs tied to Indian exports from 112 sectors for the period 1999-2013. Our regression analysis confirms that participation in GPS, as measured by the sectoral ratio of DVA to gross exports, leads to higher absolute levels of gross exports, DVA and employment. These results are robust to alternative model specifications and estimation techniques. We conclude that developing countries can reap rich dividends by adopting policies aimed at strengthening their participation in GPS.
C67|FIDELIO 3 manual: Equations and data sources|"FIDELIO (Fully Interregional Dynamic Econometric Long-term Input-Output) is a multi-sectoral model developed by the unit B.5 of the Directorate General Joint Research Centre (JRC) â€” the circular economy and industrial leadership unit. Compared to neoclassical CGE models â€” which assume that the perfect flexibility of prices and quantities ensures the full use of the factors of production at all times â€” FIDELIO integrates some new-Keynesian features: consumption adjusts slowly to its optimal level according to an error correction model and wages do not clear the labour market. The assumptions that prices do not clear the markets and market ""imperfections"" exist generate the dynamics of the model that is solved sequentially (recursive dynamic). In addition, FIDELIO is an econometric model since the calibration of most of the behavioural parameters of the model (dynamic adjustment lags of prices and quantities, and elasticities) is based on econometric estimations.This technical report illustrates the third version of the FIDELIO model, FIDELIO 3. The changes introduced in the subsequent versions of the model have two main objectives. The first one is to increase the coverage of the model. The second one is to improve the efficiency and the capacity of the model to evaluate sustainable production and consumption policies. The aim of this report is twofold. First, it contains all the equations of the current version of the model; second, it illustrates the characteristics of the data used by FIDELIO 3."
C67|World Input-Output Database Environmental Accounts|This report describes the approach adopted for the update of the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) environmental accounts for the period 2000-2016. In constructing the WIOD-based energy and emission accounts we follow closely the methodology developed by Genty et al. (2012), with some adjustments due to changes in system boundaries, which are further detailed. This report illustrates the data adjustment steps required to reconcile energy and economic data which stem, for example, from different accounting principles. Special care has been taken to address problems related to time series breaks in order to achieve a smooth transition between the years 2009 and 2010 at the intersection between the original and new WIOD releases. Results for EU countries are compared with other data sources such as the previous WIOD time series, the Physical Energy Flows Accounts (PEFA) and the National Accounts Matrices with Environmental Extensions (NAMEA) showing a satisfactory goodness of fit, with some exceptions. A final comparison of the inter-temporal structure across periods is proposed in order to identify possible reasons of changes in the patterns of gross energy use.
C67|Measuring bilateral trade in terms of value added|"The increase in the fragmentation of production across countries and the subsequent growth in the trade of intermediate products have raised concerns about the suitability of conventional trade statistics to understand the economic consequences of trade. Several authors have attempted to disentangle value added content of trade. This technical report proposes a novel framework that enables to: 1 fully decompose the factor content of bilateral trade measured at the border; and 2 account for the role of the different countries and industries participating in the global value chain. Furthermore, because of the country and industry detail of this approach, it able to provide a new extension of the standard value added to exports ratio, and also reconcile the ""sink-based"" and ""source-based"" methods commonly used to report the value added in trade."
C67|European NUTS 2 regions: construction of interregional trade-linked Supply and Use tables with consistent transport flows|Economic development is interregional in nature, with economic growth being determined by physical and technological proximity identified by interregional and national cross-border interactions in trade, investments, and knowledge. This report explains the construction of a system of multiregional input-output tables for the EU28 interlinked with trade in goods and services within the same country as well as with regions in other Member States. Taking transhipment locations into account, trade in goods and services is derived from freight transport data, airline data on flights, and business travel data. The methodology is centred on the probability of trade flows and was developed to fit the information available without pre-imposing any geographical structure on the data.
C67|The RHOMOLO-IO modelling framework: a flexible Input-Output tool for policy analysis|This Technical Report describes the features of the RHOMOLO-IO model and demonstrates its flexibility by showing a number of recent policy-relevant applications for which it has been used. Such applications include, for instance, the study of the European Globalisation Fund, of four TEN-T investment projects, of the European research and innovation regional funds, and of regulatory proposals on the energy union in the EU. The paper contains traditional input-output multipliers analyses applied to output, GDP, and employment, as well as consumption redistribution and trade analyses. The flexibility of the RHOMOLO-IO framework makes it useful for a wide range of policy-relevant studies and makes it a perfect complement to the spatial computable general equilibrium RHOMOLO.
C67|The impact of the Grand Paris Express on the European regions: a RHOMOLO analysis|This technical report illustrates a simulation performed to assess the likely economic impact of the Grand Paris Express investments on the ÃŽle-de-France and the other European Union regions, under the working assumption of a combined 1% increase in labour productivity due to better matching between skill supply and demand and a 1% increase in accessibility due to the project. Our simulations suggest an overall medium-term positive GDP impact for the EU as a whole (0.18%), for France (0.79%) and for ÃŽle-de-France (2.61%).
C67|The role of ICT productivity in Korea-Japan multifactor CES productions and trades|In this paper, we examine the economic impact of information and communication technology (ICT) innovation, under the general equilibrium framework, with empirically estimated constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production frontiers. Innovation can generate not only productivity growth and price changes but also changes in the economic structure of production and trade patterns, eventually increasing social welfare. To study such impact of ICT innovation, we construct a bilateral general equilibrium model, spanning 350 commodities and sectors with trades between Japan and the Republic of Korea (South Korea). We estimate all CES parameters from published statistics such as the linked input–output tables and Comtrade databases. A small exogenous productivity shock in ICT is examined in terms of potential price reduction in all commodities in both countries.
C67|A structural analysis of the U.S. financial economy|The Flow-of-Funds Accounts of the Unites States have been published on a quarterly basis since 1945 up to the present time. In this paper, we will construct ‘sector×sector’ Stone and Klein-formula asset-liability matrices fully exploiting the huge accumulation of data. It allows us to trace the changes in the roles of the institutional sectors over the years by application of useful input-output analytical tools, such as triangulation and dispersion indices. Although there is not too much change in the characteristics of non- financial sectors, the roles of financial institutions have been changing as the financial market develops and the deregulation advances.
C67|Did the recent Brazilian economic defaults originate from real economic or financial issues?|This paper aims to discover whether the origins of the recent Brazilian economic defaults (2009, 2015, and 2016) were related to the real economy or to pure financial transactions. To do so, we analyzed the discrepancy of dispersion index (DDI) and structural path decomposition from flow of funds (FOF) matrices of the Brazilian economy from 2004 to 2015. Financial transactions mirrored real transactions in almost every year, except in 2008, when financial transactions more highly contributed to the imbalance. Additionally, the total value of financial firms’ transactions grew more than that of non-financial firms in periods preceding economic defaults (2008 and 2014) while the continued growth of non-financial firms transactions decreased the DDI in 2009 and 2015. Changes in the power of dispersion indices corroborated this observation by pointing out that the government and non-financial firms reduced their financial sharing while financial firms improved their role as financial intermediaries and, at the same time, the rest of the world was receiving a significant portion of Brazilian savings.
C67|Sectoral Production and Diffusion Index Forecasts for Output in Lithuania|In this paper, we develop and describe quarterly data on disaggregated sectors in Lithuania which covers the period 1998-2018. The data is useful for empirical studies requiring panels with a large number of time observations and a large number of cross-sectional units. We follow the NACE2 level of disaggregation in developing our data, thus allowing us to combine the data with world input-output tables which we in turn use to identify the hubs and the main importing and exporting sectors within the economy. The data is then used for forecasting the growth rate of GDP. There is a substantial increase in the degree of covariation among sectoral production growth rates, which is observed using a split sample around 2008. When we apply factor methods, we find that this strong covariation can be explained by a few factors which are closely correlated to the growth of the retail and wholesale sectors. For GDP growth, the forecasts we consider are the diffusion index forecasts produced using a few indexes that summarize sectoral data, and the forecasts produced using the production growth of selected hubs and importing and exporting sectors. We find that the diffusion indexes and the production growth of sectors that make heavy use of imported inputs in their production have interesting forecasting power for the growth rate of GDP in the 2006-2011 and 2012-2018 periods.
C67|Intersectoral Network-Based Channel of Aggregate TFP Shocks|This study investigates the role of intersectoral networks in the transmission of aggregate technology shocks to sectors’ growth. First, we develop a theoretical model to obtain insights into the propagation of shocks through input-output linkages, which suggests that the network effect arises via sectoral downstream linkages. We then quantitatively assess this theoretical implication with US manufacturing industries, where the aggregate technology shocks are derived from a dynamic factor model. We find that aggregate technology shocks lead to an increase in the output growth of the sector, both directly and indirectly via its intersectoral linkages. More interestingly, we document a crucial role of the intersectoral network channel, which contributes about 50 percent of the total effect. In addition, the network-based effect comes mostly from downstream linkages of sectors, which is broadly consistent with theory.
C67|Direct and Network Effects of Idiosyncratic TFP Shocks|This study investigates the direct and intersectoral network effects of idiosyncratic TFP shocks on sectors’ growth in the context of US manufacturing industries. To deal with the potential endogeneity of TFP, we propose a novel set of instruments for contemporaneous regressors. These instruments are technology shocks identiﬁed via sign restriction from sectoral SVAR models. Using US input-output tables and industry-level data, we quantify direct and network-based effects of the shocks. Our results show that idiosyncratic technology shocks propagate mostly downstream the network. In addition, we capture strong contemporaneous direct effects of the shocks.
C67|The economic importance of the Belgian ports : Flemish maritime ports, Liège port complex and the port of Brussels – Report 2017|This Working Paper analyses the economic importance of the Belgian ports largely based on annual accounts data for the year 2017. As the years prior to 2017 have been described in earlier papers in the same series, the emphasis lies on the ﬁgures for 2017 and the developments between 2016 and 2017 . After the stagnation in 2016, direct value added at the Belgian ports rose by 7.3% from € 18 052 million to € 19 368 million (current prices) or roughly 4.4% of Belgium’s GDP. All ports, with the exception of the Liège port complex, contributed to value added growth at the Belgian ports. The ports of Antwerp and Ghent were the most important players. The biggest contributing sectors to value added growth were the chemical industry and, to a lesser extent, cargo handling and the metalworking industry. In 2017, indirect value added was around 82% of direct value added. Direct value added increased significantly at the ports of Ghent, Brussels and Antwerp, by 13.4%, 16.0% and 6.1% respectively. The increase by more than 3% of direct value added at the ports of Zeebrugge and Ostend was also substantial. Direct value added fell by 2.4% at the Liège port complex. After the decline between 2012 and 2015, direct employment at the Belgian ports was up for the second year in a row. Between 2016 and 2017, the number of direct full-time equivalent jobs rose by 0.8%, from 115 401 to 116 311 or approximately 2.8% of Belgium’s total domestic employment. All ports, with the exception of Ostend and Brussels, contributed to employment growth at the Belgian ports. The ports of Antwerp and Ghent were the most important players. The biggest contributing sectors to employment growth were cargo handling and, to a lesser extent, the chemical industry. In 2017, indirect employment was around 120% of direct employment. Direct employment increased by around 1% at the ports of Antwerp, Ghent and Zeebrugge. Growth at the Liège port complex was more modest at 0.4%. The number of direct full-time equivalent jobs fell at the ports of Ostend and Brussels, by 1.2% and 4.2% respectively. The pattern of investment is closely linked to projects and is therefore highly volatile. After the decline between 2012 and 2014, direct investment at the Belgian ports was up for the third year in a row. Between 2016 and 2017, investment was up by 2.4%, from € 4 711 million to € 4 825 million. The port of Ghent and, to a lesser extent, the Liège port complex contributed to investment growth at the Belgian ports. The biggest contributing sectors to investment growth were the ‘port construction and dredging’ sector and, to a lesser extent, cargo handling, and the energy and chemical industries. Based on the figures of the traffic, the Flemish ports can be considered as real bridgeheads for trade with the UK. Developments regarding the modalities and consequences of the Brexit therefor should be followed with the greatest attention. Given the existing import and export volumes in terms of tonnage, it seems it will mostly be a challenge in Zeebrugge and to some extent for Antwerp. As a supplier to both China and the United States, Belgium is indirectly involved in trade between the two countries. If protectionism would close the United States off to exports from abroad, Belgian economy might get impacted one of the most in Europe.
C67|Exploring changes in world production and trade: Insights from the 2018 update of OECD’s ICIO/TIVA database|Drawing on the 2018 update of OECD’s Inter-Country Input-Output (ICIO) database, this paper explores the evolution of trade in value added (TiVA) between 2005 and 2015. Changes in international production systems are examined with particular attention given to four key sectors heavily integrated into global value chains (GVCs): Textiles and Apparel; Chemicals; ICT and Electronics; and, Motor Vehicles. Some insights into the roles played by services sectors and non-residents’ expenditure and, the employment and environmental impacts of GVCs, are also provided.Considerable heterogeneity across countries and regions is revealed, particularly for East and Southeast Asian where China plays a key role. Services are increasingly important for manufactured exporting activities as well as for countries wishing to “upgrade” their activities to higher value added stages of production. Taking a consumption perspective suggests that national efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could be affected by international outsourcing of production.
C67|Local content requirements and their economic effect on shipbuilding: A quantitative assessment|This study quantifies the significant economic gains that are expected to be revealed through the abolition or relaxation of local content based policies. The work analyses two specific local content policies affecting directly or indirectly the shipbuilding industry in two countries: Brazil’s local content requirement as part of national concession contracts in the oil and gas sector, and the long-standing US Jones Act obliging intra-US seaborne trade to be conducted on US built and US flagged vessels. The paper’s static simulation exploits OECD’s latest Trade-in-Value-Added (TiVA) data – a rich database on Inter-Country Input-Output relationships. The database has been disaggregated to the level of the shipbuilding industry, enabling an assessment of the effect of the two selected policies on inter-industry trade. The simulation results suggest large economic benefits for both countries in the long-term despite initial losses in the target industry.
C67|Pakistan Input-Output Table 2010-11|This paper develops Pakistan’s first Input-Output table (IOT) that follows the 2008 System of National Accounts. An IOT examines the structural changes in an economy. The present paper provides Pakistan’s IOT 2010-11 in an industry-by-industry format (42*42). The analysis of backward and forward linkages reveals that manufacturing of food products, beverages, textiles, electricity, gas, steam, air-conditioning and accommodation sectors have strong backward linkages while mining and quarrying, wood products, chemicals and chemical products, electricity, gas, steam, air-conditioning, warehousing and support activities for transportation sectors have strong forward linkages. For national economic growth to be sustainable, the government should facilitate economic activities in these sectors.
C67|Key sectors in Input-Output Production Networks: an application to Brexit|This paper presents the first detailed and holistic description of the European production network (EPN) and provides different rankings of the most 'systemically important' industries involved in Brexit. Employing techniques of complex networks analysis and Input-Output traditional tools, the study identifies those industries that are key in the complex structure of the UK-EU trade relationships. The method developed would help policy-makers to better understand which tariff would have a more distortive impact, which export sector should be pushed, which imports should be safeguarded. Such information may have foremost importance in the negotiations between the UK and EU. Our findings suggest that Brexit would be not just a problem for the UK, as it is often portrayed, but any form of Brexit could propagate affecting the global production system. Further, by inspecting industries centrality within the EPN, we find that the UK could be less exposed to trade barriers than EU countries.
C67|Model and measure the relative efficiency of a four-stage production process. An NDEA multiplier relational model under different systems of resource distribution preferences between sub-processes|Measuring the relative efficiency of a production process with the DEA considers the production process as a “black box” that uses inputs to transform them into outputs. In reality, many production processes are carried out by carrying out several interconnected activities that are usually grouped into phases that are in turn interconnected. For this reason, measuring the relative efficiency of a production process within the DEA technique requires shaping it as a network system (in others words to consider the production process as interconnected sub-process). In the case of network systems, the NDEA approach has developed many models to measure their relative efficiency: independent models, connected models and relational models. In particular, the relational model allows to measure at the same time both the efficiency of the system and the efficiency of the sub-process once the operations between the latter have been considered. In our opinion, many real production processes can be modelled as a network of four sub-processes that are differently interconnected with each other. In this paper we will model a production process as a network of four sub-processes with shared variables and fixed preferences about the allocation of system resources between them. To measure the relative efficiency of the process and its parts we will develop an input-oriented NDEA model in the multiplier version. To solve the model we will use virtual data under several resources allocation preference’s structure. Then we will conclude that 1) a production process with four interconnected sub-processes can represent a large number of real production processes, so the NDEA model developed here can potentially be used for many applications, 2) the resource allocation preference system inter-sub-process influences the measurement of relative efficiency.

C67|Resolutions to flip-over credit risk and beyond|Abstract Given a risk outcome y over a rating system {R_i }_(i=1)^k for a portfolio, we show in this paper that the maximum likelihood estimates with monotonic constraints, when y is binary (the Bernoulli likelihood) or takes values in the interval 0≤y≤1 (the quasi-Bernoulli likelihood), are each given by the average of the observed outcomes for some consecutive rating indexes. These estimates are in average equal to the sample average risk over the portfolio and coincide with the estimates by least squares with the same monotonic constraints. These results are the exact solution of the corresponding constrained optimization. A non-parametric algorithm for the exact solution is proposed. For the least squares estimates, this algorithm is compared with “pool adjacent violators” algorithm for isotonic regression. The proposed approaches provide a resolution to flip-over credit risk and a tool to determine the fair risk scales over a rating system.
C67|Extraction-cum-substitution: A KISS approach to mapping the impacts of bilateral trade conflicts|This paper presents a simple yet powerful methodological tool for analysing the impact of a bilateral trade conflict on third countries when trade includes intermediate inputs. Mixing input-output modelling with recent development of trade in value-added analysis, the extraction-cum-substitution approach maps and measures the sectoral and global interactions in global value chains.It can also be used to generate “in silico” a large data set of numerical “observations” that can be further analysed using appropriate exploratory statistical techniques. The paper counts with three parts, besides introduction and conclusion. The first one is theoretical, starting with a formal model of inter-industry trade before describing the empirical application to input-output analysis. The second part is didactic, illustrating the method on a small six-countries/three-industries model.The third part applies the methodology to the bilateral trade conflict that arose between China and the USA in 2018. This section shows also how the method can also be used for generating analytical data and identify modes of insertion in the global economy. The program, written in open-source R language, is shown in annex.
C67|Performance measurement and decomposition of value added|In this paper, we benchmark an investment actively managed (e.g., fund, portfolio) against a reference portfolio passively managed replicating the investment's cash flows in order to measure the value added by the active investment and decompose it according to the influence of the investment choices (i.e., selection and allocation of assets) made in the various periods. The active investment choices are reflected in the investment's returns as opposed to the benchmark returns earned by the passive strategy. We precisely quantify the impact of the holding period rates on the value added and rank them accordingly, in order to identify the most (and the least) influential ones. The analysis is performed by applying the Finite Change Sensitivity Index (FCSI) method (Borgonovo 2010a, 2010b), a recently-conceived technique of sensitivity analysis, which we refine by means of a duplication-clearing procedure which allows a perfect (i.e., with no residue) decomposition of the value added. We conduct the analysis for a given contribution-and-distribution policy, characterized by a fixed sequence of deposits and withdrawals. We show that, if the contribution-and-distribution policy changes, the effect of the investment choices made in the various periods on the value added changes as well.
C67|The accounting-and-finance of a solar photovoltaic plant: Economic efficiency of a replacement project|In this work we illustrate a simple logical framework serving the purpose of assessing the economic profitability and measuring value creation in a solar photovoltaic (PhV) project and, in general, in a replacement project where the cash-flow stream is nonnegative, with some strictly positive cash flows. We use the projected accounting data to compute the average ROI, building upon Magni (2011, 2019) (see also Magni and Marchioni 2018), which enables retrieving information on the role of the project’s economic efficiency and the role of the project scale on increasing shareholders’ wealth. The average ROI is a genuinely internal measure and does not suffer from the pitfalls of the internal rate of return (IRR), which may be particularly critical in replacement projects such as the purchase of a PhV plant aimed at replacing conventional retail supplies of electricity.
C67|Rating firms and sensitivity analysis|This paper introduces a model for rating a firm's default risk based on fuzzy logic and expert system and an associated model of sensitivity analysis (SA) for managerial purposes. The rating model automatically replicates the evaluation process of default risk performed by human experts. It makes use of a modular approach based on rules blocks and conditional implications. The SA model investigates the change in the firm's default risk under changes in the model inputs and employs recent results in the engineering literature of Sensitivity Analysis. In particular, it (i) allows the decomposition of the historical variation of default risk, (ii) identifies the most relevant parameters for the risk variation, and (iii) suggests managerial actions to be undertaken for improving the firm's rating.
C67|Production Network Structure, Service Share, and Aggregate Volatility|This paper studies differences in production structures across countries and their implications for cross-country heterogeneity in GDP volatility. In particular, economies with more input-output connectionsâ€”a denser networkâ€”are associated with less concentrated sales shares and lower volatility. The relationship between density and volatility is stronger in countries with a higher share of services in GDP (hereafter referred to as service share). To account for this evidence, I propose a generalized production network model in which denser economies display higher production complexity. If production is also specialized in industries that use labor and intermediates as substitute inputs, higher network density indeed lowers the concentration of sales shares and aggregate volatility. U.S. sectoral data suggest that the elasticity of substitution between labor and intermediates in service sectors is larger than one and larger than in non-service sectors. A calibrated model that then also matches each countryâ€™s production network can quantitatively generate observed cross-country empirical patterns. Furthermore, in contrast to previous work, the model predicts that: i) sectoral shocks play only a modest role in accounting for the observed business cycle dynamics, especially in dense and service-oriented economies; and ii) production diversification does not always lower volatility.
C67|The Evolution of Import Content of Production and Exports in Turkey: 2002-2017|This study explores the evolution of the import content of production and exports in Turkey for the 2002-2017 period. Using 2002 and 2012 input-output tables, we estimate the production and imported input use for the remaining years based on a large data set of production and foreign trade for 20 selected sectors, mostly from the manufacturing industry. Import requirement ratios, comprising both direct and indirect linkages, for each sector are calculated using the Leontief inverse matrix. Our findings indicate that import dependency increases for exports, but stays roughly the same for production over time. In general, the import content of production is below the import content of exports. This divergence can mainly be attributed to the services sector, which has relatively low import dependency, yet a significant share in production. Sectors with the highest import requirements are found to be those with higher capital and technology intensity such as coke and refined petroleum products, basic metals and motor vehicles. Agriculture, forestry, and fishery; service and mining sectors are found to have the lowest import requirements.
C67|Research for REGI Committee – Externalities of Cohesion Policy|The study investigates the effects of Cohesion Policy (CP) which occur in a country other than the one in which CP resources were actually spent. The study estimates that macroeconomic spillovers significantly contribute to the impact of CP. Spillovers directed to EU countries represent around 9% of the total annual CP expenditure. Other spillovers to Non-EU countries are around 8% of the CP expenditure. Macro and micro spillovers together arrive at 21% of the annual CP expenditure, 67% of which is distributed among EU countries. Around 20% of the CP expenditure can trigger sectoral spillover effects in the environment, transport and higher education sectors. The analysis demonstrates that externalities reinforce EU growth and competitiveness without CP deserting its convergence objective.
C67|What drives total real unit energy costs globally? A novel LMDI decomposition approach|This paper presents a novel logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition framework that is tailor-made for unit cost indicators. It adds four new models to the existing LMDI model family. The main novelty of the new framework lies in the separation of quantity and price effects captured in unit cost indicators, while retaining the same desirable properties of traditional models. Four case studies apply the novel LMDI framework to the total real unit energy costs (total RUEC) indicator. Total RUEC represents the sum of direct energy costs (for energy products) and indirect energy costs (energy costs embedded in intermediate inputs and passed on along global value chains) as a fraction of value added. This yardstick allows for monitoring shifts in the burden of energy costs on industries. The first three case studies, based on the World Input-Output Database, cover the period between 1995 and 2009. For an up-to-date analysis, a fourth case study collects additional data for 2009-2016 from energy and economic statistics' institutions. Globally, up until 2009, rising costs for crude petroleum/natural gas and the rise of China in the global economy were the largest drivers of total RUEC. In general, increases of indirect energy costs were more substantial than were those of direct energy costs. The total RUEC of Chinese car manufacturers increased much more strongly than did that of American car manufacturers. After 2009 (until 2016), prices for crude petroleum/natural gas and value added generation were major decelerating factors of global direct RUEC, while increases in energy consumption had offsetting effects. This paper provides a suitable tool to scientists who want to build on unit cost indicators in their research in general and to all policy-oriented institutions concerned with monitoring and analysing the energy transition in particular.
C67|Potential international employment effects of a hard Brexit|We use the World Input Output Database (WIOD) to estimate the potential employment effects of a hard Brexit in 43 countries. In line with other studies we assume that imports from the European Union (EU) to the UK will decline by 25% after a hard Brexit. The absolute effects are largest in big EU countries which have close trade relationships with the UK like Germany and France. However, there are also large countries outside the EU which are heavily affected via global value chains like China, for example. The relative effects (in percent of total employment) are largest in Malta and Ireland. UK employment will also be affected via intermediate input production. Within Germany, the motor vehicle industry and in particular the 'Autostadt' Wolfsburg are most affected.
C67|Framing policy on low emissions vehicles in terms of economic gains: might the most straightforward gain be delivered by supply chain activity to support refuelling?|A core theme of the UK GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new Industrial Strategy is exploiting opportunities for domestic supply chain development. This extends to a special Ã¢â‚¬ËœAutomotive Sector DealÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ that focuses on the shift to low emissions vehicles (LEVs). Here attention is on electric vehicle and battery production and innovation. In this paper, we argue that a more straightforward gain in terms of framing policy around potential economic benefits may be made through supply chain activity to support refuelling of battery/hydrogen vehicles. We set this in the context of LEV refuelling supply chains potentially replicating the strength of domestic upstream linkages observed in the UK electricity and/or gas industries. We use input-output multiplier analysis to deconstruct and assess the structure of these supply chains relative to that of more import-intensive petrol and diesel supply. A crucial multiplier result is that for every Ã‚Â£1million of spending on electricity (or gas), 8 full-time equivalent jobs are supported throughout the UK. This compares to less than 3 in the case of petrol/diesel supply. Moreover, the importance of service industries becomes apparent, with 67% of indirect and induced supply chain employment to support electricity generation being located in services industries. The comparable figure for GDP is 42%.
C67|The characteristics of energy employment in a system-wide context|Anticipated changes in energy provision over the next decades will likely have major implications on employment within energy activities. To understand the possible consequences, many studies have considered the level and types of employment in existing energy technologies. Using the hypothetical extraction approach for the UK, we explore the employment in and supported by energy activities - including across occupations and skills categories. We show that the impact on occupation and skills across the whole economy is more evenly spread than the employment in individual sectors. From the empirical results presented here, it is evident that the system-wide demands for skills including not only the direct, but also knock-on effects across the economy can change the pattern of labour market needs, which have implications for labour market planning in the low carbon transition.
C67|On Sharing Responsibilities for Pollution Embodied in Trade|In this article, we propose a new way of assessing environmental responsibility at the country level, taking into account their trade balance in terms of carbon. Starting from the fact that the approach based on the respective responsibilities of the producer and the consumer, which are widely promoted and used in the literature, each have their own limitations, we introduce a modiÖed formula for the net trade balance of carbon at the country level. To do this, we examine the extent to which trade áows for a given country increase or decrease global emissions relative to the virtual situation where imports would have been produced in the consumer country. We argue that it would be fair for countries to retain responsibility for the additional emissions they create when trading. We then discuss the incentives provided by the modiÖed liability rule to reduce emission intensity and extend our formula to include trade in intermediate goods. Finally, we illustrate our concept using World Bank and OECD data on trade áows and emission intensity ratios. Finally, we characterize six groups of countries according to the respective order of their producer, consumer and our new liability rule.
C67|Trade Policies and Integration of the Western Balkans|Based on a newly constructed multi-country input-output table including all European countries, we estimate the economic effects of the EU accession countries entering the ‘Stabilisation and Association Agreement’ (SAA) with the EU and the potential effects of joining the European Single Market applying a structural gravity framework. The results point towards strong positive effects on trade for the SAA countries, but only small effects for the EU Member States. Conducting a counterfactual analysis, the paper gives an indication of the magnitude of the positive impacts on GDP for these countries. In addition, a detailed industry breakdown of these effects is provided.
C67|Competitiveness at the Country-Sector Level: New Measures Based on Global Value Chains|"We propose the so-called domestic ""embodied unit labor costs"" (EULC) at the country-sector level as a new cost-related basis for measures of international competitiveness. EULC take into account that a sector's labor costs constitute only a small share of its total cost which to a large extent consist of expenses for intermediate goods from other sectors. In line with a simple Leontief-type model, the proposed measure is constructed as a weighted average of unit labor costs of all domestic sectors contributing to the final goods of a specific sector. The contribution is expressed in value-added terms and takes global supply chains into account. We also show how EULC can be consistently calculated for sectoral aggregates such as the tradable goods sector. Based on EULC we propose the ""embodied real effective exchange rate"" (EREER) at the country-sector level as a new competitiveness indicator where the relevance of trading partners is quantified by an appropriate value-added measure. The chosen value-added concept replaces gross exports traditionally used as the weight basis in effective exchange rates. Using the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) we employ the proposed indicators to shed new light on changes in cost competitiveness at the sectoral level for Germany, and compare the empirical evidence with selected other euro area countries."
C67|Labour values and energy values|In the history of economic thought various thinkers have been attracted by the problematic idea of a single cause of economic value. Today such ideas appear mostly in studies on the labour theory of value of Karl Marx. In 1867 his “Das Kapital” tried to explain the values of all commodities by a special common substance, the quantity of abstract labour embodied in them, i.e., the direct and indirect labour time necessary to produce them. Several well-known mainstream economists (for example, Wicksteed, Böhm-Bawerk, Wicksell and Pareto) quickly pointed out that labour was not the only common substance in commodities. Another problem was Marx’s deficient mathematics. In Marx’s system the same commodities can appear on the side of the inputs and on the side of the outputs. Today it is well-known that many analytical problems in such circular systems can be solved by means of simultaneous equations of the input-output type. Here the most original contributions were not made by leading economists mentioned above, but by rather unknown outsiders (Mühlpfordt, Dmitriev, Charasoff, Potron), whose pioneering works were neglected for decades. In December 1927, both Sraffa and Leontief, independently of each other, argued that the reduction of all commodities to labour values was not a unique process; from a formal point of view, it was possible to compute not only labour values, but also wheat values, coal values, etc. For various reasons, their insights of 1927 remained rather unnoticed for several decades. A few decades ago the high impact journal Science published some papers advocating the use of energy values, corresponding to the direct and indirect quantity of energy necessary to produce a commodity. The most conspicuous text of this type is the often cited paper “Embodied Energy and Economic Valuation” by Robert Costanza (published in Science in 1980), claiming that both theory and empiry suggest a close connection between prices and energy values. The energy theory of value is usually discussed outside the networks of orthodox or marxian economics, but the empirical and theoretical studies on energy values and labour values show several remarkable cases of analogous arguments and imperfections, both trying to support the use of a single substance of economic value. My paper considers both theoretical and empirical aspects of such discussions on labour values and energy values. I also use a simple numerical example, to illustrate the computation of both labour values and energy values via two methods: via a system of simultaneous input-output equations and via subsystems (vertically integrated systems that produce only one net output). The two computation methods are well-known from the rich literature on labour values, but comparing energy values and labour values forces me to a generalisation of the notion of a subsystem: in order to define this notion unambiguously, I need to specify not only the net output of the subsystem, but also its net input. If the only net input of the subsystem is energy, I use the expression “energy subsystem”. This concept is needed to establish a percentage formula for the deviation of prices from energy values, analogous to my formula for the deviation of prices from labour values. By generalising Sraffa’s notion of subsystems it is possible to explain why supporters of labour values and energy values both present misleadingly “good” empirical results for their favourite theory. Both groups should be more aware of the non-uniqueness of their exaggerated claims for their one sided theories of value.
C67|An Armington–Leontief model|Abstract We develop a novel linear equilibrium model with an Armington flavor. We provide (1) proof of the solvability of the model and of the existence and non-negativity of the equilibrium solution and of the newly derived multiplier matrix; we also show (2) that the standard Leontief multiplier matrix arises as a special case of this new model and (3) that this model allows the computation of multiplier effects with no external output bias, which is particularly relevant for applied economic analysis.
C67|Decomposition of wage inequalities: an input-output approach|Income and wealth inequalities, both between and within the advanced and developing countries,haveattracted much attention in current economic debates. Wage inequalities appear to play akeyrole in the generation of final inequalities in terms of households’ income, consumptionand wealth. In this paper, we propose a decomposition approach based on the input-output analysis that allows us to disentangle the effects on the final inequalities’levels into the contributions of various determinants. So far, the analysis of income and wealth inequalities measured by standard inequality indices, e.g. Gini coefficient, Theil index, has received limited space in the input-output analysis. This does not imply thatissuesof income and wealth inequalities havebeen ignored in this stream of research. The focus of the input-output research has however been directed into distinct aspectsof inequalities. In one way, researchers have put a lot of effort in the understanding how the income and wealthinequalities influence the structure of final demand of households,and eventuallygenerate ambivalent effects on production, value added and employment. Other stream of research in input-output analysis has paid a lot of attention to inequalities that arise from the distribution of income that goes to labour andcapital. We propose to calculate cross-industry and cross-country wage inequalities directly from the input-output tablesandanalyse the final inequality variations through the lens of changes in the inputs. Detailed industry-level data on employees’ wages linked to their hours worked and education attainments, which are covered bythe World input-output database, allow us to illustrate the application of proposed methodology on major advanced and developing countries in the world. The analysis contributes to solving the puzzle around the impactsof human capital and technological progress on income inequality but may shed also more light on the rising global inequalities unfolded by international trade and fragmentation of global value chains.
C67|Revisiting the Efficiency-Equity Trade-off: A Muli-objective Linear Problem combined with an extended Leontief Input Output Model|In recent years there has been increasing interest in the question of how inequality affects economic growth. This growing interest has recently stimulated new theoretical aswell as empirical research. Some existing theoretical models propose income inequality is detrimental to growth, but alternative theoretical models point at inequality as a determinant furthering economic growth. The main goal of this paper is to obtain deeper insights into the so-called efficiency-equity trade-off. Recently the Stiglitz-Report (Stiglitz et al., 2010) revealed several limits of GDP as an indicator of economic performance and social progress and recommended to shift emphasis towards measuring people's well-being. Following this recommendation,we develop a new multiple criteria decision making model coupled with an extended Leontief input-output model taking into account the social dimension and obtain deeper insights into the so-called efficiency-equity trade-off.
C67|Double deflation: theory and practice|Real GDP measured from the output side, GDP(O), should equal real GDP measured from the expenditure side, GDP(E), just as corresponding two approaches to measuring GDP in current prices are necessarily equal. But this is only the case even in theory if real value added in each industry is measured by double deflation. We set out the theory of double deflation using a matrix algebra treatment based on the framework of the Supply and Use Tables. The context is the UKâ€™s national accounts which measures volume growth by chained Laspeyres indices and which currently use single not double deflation. Initially we use simplified assumptions about prices. Later we introduce more realistic assumptions. We analyse the conditions on prices under which real GDP(O) equals real GDP(E). We consider three alternative methods of implementing double deflation. The preferred method makes use of all the price indices which the Office for National Statistics currently collects: Producer Price Indices, Services Producer Price Indices, Consumer Price Indices, Export Price Indices and Import Price Indices. We implement a simplified version of double deflation, using the same data as in the latest vintage of the national accounts, and compare our estimates with the official ones. In this version the same price index is used for each product regardless of whether the product is an output or an input. We find that double-deflated industry growth rates are consistently lower than the official single-deflated ones and also considerably more variable year-to-year. We interpret this finding as reinforcing the case for careful selection of the set of deflators to use for double deflation.

El análisis considera no sólo los efectos directos de la producción de Bavaria S.A. sino también los impactos indirectos, e inducidos de forma tal que pueda capturarse el aporte a la economía a nivel agregado. Para esto, el análisis tiene en cuenta las interrelaciones económicas de Bavaria S.A. con el resto de sectores de la economía, así como con otros agentes como los hogares y el Gobierno plasmadas en una Matriz de Contabilidad Social (SAM). Se encuentra que los efectos indirectos en producción, valor agregado, empleo, salarios y pago de impuestos son importantes, incluso en muchos casos superiores a la contribución directa de la compañía.

C67|Structural change and female participation in recent economic growth: A multisectoral analysis for the Spanish economy|Economic growth has different impacts on gender gaps. Despite that the incorporation of women into the labour market drove towards a convergence with male participation in recent decades, a notable gender pay gap still persists standing at around 15% on average in the European Union. In this context, this paper evaluates the impact of economic growth patterns on the evolution of female employment and gender pay gaps. As a case study, we examine Spanish economic growth from 1980 to 2007 and the influences on the size, composition (by skill), and distribution (by sector) of female and male employment, as well as the consequences for gender gaps. First, sectorial feminization, direct discrimination, and structural change factors are identified and evaluated as sources of change in gender pay gap. Second, we explore the influence of demand, technology, and intensity factors on the evolution of employment in Spain, combining gender, skill, sectorial, and temporal perspectives.
C67|How shifting investment towards low-carbon sectors impacts employment: Three determinants under scrutiny|The threat of climate change requires redirecting investment towards low-carbon sectors, and this shift generates heated debates about its impact on employment. Many studies exist, most of which use CGE or Input-Output (IO) models. However, the economic mechanisms at play remain unclear. This paper disentangles the channels of job creation and studies to what extent the results of simpler IO models diverge from CGE results.
C67|The Origins of Aggregate Fluctuations in a Credit Network Economy|I show that inter-firm lending plays an important role in business cycle fluctuations. I first build a tractable network model of the economy in which trade in intermediate goods is financed by supplier credit. In the model, a financial shock to one firm affects its ability to make payments to its suppliers. The credit linkages between firms propagate financial shocks, amplifying their aggregate effects by about 30 percent. To calibrate the model, I construct a proxy of inter-industry credit flows from firm- and industry-level data. I then estimate aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks to industries in the US and find that financial shocks are a prominent driver of cyclical fluctuations, accounting for two-thirds of the drop in industrial production during the Great Recession. Furthermore, idiosyncratic financial shocks to a few key industries can explain a considerable portion of these effects. In contrast, productivity shocks had a negligible impact during the recession.

Analyses for 2014 show that energy products as well as food and non-alcoholic beverages are the most air polluting expenditure categories.
C67|Working Paper 11-18 - Value chain integration of export-oriented and domestic market manufacturing firms - An analysis based on a heterogeneous input-output table for Belgium|For a finer analysis of competitiveness and value chain integration, this working paper presents a micro-data based breakdown of manufacturing industries in the 2010 Belgian supply-and-use and input-output tables into export-oriented and domestic market firms. The former are defined as those firms that export at least 25% of their turnover. Analyses based on the resulting export-heterogeneous IOT reveal differences between the two in terms of input structures and import behaviour: export-oriented manufacturers have lower value-added in output shares, and they import proportionally more of the intermediates they use. Moreover, exports of export-oriented manufacturers generate a substantial amount of value added in other Belgian firms, in particular providers of services. The policy implication of these results is that Belgium's external competitiveness depends not only on exporters but also on firms that mainly serve the domestic market. To maximise the impact of export promotion in terms of domestically generated value added, the entire value chain for the production of exports must be taken into account.
C67|National Policies for Global Emission Reductions: Effectiveness of Carbon Emission Reductions in International Supply Chains|In a world with diverging emission reduction targets, national climate policies might be ineffective in reducing consumption-based CO2 emissions (carbon footprints), i.e. emissions of final demand that are embodied across the whole supply chain, including international fractions. We analyse a set of different policies in three areas with particularly high consumption-based emissions in Austria: building construction, public health, and transport. To capture the substitution possibilities triggered by these policies and the induced emission reductions along the full global supply chain, our analysis combines a Computable General Equilibrium with a Multi-Regional Input-Output model. For construction of buildings we find that a carbon added tax is highly effective in reducing consumption-based emissions whereas an information obligation on vacant dwellings combined with a penalty payment when vacant buildings are not made available is ineffective because of reallocated investment capital. Mandatory energy efficiency improvements in public health and mobility are found equally effective in reducing consumption- and production-based emissions while a decarbonization of freight transport logistics stronger reduces production-based emissions. Overall, the effectiveness of policies, to mitigate consumption-based emissions, is therefore determined by the backward and forward linkages of the sector addressed by the policy as well as the substitution effects within final demand.

C67|Multi-sectoral value chain in a bilateral general equilibrium|The information and communication technology (ICT) is a key engine of economic growth. In this paper, we examine the impact of ICT innovation using a multifactor constant elasticity of substitution (CES) general equilibrium model. Innovation not only leads to productivity growth and thus influence prices, it also changes output and trade patterns, and welfare. To examine trade values, we construct a bilateral multifactor CES general equilibrium model between Japan and the Republic of Korea using linked input–output tables. We estimate elasticities of substitution and productivity growths of the ICT sectors, to assess the effects of ICT improvement on the two countries.
C67|Structure and comparison of the electronics and motor vehicle value chains in East Asia|This paper explores the structure of the electronics and the motor vehicle value chains in East Asia. Trade in value added analysis and its decomposition method are applied to the inter-country input–output data of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The method of value chain mapping has been introduced to illustrate the upstream and downstream transactions of goods and services along the value chain. The result of the analysis shows that the electronics industry has a greater vertical specialisation (VS) share than the automotive industry. The decomposition analysis reveals that the Korean industries were strongly integrated into the Chinese value chains, whereas the Thai industries continued to be overwhelmingly dependent on Japan, albeit, with increased linkages with neighbouring Southeast Asian economies. Moreover, value chain mapping demonstrated that China has increased its presence not only as an export platform for multinational firms but also as a consumer of final goods―especially for the Korean industries.
C67|Flow-of-funds analysis in the Brazilian economy (2004–2014)|This paper is applies the flow-of-funds (FOF) framework proposed by Tsujimura and Mizoshita (2004) to investigate the structure of financial system in the Brazilian economy. The study presents the compilation process of the asset–liability matrix (ALM) and then develops an ALM with six institutional sectors (households, non-financial firms, government, the rest of world, financial firms and the Central Bank of Brazil) for the years 2004 to 2014. From the Brazilian ALM, FOF indexes are calculated (the power of dispersion, the sensitivity of dispersion and the discrepancy of dispersion). For selected years, the structural decomposition of change in the discrepancy index is calculated and an additional expansion presents an ALM with four additional financial firms: three government-sponsored banks—Banco do Brasil, Caixa Econômica Federal, and Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social —and one private bank—Itaú. The role of each institutional sector in the Brazilian financial system is illustrated and the discrepancy of dispersion is highlighted with a good indicator of economic problems showing that the origin of recessions in Brazilian economy was almost in the structure of the financial system.
C67|Network-based macro fluctuations: Evidence from Lithuania|Do inter-sectoral linkages of intermediate products affect the spread of sectoral shocks at the aggregate level in Lithuania, a small and open economy? We answer this question by: i) constructing the domestic sector-by-sector direct requirements table using the Lithuanian interindustry transactions tables, and ii) applying Acemoglu et al. (2012)'s network-based methodology and Gabaix and Ibragimov (2011)'s modified log rank-log size regression to analyse the nature of inter-sectoral linkages. Our results indicate that the direct and indirect inter-sectoral linkages cause aggregate volatility to decay at a rate lower than square root of n - the rate predicted by the standard diversification argument. Furthermore, indirect linkages play an important role in the above-mentioned process, supporting the findings of Acemoglu et al. (2012). These results suggest that the inter-sectoral network of linkages represent a potential propagation mechanism for idiosyncratic shocks throughout the Lithuanian economy.
C67|Global Value Chains and Vertical Specialization: The case of Portuguese Textiles and Shoes exports|This paper evaluates the growing participation of the Portuguese economy, and especially of the textiles, leather, and shoes industry, in the so-called Global Value Chains (GVCs).We use the 2016 edition of the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) to empirical assess the changes in the geography of imports and exports of the Portuguese textiles, leather and shoes industry as well as quantify the growing vertical specialization in this sector. We also measure value added, import and employment coefficients for the Portuguese economy and the Portuguese textiles, leather, and shoes sector. The results show that Portuguese textiles, leather, and shoes trade have been more concentrated in Spain, Italy, India and China and less concentrated in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. This sector is more relevant in the Portuguese economy than in any other Eurozone economy in terms of output, employment and value-added, and it has been recovering its relevance in the Portuguese economy since 2009.Textiles, leather, and shoes is the manufacturing industry with the higher potential to generate new jobs in Portugal. Despite the negative contribution of the financial crisis, vertical specialization of Portuguese textiles, leather, and shoes exports have been increasing ever since.
C67|The Input-Output Analysis Of Blue Industries: Comparative Study Of Estonia And Finland|The paper focuses on examining the role of blue industries in the national economies of Estonia and Finland as two neighbouring countries that have a sea border. We exploit the Input-Output (I-O) methodology to analyse inter-industry linkages relying on the OECD I-O tables. The OECD database comprises information on 34 sectors of the national economy over the period 1995–2011. The results of the analysis show that despite rather weak overall backward and forward linkages of aggregated blue industries within the national economies, they play a remarkable role in the economic activities of maritime regions, and to a large extent drive the economic success of Estonian and Finnish regional and national economies in generating new growth and employment. The weak backward and forward linkages indicate that negative dynamics within the blue economy yield rather weak negative externalities for the overall economy, and by contrast, if the national economy as a whole is suffering under a crisis, the potential impact on industries is not particularly remarkable. These findings suggest that blue industries are relatively independent within national economies having a remarkable role in socio-economic development of maritime regions, and thereby, create good preconditions for the stable development of cross-border cooperation between the maritime regions of both countries.
C67|The economic importance of the Belgian ports : Flemish maritime ports, Liège port complex and the port of Brussels – Report 2016|This Working Paper analyses the economic importance of the Belgian ports based largely on the annual accounts data for the year 2016. As the years prior to 2016 have been described in earlier papers in the same series, we mainly focus on the figures for 2016 and developments between 2015 and 2016. On the back of strong growth, direct value added in the Belgian ports remained more or less stable in 2016 at around € 18 000 million (current prices) or roughly 4.3% of Belgium’s GDP. Direct value added declined in the Flemish seaports, mainly in the port of Antwerp. Ghent and Zeebrugge could only partly compensate for the fall in Antwerp’s value added, while Ostend showed a small decline itself. The inland ports as a whole grew over the period 2015-2016; the port of Brussels registered a decline and the Liège port complex an increase. Indirect value added is around 82% of the direct figure. After declining from 2012, direct employment in the Belgian ports was more or less stable in 2016 at around 115 000 FTE or approximately 2.8% of Belgium’s total domestic employment. Direct employment in the Flemish seaports increased, mainly in the ports of Zeebrugge, Ghent and Antwerp. Ostend showed a decline in employment. The inland ports recorded lower employment; the port of Brussels registered a decline, as did the Liège port complex. Indirect employment is around 1.2 times the direct figure. Delving deeper into the data and trying to explain the above trends in terms of the structural composition of the Belgian ports shows that all ports are concentrated on a few sectors, and within those sectors often on just a handful of companies. Based on the figures of the traffic, the Flemish ports can be considered as real bridgeheads for trade with the UK. Developments regarding the modalities and consequences of the Brexit therefor should be followed with the greatest attention. Given the existing import and export volumes in terms of tonnage, it seems it will mostly be a challenge in Zeebrugge and to some extent for Antwerp.
C67|The Role of Exporters and Domestic Producers in GVCs: Evidence for Belgium based on Extended National Supply-and-Use Tables Integrated into a Global Multiregional Input-Output Table|For a finer analysis of global value chain integration and competitiveness, we develop and apply a method for a micro-data based breakdown of manufacturing industries in the 2010 Belgian supply-and-use tables into export-oriented and domestic market firms. The former are defined as those firms that export at least 25% of their turnover. We then derive export-heterogeneous national input-output tables which we integrate into a global table. Our analyses reveal that: a) export-oriented manufacturers have lower value-added in output shares and import proportionally more of the intermediates they use; b) exports of export-oriented manufacturers generate substantial value added in other Belgian firms, in particular providers of services; c) Belgium’s backward participation in global value chains is mainly due to export-oriented manufacturers and its forward participation is due to other firms, d) export-oriented manufacturers participate in value chains that comprise, on average, a greater number of upstream and downstream production stages and of which a greater share is located abroad.
C67|The Persistent Statistical Structure of the US Input-Output Coefficient Matrices: 1963-2007|The paper finds evidence for the existence of a statistical structure in the US input-output (I-O) coefficient matrices A = f{aij} for 1963-2007. For various aspects of matrices A we find smooth and unimodal empirical frequency distributions (EFD) with a remarkable stability in their functional form for most of the samples. The EFD of all entries, diagonal entries, row sums, and the (left and right) Perron-Frobenius eigenvectors are well described by fat-tailed distributions while the EFD of column sums and eigenvalue moduli are well explained by the normal distribution and the Beta distribution, respectively. The paper provides several economic interpretations of these statistical results based on the recent developments in the I-O analysis and the price of production literature. Our findings question some probabilistic assumptions conventionally adopted in the stochastic I-O analysis literature and call for a statistical approach to the discussion of the structure of I-O matrices.
C67|Eigenvalue distribution, matrix size and the linearity of wage-profit curves|Brody (1997), while experimenting with random matrices, conjectured that the relative size of the second eigenvalue with respect to the first tended to fall as a random matrix got larger. Bidard and Schatteman (2001) proved that in a random matrix with independently and identically distributed entries the speed of convergence increases with the size of the matrix because the relative size of all subdominant eigenvalues tends to zero as the matrix size approaches infinity. Schefold (2010) then showed that zero subdominant eigenvalues imply linear wage-profit curves for any given numeraire. Our concern is with actual input-output matrices. We successively aggregate the US 2002 matrix from 403 to 10 industries and observe the distribution of the moduli of eigenvalues at each level of aggregation. The random matrix hypothesis predicts that both the size of ratio of the modulus of second eigenvalue to the first and the average size of all moduli will fall toward zero as matrix size increases. At an empirical level, we find that the eigenvalue ratio rises while the average size of eigenvalue moduli falls towards a positive constant. These findings do not support the applicability of Brody’s conjecture for real input-output tables, and by implication do not support the hypothesis that wage-profit curves will become strictly linear in the limit. It is still possible to reconcile our findings with empirically observed near-linear wage-profit curves.
C67|"Fiscal Policy, as the ""Employer of Last Resort"": Impact of MGNREGS on Labour Force Participation Rates in India"|"We examine the impact of conditional fiscal transfers on public employment across gender in India taking the case of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). The MGNREGS, as an ""employer of last resort"" fiscal policy, is a direct employment transfer, which guarantees to provide 100 days of paid work opportunities at a predetermined wage for public works in India through a self-selection criterion. Using unit record data of the latest 68th round of NSS Employment-Unemployment survey, we examined gender differential impacts of MGNREGS on labour force participation rates across States in India. The unit of analysis in our paper is not `household', but is one step ahead to capture the intra-household level of participating behaviour in the economic activity. The results, based on the survey enumerating 2,80,763 individuals in rural areas, revealed that there is a striking heterogeneity in the gender impacts of job guarantee programme across States of India. The probit estimates showed that MGNREGS job card holder's labour force participation rates were higher than the non-card holders and the result was more pronounced for women. The analysis of the time-use patterns and the unpaid care economy statistics of job guarantee card holders obtained from the unit records also shows that augmenting public investment in care economy infrastructure is significant for the job guarantee programme to function at its full potential in India."
C67|Double Deflation: theory and practice|Real GDP measured from the output side, GDP(O), should equal real GDP measured from the expenditure side, GDP(E), just as corresponding two approaches to measuring GDP in current prices are necessarily equal. But this is only the case even in theory if real value added in each industry is measured by double deflation. We set out the theory of double deflation using a matrix algebra treatment based on the framework of the Supply and Use Tables. The context is the UK’s national accounts which measures volume growth by chained Laspeyres indices and which currently use single not double deflation. Initially we use simplified assumptions about prices. Later we introduce more realistic assumptions. We analyse the conditions on prices under which real GDP(O) equals real GDP(E). We consider three alternative methods of implementing double deflation. The preferred method makes use of all the price indices which the Office for National Statistics currently collects: Producer Price Indices, Services Producer Price Indices, Consumer Price Indices, Export Price Indices and Import Price Indices. We implement a simplified version of double deflation, using the same data as in the latest vintage of the national accounts, and compare our estimates with the official ones. In this version the same price index is used for each product regardless of whether the product is an output or an input. We find that double-deflated industry growth rates are consistently lower than the official single-deflated ones and also considerably more variable year-to-year. We interpret this finding as reinforcing the case for careful selection of the set of deflators to use for double deflation.
C67|Water Content in Trade: A Regional Analysis for Morocco|This paper reports the results of an application using an interregional input-output matrix for Morocco together with regional information on water consumption by sectors. We develop a trade-based index that reveals the relative water use intensities associated with specific interregional and international trade flows. We estimate, for each flow associated with each origin-destination pair, measures of trade in value added and trade in water that are further used to calculate our index. We add to the existing literature on virtual water flows by encompassing the subnational perspective in the case study of a country that shows a â€œclimate divideâ€ : while a great part of the southern territory is located in the Sahara Desert, with serious water constraints, the northern part is relatively more privileged with access to this natural resource. Furthermore, we compare that Trade-Based Index of Water Intensity to similar metrics related to the use of other natural resources.
C67|GVCS and centrality: Mapping key hubs, spokes and the periphery|This paper uses “centrality” metrics to reflect position with Global Value Chains (GVCs). Central sectors reflect those that are highly connected (both directly and indirectly) and influential within globalproduction networks, whereas peripheral sectors exhibit weak linkages and are less influential. Applying these metrics to OECD ICIO data, reveals there have been profound changes in the structure of GVCs over the period 1995-2011. Whilst some activities remain clustered around the same key hubs as was the case at the start of the period (e.g. motor vehicles), for others there have been dramatic changes in the geography of economic activity (e.g. IT manufacturing), whereas other activities have become more influential for value chains almost universally (e.g. IT services). Several emerging economies and their industries have become more central to global production networks. We find this is particularly true of most peripheral industries of Eastern European countries, with their growing importance coinciding with the timing of their EU accession. Asian value chains have also undergone substantial reorganisation. In particular, the centrality of Japanese industries has fallen from an initial position of being the key hub within Asian value chains and the bulk of this fall does not appear to be due to the decline in size of the Japanese economy over this period. This is in contrast with trends in foreign value added content of exports of these Japanese industries, which increased over the same time period, illustrating that the centrality measure does not seem to simply reflect features captured by existing GVC metrics.
C67|Less Is More: Capital Theory And Almost Irregular-Uncontrollable Actual Economies|Capital theory and the price effects consequent upon changes in the distributive variables hold center stage when it comes to the internal consistency of both classical and neoclassical theories of value. This paper briefly reviews the literature and then focuses on the detected skew eigenvalue distribution of the vertically integrated technical coefficients matrices of actual economies. The findings prompt the use of the Schur triangularization theorem for the construction even of a single industry from the input–output structure of the entire economy. Such a hyper-basic industry, in combination with hyper-non-basic industries, embodies properties that may capture the behavior of the entire economic system. Thus, we can derive some meaningful results consistent with the available empirical evidence, which finally suggest that actual economies tend to respond as ‘irregular-uncontrollable’ systems.
C67|Economic drivers of greenhouse gas-emissions in small open economies: A hierarchical structural decomposition analysis|The Paris agreement has prescribed strict Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reduction targets for participating countries. Implementation of climate protection policies is challenging, especially if the economy is export driven. We introduce a hierarchical structural decomposition model in order to investigate the effects of exports, imports, economic structure, consumption patterns, consumption level, outsourcing and insourcing on national GHG emissions. This model is applied to the data of national environmental accounts and to a harmonized and price-deflated series of national input-output tables of Austria for the years 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010. Over the whole time period, the results indicate that the final demand effect was the main driver of GHG emissions, with exports as most important factor. Surprisingly, emission intensity contributed to an increase of GHG emissions during the period 2000-2005 as well, mostly due to increasing emission intensity in the transport sector.
C67|Ricardo’s Theory of Value is Still Alive and Well in Contemporary Capitalism|The purpose of this article is, on the one hand, to shed light on some significant aspects of Ricardo's theory of value and on the other hand to show that Ricardo's insights about the explanatory power of the relative labour times on the movement of relative prices were in the right direction. For this purpose, Ricardo's theory of value is cast rigorously and in modern terms such that by using detailed intertemporal data from input-output tables of two major economies to show that Ricardo's insights are absolutely consistent with the facts.
C67|Dissecting the Input-Output Structure of the Greek Economy|Using input-output table data and a system of basic and derivative indices, the analysis in this paper provides a dissection of the Greek economy for the years 2005 and 2010. The findings suggest that: (i) the structural features of the economy have been shaped well before the emergence of the so-called Greek (or PIIGS) crisis; (ii) a well-targeted effective demand management policy could be mainly based on the service and primary production sectors; and (iii) industrial policy would be necessary and could primarily focus on nine highly import-dependent commodities of the industry sector. Therefore, it seems that a change in the intersectoral structure of the Greek economy is necessary.
C67|Mapping the UK domestic and global value chains from a Brexit perspective|The paper offers background information for a sectoral analysis of the Brexit implications on the UK value chains. It analyses trade data through the specific angle of inter-industrial relation-ships and international supply chains, including employment implications. The paper benchmarks UK against other key G-20 countries for three specific industries that have a particular relevance from an inter-industrial perspective: Transport equipment, Chemicals and Electronics. In the pro-cess, a number of stylised facts are identified and several synthetic indicators are produced. Be-cause a hard Brexit is expected to increase trade costs and affect prices, the paper estimates the impact of additional tariff and non-tariff trade costs on the competitiveness of these three sectors. Hopes that a devaluation of the Pound may compensate for higher trade costs must take into con-sideration that devaluation affects only the domestic share of the value-added, requiring larger exchange rate adjustment. In the case of Transport equipment, the required devaluation is around 30% if all tariff and non-tariff trade costs are passed to the producers.
C67|Performances management when modelling internal structure|The performances management is a key issue for public as well as private organizations. The core of the performances management in the DEA context are essentially the relative efficiency measurement for organizations considered as a “black box” that use inputs to produce two or more outputs. In reality, organizations/ production process are comprised of a number of divisions/stages which performs different functions/tasks interacting among them. For these reasons modelling internal structures of organizations/production process allow to discover the inefficiency of individual divisions/stages. In this paper we estimate the relative efficiency of a production process once modelling its internal structure with a network structure of three divisions/stages interrelated among them. To outline the differences in the performances management in the two cases (“black box” vs network structure) we compare they empirical cumulative distribution functions.
C67|Classical labour values – properties of economic reproduction|We attempt to clarify the meaning of labour value, a concept that originated in classical political economy. Using a modern formalism, we show that labour values are understood as a field property, or equivalently a characteristic accounting property, of economic reproduction. The applicability of the concept is discussed and its relation to productivity, employment, surplus labour and unproductive activities are demonstrated.
C67|A non-linear post-Keynesian Goodwin-type endogenous model of the cycle for the USA|Since its original formulation, Goodwin’s (1967) approach became a standard endogenous business cycles model. However, despite its elegant mathematical formulation, the empirical estimation of Goodwin-type models has not always ended up in success. The present paper uses the so-called Bhaduri-Marglin accumulation function in Goodwin’s original growth cycle model. Based on its derived equations of motion and dynamic properties, we econometrically estimate the proposed model for the case of the US economy in the time period 1960-2012, using structural breaks. The empirical estimation is very satisfactory and, in general terms, consistent with economic theory and the findings by other researchers on the US economy. The results of this work suggest that the proposed approach is an appropriate vehicle for expanding and improving traditional Goodwin-type models.
C67|Impacts of Public Infrastructure Investment in South Africa: A SAM and CGE-Based Analysis of the Public Economic Sector|This paper assesses the general equilibrium impacts of public infrastructure investment in the South African economy by making use of complementary general equilibrium models, such as the social accounting matrix (SAM) multiplier, the Structural Path Analyses (SPA) and the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models. Both the SAM and CGE analyses indicate that increasing public economic infrastructure can be an effective way of stimulating the economy in a way that has a positive impact on labour. SPA shows that the main and most important path of influence is a direct influence of the public economic sector on each of the formal labour categories. However, because the public economic sector does not employ informal labour, this labour account is only connected indirectly via intermediate consumption of the construction sector output. This is an important outcome for South Africa, as the results suggest that an increase in public economic infrastructure could help address the problem of unemployment as well as that of low income levels that exacerbate poverty
C67|Investment decisions and sensitivity analysis: NPV-consistency of rates of return|Investment decisions may be evaluated via several different metrics/criteria, which are functions of a vector of value drivers. The economic significance and the reliability of a metric depend on its compatibility with the Net Present Value (NPV). Traditionally, a metric is said to be NPV-consistent if it is coherent with NPV in signaling value creation. This paper makes use of Sensitivity Analysis (SA) for measuring coherence between rates of return and NPV. In particular, it introduces a new, stronger definition of NPV-consistency that takes into account the influence of value drivers on the metric output. A metric is strongly NPV-consistent if it signals value creation and the ranking of the value drivers in terms of impact on the output is the same as that provided by the NPV. The degree of (in)coherence is calculated with Spearman (1904) correlation coefficient and Iman and Conover (1987) top-down coefficient. We focus on the class of AIRRs (Magni 2010, 2013) and show that the average Return On Investment (ROI) enjoys strong NPV-consistency under several (possibly all) methods of Sensitivity Analysis.
C67|Distortions and the Structure of the World Economy|We develop a model of the world economy as input-output relationships subject to distortions. We then propose a methodology to solve the identification problem, common to the literature on misallocation in input-output relationships, of separating sectoral TFPs from the sectoral distortions. Using both the input shares and the consumption shares within the CES production and CES consumption structure we derive simple closed-form sufficient statistics for the sectoral distortions and for the sectoral TFPs. We then derive a closed-form solution of the elasticities of each entry in the world input-output matrix to distortions. We compute a total of more than half a million internal distortions and TFPs and document significant heterogeneity of those across countries and sectors. We then calculate the whole matrix of about two million elasticities to distortions and TFPs of the input-output matrix of the world economy. We show that internal (within a given country) distortions significantly affect the structure of the economy of that country and have sizeable cross effects on the input-output matrix of other countries. We then find that the world GDP elasticity to changes in internal distortions is an order of magnitude larger than that of the external distortions.
C67|Export Boom and Economic Performance: Bolivia 2004-2015|The supercycle of high commodity prices has had profound impacts on the Bolivian economy. We have investigated the relations of commodity prices with the main indicators of macroeconomic performance. We have found significant ties in our statistical analysis. An important question that we address concerns the consequences of the transitory export boom on the long term rate of growth of the economy. Also, given the importance of fiscal linkages with windfall income, we examined the procyclality of public expenditures based on an analysis of correlations of the cyclical components. We find positive but weak correlations. With export booms, consumption increases but also saving rates. Savings have been invested in foreign assets and, to a large extent, in construction. We find that commodity prices and per capita value added in the construction sector are co-integrated, suggesting a long term relationship. Also we looked into the real linkages of the hydrocarbons sector with other sectors of the economy through an Input-Output analysis. Finally, we have conducted a set of simulations, with a small Computable General Equilibrium Model adapted to the Bolivian conditions, to trace the domestic price and quantity effects of the commodity price increases.
C67|ECIO Model Operators Guide|The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL)/ West Virginia University (WVU) Econometric Input-Output (ECIO) model is a time-series enabled hybrid econometric input-output (IO) model that combines the capabilities of econometric modeling with the strengths of IO modeling. The model was developed and designed specifically for estimating the income and employment impacts of the development and deployment of new energy technologies over a given forecast period. The ECIO model consists of a macroeconomic econometric model of the United States (U.S.) national economy and an inter-industry model that reflects the interdependence of all the industries in the economy. These two components have three modules and several sub-modules of interrelated equations for the U.S. economy, with employment and income detail for 32 industrial sectors. This document is designed to escort a user with little computing or programing experience through the processes of setting up the ECIO model application to run on a personal computer (PC). The document will guide user through the various stages of the ECIO model with screenshots and instructions. Using this guide and standardized input data files (in .csv format) that are generated by the NETL NEMS-ECIO Translation Tool, users should be able run the model to generate estimates of deployment scenario impacts.
C67|Value Added Trade Restrictiveness Indexes. Measuring Protection Within Global Value Chains|Production and trade are increasingly organized within Global Value Chains (GVCs) and therefore assessing who effectively pays the cost of protection is not straightforward. Since exports rely on imported inputs, the evaluation of trade policies requires the use of new trade metrics on a value-added base in order to assess in which country the value embedded in trade has been actually produced. We define a new set of trade policy indexes in the spirit of the protection indexes introduced by Anderson and Neary, based on the value added in trade: the Value Added Trade Restrictiveness Indexes (VATRIs). VATRIs are theoretically sound protection measurements that make use of the trade flow decomposition proposed by the recent value added in trade literature. We compute the direct and indirect components of trade protection by computing the VATRIs using the Global Trade Analysis Project computable general equilibrium model.
C67|Generation of regional input-output tables: a spatial econometric approach with illustrative simulations for France,Germany and Poland|This paper investigates the construction of multisector-multiregion input-output tables by using spatial econometric methods. I demonstrate that, under reasonable assumptions, the problem of finding Leontief's technical coeffecients can be formulated as a modified multi-equation spatial Durbin model and the missing parameters can be estimated via maximum likelihood. The resulting coefficients are computed as a function of country-wide coeffiecients, as well as distance and regional-sectorial data on value added. The statistical performance of the model is scrutinized and the method is illustrated with simulations of regional (NUTS-3 level) economic impact assessment - for generic companies located in Southern France, Germany and Poland.
C67|Estimation of NUTS2 Interregional Input-Output Systems for Greece, 2010 and 2013|The aim of this paper is to describe in details the process of estimation of two interregional input-output systems for Greece, for the years 2010 and 2013. Further understanding of the changing structure of the Greek regional economies during the crisis, within an integrated interregional system, is one of the main goals of a broader project underway at the University of SÃ£o Paulo Regional and Urban Economics Lab (NEREUS). With this paper, we make available not only the details of the methodological procedures adopted to generate the interregional systems, but also the database itself to be used by other researchers and practitioners.
C67|Water Content in Trade: A Regional Analysis for Morocco|This paper reports the results of an application using an interregional input-output matrix for Morocco together with regional information on water consumption by sectors. We develop a trade-based index that reveals the relative water use intensities associated with specific interregional and international trade flows. We estimate, for each flow associated with each origin-destination pair, measures of trade in value added and trade in water that are further used to calculate our index. We add to the existing literature on virtual water flows by encompassing the subnational perspective in the case study of a country that shows a “climate divide”: while a great part of the southern territory is located in the Sahara Desert, with serious water constraints, the northern part is relatively more privileged with access to this natural resource. Furthermore, we compare that Trade-Based Index of Water Intensity to similar metrics related to the use of other natural resources.
C67|A növekedés lehetőségei és kockázatai. Magyarország feldolgozóipari exportteljesítményének és ágazati szerkezetének vizsgálata, 2010-2014<BR>[Growth opportunities and risks in Hungary's industrial mix and export performance, 2010 2014]|A tanulmány a magyar gazdaság szerkezeti átalakulását s ennek növekedésre gyakorolt hatásait vizsgálja input-output táblák és hozzáadottérték-multiplikátorok segítségével. Az időszak elején még domináns, majd visszaszoruló számítógép- és elektronikaiberendezés-gyártás, valamint az egyre inkább kiemelkedő közútijármű- gyártás szorzói a legalacsonyabbak között vannak. A két húzóágazat GDP-hez való jelentős hozzájárulása sokkal inkább hatalmas termelési és kiviteli volumenüknek, mint hozzáadottérték-hányadaiknak és hazai beszállítóikra tovagyűrűző hatásaiknak köszönhető. A keresleti komponensek közül ezért az exportra, az ágazatok közül pedig ennek legnagyobb hányadát adó, az ágazati politika középpontjában álló feldolgozóiparra koncentrálunk. Megmutatjuk, hogy a 2009-ben bekövetkezett exportsokk nagyjából fél százalékkal nagyobb visszaesést eredményezett volna 2014-ben, mint 2010-ben. A feldolgozóipari kivitelnek tulajdonítható várható növekedés emelkedett, nőtt ugyanakkor ennek szórása, vagyis a növekedés kockázata is. A közútijármű-gyártás mindkét változáshoz való hozzájárulása kiemelkedő. Kimutatható az is, hogy a 2010-ben még két domináns ágazattal rendelkező gazdasági szerkezet fennmaradása jóval kedvezőbb növekedési és kockázati feltételeket teremtett volna, ami a diverzifikáció fontosságára hívja fel a figyelmet.* Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) kód: C67, F43, G11, O11, O14.
C67|Cambodia Macroeconomic Impacts of Public Consumption on Education: A Computable General Equilibrium Approach|Employing the available social accounting matrix, this paper examines the impacts of different public education consumption schemes on Cambodian macroeconomics, the labour market and household welfare. The results from the simulation scenarios in the CGE model revealed that the reallocation of public spending from primary and secondary education to higher education produced a negative impact on the wage rate of low and fairly educated labour, dropped outputs, and reduced household welfare, which had adverse effects on macroeconomic variables in general. However, the shift of public spending from administration to the three education sectors, showed positive impacts on the economy, household income and welfare. Given the factor endowment structure of the Cambodian education sector, the policy that focuses on higher education by providing more spending to this sector did not yield results as good as keeping the initial education spending structure.

C67|Economic importance of the Belgian ports: Flemish maritime ports, Liège port complex and the port of Brussels - Report 2015|This paper is an annual publication issued by the Microeconomic Analysis service of the National Bank of Belgium. The Flemish maritime ports (Antwerp, Ghent, Ostend, Zeebrugge), the Autonomous Port of Liège and the port of Brussels play a major role in their respective regional economies and in the Belgian economy, not only in terms of industrial activity but also as intermodal centers facilitating the commodity flow. This update paper1 provides an extensive overview of the economic importance and development of the Flemish maritime ports, the Liège port complex and the port of Brussels for the period 2010 - 2015, with an emphasis on 2015. Focusing on the three major variables of value added, employment and investment, the report also provides some information based on the social balance sheet and an overview of the financial situation in these ports as a whole. These observations are linked to a more general context, along with a few cargo statistics. Annual accounts data from the Central Balance Sheet Office were used for the calculation of direct effects, the study of financial ratios and the analysis of the social balance sheet. The indirect effects of the activities concerned were estimated in terms of value added and employment, on the basis of data from the National Accounts Institute. As a result of the underlying calculation method the changes of indirect employment and indirect value added can differ from one another. The developments concerning economic activity in the six ports in 2014 - 2015 are summarized in the table on the next page. In 2015 the growth of maritime traffic in the Flemish maritime ports was due to developments in the port of Antwerp and the port of Ghent. Direct value added increased in all Flemish maritime ports in 2015. However, direct employment is continuing to decline. Investment was down everywhere except in the port of Zeebrugge. Cargo traffic in the Liège port complex declined in 2015, whereas it slightly slowed down in the port of Brussels. At the same time, direct value added in Liège shrank while it rose sharply in the port of Brussels. By contrast, direct employment was down in both ports. This report provides a comprehensive account of these issues, giving details for each economic sector, although the comments are confined to the main changes that occurred in 2015.
C67|Economic importance of air transport and airport activities in Belgium – Report 2015|This study assesses the economic importance of air transport and airport activities in Belgium in terms of value added, employment and investment over the 2013-2015 period 1 . The sector considered embraces not only the activities directly connected with air transport, but also all those that take place on site at the six Belgian airports (Antwerp, Brussels,Charleroi, Kortrijk, Liège and Ostend). The study reviews the direct and indirect effects of the sector on the basis of microeconomic data (mainly obtained from the Central Balance Sheet Office) and mesoeconomic data (from the National Accounts Institute). It also includes a social balance sheet analysis and an indication of credit risk using statistical models from the NBB’s In-house Credit Assessment System (ICAS). In 2015, air transport and airport activities generated € 6 billion in direct and indirect value added (i.e. 1.5 % of Belgian GDP) and employed around 62 500 people in full-time equivalents (FTEs)either directly or indirectly (1.5 % of domestic employment including the self-employed). Brussels and Liège Airport remain the country’s biggest airports, respectively in terms of passenger and cargo traffic. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in March 2016, the regional airports received part of Brussels’ passenger traffic. All in all, Brussels recovered fairly quickly, especially freight traffic, but also passenger traffic resumed gradually to tie in with growth again since November 2016. Brussels and Liège are the fastest growing airports during the 2013-2015 period, respectively in terms of value added and employment. At Ostend Airport, these economic variables slumped in line with the evolution of freight traffic volumes. Antwerp’s growth rates went into the red as well, mainly under the influence of the difficulties faced by VLM Airlines. At Charleroi and Liège, the trend of value added is downward, while that is not the case for employment. The smallest changes are recorded in Kortrijk.
C67|On the Geography of Global Value Chains|This paper studies the optimal location of production for the different stages in a sequential global value chain. We develop a general-equilibrium model featuring a proximity-concentration tradeoff: slicing global value chains across countries allows to better exploit agglomeration economies, but such fragmentation comes at the cost of increased transportation costs. We show that, other things equal, it is optimal to locate relatively downstream stages of production in relatively central or well-connected locations, while upstream stages of production are optimally assigned to more remote locations. We illustrate this result by working out the optimal location of production for a few basic topologies featuring a low number of countries and stages. Exact solutions to the problem for a larger number of countries and stages are computationally complex, but can be obtained using combinatorial optimization tools. We apply the model to study the optimal specialization within chains in eleven countries in Factory Asia.
C67|Endogenous Production Networks|We develop a tractable model of endogenous production networks. Each one of a number of products can be produced by combining labor and an endogenous subset of the other products as inputs. Different combinations of inputs generate (prespecified) levels of productivity. Markets are “contestable” in the sense that production technologies are available to a large number of potential producers. We establish the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium with an endogenous production network and provide comparative static results on how prices and endogenous technology choices (and thus the production network) respond to changes in parameters. These results show that improvements in technology (or reductions in distortions) spread throughout the economy via input-output linkages and reduce all prices, and under reasonable restrictions on the menu of production technologies, also lead to a denser production network. Using a dynamic version of the model, we show that the endogenous evolution of the production network could be a powerful force towards sustained economic growth. At the root of this result is the fact that the arrival of a few new products expands the set of technological possibilities of all existing industries by a large amount — that is, if there are n products, the arrival of one more new product increases the combinations of inputs that each existing product can use from 2 n-1 to 2 n , thus enabling significantly more pronounced cost reductions from the choice of optimal technology combinations. These cost reductions then spread to other industries that benefit from lower input prices and are further incentivized to adopt additional inputs.
C67|Regularities in Prices of Production and the Concentration of Compositions of Capitals|Recent developments in price of production models have proposed a hypothesis on the structure of the input coefficient matrices to explain the empirical near-linearity and monotonicity found in prices as a function of income distribution - the tendency towards zero of subdominant eigenvalues. The objective of this paper is twofold: First, based on the behavior of observed eigenvalues, the paper shows that they cannot explain by their own the regularities found in prices of production. Second, it is shown theoretically and empirically the existence and relevance of an additional force acting on the input matrix and the labor coefficient vector: the concentration of industries' vertically integrated compositions of capital around their average. It is argued that the combined effect of these two factors produces the empirical regularities in relative prices. The tendency of the vertically integrated labor to means of production proportions to cluster around their average reveals the existence of an economic force acting on the structure of technology of observable economies and calls for an explanation. The paper relies on the US 1987- 2007 Input-Output accounts, at the highest disaggregation level (between 370-466 sectors), for the empirical evidence in this paper.
C67|Efficient Implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy Goals: Is Social Equality Achievable Reality or Myth Perhaps?|Economic crisis hit all the European Union Member States hard, the impact of crisis varied considerably. The low growth performance in the EU has increased concerns regarding an increasing wage dispersion, income inequality at large, and social exclusion in line with poverty. Inequality should be seen as a cornerstone of both sustainable and inclusive growth under the Europe 2020 Strategy. Social inequality in the EU is a very real problem which hampers sustainable economic growth. The purpose of this study is to introduce evaluation of social development convergence and divergence trend between EU28 Member States in the context of the Europe 2020 Strategy. The study gives an outline of the issues of labour market and income disparities and poverty. Policy-makers must be clear about what social objectives they are aiming to achieve, therefore special attention is paid to headline national goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy. The main tasks of this study is to assess social dimension and inequalities problems in the EU27 by applying Data Envelopment Analysis method, resp. time-series dynamic efficiency analysis in the form of output-oriented Malmquist Productivity Index. This study contain changes of key social equality indicators related to the Europe 2020 Strategy and compares objectives and general outlines of period 2010-2015, as well as its impact on national economics and living conditions. Results contain elements of typology premises of the EU28 and point to a large diversity in inequality patterns, as author observe both increases and decreases in inequality at the EU level. Recent changes in social inequality have been associated with the business cycle, particularly with the accessibility of the labour market and, of course, with income inequality. Additionally the development challenges are discussed for improvement of the socioeconomic well-being of the EU27 and to avoid social disparities.
C67|Efficiency Analysis of ERDF and CF Co-financed Programmes Focusing on the Transport in Member States of the European Union|European Union provides financial support to the Member States through various financial tools currently from European Structural and Investment Funds that represent the main instrument of EU Cohesion Policy to sustain territorial development, to increase competitiveness and to eliminate regional disparities. The overall impact of EU Funds depends on the structure of funding and absorption capacity of the country. Efficiency of funding across EU Member States is a fundamental issue for the EU development as a whole. The author considers determining the efficiency of EU Funds as an issue of high importance and therefore this study provides a contribution to the debate on the role of the EU Cohesion Policy in EU Member States. The paper focuses on the territorial effects of selected EU Funds in programming period 2007–2013 in theme of infrastructure through transport efficiency analysis. Efficiency analysis is based on data at country level originating from ex-post evaluation of Cohesion Policy programmes 2007–2013 representing the input and output variables to analyse whether the goal of fostering growth in the target countries have been achieved with the funds provided and whether or not more resources generated stronger growth effects in transport accessibility. Study deals with comparative cross-country analysis, descriptive data analysis and multicriteria approach to Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) in the form of output oriented BCC VRS model. The study aims at testing several factors in form of two inputs and five outputs, trying to elucidate the differences obtained by the EU Member States in efficient using of the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund in transport sector. Paper determines if the countries have been more efficient in increasing their levels of competitive advantages linked with transport. Preliminary results reveals that mostly countries with lower amount of funding achieve higher efficiency, especially from the group of EU15.
C67|Der ökonomische Fußabdruck der Privaten Krankenversicherung in Deutschland. Untersuchung der PKV als Finanzier von Gesundheitsleistungen<BR>[The economic footprint of private health insurance in Germany. Examining its role as healthcare financier]|There is now much evidence for the vital importance of the health economy, and it is receiving more attention from social and political spheres. This development is evidenced, not least, by the increased perception of the health economy as a key economic factor in Germany. Private health insurance (PKV) plays an important role in the health economy in three respects: as an economic actor, as a financer of healthcare services, and as a provider of capital. In a first step, an earlier study determined the economic footprint of the private health insurance sector as an economic actor. In doing so, the economic significance of private health insurance was measured on the basis of official national accounts categories for the first time. The starting point for this earlier study was a change of perspective so as to view the health economy – including private health insurance – not just as a cost factor, but also from the angle of economic growth and employment. From this basis, the second step presented here measures the economic importance of private health insurance in its role as a financer of healthcare services. Unlike in the first step, the private health insurance sector’s expenditure on benefits for its members forms the subject of the study, instead of the economic activity of the sector. This expenditure finances medication and services rendered to private patients by licensed doctors and hospitals, for example. The aim of this study is to calculate the resultant gross value added and employment. The comprehensive economic footprint approach is unique in that it incorporates the economic significance of intermediate inputs (indirect effects) and the spending of employee compensation (induced effects). This study augments this approach by examining the economic effects of the additional revenue raised from private patients. Additional revenue is the sum that the entire health system would lose if private patients were insured under the statutory scheme instead of privately. This issue is relevant seeing as there is currently some debate about introducing a universal system.
C67|Der ökonomische Fußabdruck der Gesundheitswirtschaft in Deutschland nach ESVG 2010<BR>[The Economic Footprint of the German Health Economy according to ESA 2010]|The National Health Account quantifies the economic contribution of the German health economy for national GVA, employment and international trade. Underlying methodology and concepts were developed in the course of several projects commissioned by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy. Due to a revision of statistical standards in the context of national accounts in 2014, results from earlier calculations are no longer comparable to recently calculated indicators. This paper hence pursues to indicate changes due to the new statistical standard of national accounts, ESA 2010, and present results from recent calculations. In addition, results from input-output analysis enable a more thorough analysis of the health economy and its interdependencies with the overall economy.
C67|Methodology of the Multiregional Health Account for Germany - An Iterative Algorithm-Based Multiregionalization Approach of Supply and Use Tables with Emphasis on Health|The Multiregional Health Account is a methodological enhancement of the National Health Account for Germany. The latter represents an established and annually updated satellite account quantifying the economic contribution of the health economy in terms of gross value added, employment and interna-tional trade. Its methodological enhancement to a multiregional framework for the 16 federal states of Germany is represented by multiregional supply and use tables. This setting allows to compile a multire-gional health input-output table and subsequently to carry out input-output analysis. Hence, we are able to quantify the direct and indirect economic impacts of the health economy to analyze interdependencies between industries and federal states. For the purpose of compiling the Multiregional Health Account, we elaborate a new approach based on the SUT-RAS algorithm (Temurshoev & Timmer, 2011), which we adapt for the multiregional framework. We call it the MR-SUT-RAS algorithm. The methodology and its application in the context of the health economy is the subject of this contribution.
C67|Basic Results of the Multiregional Health Account for Germany - Validation of Indirect Effects of the Health Economy|The Multiregional Health Account is a methodological enhancement of the National Health Account and adds a subnational regional dimension to the latter. Both satellite accounts aim to quantify the contribution of the German health economy in terms of gross value added, employment and trade. Moreover, since they are based on supply and use tables and thus input-output tables of the national accounting system, both models allow input-output analysis for a more thorough evaluation of the national and multiregional health economy. The challenge addressed in this paper consists in questioning the reliability of the results from multiregional input-output analysis based on the Multiregional Health Account. This is necessary due to the circumstance that no official multiregional input-output tables are available for German federal states and we elaborated a new methodology to derive multiregional tables on our own. Hence, we conduct input-output analysis to evaluate the performance of the multiregional input-output table in modelling intra- and interregional interdependencies. We find that the model succeeds in reproducing certain regional characteristics.
C67|Basic Results of the Multiregional Health Account for Germany - Validation of Direct Effects of the Health Economy|The Multiregional Health Account is a satellite account focusing on the economic impact of the health economy in German federal states. It was developed as an enhancement of the existing National Health Account for Germany. In contrast to the subject of matter over here, the calculations of the National Health Account are based on available national supply and use tables. Since there are no according tables available for the German federal states, we developed a methodology, which allows to calculate supply and use tables at the subnational multiregional level. The present paper focusses on the results of the MRHA for the reason of a thorough validation procedure of the developed approach. We evaluate regional direct effects of the health economy by comparing derived characteristics with company data and evaluate the performance of the algorithm in a time series. We find that the elaborated approach shows reasonable results in both dimensions evaluated.
C67|Application of the Multiregional Health Account for Germany - A financial equalization scheme to cope with lagging investments in German hospitals|Lagging investments in German hospitals have become a serious challenge in recent decades. The responsibility for investment financing lies with the German federal states, the “Bundeslaender”, due to the dualistic financing framework applying for German hospitals. Yet, hospital investments experience a field of tension between the availability of financial resources and necessary investments. A possible solution could be a financial equalization scheme for the health economy incorporating an earmarked fund for hospital investments. The rationale for such a system is that health economies of federal states do not represent single closed systems, but depend on interregional trade flows to supply patient treatment. The respective calculations in this paper are based on our recently compiled Multiregional Health Account for Germany. The model represents a satellite account of the health economy based on national accounts. Consequently, we are able to calculate spillover effects from patient treatment in federal states by conducting input-output analysis. Based on the results, we derive a sketch of a financial equalization scheme in order to ensure needs-based hospital infrastructure in German federal states.
C67|Regional environmental efficiency in waste generation|This paper employs Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to consider waste generation at a regional level in the European Union (EU). By doing so both good and bad outputs are taken into account and different frameworks are designed. Five parameters (waste generation, employment rate, capital formation, GDP and population density) are used for 172 EU regions and for the years 2009, 2011 and 2013. In doing so four frameworks have been designed with different inputs and outputs each time. The results show the more efficient EU regions according to each framework, but it should be noted that results from different frameworks should not be compared to each other. Overall results suggest that the highest performers are regions in Belgium, Italy, Portugal and the UK. Finally the efficiency results from DEA were reviewed against the treatment options employed in the relevant regions. Our findings show that although a country might be efficient according to DEA and by taking many factors into consideration, it is not necessary that regions within a country use sustainable waste treatment options as it is essential to account for trade and shipment of waste between regions and countries as well.
C67|K-Chains: A New Class of Blockchains and Related Turing Machines Based on Quantum Mechanics|Quantum Mechanical principles have brought about a revolution in the way we perceive our world and use technology. One of the possible impacts and usage of Quantum mechanics is in the field of economics. Quantum mechanics can be applied to build a new class of Blockchain systems. This paper explores that possibility. It deals with how Quantum Mechanics can be best implemented to bring into existence a new class of Blockchain systems. These Quantum Blockchains (called K-Chains) will have several advantages like possible Faster-Than-Light (FTL) communication of Transactions, Unlimited network capacity and the revolutionary prospect of an Off-line Blockchain which will not need to be connected to the internet for transactions to occur. Extrapolation of this likelihood can lead to the designing of Quantum Turing Machines which are based on Quantum Blockchain (K-Chain) Technology. Real time information and communication systems spanning distances across light-years will most likely be probable. This can allow Mankind to instantly exchange value and information across vast distances of space almost instantly. The paper starts by briefly explaining the basics of Blockchains, cryptocurrencies and relevant Quantum mechanical concepts. Then we discuss how Quantum mechanics can be amalgamated with Blockchain Technology to achieve K-Chains. Later we will delve into the various impediments that make achieving a Quantum Blockchain (K-Chain) difficult with present day hardware technology. The paper concludes by discussing the various aspects of Quantum Technology, Blockchain Systems and the possibilities of constructing a Blockchain based Quantum Turing Machines.
C67|An Analytic Estimation of the Multiplier Effect of Public Consumption in the Dominican Republic: 2007-2012|This study estimates the multiplier effect of public consumption in the Dominican Republic via an analytic methodology that works with input-output tables using data on the years 2007-2012. This study finds that the public sector has an employment multiplier of 1.5, which means that for every 10 jobs that are created within the public sector because of public consumption, 5 jobs are created within the private sector. Also, the study finds that around 20\% of imports are directly and indirectly caused by the effect of public consumption. The proportion of GDP explained by public consumption is also estimated around 20\%. However, when one takes into account (and discounts) the effect that the money directed to public spending would've had if it had been spent by the private sector on consumption and investment, the impact is reduced by at least a quarter.
C67|Türkiye Ekonomisinde Sürükleyici Endüstri Analizi:2002-2012 Karşılaştırması<BR>[Key Sector Analysis in Turkish Economy: A Compare Between 2002-2012]|"Interindustry analysis that researches alterations in qualitative and quantitative structures of industrial activity is being used as an analytical tool in the matter of monitoring development performance of economy. The aim of this study is to calculate backward linkages by Leontief approach and forward linkages by Ghosh approach based on 2002 and 2012 input output tables and analyse evolution in key sectors. Linkage findings reflecting the 'feedback' and 'stimulant' power of industries are utilized as indicators for optimization in allocation of resources and taking investment decisions. Findings of the study reveal that ""manufacture of chemicals, chemical products"", ""manufacture of fabricated metal products"", ""recycling"" and ""research and ""development"" industries have lost the property of being key industry in relevant period. However only ""basic metals” became as a key industry thereby reducing its import dependency. By the results of this study, it is expected to contribute to policymakers in developing policy."
C67|Impact of Cash Subsidy Transfer in a Nonlinear Programming Model for Economic Input-Output Analysis|This paper measures the distributional and welfare impacts of cutting commodity subsidy and paying cash subsidy. We introduce an extended Input-Output model employing a non-linear programming approach. The model is calibrated based on 2004 Iranian Micro Consistent Matrix with 56 commodity groups, 10 rural, and 10 urban household groups. Then we calculate Rawlsian welfare, Bentham welfare, and Cobb-Douglass welfare functions. Then the 2010 version of Iranian Economic Reform Plan to cut commodity subsidies and pay them in cash is simulated. We translate the 2010 cash subsidy policy to scale of 2004 data and with special attention to different household dimension. Simulating the policy, we found that equal payment to all individuals can lead to 47% rise in Rawlsian welfare index, and 3.6% higher welfare in Bentham welfare function. Paying cash subsidy to seven expenditure-deciles of households can improve the Rawlsian and Bentham welfare index by 73% and 1.9%, respectively. Although this policy is preferred by equality measures, it decreases the welfare of top 30% rich between 13% to 16%.
C67|Examination of Seasonal Volatility in HICP for Baltic Region Countries: Non-Parametric Test versus Forecasting Experiment|The aim of this paper is to examine the problem of existing seasonal volatility in total and disaggregated HICP for Baltic Region countries (Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Finland, Germany, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden). Using nonparametric tests, we found that in the case of m-o-m prices, including fruit, vegetables, and total HICP, the homogeneity of variance during seasons is rejected. Based on these findings, we propose an exponential smoothing model with periodic variance of error terms that capture the repetitive seasonal variation (in conditional or unconditional second moments). In a pseudo-real data experiment, the short-term forecasts (nowcasting) for the considered components of inflation were determined using different specifications of considered models. The forecasting performance of the models was measured using one of the scoring rules for probabilistic forecasts called logarithmic score. We found instead that while the periodic phenomenon in variance was statistically significant, the models with a periodic phenomenon in variance of error terms do not significantly improve forecasting performance in disaggregated cases and in the case of total HICP. The simpler models with constant variance of error term have comparative forecasting (nowcasting) performance over the alternative model.
C67|Who’s Who in Global Value Chains? A Weighted Network Approach|Abstract This paper represents global value chains (GVCs) as weighted networks of foreign value added in exports, which allows for the identification of the specific roles of countries and for the quantification of their relative importance over time. A major structural change occurred in the beginning of the century as GVCs steadily turned into global networks, amid an unprecedented growth of value-added flows and the rise of China as a major player. First-order network metrics highlight the vital but also distinct roles of Germany, the US, China and Japan in the international organisation of production. Germany is very relevant both as a user and as a supplier of foreign inputs, whilst the US acts mostly as a supplier of value added to other countries. Second-order properties of networks shed light on the complex architecture of GVCs, notably in terms of cyclical triangular relationships. Germany’s GVCs mostly root in direct relationships, whilst Japanese ones typically involve more than two countries.

The Matlab function is provided. Although coal is the industry of interest in this document, any other industry could be targeted for similar study.
C67|Разработка динамической межотраслевой модели с блоком человеческого капитала. Construction of a dynamic input-output model with a human capital block|Накопление человеческого капитала является важным фактором экономического роста. Включение человеческого капитала как фактора в макроэкономические модели, в том числе в межотраслевые, позволит принять во внимание не только количественную составляющую трудовых ресурсов, вовлеченных в производство, но и их качественную дифференциацию. Это позволит учесть (в дополнение к дифференциации трудовых ресурсов по уровню образования) влияние на производительность труда (а значит, и на валовый выпуск) фактора здоровья рабочей силы, воспитания и культуры, а также некоторых других элементов показателя «человеческий капитал». В работе представлено математическое описание расширенной динамической межотраслевой модели (ДММ) с включением блока человеческого капитала. Разработка модели ведется на основе ДММ системы КАМИН, разработанной в Институте экономики и организации промышленного производства СО РАН и в Новосибирском государственном университете. Полученная модель может быть использована для анализа и прогнозирования развития экономики России. The accumulation of human capital is an important factor of economic growth. It seems to be useful to include «human capital» as a factor of a macroeconomic model, as it helps to take into account the quality differentiation of the workforce. Most of the models usually distinguish labor force by the levels of education, while some of the factors remain unaccounted. Among them are health status and culture development level, which influence productivity level as well as gross product reproduction. Inclusion of the human capital block to the interindustry model can help to make it more reliable for economic development forecasting. The article presents a mathematical description of the extended dynamic input-output model (DIOM) with a human capital block. The extended DIOM is based on the Input-Output Model from The KAMIN system (the System of Integrated Analyses of Interindustrial Information) developed at the Institute of Economics and Industrial Engineering of the Siberian Branch of the Academy of Sciences of the Russian Federation and at the Novosibirsk State University. The extended input-output model can be used to analyze and forecast development of Russian economy.
C67|An Alternative Look at Measurement of University Performance in STEM education: A Data Envelopment Analysis Project|How is success measured in the field of STEM education in US universities? Such a question can be difficult to answer because of the lack of uniformity among the relevant variables. Given the wide diversity in success indicators, and the fact that universities choose to pursue different aspects of educational outcomes, it is often difficult to compare performances and definitively point to one school as 'better' than another. In an attempt to measure university efficiency in the areas of engineering, natural, physical and health sciences, the authors use the non-stochastic frontier model of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which is commonly used in Operations Research literature, to evaluate the efficiency of producers. In this initial research, the authors isolated the large public universities of Ohio as the subject of the analysis. They found that with the input-output structure defined by the data, certain universities clearly stood out as efficient compared to others in the dissemination of STEM education. A logistic regression isolated the inputs and outputs that had the strongest effects on the efficiency scores.
C67|Extended Input Output Model for Nuclear Power Plant Impact Assessment|Energy is important for economic and social development while energy infrastructure is necessary element of growing energy demands. Infrastructure (including energy infrastructure like a power plant or transmission and distribution networks) is capital intensive activity and it has significant direct and indirect impact on macroeconomic variables like GDP or employment. Most world countries (developing countries primarily) do not have appropriate macroeconomic analytical tool/model and knowledge to calculate not only energy but also economic and social benefit from investment in energy sector. Developed countries usually use full econometric input-output (IO) models and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models.International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) assists Member States in capacity building and offers a set of computer models and a methodology. According to the previous mission IAEA two years ago started to develop new analytical tool under the new project Assessing the National and Regional Economic and Social Effects of Nuclear Programmes. Croatia as other 11 countries actively participated in this project. The final result of the project is Extended Input Output Model for Nuclear Power Plant Impact Assessment (EMPOWER). The model set up follows the traditional impact analysis with input-output analysis, where a new industry (new plant like nuclear power plant or any other power plant) is introduced. Model is simple static input-output model and use technical and commercial data from nuclear power plants for economic and social impact analysis.The model framework is designed for impact analysis including the following four model mechanisms: (A) Indirect effects (including direct effects), (AB) Indirect & induced effects (including direct effects), (ABC) Indirect & induced effects & labor market response (including direct effects), (ABCD) Indirect & induced effects & labor market response & feedback from financing of investment (including direct effects). Each model version from A to ABCD incorporates everything of the model version below plus one additional feature. The results of the model simulations are presented on two ways: as aggregate results (gross domestic impact, disposable income, total production, public net savings, private consumption, exports and imports, all at current as well as constant prices, and employment; as results by industry production at current as well as constant prices, and employment.
C67|Interstate Input-Output Matrix for Brazil: An Application of the IIOAS Method|This paper presents the process of estimation of an interregional input-output system for the 26 Brazilian states and the Federal District, in conditions of limited information, using the IIOAS method. IIOAS is consistent with the national input-output matrix and can be built for any country that publishes its SUTs, and has a regionalized sectoral information system. Subsequently, the commercial relations and productive structures of each state were analyzed. SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro were the most self-sufficient states. Roraima and Tocantins were the ones that presented the lowest levels of self-sufficiency. Regarding regional interdependence, Roraima and Acre were the states whose production showed less dependence on the final demand of other states, whereas Amazonas, EspÃ­rito Santo and Mato Grosso were the states in which the final demand of other states and exports exert most influence in the local production.
C67|Semiparametric smooth coefficient quantile estimation of the production profile|Abstract In this paper, quantile regression models are suggested as an alternative description of a production technology. The quantile of continuous order defines the production profile and the quantile-based individual technical efficiency relative to the quantile order. Quantile-based production frontier and efficiency are easy to derive and estimate and do not envelop all sample observation points. A quantile-based production frontier is more robust to extreme observations than DEA or FDH. Furthermore, quantile regression does not make a distribution assumption. It is more robust to the misspecification of error structure than DFA or SFA. In this paper, the quantile regression methods are extended to semiparametric smooth coefficient models. A local linear fitting scheme to estimate the smooth coefficients is proposed in the quantile framework. An empirical application of the model to the Taiwan manufacturing industry demonstrates the potential for the estimation of production technology and efficiency measures.
C67|The regionalization jhjhjhof national input-output tables: a study of South Korean regions|This paper uses survey-based data for 16 South Korean regions to refine the application of Flegg¡¦s location quotient (FLQ) and its variant, the sector-specific FLQ (SFLQ). These regions vary markedly in terms of size. Especial attention is paid to the problem of choosing appropriate values for the unknown parameter £_ in these formulae. Alternative approaches to this problem are evaluated and tested. Our paper adds to earlier research that aims to find a cost-effective way of adapting national coefficients, so as to produce a satisfactory initial set of regional input coefficients for regions where survey-based data are unavailable.
C67|The effect of globalisation on energy footprints: Disentangling the links of global value chains|This paper investigates the impact of global value chains on energy footprints. Energy footprints are consumption-based indicators which record the energy used to produce a country's final demand. In order to disentangle key characteristics of global value chains and their effects on the global energy footprint, we employ structural decomposition analyses (SDA). Furthermore, the analysis combines a retrospective with a prospective SDA approach. After an analysis of the global energy footprint for the period between 1995 and 2009, we discuss three scenarios of international integration and their implications for energy footprints for the period from 2009 to 2030. Our results show that the global energy footprint has increased by 29.4% from 1995 to 2009, and the scenarios indicate that it will increase by another 23.5% until 2030. Economic activity is the most important driver for the increase in energy footprints. Rising final demand alone would have increased the global energy footprint by 47.0% between 1995 and 2009. The composition of countries from where consumption and investment goods come adds another 12.6%. Sectoral energy intensity reductions are the most important decelerator of energy use (−27.8%). There is a substantial contribution of changing global value chains on the rise in the global energy footprint (7.5%): Stronger backward linkages in global value chains increased the global energy footprint by 5.5% between 1995 and 2009. Changes in the regional composition of intermediate inputs raised it by another 1.8%. The shift of the world economy towards East Asia alone would have increased the global energy footprint by 3.0%. The sectoral composition of global value chains, on the other hand, had a negligible effect on energy footprints.
C67|Economic vulnerabilities in Italy: A network analysis using similarities in sectoral employment|This article presents an original spatial methodology based on a network analysis approach in order to identify and to track spatial similarities among economic activities as well as to analyse their interdependence. Traditionally, such interdependence is analysed using input-output matrices (IO) that track economic flows across sectors. However, models based on IO do not allow to analyse spatial interdependence. In our approach, instead, we make use of local employment patterns. In particular, using sectoral employment of 8091 Italian municipalities across 18 economic activities, our approach allows to identify spatial inter-linkages in terms of employment patterns. By comparing such local employment patterns, our methodology shows inter-linkages among activities, which are important for understanding the transmission of exogenous shocks. Our analysis highlights similarities among economic activities, and allows to identify central activities (hubs) and their relationship with each other. Moreover, simulating the spread of an exogenous shock through the economic structure allows us to identify important activities not only in economic terms but also in terms of centrality and connectivity.
C67|Accumulating trade costs and competitiveness in global value chains|"Trade costs such as applied tariffs, transportation and insurance costs are amplified as they pass through the multiple production steps associated with modern supply chains. This so-called ""cascade effect"" arises since trade costs accumulate as intermediate goods are imported and then re-exported further downstream, going through different processing nodes before reaching the final consumer. Moreover, the financial impact of these trade costs is magnified in the ""trade in tasks"" rationale which governs global value chains (GVCs). Specialised processing firms need to recoup the associated trade cost applying to the full value of the good from the smaller fraction of value-added created at each consecutive productive stage. This large relative weight of transaction expenses on the profitability of individual business operations explains why trade along GVCs is particularly exposed to trade costs. The paper reviews the implications of trade costs on competitiveness at industry, national and global levels. The financial implications of trade costs at firm and sectoral level are based on trade in value-added data for 2011. The multilateral welfare effects of reducing discrete trade costs are identified using a network analysis approach, which goes beyond the traditional bilateral dimension of international trade and identifies where trade facilitation investment would have the highest social returns from a GVC perspective. The authors conclude that while the direct benefits of trade facilitation will be proportionally higher for those countries that are not well integrated into international trade because of their high trade costs, the global benefits of trade facilitation investments will also be high if they are undertaken by key traders that lie at the core of global value chains"
C67|Equivalence between input-output and value-added economies|I show that, under standard assumptions, input-output (or network) economies are equivalent to value-added ones. Using a generalized version of the model in Acemoglu et al. (Econometrica, 2012), I show that the degree of influence of a given sector is equal to its value added share. This occurs because --by using the input-output network-- the output of a given sector indirectly contributes to the production of the final consumption of the rest of the sectors, which constitutes the source of its value. Thus, value-added economies deliver the same aggregate response to sectoral shocks than input-output ones. Despite this equivalence, the Leontief multiplier, which applies to sales and gross output, is intact.
C67|Multiplex interbank networks and systemic importance: An application to European data|Research on interbank networks and systemic importance is starting to recognise that the web of exposures linking banks’ balance sheets is more complex than the single-layer-of-exposure approach suggests. We use data on exposures between large European banks, broken down by both maturity and instrument type, to characterise the main features of the multiplex (or multi-layered) structure of the network of large European banks. Banks that are well connected or important in one network, tend to also be well connected in other networks (i.e. the network features positively correlated multiplexity). The different layers exhibit a high degree of similarity, stemming both from standard similarity analyses as well as a core-periphery analyses at the layer level. We propose measures of systemic importance that fit the case in which banks are connected through an arbitrary number of layers (be it by instrument, maturity or a combination of both). Such measures allow for a decomposition of the global systemic importance index for any bank into the contributions of each of the sub-networks, providing a potentially useful tool for banking regulators and supervisors in identifying tailored policy responses. We use the dataset of exposures between large European banks to illustrate that both the methodology and the specific level of network aggregation may matter both in the determination of interconnectedness and in the policy making process.
C67|Input-Output Analysis of Deindustrialization and Outsourcing|The paper deals with the topic of deindustrialization as a process of a decreasing relative importance of manufacturing. While the decrease of manufacturing in major developed and developed economies is undeniable, the developing and newly industrialized economies are starting to experience this phenomenon as well. The results of the paper show that the so-called premature deindustrialization is mainly caused by outsourcing. Furthermore, the data suggest the existence of an upper limit of outsourcing for major developed economies. In these economies, the decrease of manufacturing is more likely caused by other relevant factors. Last but not least, a few transition economies face to a slightly decreasing value of outsourcing on a much lower level. This could be explained by a fragmentation of the entire value chain across the European Union. The empirical results are based on the Input-Output methodology, the observation period of fifteen years from 2000 to 2014 and a sample of 43 countries.

C67|Updating USAGE: Baseline and Illustrative Application|USAGE is a dynamic, CGE model of the U.S. economy created at CoPS in collaboration with the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC). The model has been used by and on behalf of: the USITC; the U.S. Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, Energy, Transportation and Homeland Security; private sector organizations such as the Cato Institute and the Mitre Corporation; and the Canadian Embassy in Washington DC. To keep the model relevant for policy analysis, it must be updated periodically. This paper describes a major update of USAGE undertaken for the USITC. In accordance with the CoPS contract with the USITC, the update task was to: 1. build a NAICS-based database at the 400-industry level for USAGE using the 2007 BEA benchmark input-output tables; 2. update this database to 2014; 3. create a baseline projection starting from the base year of 2014 and proceeding at 5 year intervals to 2024; and 4. conduct an illustrative USAGE policy simulation around the baseline. At the completion of this work in August 2016, the ITC requested a fifth task: 5. update from 2007 to 2015 rather than 2014 and create a baseline from 2015 to 2020. This paper describes how we undertook the five tasks.
C67|Global Supply Chains: towards a CGE analysis|Economists have analysed global supply chains (GSC) using pure theory, case studies, econometrics and input-output calculations. We now need a new type of computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to show how GSC trade affects welfare and its distribution between and within nations. The new model must recognize: fragmentation of production; scale economies; intermediate inputs that cross national borders multiple times embodied in products at different stages of completion; and decision-making by global agents. We describe a prototype that incorporates these features and gives interpretable results not attainable with a standard CGE model. We discuss steps to move from the prototype to a policy-relevant model.
C67|Unraveling the Energy use Network of Construction Sector in Turkey using Structural Path Analysis|Input-output (I-O) analysis provides a useful framework for examining the direct and the indirect changes in the energy use. The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of the energy use network in Turkish construction (CON) sector. To do this, a particular type of network analysis, structural path analysis is conducted. Sectoral energy use data provided by World I-O database is used for the elaboration of energy paths. Mediating sectors underlying backward energy linkages are identified. Results show that energy use of CON increased both in absolute terms and that of rank among other industries. The magnitude and complexity of the coke and refined petroleum path decreased. Due to the expansion in natural gas powered energy production, relative importance and complexity of the electric, gas and water supply path increased. Energy use paths are discussed with reference to current account deficit and growth issues in Turkey
C67|Macroeconomic Effects of Prosumer Households in Germany|This paper investigates the macroeconomic effects of the evolution of prosumer households in the future energy market in Germany. In the German policy debate, these households are discussed as potential key actors for the transition of the energy system. On the one hand, prosumer households produce power from solar PV or micro combined heat and power systems; on the other hand they consume (at least partly) their own produced power or store the energy on site for later use. Thus, prosumer households increase the complexity of the energy system, but they also offer opportunities to solve existing problems for grid stability. Prosumer households have a slightly positive effect on the macro economy: Both the investments in power generating technologies and the higher income of prosumer households due to self-produced electricity lead to higher consumption and stimulate economic growth. At the same time, the increase of prosumer households reduces emissions.
C67|Green versus brown: Comparing the employment impacts of energy efficiency, renewable energy, and fossil fuels using an input-output model|Global carbon emissions have reached unsustainable levels, and transforming the energy sector by increasing efficiency and use of renewables is one of the primary strategies to reduce emissions. Policy makers need to understand both the environmental and economic impacts of fiscal and regulatory policies regarding the energy sector. Transitioning to lower-carbon energy will entail a contraction of the fossil fuel sector, along with a loss of jobs. An important question is whether clean energy will create more jobs than will be lost in fossil fuels. This article presents a method of using Input-Output (I-O) tables to create “synthetic” industries – namely clean energy industries that do not currently exist in I-O tables. This approach allows researchers to evaluate public and private spending in clean energy and compare it to the effects of spending on fossil fuels. Here we focus on employment impacts in the short-to-medium term, and leave aside the long-term comparison of operations and maintenance employment. We find that on average, 2.65 full-time-equivalent (FTE) jobs are created from $1 million spending in fossil fuels, while that same amount of spending would create 7.49 or 7.72 FTE jobs in renewables or energy efficiency. Thus each $1 million shifted from brown to green energy will create a net increase of 5 jobs.
C67|A carbon footprint proportional to expenditure - A case for Norway?|Motivated by the importance of consumption as an underlying driver of CO2 emissions, we examine the link between consumption and CO2 emissions for Norwegian households. The main goal is to investigate whether there is a decoupling of consumption expenditures and the environmental impact as we move up the income ladder. By combining a 2007 Norwegian consumer expenditure survey with emission coefficients from an environmental input-output model, reflecting emissions embodied in both domestically produced and imported goods and services, we calculate the per capita carbon footprint. The results from the analysis suggest that the per capita carbon footprint is directly proportional to expenditure with an estimated elasticity close to unity, implying no decoupling. The finding is partly driven by a near zero-emission power sector, which leads to comparatively low emissions embodied in domestically-produced goods and services.
C67|The Carbon Footprint of European Households and Income Distribution|This paper calculates the carbon footprint of private consumption in the EU27 by five groups of household income, using a fully fledged macroeconomic input-output model covering 59 industries and five groups of household income for the EU27. Due to macroeconomic feedback mechanisms, this methodology – besides induced intermediate demand – also quantifies: (i) private consumption induced in the other household groups, (ii) impacts on other endogenous final demand components, and (iii) negative feedback effects due to output price effects of household demand. The carbon footprint is calculated separately for the consumption vector of each of the five income groups. The simulation results yield a non-linear income elasticity of direct and indirect emissions at each income level: the value of the direct footprint income elasticity decreases from 1.32 (first quintile) to 0.69 (fourth quintile). The value of the indirect footprint income elasticity is always below unity and decreases from 0.89 to 0.62. The results in general reveal a relative decoupling effect: the share of the top income group in income (45%) is much larger than its share in the carbon footprint (37%) and vice versa for the bottom income group (6% in income and 8% in footprint).
C67|The multi-factor energy input–output model|Energy input–output analysis (EIO analysis) is a noteworthy tool for the analysis of the role of energy in the economy. However, it has relied on models that provide a limited description of energy flows in the economic system and do not allow an adequate analysis of energy efficiency. This paper introduces a novel energy input–output model, the multi-factor energy input–output model (MF-EIO model), which is obtained from a partitioning of a hybrid-unit input–output system of the economy. This model improves on current models by describing the energy flows according to the processes of energy conversion and the levels of energy use in the economy. It characterizes the vector of total energy output as a function of seven factors: two energy efficiency indicators; two characteristics of end-use energy consumption; and three economic features of the rest of the economy. Moreover, it is consistent with the standard model for EIO analysis, i.e., the hybrid-unit model. This paper also introduces an approximate version of the MF-EIO model, which is equivalent to the former under equal energy prices for industries and final consumers, but requires less data processing. The latter is composed by two linked models: a model of the energy sector in physical units, and a model of the rest of the economy in monetary units. In conclusion, the proposed modelling framework improves EIO analysis and extends EIO applications to the accounting for energy efficiency of the economy.
C67|Interregional carbon emission spillover–feedback effects in China|A three-region input–output model was applied in this study to analyze the emission spillover–feedback effects across the eastern, middle, and western regions of China. Results revealed that the interregional trade has important spillover effects (SEs) on the emissions of each region, particularly in the middle and western regions, but the feedback effects are few. Although the eastern regional final demands have a smaller economic SE per unit than those of the middle and western regions in 2002–2010, its emission SE gradually exceeded that of the two other regions. The interregional trade policy has to be enforced in the future, but the emission SEs should be controlled efficiently. Therefore, the central government should continue to implement the policies on the reduction of energy and carbon intensities from the past decade, limit coal consumption, and encourage renewable fuel development. At the same time, the central government and the eastern region can help the middle and western regions control their carbon intensity by providing fiscal, technological, and training assistance. The middle and western regions should set strict admittance standards for energy-intensive plants that transferred from the eastern region.
C67|Input-output and structural decomposition analysis of Singapore's carbon emissions|Singapore is an island city-state. It lacks conventional energy resources and is alternative energy disadvantaged. In the past decade (2000–2010), its energy-related carbon emissions increased from 37.8 to 44.4 million tonnes of CO2. This paper analyses the city state's carbon emissions from the demand perspective using the input-output (I-O) method and investigate the drivers of emission changes using structural decomposition analysis (SDA). It is the first comprehensive analysis of Singapore's emissions using the I-O framework. The results obtained show that exports accounted for nearly two-thirds of its total emissions and growth in its emissions in the last decade was largely export-driven. Emissions increased as export-oriented industries and export volume expanded. Fuel switching and energy efficiency, however, helped to lower growth in emissions. Besides exports, household-related emissions accounted for about a quarter of Singapore's total emissions. The emissions related to different household groups remained fairly stable as increases in embodied (indirect) emissions were offset by decreases in direct emissions. The high-income household group registered the largest increase in direct emissions, while the middle-income household group registered the largest increase in embodied emissions. The policy implications of our findings are discussed.
C67|Bank productivity growth and convergence in the European Union during the financial crisis|This paper examines the bank productivity growth and integration process for the 28 EU countries during three main phases of the financial crisis: the U.S. subprime crisis (2007–2008), the global financial crisis (2009–2010) and the sovereign debt crisis (2010–2012). We extend the Malmquist Productivity Index by applying an additive two-stage DEA model. This allows us to explore the sources of growth in different stages of production. Furthermore, we assess the integration of European banks by analyzing the β-convergence and σ-convergence of the two-stage Productivity Index. Our results show a productivity growth during the U.S. subprime crisis, but a consistent decline during the global financial crisis. The loss of competitiveness of the European banking system is due to the drop in growth of the performance stage and technical change. Finally, we find a strong convergence pattern during the financial crisis, mainly driven by the catch up process of some Eastern countries and the drop in performance of Western countries.
C67|AH1N1 impact on the Mexican pork meat market|This article presents estimates of AH1N1's effects on the consumption of pork through an Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) for meat consumption in Mexico. Additionally, indirect effects through the Mexican economy are estimated using a general equilibrium model that captures the effects of intersectoral relationships and the induced effects by the circular flow of income. It is concluded that the presumed risk of contracting AH1N1 via pork consumption provoked total economic losses of $94 million. The rumor affected the pork sector, the grains sector and the manufacturing sector of food, beverages and tobacco. The poor rural households were the most affected.
C67|Domestic value added content of India's exports: Estimates for 112 sectors, 1999-2000 to 2012-13|Using Input-Output (IO) analysis, this study provides the time series estimates of domestic value added (DVA) content of India's merchandise and services exports for the period 1999-2000 to 2012-13 and for 112 sectors. The study makes use of the official input-output tables (IOTs) for the benchmark years 1998-99, 2003-04, 2007-08 as well as the recently published Supply Use Tables (SUTs) for the years 2011-12 and 2012-13. The IOTs and SUTs, compiled by the CSO, do not distinguish imported inputs from domestic inputs. Using a proportionality assumption we separate domestic and imported inputs. Further, for the intervening years (i.e., the years for which IOTs and SUTs are not available), we construct the domestic use tables by making use of detailed production and trade data from various official sources. This enables us to make use of year-specific domestic use tables in our estimation. The estimates show that the DVA content of India's exports increased from US$46 billion in 1999-00 to US$ 295 billion in 2012-13, with a growth rate of 17.7 per annum. The ratio of DVA to gross exports steadily declined from 0.86 in 1999-00 to 0.65 in 2012-13. The decline in the ratio of DVA to gross exports has been particularly sharp for manufacturing sectors, suggesting that Indian industries have become more integrated with the global production networks (GPNs) and value chains, especially since the second half of the 2000s. Backward linkages, particularly from manufacturing to agriculture and services, have become an important source of export related DVA in the country. An implication is that the industries which are less export oriented are not necessarily protected from negative external shocks. Finally, using an econometric analysis, we show that greater participation in GPNs, as captured by the share of DVA in gross exports of a sector, leads to higher absolute values of gross exports and DVA.
C67|Working Paper 10-17 - Belgium’s Carbon Footprint - Calculations based on a national accounts consistent global multi-regional input-output table|The traditional attribution of responsibility for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to producing countries may be distorted by international trade flows as importing emission-intensive commodities contributes to reducing a country's production-based emissions. This has motivated the calculation of carbon footprints that measure the amount of domestic and foreign GHG emissions (directly and indirectly) embodied in commodities intended for final consumption by a country's residents. In thisworking paper, we present carbon footprint estimations for Belgium based on global multi-regional input-output (MRIO) tables that have been made consistent with detailed Belgian national accounts. According to our calculations, Belgium's carbon footprint is substantially higher than its productionbased emissions, which means that Belgium is a net importer of GHG emissions. Moreover, our results show that consistency with detailed national accounts does matter for MRIO-based carbon footprint calculations, in particular for a small open economy like Belgium.
C67|Poverty and Distributional Effects of a Carbon Tax in Mexico|Mexico recently declared ambitious goals in reducing domestic CO2 emissions and introduced a carbon tax in 2014. Although negative effects on household welfare and related poverty measures are widely discussed as possible consequences, empirical evidence is missing. We try to fill this gap by simulating an input-output model coupled with household survey data to examine the welfare effects of different carbon tax rates over the income distribution. The currently effective tax rate is small and has negligible effects on household welfare. Higher simulated tax rates, maintaining the current tax base, show a slight progressivity but welfare losses remain moderate. Welfare losses, regressivity and poverty rise more with widening the tax base towards natural gas and other greenhouse gases (CH4, N2O) mainly through food price increases. For a complete analysis of the policy, we simulate a redistribution of calculated tax revenues and find that the resulting effects become highly progressive, also for high rates, wider tax bases and even in the absence of perfect targeting of social welfare programs.
C67|Microfinance efficiency in the West African Economic and Monetary Union: have reforms promoted sustainability or outreach?|This study aims to assess the microfinance institutions’ (MFIs’) efficiency in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) after the reforms that were undertaken in the industry. Given the complementary role between MFIs and banks (where MFIs reach the population that the banks cannot), we ask whether these reforms have promoted sustainability or outreach. For this purpose, we use a data envelopment analysis (DEA) to measure the social efficiency on the one hand and the financial efficiency on the other hand. Our results show that sustainability prevails. Indeed, we observe an increase in financial efficiency at the expense of social and financial efficiency. MFIs that stress outreach tend to be less efficient, when one considers their intermediation role. Moreover, reforms have a negative impact on social efficiency and a positive impact on financial efficiency. Indeed, prudential ratios and accounting standards that were implemented, led MFIs to privilege their intermediation role.
C67|Spillover effects of Germany's final demand on Southern Europe|We use data from the World Input‐Output Database to fit a closed multiregional input–output model in order to estimate the size of spillover effects of Germany's final demand on GDP, employment and the trade balance in Southern European countries. We find that spillover effects are rather small. Germany alone will hardly make a significant contribution to the external adjustment process in the European South.
C67|Domestic Value Added Content of India's Exports: Estimates for 112 Sectors, 1999-2000 to 2012-13|Using Input-Output (IO) analysis, this study provides the time series estimates of domestic value added (DVA) content of India's merchandise and services exports for the period 1999-2000 to 2012-13 and for 112 sectors. The study makes use of the official input-output tables (IOTs) for the benchmark years 1998-99, 2003-04, 2007-08 as well as the recently published Supply Use Tables (SUTs) for the years 2011-12 and 2012-13. The IOTs and SUTs, compiled by the CSO, do not distinguish imported inputs from domestic inputs. Using a proportionality assumption the domestic and imported inputs are separated. Further, for the intervening years (i.e., the years for which IOTs and SUTs are not available), the paper construct the domestic use tables by making use of detailed production and trade data from various official sources. This enables to make use of year-specific domestic use tables in our estimation.
C67|Financial Structure of South Korea's Chaebol: A Flow-of-Funds Approach|The chaebol, a South Korean form of business conglomerate, has been a key factor in the country's economic growth. In this study, the chaebol sector is added to the asset-liability matrix derived from a flow-of-funds (FOF) analysis in order to explain the role of the chaebol in the Korean financial system. We find that the power-of-dispersion indices in the asset-oriented system differ between the chaebol and other private corporations. Between 1987 and 2002, the former has increased while the latter has declined. In the case of the chaebol, excess liabilities were reduced, while investments in financial assets were increased. This tendency led to an increase in the power-of-dispersion index in this asset-oriented system. Our previous research found a decrease in this index for the private sector in Korea. However, the index increased for chaebol when the private sector is divided into the chaebol and small/medium-sized corporations in this paper. These results point to a greater concentration of economic power in the chaebol in the Korean financial market.
C67|Evaluating the Asian international input-output table in comparison with the three major multiregional input-output tables|This paper introduces the existing multiregional Input-Output (MRIO) Tables i.e., IDE, ADB, OECD, and GTAP with special attention to the method of constructing import matrix. Also, the similarities and differences among the four MRIO Tables are studied in this paper, setting the IDE table as the benchmark. From the results of comparison of major economic indicators with WDI, IDE and OECD shows similarity to WDI, compared to GTAP and ADB. However, TiVA indicators show considerably different values in motor vehicles and motorcycles in Indonesia. Whereas there is some possibilities Indonesia’s TiVA is overestimation, it can be said that the IDE table might captures the proper production structure. In order to understand the reason why different value in the IDE table occurs, an additional survey on import demand might be required.
C67|Korean Flow-of-Funds and Policy Evaluation: Comparison between Monetary Stabilization Bonds and Korean Treasury Bonds|"This study evaluates the authorities' monetary policies on a ""from-whom-to-whom"" basis for Korean FOF tables and using the input–output analysis method. In order to compare the monetary policy of the central bank with that of the government, net induced investments (NII) are calculated and decomposed. The notable findings of this study are as follows. After the Asian financial crisis in 1997, negative investments by the financial sectors, induced by the central bank, increased drastically. The sign of total NII finally turned negative during the period of credit card distress. However, the global financial crisis in 2008 was a turning point, in which the NII of the financial sectors, and especially banks, switched to being positive. In contrast, net investments induced by the Korean government have shown a steady increase. In addition, other than in 2008, the effects of changes in the government portfolio have been positive and constant. In addition, the NII of a combination of financial instruments are used to analyze monetary or fiscal policy simulations. This method will provide useful indicators for policy authorities when needing to select optimal amounts and types of financial instruments for open-market operations."
C67|Comparative advantage of the EU in global value chains: How important and efficient are new EU members in transition?|We suggest original modifications and extensions of the recently presented methodological developments in ex-post accounting framework in global value chains in order to obtain empirical results both for the analyzed group of ten CEE economies as well as at acountry-and-sector-specific level. The empirical results confirm that the role of the selected CEE economies in transition in creating value added with respect to the total value added in the European Union in the GVC framework was biggest in the cases of agriculture-, wood-products-, metal-production, and travel-and-tourism-related sectors. We also found that, after two decades of transition, the measures of productivity in the examined economies in 2009 were still much lower as comparedto the EU average for most of the sectors. Moreover, in the transition period, these indexes were increasing, especially after EU accession. In contrary, after two decades of transition, the measures of capital efficiency in the ten CEE economies in 2009 were comparable to the EU average for most of the sectors. Moreover, during this period, the growth rates of these indexes were, in general, positive. However, their growth rates dropped after EU accession.
C67|Production Networks|"In this paper, we model the economy as a production network of competitive firms that interact in a general-equilibrium setup. First, we find that, at the unique Walrasian equilibrium, the profit of each active firm is proportional to (a suitable generalization of) its Bonacich centrality. We also determine consumer welfare at equilibrium and characterize efficient networks. Then we proceed to conduct a broad range of comparative-static analyses. These include the effect on profits and welfare of: (a) distortions (e.g. tax/subsidies) imposed on the whole economy or specific firms; (b) structural changes such as the addition of links and the elimination of nodes; (c) productivity and preference changes. We discover that the induced effects are in general nonmonotone, depend on global network features, and impinge on each sector depending on the pattern of incentralities displayed by its input providers and output users. Furthermore, the inter-sector ""linkages"" underlying these effects can usually be decomposed – following the heuristic dichotomy proposed by Hirschman (1958) – into a forward (push) component and a backward (pull) one. Finally, we undertake some preliminary analysis of firm dynamics and illustrate that, when evaluating policies of support and shock mitigation from a dynamic viewpoint, the reliance on strict market-based criteria can be quite misleading in terms of social welfare."
C67|Key Factors of Foreign Trade Competitiveness: Comparison of the EU and BRICS by Factor and Cluster Analysis|International competitiveness is influenced by globalization processes in the world economy. This process changes the comparative advantages of each country and thus the shares of individual countries in world trade. BRICS countries have quickly strengthened their influence in international trade, and thus the European Union must face new pressure in competitiveness from their side. The aim of this paper is to define key factors of foreign trade competitiveness by an application of factor analysis and identify countries with similar characteristics of competitiveness factors by an application of cluster analysis. Factor and cluster analysis contain indicators of foreign trade which describe the driving forces of competitiveness, also in terms of long-term potentiality, and those which are direct or indirect outcomes of a competitive society and economy. Based on the results of the factor analysis, it is possible to classify the evaluated territories according to the level of foreign trade advancement by cluster analysis.
C67|Brazilian Role in the Global Value Chains|In recent past, the global value chains have increasingly become more pervasive in the productive processes around the world and thus decisively affect how each country is integrated in a reshaped global economy. Understanding the role of the economies in the global value chains can help national and local governments to develop more effective responses to the challenges that are imposed by globalization. The present paper focuses Brazil, whose rate of economic openness is generally considered low compared to other large emerging countries such as China. The paper analyzes such topic with the viewpoint that products and services are now made in global value chains and that ‘trade in value added’ might be a better approach for the measurement of international trade. Thus, our main goals are 1) evaluating how the Brazilian participation in the global value chains has evolved in the last two decades; 2) analyzing the trade relationships of Brazil with other economies, especially those composing the BRIC group of countries. In order to do so, we apply the WIOD's series of world input-output table (in the period of 1995-2011), and the 2005 IDE’s BRICs international input-output table. Our results show that the Brazilian trade in value added has been quite limited, but exhibits an increasing trend following the global upsurge of trade in value added. With respect to sectoral roles, the mining and metallurgical activities generated large shares of the Brazilian exports to value added, especially to China.
C67|Tracing Brazilian regions? CO2 emissions in domestic and global trade|The current Brazilian position on climate change has been formalized with the law of National Climate Change Policy (PNMC, in Portuguese), established in December 2009, which provides a legal framework for national actions aimed at mitigation and adaptation. Within PNMC, the country has defined its national voluntary reduction targets for greenhouse gases emissions, with reductions between 36.1% and 38.9% of projected emissions by 2020. The distribution of the corresponding mitigation efforts by regions is of great concern in a large country like Brazil, with substantial regional variation in economic development, physical geography, production system, and energy consumption. In fact, most of Brazilian states have established public policies on climate change. Out of the 27 states, three have mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions: SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, in the most developed Southeast region; Mato Grosso do Sul, in the Central-West region; as well as ParaÃ­ba, in the Northeast region. In this context, questions raised in the literature on global climate change, such as the environmental responsibility for emissions embodied in trade, also apply at the regional level, and perhaps even to a larger extent. In order to analyze at regional level the current relationship between Brazil?s CO2 emissions and domestic and global value chains, in this study we adopt a new framework that combines a world input-output table (WIOT) with an inter-regional input-output table (IRIOT). In our approach, we have chosen not to take one of the datasets (say the WIOT) as a starting point and adapt the other dataset (i.e. the IRIOT) accordingly, instead we construct input coefficients for which both datasets are used. For the empirical application, we use the WIOT for 2008 that was constructed in the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) project. It is a full inter-country input-output table covering 40 countries and the rest of the world as a 41st country. Our IRIOT for 2008 covers the 27 Brazilian states. Both the WIOT and the IRIOT were aggregated to 28 compatible industries. Also, a new database is compiled on Brazilian states? energy use (by fuel) and related CO2 emissions at sectoral level, based on states? official energy balances and estimates of national greenhouses gases emissions for 2008 from Brazil?s Ministry of Science and Technology. We are able to evaluate the CO2 emissions in each of the 27 Brazilian states, considering their respective intra-regional productive structure, energy use, as well as their trade with other states or foreign countries. In this way, our results reveal how CO2 emissions are produced in Brazilian regions by means of domestic and global value chains.
C67|Financial Frictions in Production Networks|We study how an economy’s production structure determines the response of aggregate output and employment to sectoral financial shocks. In our framework, economic production is organized in an input-output network in which firms face financial constraints on their working capital. We show how sectoral financial shocks propagate through the network and manifest at the aggregate level through two channels: a fall in total factor productivity and an aggregate labor wedge distortion. The strength of each channel depends on the overall network architecture and the location of shocks. Finally, we calibrate our model to the U.S. input-output tables and use it to quantitatively assess the role of the network multiplier within the context of the recent Financial Crisis and the Great Recession.
C67|Impactos Económicos Regionales del “Shale Gas” en la Reforma Energética de México|El estudio tiene como objetivo estimar los impactos económicos de algunos aspectos de la Reforma Energética de 2013 en el Noreste de México, particularmente los relacionados con los recursos de gas de esquisto (lutitas) o de “shale gas”. En específico, el reporte presenta estimaciones preliminares de los efectos de los nuevos proyectos de construcción y operación de gasoductos en la región Noreste. Para medir dichos impactos se construyeron matrices insumo-producto y de contabilidad social regionales. Para ello, se partió de las matrices nacionales del Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía para el año 2012. Al análisis tradicional de insumo-producto se le ha añadido información de cuentas sociales que presentan las transacciones no sólo entre sectores industriales sino que además incluyen a instituciones como los hogares, las sociedades y los trabajadores por cuenta propia.
C67|Global value chains: new evidence and implications|The workshop entitled 'Global Value Chains: new evidence and implications' was held in Rome on the 22nd of June 2015. The workshop presented the results of a research project carried out by a group of economists from the Bank's Directorate General for Economics, Statistics and Research. The first session focuses on the structure of global value chains and how they function in the euro area economies. The second and third sessions examine the implications of global value chains on competitiveness and economic performance, respectively. The last session concentrates on specific countries, regions and firms.
C67|Encadenamientos, clústeres y flujos de trabajo en la economía colombiana|Conocer de manera profunda las relaciones de interdependencia de la estructura económica es de gran importancia en el ejercicio de diseño de políticas económicas. Este trabajo usa el modelo insumo-producto para el análisis económico. Se aplican 2 enfoques no usados tradicionalmente para la economía colombiana: análisis de descomposición espectral (Dietzenbacher, 1992) e identificación de clústeres (Garbellini y Wirkierman, 2014). El resultado es la construcción de indicadores de encadenamientos sin sesgo de sobrestimación o subestimación, y la identificación de clústeres de manera endógena. Adicionalmente se derivan los flujos de trabajo incorporado que se propagan a través de la red productiva. Cada uno de estos flujos se descompone en indicadores que permiten caracterizar los clústeres de acuerdo a su cercanía con la demanda final, su grado de cohesión con la red y su importancia para el resto del sistema.
C67|European banks’ technical efficiency and performance: do business models matter? The case of European co-operatives banks|This paper analyses the technical efficiency of European co-operative banks compared to European commercial banks from 2006 to 2014. For this we use the B-convexity method, an innovative approach in frontier efficient models estimation, to measure banks’ technical efficiency; we also analyse the influence of certain variables on the level of efficiency. Our findings show that: a) a principal component analysis indicates that cooperative banks’ balance sheet are oriented towards lending activities while commercial banks are more oriented towards securities and derivatives activities; b) on average, the technical efficiency of the banks in our sample significantly decreased between 2007 and 2009, before recovering markedly between 2010 and 2012 and stabilizing over the period 2013-2014; c) there is no significant difference in technical efficiency between European cooperative banks and commercial banks, although we observe a slight superiority of commercial banks; d) French cooperative banks have higher levels of technical efficiency than their European peers; and (e) technical efficiency is positively impacted by the banks’ size, suggesting that large banks tend to have higher technical efficiency than smaller banks. This is in line with a trend towards concentration to improve technical efficiency in the European banking sector.
C67|The Great Collapse in Value Added Trade|This paper studies the great collapse in value added trade using a structural decomposition analysis. We show that changes in vertical specialisation accounted for almost half of the great trade collapse, while the previous literature on gross trade has mainly focused on final expenditure, inventory adjustment and adverse credit supply conditions. The decline in international production sharing during the crisis may partially account for the observed decrease in global trade elasticities in recent years. Second, we find that the drop in the overall level of demand accounted for roughly a quarter of the decline in value added exports while just under one third was due to compositional changes in final demand. Finally, we demonstrate that the dichotomy between services and manufacturing sectors observed in gross exports during the great trade collapse is not apparent in value added trade data.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
C67|Accounting for the Differences Between Gross and Value Added Trade Balances|One of the main stylised facts that has emerged from the recent literature on global value chains is that bilateral trade imbalances in gross terms can differ substantially from those measured in value added terms. However, the factors underlying the extent and sign of the differences between the two measures have so far not been investigated. Here, we propose a novel decomposition of bilateral gross trade balances that accounts for the differences between gross and value added concepts. The bilateral analysis contributes conceptually to the literature on double counting in trade by identifying the trade flow in which value added is actually recorded for the first time in international trade statistics. We apply our decomposition framework to the development of intra-EU27 trade balances from 1995 to 2011 and show that a growing share of intra-EU bilateral trade balances is due to demand in countries other than the two direct trading partners. The latter accounted for 25% of the total variance of intra-EU gross bilateral trade balances in 2011, which marks a considerable rise from 3% in 1995. A structural decomposition analysis indicates that this evolution was especially due to the rising importance of international production sharing.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
C67|Determination Of Key Sectors In Turkish Economy By Using Input-Output Analysis|The purpose of this study is to determine the key economic sectors by using Leontief input-output analysis in the deriving backward and forward linkages for all sectors in the Turkish economy for the year 2011. It is important to contribute to public policies aimed at development of the national economy according to the results reached in our study. The key economic sectors, according to their direct or indirect forward and backward linkage indices, are Textiles and Textile Products, Chemicals and Chemical Products, Basic Metals and Fabricated Metal, Electricity, Gas and Water Supply, Other Supporting and Auxiliary Transport Activities; Activities of Travel Agencies. Investments primarily in these sectors may increase economic mobility.
C67|Estimation of Formal and Informal Sectors in Social Accounting Matrix for the North Korean Economy (in Korean)|The expansion of the informal sector is one of the most representative changes in North Korean economy since the 2000s. This paper estimates a social accounting matrix(SAM) that distinguishes between formal and informal activities of North Korea during the year of 2013 in order to understand its dual economic structure. As the estimation results, the share of informal sector in North Korea is estimated at 18.5% for factor income and 28.5% for final demand. Also, it indicates the production inducement effect of the informal sector in both household consumption and investment based on the Input-Output analysis. Increasing informal investment expenditure could contribute to encouraging the entire North Korean economy because the output multiplier of investment expenditure is much higher than that of household spending. Lastly it is worth to note that these estimation results are based on relatively rough assumptions due to the limited statistics of North Korean economy. Therefore, the results could be changed in case different assumptions are introduced regarding informal economic activities in North Korea.
C67|Econometric Analysis of Production Networks with Dominant Units|This paper builds on the work of Acemoglu et al. (2012) and considers a production network with unobserved common technological factor and establishes general conditions under which the network structure contributes to aggregate fluctuations. It introduces the notions of strongly and weakly dominant units, and shows that at most a finite number of units in the network can be strongly dominant, while the number of weakly dominant units can rise with N (the cross section dimension). This paper further establishes the equivalence between the highest degree of dominance in a network and the inverse of the shape parameter of the power law. A new extremum estimator for the degree of pervasiveness of individual units in the network is proposed, and is shown to be robust to the choice of the underlying distribution. Using Monte Carlo techniques, the proposed estimator is shown to have satisfactory small sample properties. Empirical applications to US input-output tables suggest the presence of production sectors with a high degree of pervasiveness, but their effects are not sufficiently pervasive to be considered as strongly dominant.
C67|Extending the Input-Output Table Based on Firm-level Data|This paper proposes a general method to extend a standard input-output (IO) table to incorporate firm heterogeneity when portraying the domestic segment of global value chains in a country. We develop a quadratic optimization model to estimate an extended IO table that reports inter-sector transactions between different types of firms in an economy, using information from standard IO tables along with various linear constraints implied by sector-level statistics and firm-level data. The proposed method permits the computation of standard errors of all values in the estimated IO tables, inferred from bootstrapped samples of the underlying firm-level data. As an illustration, we implement our model using Chinese IO tables and firm census data. We then use the estimated IO tables to compute the direct and indirect domestic value added in exports of different firm types in China. Based on our reconciled data sets for 2007 and 2010, we find that both state-owned enterprises (SOE) and small and medium enterprises (SME) in China have much higher value-added exports (VAX) to gross exports ratios, compared to the rest of the economy. While the VAX ratio of China’s aggregate exports increased by about 9% between 2007 and 2010, SOE’s and SME’s VAX increased by 47% and 27%, respectively.

This work uses the input-output (I/O) model for economic analysis. Two approaches, not traditionally used, are applied to analyse the Colombian economy: spectrum of different I/O coefficient matrices (Dietzenbacher, 1992) and clustering techniques (Garbellini y Wirkierman, 2014). As a result, indicators of linkages are obtained without bias of overestimation or underestimation. Additionally, clusters are identified endogenously. Furthermore, embodied labour flows that spread through the network-production are calculated. Each of these flows is broken down into indicators that characterise the clusters according to their proximity to final demand, to their degree of cohesion to the network, and to their importance for the rest of the system.
C67|Una Nota sobre la Evolución de la Tasa de Protección Efectiva y la Tasa de Protección Nominal en Colombia (2002 – 2014)|El presente documento tiene como objetivo evaluar el impacto de la política arancelaria en la estructura de protección de 137 ramas industriales, 59 productos agrícolas y 10 productos pecuarios en Colombia para el periodo 2002 y 2014. El análisis se realiza a partir de la Matriz Insumo – Producto del Departamento Nacional de Planeación (2014) y el arancel ponderado por tiempo propuesto por Nieto (2015). Los resultados obtenidos muestran que la Tasa de Protección Efectiva (TPE) y Tasa de Protección Nominal (TPN) tuvieron una tendencia decreciente para el sector industrial a partir de 2009, año a partir del cual Colombia no tuvo la obligación de cumplir con el Arancel Externo Común (AEC) de la Comunidad Andina de Naciones (CAN). En los sectores agrícola y pecuario ambos indicadores mantienen o registran una tendencia creciente.
C67|Cálculo de la Productividad Sectorial en Colombia con Herramientas Insumo-Producto|En este trabajo se adopta la recomendación de Felipe y McCombie (2007) y Pasinetti (1987) de medir la productividad desde un punto de vista desagregado. De esta manera, es posible entender el comportamiento inter-sectorial, frente a los distintos escenarios por los que atraviesa la economía. Para tal fin, se hace uso de las herramientas basadas en el modelo Insumo-Producto: fraccionamiento del sistema productivo en clústeres y cálculo de la productividad laboral total por subsistemas verticalmente integrados. Se usan los clústeres identificados por Villamil y Hernández (2016) para clasificar los sectores y, a partir de allí, se logró establecer las fuentes del cambio de productividad: de acuerdo al clúster de origen. Se encuentran 29 sectores dinámicos en el período 2005-2012. Dentro de estos últimos, se destacan los sectores con vocación hacia la intermediación (comercio, finanzas y transporte) y algunos sectores de la industria manufacturera (equipo de transporte, maquinaria eléctrica y mecánica). Se encuentra, que en los sectores no-dinámicos, existe una alta incidencia negativa sobre la productividad generada dentro de su propio clúster. Se concluye resaltando la necesidad de ahondar en el estudio de las relaciones interindustriales a nivel de sector o, incluso, a nivel de firma.
C67|Pronóstico del Consumo Privado: Usando datos de alta frecuencia para el pronóstico de variables de baja frecuencia|Uno de los componentes más importantes del PIB es el consumo de los hogares, por lo cual el pronóstico de esta variable es clave para poder evaluar y predecir el comportamiento de la actividad económica. En este trabajo se introducen dos elementos innovadores para su predicción, primero se incorpora dentro de la función de consumo el índice de confianza al consumidor, con el fin de involucrar un indicador líder del comportamiento de los consumidores y el segundo es el uso de metodologías econométricas en las que se incorporan series de alta frecuencia para el pronóstico de series de baja frecuencia, con el fin de no perder información que pueda ser valiosa. Se encuentra que el pronóstico dentro de la muestra ha sido bastante cercano a los datos reales, aunque los intervalos de confianza del pronóstico pueden ser amplios.

Para este propósito, se aplican las siguientes metodologías basadas en el análisis input-output: a) el método Chenery-Watabane (1958) para el cálculo de encadenamientos productivos directos; b) los métodos Rasmussen (1963) para el cálculo de encadenamientos productivos totales; c) el enfoque de demanda de Leontief (1985) para cuantificar los encadenamientos hacia atrás directos y totales; d) el enfoque de oferta de Ghosh (1958, 1968) para la cuantificación de los encadenamientos hacia delante directos y totales. Finalmente, los resultados de estas aplicaciones muestran que los sectores clave de México son las industrias de bienes intermedios y bienes de capital.******This article seeks to identify the industrial sectors that are key to the Mexican economy. To this end the following methodologies are employed, all based on input-output analysis: a) the Chenery-Watabane Method (1958) for calculating direct productive linkages; b) the Rasmussen Methods (1963) for calculating total productive linkages; c) Leontief’s demand focus (1985) for the quantification of direct and total backward linkages; and d) the supply focus of Ghosh (1958, 1968) used to quantify direct and total forward linkages.

C67|Incorporation of services in natural resource-intensive goods: description and measurement of the phenomenon|South American countries play a key role in international markets of the so called Natural Resource Intensive Goods (NRIGs), in particular mining and food. It has been argued that this specialization pattern has disadvantages in terms of economic development, and both policy makers and academia repeatedly sustain the need to search for new international insertion schemes. In this paper we argue that one such avenue could be based on these comparative advantages themselves, and we ask how services can add value to the production and exports of NRIGs. To measure the relevance of economic infrastructure services on the competitiveness of NRIGs we develop a sectoral approach using domestic input-output tables for six Latin American countries. In particular, we measure Services value added incorporated in NRIGs, and we also analyse the impacts of productivity changes in infrastructure services on NRIGs producer prices. Results allow to identify which services are more important to each NRIG in each country. They also highlight that new instruments in trade and industrial policy must be develop to promote the specialized products services in NRIG. It is necessary to know the nature of the process that generates this new comparative advantage.
C67|Income Differences and Input-Output Structure|We consider a multi-sector general equilibrium model with IO linkages, sector-speci c productivities and tax rates. Using tools from network theory, we investigate how the IO structure interacts with productivities and taxes in the determination of aggregate income. We show that aggregate income is a simple function of the rst and second moments of the distribution of the IO multipliers, sectoral productivities and sectoral tax rates. We then estimate the parameters of the model to t their joint empirical distribution. Poor countries have more extreme distributions of IO multipliers than rich economies: there are a few high-multiplier sectors, while most sectors have very low multipliers; by contrast, rich countries have more sectors with intermediate multipliers. Moreover, the correlations of these with productivities and tax rates are positive in poor countries, while being negative in rich ones. The estimated model predicts cross-country income di erences extremely well, also out-of-sample. Finally, we perform a number of counterfactuals and compute optimal tax rates.
C67|Networks of Value-added Trade|Global Value Chains (GVCs) became the paradigm for the production of most goods and services around the world. Therefore, linkages among countries can no longer be adequately assessed through standard bilateral gross trade flows and new methods of analysis are needed. In this paper, we apply visualisation tools and measures of network analysis on value-added trade flows in order to understand the nature and dynamics of GVCs. The paper uses data on the bilateral foreign value added in exports from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) for the period 1995-2011 and, in each period, the GVC is represented as a directed network of nodes (countries) and edges (value added flows). The analysis is extended beyond total trade flows with a view to discussing the distinct roles of goods and services in GVCs. Moreover, the differences between Germany, the US, China and Russia as major suppliers of value added in GVCs are also examined.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
C67|Crisis severity and the international trade network|In this paper we analyse the role of the international trade network for the strength of the global recession across countries. The novelty of our paper is the use of value-added trade data to capture the importance of trade network structure. We estimate with BMA techniques how far network indicators measuring interlinkages in terms of value added trade has explanatory power both for the length and the depth of the recent crisis once we control for pre-crisis macroeconomic fundamentals. Our main findings are that the macroeconomic control variables with the strongest explanatory power for the length and the depth of the crisis are the growth rates of credit and of the real effective exchange rate in the pre-crisis period and, though to a lesser extent, GDP and inflation growth over the same period and pre-crisis foreign exchange reserves. Government debt, the GVC participation index and net foreign assets have very little explanatory power in the BMA estimations. The models JEL Classification: F14, C45, C52, C67
C67|Has EU Accession Caused Structural Change in New Entrants? Intersectoral Linkage Analyses on Bulgaria and Romania|The European Union (EU) countries, especially the founders and earlier entrants (EU-15) are among the most-developed, post-industrial and innovationdriven economies in the world. Countries with different structures are expected to have progressive structural changes after their accessions to the EU by means of the intra-EU policies on socio-economic integration and monetary (Euro) adoption. Starting from this convergence premise, this study aims to explore whether the latest member states, Bulgaria and Romania, that joined the EU in 2007, have experienced significant changes in their economic structures. To this end, with a general equilibrium approach and using input-output data of the countries, we conduct intersectoral linkage analyses covering all economic activities aggregated to 34 sectors for the years of 1995, 2002, 2007 and 2011. Backward and forward linkage coefficients calculated from inverse matrices based on the Leontief model and the Ghosh model reveal that there is no strong evidence found supporting the structural change experiences in the 5th year of the EU accession for both countries
C67|The Changing Energy Intensity in Indian Economy: A Sector-level Analysis Based on Input-Output Model| This paper is an attempt to analyze changing energy intensities in the Indian economy. The hybrid input-output model at constant prices has been used to address the problem of homogenous pricing of energy inputs across sectors of the economy. Results reveal that the indirect rather than direct energy use is an important source of energy consumption. In such scenario, conservation measures should be pegged in upstream suppliers through technological improvements, fuel substitution or input replacements. Finally, the paper argues that improvements in energy efficiency in the production chains are likely to be more effective than changes within the production process.
C67|On the emergence of scale-free production networks|We propose a simple dynamical model for the formation of production networks among monopolistically competitive firms. The model subsumes the standard general equilibrium approach à la Arrow–Debreu but displays a wide set of potential dynamic behaviors. It robustly reproduces key stylized facts of firms׳ demographics. Our main result is that competition between intermediate good producers generically leads to the emergence of scale-free production networks.
C67|Modeling the short-run effect of fiscal stimuli on GDP: A new semi-closed input–output model|In this study, we propose a new semi-closed input–output model, which reconciles input–output analysis with modern consumption theories. It can simulate changes in household consumption behavior when exogenous stimulus policies lead to higher disposable income levels. It is useful for quantifying the short-run effects of fiscal stimuli on GDP and its industry-level value added components. We illustrate the use of the model by estimating the short-run effect of the 4trillion yuan stimulus package on China's GDP. Our results show that this stimulus package might have led to an increase in GDP of more than 3trillion yuan, which is 9.5% of China's GDP in 2008. This result compares well to actual changes in GDP as observed in the years immediately after the introduction of the package.
C67|The distributional effects of emissions taxation in Brazil and their implications for climate policy|The emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) generated by human activity is a major cause of global warming and climate change. There is considerable debate about the choice of the best mechanism to reduce emissions under a climate policy. The aim of this paper is to measure the impact of a policy of taxing GHG emissions on the Brazilian economy as a whole and on different household groups based on income levels in 2009. The following databases were used: Supply and Use Tables, Household Budget Survey, National Household Sample Survey and emissions data from the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology and Innovation. A price system from a national input–output model that incorporates the intensity of GHG emissions is used, as well as a consumption vector broken down into ten representative households with different income levels. The main results indicate that this taxation system was slightly regressive and had a small negative impact on output. There were, however, significant emissions reductions.
C67|China's carbon emissions embodied in (normal and processing) exports and their driving forces, 2006–2012|This paper constructed a time-series extended input–output dataset (2006–2012) to analyze China's carbon emissions embodied in both normal and processing exports at a detailed 135-sector level. The structural decomposition analysis (SDA) was further applied to shed light on the driving forces behind the changes in their embodied emissions over the entire time period. This empirical study confirms the importance of using the extended model for analyzing the trade-related embodiment, especially for processing exports. The embodied emissions in both normal and processing exports first increased from 2006 to 2008, then dropped during the global financial crisis (2008–2009), and then rose again after 2009. The embodied emissions as a percentage of total CO2 emissions were quite stable before and after the global financial crisis, at around 24% over the 2006–2008 period, and 18% over the 2010–2012 period. From 2006 to 2012, emission intensity played the key role in reducing the embodied emissions (around 595Mt CO2), while the total export effect contributed the most to the increase in embodied emissions (around 552Mt CO2). Similar analysis can be applied to other indicators, such as energy, water, GHG emissions, pollutants and materials.
C67|An analysis of the driving factors of energy-related CO2 emission reduction in China from 2005 to 2013|The identification of the driving factors of China's energy-related emissions in the past years is very important to inform the policy design for China's future emission mitigations. Although this topic has been widely discussed in the literature, this paper provides the most recent overall estimation of the emission mitigation factors from both the production side and the consumption side taking into account China's recent energy and economic transformation. This study adopts China's most recent revised energy and economic data from 2005 to 2013 and analyzes it with a logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition model. We find that the primary emission mitigation contributor is the improvement of energy productivity in the industry sectors, which contributes 72% of the total reduction; household contributes 8.3%. The economic transitions in 2013 are still in an early stage, and the expected economic structure effect is moderately on emission reduction. In the future, China needs to improve the energy productivity in production sectors further by both enforcing energy conservation and promoting industry upgrading. Economic restructure will play a more important role in future emission reduction.
C67|Reforming fossil fuel prices in India: Dilemma of a developing economy|Over the period between 1990–1 and 2012–3, fossil fuel use on farms has risen and its indirect use in farming, particularly for non-energy purposes, is also growing. Consequently, both energy intensity and fossil fuel intensity are rising for Indian agriculture. But, these are declining for the aggregate Indian economy. Thus, revision of fossil fuel prices acquires greater significance for Indian agriculture than for rest of the economy. There are significant differences across crops. The crop-level analysis is supplemented by an alternative approach that utilizes a three-sector input–output (I–O) model for the Indian economy representing farming, fossil fuels, and rest of economy. Fossil fuels sector is assessed to portray, in general, strong forward linkages. The increase in total cost of farming, for a given change in fossil fuel prices, is estimated as a multiple of increase in direct input cost of fossil fuels in farming. From the three-sector aggregated economy this multiple was estimated at 3.99 for 1998–9. But it grew to 6.7 in 2007–8. The findings have stronger ramifications than commonly recognized, for inflation and cost of implementing the policy on food security.
C67|Bi-lateral CO2 emissions embodied in Australia–China trade|This paper quantifies the CO2 emissions embodied in bi-lateral trade between Australia and China using a sectoral input–output model. The results revealed: (1) that China performs lower than Australia in clean technology in the primary, manufacturing, energy sectors due to their overuse of coal and inefficient sectoral production processes, and (2) that China had a 30.94Mt surplus of bi-lateral CO2 emissions in 2010–2011 and (3) overall global emissions were reduced by 20.19Mt through Australia–China trade in 2010–2011. The result indicates that the greater the energy efficient a country among the trading partners the lower will be the overall global CO2 emissions. Global emissions decreased mainly because China consumed Australian primary products rather than producing them. Australia is an energy efficient producer of primary products relative to China. The bilateral trade compositions and trade volume played an important role in lowering global emissions and therefore one can view proposed China Australia Free trade Agreement positively in reducing global emissions. However, for the sustainable development, China should strengthen clean energy use and both countries should adopt measures to create an emission trading scheme in order to avoid protectionism in the form of future border price adjustments.
C67|Evaluating the efficiency of Italian public universities (2008–2011) in presence of (unobserved) heterogeneity|In assessing the performance of universities, the most recent literature underlined that the efficiency scores may suffer from the presence of incidental parameters or time-invariant, often unobservable, effects that lead to biased efficiency estimates. To deal with this problem, we apply a procedure developed by [67]; for estimating the efficiency in Italian higher education through a multi-output parametric distance function. We show that models which do not consider unobservable heterogeneity tend to estimate divergent efficiency scores. We also study the determinants of efficiency; the findings provide a clue towards the expansion of pro-competitive policies in the Italian higher education sector, consistently with the interpretation that when market forces operate, there are benefits for university efficiency. When exploring differences in the performance of universities, by geographical areas, we claim that maintaining State-level policies can be detrimental for overall efficiency, and instead special interventions for universities in the South should be designed.
C67|Dual-use products export multipliers with the indirect effects|The micro–macro link is provided for the impact of the dual-use defence-civilian exports of products and services on the Slovenian economy. The unique firm-level data on the dual-use export is integrated in the symmetric 60 groups of activities input–output tables. The classification of the economic activities is used to integrate data on the firm-to-firm dual-use export transactions in the symmetric input–output coding system to avoid the double counting. The input–output modelling approach is used for the measuring of the direct input–output flows and the dual-use products export multipliers with the indirect effects. The direct and indirect effects are analysed by the economic activities, technological intensity of the products and services, and statistical regions in Slovenia. Comparisons with alternative non dual-use high tech are analysed by economic activities in terms of value-added and labour productivity. The dual-use export is associated with high technologically intensive suppliers and sub-suppliers of defence-civilian goods and services. The empirical estimations can serve as a guide in questions of comparing with alternative in economic policy design when investigating trade-offs between allocation of expenditures for defence equipment and their opportunity costs for non dual-use of high tech products and services.
C67|Reform of Public Administration in Greece; Evaluating Structural Reform of Central Government Departments in Greece:Application of the DEA Methodology|The focus of this study is the evaluation of the efficiency and effectiveness of Central Government Departments (CGDs) in Greece. Measurements are compared with those defined by the Administrative Reform 2013 (AR2013) to assess whether the reforms introduced by the AR2013 to the CGDs attain the objectives of efficiency and effectiveness. The efficiency and effectiveness measurements of 19 CGDs drew on four Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models (i.e. Variable Returns to Scale DEA; Targeted factor-oriented radial DEA; Stochastic DEA; and Quality-driven Efficiency-adjusted DEA). This analytical methodology does more than merely attempt to defend or argue against the AR2013. It rather provides a concrete analytical framework for evaluating the performance of public organisations across the board, suggesting reforms that promote efficiency and effectiveness, and advance managerial capacity.
C67|Productivity spillovers in the GVC. The case of Poland and the New EU Member States|The new EU member states have been experiencing firm internationalization not only through inward foreign direct investment but also through exporting, importation of foreign technology in investment goods and increased use of imported intermediates. We argue that there are important productivity spillovers within the global value chains, i.e. FDI alone does not tell the whole story of the reallocation processes going on in the economies of the NMS. We augment the standard TFP spillover empirical model with modern measures of GVC participation. We show that increased foreign content of exports brings additional productivity gains on top of the ones attributed to exporting. Moreover, we show that in selected cases, participation in the GVC leads to a smaller productivity gap between foreign and domestic firms.
C67|Estructura interindustrial y desarrollo económico. Un análisis desde las perspectivas de redes e input-output|This paper studies inter-industry structures at national level by applying traditional input-output measures and also network analysis. The main objective is to attain a better understanding of economic processes by focusing on inter-industrial structures as a main explanatory factor of the observed international disparities in development. This study shows the existence of a fundamental inter-industrial structure, common to all countries. When comparing groups of countries, there are also structural differences that are in accordance with differences in development levels, in industrial specialization and in the structural position of some industrial sectors. Those differences have an impact on the countries’ unequal development processes. This study shows that both methodologies, input-output and network analyses, are complementary and allow to attain more advanced explanations of the processes of development. By applying network theory it is possible to improve our knowledge on structural differences and its relation with economic growth and development.// En este trabajo se estudian diversas estructuras interindustriales nacionales aplicando medidas tradicionales input-output y análisis de redes. Su principal objetivo es avanzar en la comprensión de los procesos económicos centrándose en las estructuras interindustriales como un factor explicativo de las disparidades internacionales de desarrollo. El estudio de las relaciones intersectoriales muestra la existencia de una estructura fundamental o común y de diferencias estructurales entre grupos de países, de acuerdo con sus niveles de desarrollo, en la especialización y en la posición de determinadas ramas, teniendo un impacto en sus desiguales procesos de des-arrollo. En este trabajo se muestra que ambas metodologías, input-output y redes, son complementarias y permiten alcanzar explicaciones más ricas de los procesos de desarrollo. La aplicación de la teoría de redes permite una mejor comprensión de las diferencias estructurales, que puede ser relacionada con el crecimiento económico y el desarrollo.
C67|Una red económica norteamericana|Las estructuras económicas pueden entenderse como redes de ramas, vinculadas entre sí mediante el intercambio de bienes producidos. El modelo de Insumo-Producto analiza la interdependencia sectorial en tales estructuras. En este trabajo, identificamos una red económica en una tabla IP trilateral norteamericana. Utilizamos una medida de densidad como indicador de la integración regional. Nuestros resultados muestran que la economía de los Estados Unidos determina el perfil de la estructura de Norteamérica. Canadá y México mantienen escasas relaciones directas y su pertenencia a la región ayuda a entender sus economías.
C67|Working Paper 02-16 - Een economische analyse van de sector van alcoholische dranken in België<BR>[Working Paper 02-16 - Une analyse économique du secteur des boissons alcoolisées en Belgique]|This paper analyses the importance of the production of alcoholic beverages for the Belgian economy, with a particular focus on beer. First, the paper provides an outline of the recent development of production, imports, exports and domestic use of alcoholic beverages. This product analysis is complemented by a study of the branch of alcoholic beverages in which production, added value, investments and employment are discussed. Finally, production, revenue and employment multipliers are calculated using the input-output tables for the year 2010, as well as the total contribution of the whole production and distribution chain of the produced and imported alcoholic beverages to Belgian GDP and employment.
C67|Working Paper 05-16 - Analyse du tableau input-output interrégional pour l’année 2010<BR>[Working Paper 05-16 - Analyse van de interregionale input-outputtabel voor het jaar 2010]|This working paper presents two analytical applications based on the interregional input-output (IO) table for Belgium for the year 2010. The Federal Planning Bureau constructed this table in 2015 in cooperation with the statistical authorities of the country's three Regions (IBSA, SVR and IWEPS). The following standard IO analyses based on applying the Leontief model to the interregional IO table are presented here: the derivation of multipliers for each region and the estimation of regional value added and regional employment generated by domestic final demand and exports.
C67|The effects of offshoring to low-wage countries on domestic wages: a worldwide industrial analysis|Abstract This paper extends the literature on the implications of offshoring for labour markets by investigating its effect on the wages of different skill groups in a broad global context. The analysis draws on input–output data from the WIOD project, and in the panel analysed (13 manufacturing industries, 40 countries, 1995–2009) we account for up to 96 % of the international trade in manufacturing inputs. Being particularly interested in the wage effects of offshoring to low-wage countries (LWC), we use precise LWC classifications (varying across industries and time) to decompose overall offshoring by source country. We use a decomposition of the conventional offshoring measure in order to capture its pure international component, which is further instrumented using a gravity-based strategy. According to the estimation results, the negative impact of offshoring on wages mainly concerns low and medium skilled workers. However, in terms of magnitude, the downward pressure on domestic wages exhibited by offshoring to LWC is relatively small.
C67|Economic freedom and public, non-market institutions: evidence from criminal prosecution|Abstract Economic freedom, which measures the protection of property and freedom to contract, is generally argued to capture the quality of a state’s institutions regarding market activity. As to be expected, numerous studies have found that economic freedom is associated with good economic outcomes. Additionally, much effort in public economics has worked to identify the features of quality non-market public institutions. No effort has been made to connect institutions that influence market activity and institutions that govern non-market activities. We take a first step. We employ a linear programming method for measuring relative efficiencies known as Data Envelopment Analysis. We apply this technique to information on the use of inputs to the production of the prosecution of crime across the thousands of local prosecutor offices in the U.S. We then compare state-level measurements of prosecution productivity with data on state-level economic freedom from the Economic Freedom of North America index. We show that there is a positive and statistically significant relationship between the two. Those states that develop institutions respecting economic freedom also tend to be the states that develop efficient publicly-provided services. The results are extended to complementary economic freedom measurements.
C67|Destination performance: Introducing the utility function in the mean-variance space|Economic characteristics of home countries can cause considerable variations in the tourism demand. For example, the average level of expenditure per tourist varies from one origin to another and these variations may alter overtime. Thus different tourist nationalities are associated with different level of expenditures and risks. Therefore strategies aimed at minimizing the variations may become an important issue for the policy makers. In this paper, we aim to use the productivity measurement theory in a mean-variance space to a French region (Nord Pas-de-Calais) by introducing the utility function in a mean-variance framework. With this method, we can calculate the optimal portfolio share for each origin and give some useful political advices to the policy decision makers to improve the performance of the tourist sector.
