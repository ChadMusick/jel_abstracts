H63|Límite de la Deuda Pública y Espacio Fiscal: Análisis para Colombia y Otros Mercados Emergentes|En este documento se analiza el límite de la deuda pública y el espacio fiscal para Colombia y otras economías emergentes, bajo el enfoque de la fatiga fiscal (Ghosh et. al., 2013). El estado de fatiga se presenta en situaciones de incrementos continuos de la deuda y del pago de los intereses, que llevan a que los esfuerzos del gobierno para generar superávits primarios se deterioren. El trabajo utiliza la técnica de los splines para estimar la reacción del gobierno a la dinámica de deuda y plantea una prima de riesgo endógena a su evolución. Las estimaciones se realizan con un panel desbalanceado de trece economías, seis de la región, para el periodo 1985–2016. Los resultados sugieren que el límite de la deuda pública de país se situaría en 56% del PIB y el espacio fiscal ascendería a 7 p.p. del producto, el cual luce estrecho especialmente por la sensibilidad de la deuda a los choques externos. Frente a otros países de la región, Chile cuenta con el mayor espacio fiscal, al tiempo que México y Ecuador, con endeudamientos cercanos al colombiano, disponen de menor espacio. **** ABSTRACT: This paper assess the public debt limit and fiscal space for Colombia and some emerging economies, under the fiscal fatigue approach (Ghosh et. al., 2013). The fatigue phenomenon occurs under situations of continuous increases of both debt and interest payments, which lead to government´s efforts to obtain primary surpluses to deteriorate. The paper uses the spline technique to estimate the government's reaction function to debt dynamics and proposes a sovereign risk premium endogenous to the level of indebtedness. Estimates carry out with an unbalanced panel of thirteen economies, six of them from Latin America, for the period 1985-2016. Results suggest that the limit of Colombian public debt would be 56% of GDP and that fiscal space would amount to 7 points of GDP, which looks so narrow due to the debt sensitivity to external shocks. In front to other countries, Chile has the largest fiscal space, while Mexico and Ecuador, with comparable indebtedness to the Colombian, have lower spaces.
H63|¿Cómo y qué tanto impacta la deuda pública a las tasas de interés de mercado?|La relación entre la deuda pública y las tasas de interés de mercado ha sido un tema de amplia discusión en la literatura internacional, por sus implicaciones sobre los mercados financieros, las decisiones de ahorro e inversión de los agentes económicos y el agregado de la economía. En este artículo se analiza cómo y qué tanto impacta la deuda del pública la pendiente o spread de la estructura a plazos de las tasas de interés en Colombia en el periodo 2003-2017. Para alcanzar su objetivo, primero se estima el spread a diferentes plazos, mediante un modelo de estado-espacio. Posteriormente, se determina el impacto de la deuda sobre aquel; utilizando modelos de series de tiempo univariados y multivariados. Por último, se realiza una descomposición histórica de choques del spread. Los principales resultados obtenidos muestran que la deuda pública tiene un efecto positivo sobre el spread, tanto la emitida a tasa fija como a tasa variable. Así mismo se encuentra que la emisión de deuda a tasa variable tiene un mayor efecto sobre el spread de las tasas de interés de corto plazo, mientras la de tasa fija, más sensible a las condiciones del mercado, tiene un mayor impacto sobre el spread de las tasas de interés de largo plazo. La implicación de política más importante es el llamado a la reducción del endeudamiento público, con el objetivo de aminorar su impacto no deseado sobre el mercado financiero y la actividad económica. **** ABSTRACT: The relationship between public debt and market interest rates has been a subject of wide discussion in the international literature, due to its implications for the financial markets, saving and investment decisions of economic agents and for the aggregate of the economy. This article analyzes how and how much public debt impacts the slope or spread of the term structure of interest rates in Colombia in the period 2003-2017. To reach its objective, the spread is estimated at different terms, using a state-space model. Subsequently, the impact of the debt on the spread is determined; using univariate and multivariate time series models. Finally, a historical decomposition of the spread shocks is carried out. The main results obtained show that the public debt has a positive effect on the spread, both debts issued at a fixed rate and at a variable rate. It is also found that the issuance of debt at a variable rate has a greater effect on the spread of the short-term interest rates, while the fixed-rate debt, which is more sensitive to market conditions, has a greater impact on the spread of long-term rates. The most important policy implication is the call for the reduction of public indebtedness, with the aim of reducing its undesired impact on the financial market and economic activity.
H63|Real Effects of Financial Distress: The Role of Heterogeneity|How severe are the real consequences of financial distress caused by sovereign debt crisis? What are the channels through which sovereign debt crisis affect banks and firms, and vice versa? Does firm heterogeneity matter? If yes, what are the important dimensions of heterogeneity? Using micro data from Portugal during the sovereign cri- sis starting in 2010, we address these questions. We make use of the Bank of Portugal’s detailed credit registry database together with bank and firm balance sheets and income statements to conduct this analysis. We first study the direct effect of the sovereign crisis on bank balance sheets by analyzing the differential impact on firms that had relations with banks who were more exposed to the sovereign (pre-crisis). We find that more fragile firms that had relations with more exposed banks contracted more than their counterparts. Specifically we find leverage and maturity structure of debt to be important dimensions of heterogeneity determining a firm’s fragility. Highly leveraged firms and those that had a larger share of short term debt contracted more during the sovereign debt crisis. We analyze firm performance on the basis of growth rate of employment, assets, liabilities and usage of intermediate commodities. We show that our findings are consistent with a simple model of leverage and maturity choice. We then document the spillover effects across firms that are mediated through the banking sector. To do this, we focus on the set of firms that were current on all their loans through the crisis, i.e., the set of performing firms. We find that performing firms that had relations with banks whose corporate loan balance sheet deteriorate by more were more affected by the sovereign crisis. Again, highly leveraged firms and those that had a larger share of short term debt contracted more during the sovereign debt crisis.
H63|Friends for the benefits: The effects of political ties on sovereign borrowing conditions|Do closer political ties with a global superpower improve sovereign borrowing conditions? We use data on voting at the United Nations General Assembly along with foreign aid flows to construct an index of political ties and find evidence that suggests closer political ties leads to both better sovereign credit ratings and lower yields on sovereign bonds. We use heads-of-state official visits and coalition forces troop contributions as exogenous instruments to further strengthen the findings.
H63|Long term Government Bonds|We study how the issuance of long bonds affects optimal fiscal policy. Long bonds are usually modelled as having two features that are not found in the data: a) zero coupons and b) previously issued bonds are repurchased each period regardless of their time to maturity. The literature has found that under a) and b) issuing long bonds provides fiscal insurance. We show that these assumptions are not innocuous. Specifically we find that long bonds may not complete the markets even in the absence of uncertainty and under certain assumptions long bonds introduce additional tax volatility that offsets the attractiveness they provide through fiscal insurance. We find that introducing coupons helps alleviate the additional tax volatility but does so by reducing the ability of long bonds to provide insurance. Under full commitment the government promises future tax changes in order to reduce current funding costs. This introduces additional tax volatility. If we remove assumptions a) and b) interest rate twisting takes a very different form, showing again that those assumptions matter.
H63|Union Debt Management|We study the role of government debt maturity in a monetary union in the absence of fiscal transfers across countries. Our key finding is that fi scal hedging is only possible when spending represents an aggregate shock in the union. In the case of idiosyncratic disturbances in spending it is not possible to target a portfolio which provides fi scal insurance to the governments: the allocation is one of incomplete financial markets. These implications are in line with the empirical evidence. Using a sample of 5 Euro area countries and historical holding period returns on government debt, we find that fiscal insurance is not signifi cant against country speci fic shocks however, it is signifi cant against aggregate shocks. Our analysis extends the theoretical results of the literature on optimal fiscal policy without state contingent debt to a two country model. We show that in the two country setup and under an incomplete market the optimal tax schedule, consumption and leisure follow a random walk.
H63|The mirror does not lie: Endogenous ?scal limits for Slovakia|We study the interactions among ?scal policy, ?scal limits and the associated sovereign risk premium. The ?scal limit distribution, which measures the ability of the government to service its debt, arises endogenously from dynamic Laffer curves. We assume a feedback loop between the ?scal limit distribution and the risk premium and determine them simultaneously using and ef?cient iterative scheme. A nonlinear relationship between the sovereign risk premium and the level of government debt then emerges in equilibrium. The model is calibrated to Slovak data assuming steeply growing age-related transfers and volatile business cycle. We study the impact of various model parameters on the conditional (state-dependent) and unconditional distributions of the ?scal limit. Fiscal limit distributions obtained via Markov–Chain–Monte–Carlo regime switching algorithm depend on the rate of growth of government transfers, the degree of countercyclicality of policy, and the distribution of the underlying economic conditions. We ?nd that both distributions are considerably more heavy-tailed compared with those usually obtained in the literature for advanced economies, and are very sensitive to the size and rate of growth of transfers, the business cycle phase and the ?scal policy credibility. The main policy message is that the Maastricht debt limit of 60 percent of GDP is not safe enough for Slovakia. Furthermore, credible reforms reining in age-related spending and thus stabilising public ?nance in the long-run, should be a priority.
H63|The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2019 to 2029|In CBOâ€™s projections, the federal budget deficit is about $900 billion in 2019 and exceeds $1 trillion each year beginning in 2022. Because of persistently large deficits, federal debt held by the public is projected to grow steadily, reaching 93 percent of GDP in 2029. Real GDP is projected to grow by 2.3 percent in 2019â€”down from 3.1 percent in 2018â€”as the effects of the 2017 tax act on the growth of business investment wane and federal purchases decline sharply in the fourth quarter of 2019.
H63|Updated Budget Projections: 2019 to 2029|CBO estimates that the deficit for fiscal year 2019 will be $896 billion, which is $1 billion less than the agency estimated in January. If current laws generally remained unchanged, deficits would average 4.3 percent of gross domestic product over the 2020â€“2029 period. Other than the period immediately after World War II, the only other time the average deficit has been so large over so many years was after the 2007â€“2009 recession.
H63|An Analysis of the Presidentâ€™s 2020 Budget|By CBOâ€™s estimates, the federal deficit under the Presidentâ€™s budget would increase from $896 billion in 2019 to $966 billion (equal to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product, or GDP) in 2020. The cumulative deficit under the Presidentâ€™s policies would total $9.9 trillion over the 2020â€“2029 period, $1.5 trillion less than in CBOâ€™s baseline. (The Administration projects smaller deficits, totaling $7.3 trillion over that period.) Measured relative to the size of the economy, deficits would average 3.8 percent of GDP over the 10-year period, CBO estimates.
H63|The 2019 Long-Term Budget Outlook|If current laws generally remained unchanged, CBO projects, large budget deficits over the next 30 years would drive federal debt held by the public to unprecedented levelsâ€”from 78 percent of gross domestic product in 2019 to 144 percent by 2049. That level of debt would be the highest in the nationâ€™s history by far, and it would be on track to increase even more.
H63|An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 2019 to 2029|CBO estimates that the federal budget deficit for 2019 will be $960 billion. Under current law, budget deficits are projected to average $1.2 trillion a year between 2020 and 2029, boosting debt held by the public to 95 percent of GDP in that yearâ€”its highest level since just after World War II. Economic output is projected to grow by 2.3 percent in 2019, supporting strong labor market conditions that feature low unemployment and rising wages. After 2019, in CBOâ€™s projections, economic growth averages 1.8 percent per year, which is less than the historical average.
H63|Creating a Euro Area Safe Asset without Mutualizing Risk (Much)|This paper explains and evaluates three proposals to create “safe assets” for the euro area based on sovereign bonds, in which sovereign risk is limited through diversification and some form of seniority. These assets would be held by banks and other financial institutions, replacing concentrated exposures to their own sovereigns. The paper focuses on three ideas: (1) to create multitranche “sovereign bond-backed securities” (SBBS), of which the senior tranche would constitute a safe asset; (2) to create a senior, publicly owned financial intermediary that would issue a bond backed by a diversified portfolio of sovereign loans (“E-bonds”); and (3) to issue sovereign bonds in several tranches and induce banks to hold a diversified pool of senior sovereign bonds (“multitranche national bond issuance”). Public attention (including public criticism) has so far focused on the first idea; the other two have not yet been seriously debated. We find that none of the competing proposals entirely dominates the others. SBBS do not deserve most of the criticism to which they have been subjected. At the same time, E-bond and multi-tranche national bond issuance have several interesting features—including inducing fiscal discipline—and warrant further exploration.
H63|Fiscal-Financial Vulnerabilities|The paper analyses the linkages from financial developments to public finances. It maps and discusses the transmission channels to fiscal variables. These channels include asset prices, financing conditions, balance sheets of banks, non-banks and central banks and international linkages. The study argues that the fiscal effects via each and all these channels can be very serious in magnitude and can put the sustainability of public finances at risk. However, there is only limited in–depth analysis of these channels and risks.
H63|How to Handle the Fiscal Crisis in Greece? Empirical Evidence Based on a Survey of Economic Experts|We asked economic experts polled by the CESifo World Economic Survey how to handle the fiscal crisis in Greece in the year 2015. The sample includes about 850 experts from 110 countries. We find systematic differences in experts’ recommendations. Our results suggest that policy advice is related to an expert’s personal and country-level attributes. Country-level characteristics, especially credit default swaps as a measure of fiscal stability, predict views on whether Greece should exit the eurozone. An expert’s educational background, age and professional affiliation predict opinions on the credit programs of the International Monetary Fund. We propose that policymakers who seek balanced policy advice should consult experts from different countries and personal backgrounds.
H63|The Effects of Macroeconomic, Fiscal and Monetary Policy Announcements on Sovereign Bond Spreads: An Event Study from the EMU|We assess the impact of announcements corresponding to different fiscal and monetary policy measures on the 10-year sovereign bond yield spreads (relative to Germany) of the 10 EMU countries during the period 01:1999 - 07:2016. Implementing pooled and country-fixed effects OLS regressions, we find that the European Commission’s (EC) releases of the excessive deficit procedure significantly affect the yield spreads. The EC releases of higher debt and better budget balance forecasts contribute to the rise and the decline of spreads, respectively. Moreover, we find that the announcements of the ECB’s key interest rates together with the longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) and the first covered bond purchase programme (CBPP1) negatively affect sovereign yield spreads in our sample of EMU countries.

H63|Sovereign debt: election concerns and the democratic disadvantage|We re-examine the concept of ‘democratic advantage’ in sovereign debt ratings when optimal repayment policies are time-inconsistent. If democratically elected politicians are unable to make credible commitments, then default rates are inefficiently high, so democracy potentially confers a credit market disadvantage. Institutions that are shielded from political pressure may ameliorate the disadvantage by adopting a more farsighted perspective. Using a numerical measure of institutional farsightedness obtained from the Global Insight Business Risk and Conditions database, we find that the observed relationship between credit ratings and democratic status is strongly conditional on farsightedness. With myopic institutions, democracy is associated with worsened credit ratings on average by about three investment grades. With farsighted institutions there is, if anything, a democratic advantage.
H63|The design of a sovereign debt restructuring mechanism for the euro area: Choices and trade-offs|This paper critically assesses several dimensions of a sovereign debt restructuring mechanism (SDRM) for the euro area. The novelty of our analysis is that we abstain from recommending one ideal model for a restructuring mechanism. Instead, we apply a menu-type approach. For five key institutional SDRM dimensions, we discuss the underlying fundamental trade-offs and discuss the pros and cons of different design choices. Specifically, we investigate the following SDRM dimensions: (i) the institutional assignments of responsibilities, (ii) the condition or decision rule that triggers a debt restructuring, (iii) the design and size of debt restructuring, (iv) the role and details of collective action clauses (CACs), and (v) the safeguards for financial stability in support for a SDRM. We conclude that there is no such thing as the single optimal SDRM. Design decisions require judgements on the underlying trade-offs and related assumptions on relative costs. Also, the search for an appropriate euro area SDRM design can benefit from complementarities. Ambition in one dimension can offer more degrees of freedom in another dimension. Our analysis implies that there is no convincing reason to further taboo the search for a euro area SDRM, as there are ways to combine the opportunities of a credible SDRM with financial stability.
H63|When Governments Promise to Prioritize Public Debt: Do Markets Care?|During the European sovereign debt crisis of 2011-13, some nations faced with rising borrowing costs adopted commitments to treat bondholders as priority claimants. That is, if there was a shortage of funds, bondholders would be paid first. In this article, we analyze the prevalence and variety of these types of commitments and ask whether they impact borrowing costs. We examine a widely-touted reform at the height of the Euro sovereign debt crisis in 2011, in which Spain enshrined in its constitution a strong commitment to give absolute priority to public debt claimants. We find no evidence that this reform had any impact on Spanish sovereign bond yields. By contrast, our examination of the U.S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico suggests that constitutional priority promises can have an impact, at least where the borrower government is subject to supervening law and legal institutions.
H63|The Motives to Borrow|Governments issue debt for good and bad reasons. While the good reasons—intertemporal tax-smoothing, fiscal stimulus, and asset management—can explain some of the increases in public debt in recent years, they cannot account for all of the observed changes. Bad reasons for borrowing are driven by political failures associated with intergenerational transfers, strategic manipulation, and common pool problems. These political failures are a major cause of overborrowing though budgetary institutions and fiscal rules can play a role in mitigating governments’ tendencies to overborrow. While it is difficult to establish a clear causal link from high public debt to low output growth, it is likely that some countries pay a price—in terms of lower growth and greater output volatility—for excessive debt accumulation.
H63|China's overseas lending|"Compared with China's dominance in world trade, its expanding role in global finance is poorly documented and understood. Over the past decades, China has exported record amounts of capital to the rest of the world. Many of these financial flows are not reported to the IMF, the BIS or the World Bank. ""Hidden debts"" to China are especially significant for about three dozen developing countries, and distort the risk assessment in both policy surveillance and the market pricing of sovereign debt. We establish the size, destination, and characteristics of China's overseas lending. We identify three key distinguishing features.First, almost all of China's lending and investment abroad is official. As a result, the standard ""push"" and ""pull"" drivers of private cross-border flows do not play the same role in this case. Second, the documentation of China's capital exports is (at best) opaque. China does not report on its official lending and there is no comprehensive standardized data on Chinese overseas debt stocks and flows. Third, the type of flows is tailored by recipient. Advanced and higher middle-income countries tend to receive portfolio debt flows, via sovereign bond purchases of the People's Bank of China. Lower income developing economies mostly receive direct loans from China's state-owned banks, often at market rates and backed by collateral such as oil. Our new dataset covers a total of 1,974 Chinese loans and 2,947 Chinese grants to 152 countries from 1949 to 2017. We find that about one half of China's overseas loans to the developing world are ""hidden""."
H63|Public Debt Sustainability|Why can Japan sustain debts above 200 percent of GDP, while Ukraine defaulted on its debt when it was 30 percent of GDP? Answering that question is challenging. First, debt sustainability does not easily translate into operational concepts and indicators. Second, servicing the debt is a strategic decision, the result of a cost-benefit analysis. Thus markets can always, for good or bad reasons, question governments' commitment to face their financial obligations. Third, uncertainty around public debt developments is large and difficult to model. Fourth, not all debts are born equal, as the currency composition, maturity structure, type of creditor and ownership of the debt affect exposure to rollover and liquidity risks. The paper surveys the knowns and unknowns of debt sustainability, including the tools helping us to understand vulnerabilities and to inform our judgment. Instead of embarking on the impossible mission to build a holistic, consistent and broadly-accepted debt-sustainability framework for practitioners, we take the more modest approach to review some of the key economic principles and statistical methods that form today's leading practice in debt sustainability assessments.
H63|Helicopter Drops of Money under Secular Stagnation|What are the effects of helicopter drops of money under secular stagnation? This paper shows that, if the government cannot sustain a Ponzi debt scheme under full employment, then helicopter drops of money cannot transfer real wealth to households under secular stagnation. In that case, despite being in a permanent liquidity trap, a one-off helicopter drop triggers an upward jump in the price level, without any real effect on the economy. Conversely, if a Ponzi scheme can be sustained, then the helicopter drop can stimulate aggregate demand by raising household wealth. If the stagnation real interest rate is larger than the economic growth rate, the economy converges to full employment and a sustainable Ponzi scheme and, otherwise, it gradually reverts back to stagnation. Finally, continuous helicopter drops of money under stagnation must induce the economy to reach a full employment steady state, with or without a Ponzi scheme.
H63|The Preference for Net Wealth|This paper provides a definition of the preference for wealth such that households do not su¤er from any wealth illusion from the ownership of government bonds. People understand that public indebtedness will translate into future taxes. Each household is therefore assumed to own a share government liabilities equal to the future taxes that these liabilities will cause. A household's net wealth is defined as the sum its private wealth and of its own share of public liabilities. The preference for net wealth ensures that the Ricardian equivalence holds. The endogeneity of the ownership share through distortionary taxes is carefully investigated.
H63|Fiscal multipliers and foreign holdings of public debt|This paper explores a natural connection between fiscal multipliers and foreign holdings of public debt. Although fiscal expansions can raise domestic economic activity through various channels, they can also have crowding-out effects if the resources used to acquire public debt reduce domestic consumption and investment. Thus, these crowding-out effects are likely to be weaker when public debt is purchased by foreigners. We test this hypothesis on (i) post-war US data and (ii) data for a panel of 17 advanced economies from the 1980’s to the present. To do so, we assemble a novel database of public debt holdings by domestic and foreign creditors for a large set of advanced economies. We combine this data with standard measures of fiscal policy shocks and show that, indeed, the size of fiscal multipliers is increasing in the share of public debt held by foreigners. In particular, the fiscal multiplier is smaller than one when the foreign share is low, such as in the U.S. in the 1950’s and 1960’s and Japan today, and larger than one when the foreign share is high, such as in the U.S. and Ireland today
H63|Public Spending in an OLG Economy with Endogenous Technological Change - Financing Matters -|This paper introduces a government in an overlapping generations economy where long-run growth is the result of purposeful investments in a research sector that creates new technological knowledge. The government provides a subsidy to the re- search sector and pays for its spending by raising taxes and/or issuing debt. A debt- financed research subsidy cannot lead to a higher long-run growth rate than the one obtained in a competitive equilibrium of an otherwise equivalent economy without government. Instead, we show that paying for the subsidy entirely by raising taxes is advantageous from a long-run growth perspective. However, our analysis indicates that neither financing scenario is Pareto-improving as the initially old generation always suffers a welfare loss.
H63|The Monetary and Fiscal History of Bolivia, 1960-2017|After the economic reforms that followed the National Revolution of the 1950s, Bolivia seemed positioned for sustained growth. Indeed, it achieved unprecedented growth from 1960 to 1977. Mistakes in economic policies, especially the rapid accumulation of debt due to persistent deficits and a fixed exchange rate policy during the 1970s, led to a debt crisis that began in 1977. From 1977 to 1986, Bolivia lost almost all the gains in GDP per capita that it had achieved since 1960. In 1986, Bolivia started to grow again, interrupted only by the financial crisis of 1998–2002, which was the result of a drop in the availability of external financing. Bolivia has grown since 2002, but government policies since 2006 are reminiscent of the policies of the 1970s that led to the debt crisis, in particular, the accumulation of external debt and the drop in international reserves due to a de facto fixed exchange rate since 2012.
H63|The Value of Government Debt|The market value of government debt equals the present discounted value of primary surpluses. Applying present value decompositions from asset pricing to this valuation equation, I find that half of the variation in the market value of debt to GDP ratio corresponds to varying forecasts of future primary surpluses, and half to varying discount rates. Variation in expected growth rates is unimportant.
H63|Transition finance country study of Lebanon: Global public goods and the response to adverse shocks|This study investigates transition finance in Lebanon, an upper middle-income country in the MENA region transitioning from a significant adverse shock. Lebanon’s development path has been historically non-linear and, most recently, the Syrian conflict adversely affected the country’s development path. The Syrian conflict compounded pre-existing deficits and challenges in Lebanon, calling for increased international assistance.DAC donors increased official development assistance (ODA) to Lebanon to preserve stability and promote refugee protection. Donors also created special financing instruments such as the Global Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF) to foster the provision of multilateral concessional financing to Lebanon. Official development finance in Lebanon is high in comparison to its peers, particularly on a per capita basis and for humanitarian assistance. The country also attracts high amounts of FDI and remittances. Overall, domestic credit dominates the financing landscape and public debt is high.DAC members and other donors can strengthen the humanitarian-development-peace nexus, address long-standing country needs to promote self-sufficiency, and re-design partnerships driven by mutual accountability and appropriate incentive structures.
H63|Intergenerational Conflict Over Consumption Tax Hike: Evidence from Japan|This paper analyzes the determinants of voter preferences on consumption tax hike using an opinion survey of Japanese citizens. We find robust evidence that the older voter is more likely to support consumption tax hike. We also find that the most of inter-generational difference toward consumption tax policy is explained by the gap between citizens under sixty and over sixty. We investigate how individual economic environment changes in 60 years old as a result of mandatory retirement system and pension system and find that the hours of work do not change but their degree of dependence on the pension in household income increases at the age of 60. Utilizing these facts, we conjecture that individuals may realize the importance of consumption tax in order to save the value of their assets.
H63|Dette Publique Extérieure Et Croissance Économique En République Démocratique Du Congo (Rdc)<BR>[External Public Debt And Economic Growth In The Democratic Republic Of Congo (Drc)]|The purpose of this article is to determine the effect of external public debt on the economic growth of the Democratic Republic of Congo. To achieve this objective, we used the error-correction model (Engle and Granger, 1987), estimated by the Least Squares method over a period from 1981 to 2015. The results indicate a nonlinear relationship between external public debt and economic growth, as well as an optimal threshold of 22.5 % of GDP. The external public debt has a positive effect on the economic growth of the DRC for any debt below this threshold. Therefore, to sustainably promote economic growth in the DRC, the management of external public debt will need to focus on good governance.
H63|Asset Liquidity and Fiscal Consolidation Programs|We argue that the relationship between wealth inequality and fiscal multipliers depends crucially on the type of fiscal experiment used as well as on the measure of the wealth distribution. We calibrate an incomplete-markets, overlapping generations model to different European economies and use Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) data to compare fiscal multipliers when models are calibrated to match the distribution of liquid vs. net wealth. We find a negative relationship between fiscal multipliers and wealth inequality when considering fiscal consolidation programs, in contrast to fiscal expansions experiments which are standard in the literature. The underlying mechanism relies on the relationship between the distribution of wealth and the share of credit constrained agents. We examine the role of households’ balance sheet compositions regarding asset liquidity and find that when calibrating the model to match liquid wealth, the relationship between wealth inequality and fiscal multipliers is much stronger.
H63|Political Economy of Taxation, Debt Ceilings, and Growth|This study presents an overlapping-generations model with physical and human capital accumulation and considers probabilistic voting over capital and labor taxes and public debt to finance public education expenditure. Our analysis shows that the greater political power of the old induces the government to raise the labor tax on the young and lower the capital tax on the old as well as issue debt. The analysis also shows that the introduction of a debt ceiling rule calls for a rise in the labor tax and thus lowers the welfare of the currently working generation. However, it increases the growth rate, and this growth effect raises the welfare of future generations. These benefits last for a long period even if the rule is imposed only for a limited time.
H63|A European safe asset to complement national government bonds|This paper expands the growing literature on common safe assets in the context of the euro area financial system by employing credit risk simulation techniques to investigate the properties of different safe asset models and their impact on national bond markets. The paper explores in particular the E-bonds model, whereby a supranational institution would raise funds in the markets and provide bilateral senior loans to Member States corresponding to a fixed proportion of GDP, complementing the issuance of national government bonds, without risks of mutualisation. The main findings are that E-bonds could reach a volume of 15 to 30% of euro area GDP with a high degree of safety while becoming the reference safe asset for the banking sector, capital markets and monetary policy operations in the euro area. As regards the impact on remaining national bonds, such volumes would be consistent with Germany maintaining its top credit rating. The average funding costs of Member States would remain broadly stable, while marginal funding costs would tend to experience limited increases, which should enhance market discipline.
H63|Is Inflation Fiscally Determined?|This paper examines the relationship between fiscal variables and inflation for 46 countries from 1960–2017 using a linear identity that links inflation to fiscal and monetary variables and economic growth. The results indicate that inflation is affected by both monetary and fiscal policies. However, the relation between inflation and fiscal variables disappears when monetary policy is based on commitment strategies. We conclude that fiscal determinacy of inflation is only possible when central banks practice poorly structured discretion.
H63|Public Debt and Economic Growth nexus: A Dynamic Panel ARDL approach|The impact of public debt on economic growth has been a pertinent topic over the last decade following the ﬁnancial and global economic crisis. This empirical study examines the debt and growth nexus for a panel of 25 European Union member states over the 1996-2017 period. A panel autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) is used to analyse the impact of debt on growth. This framework helps in determining both the long and short-run impact of debt on growth. This mitigates some limitations of previous empirical literature that explains either the short- or long-run effect. The full panel ARDL estimation illustrates a negative relationship between debt and growth both over the long and short-term. The debt and growth nexus, although of different magnitudes, is also negative across high and low levels of debt and across different time periods. Finally, a Dumitrescu Hurlin panel causality test is carried out to establish the causal direction between debt and growth. Evidence of bidirectional causality is detected for the full panel of countries. However, the direction of causality varies between countries with high and low average debt-to-GDP ratio.
H63|Local Currency Bond Risk Premia of Emerging Markets: The Role of Local and Global Factors|This paper investigates the sources of variation in emerging market (EM) local currency bond risk premium. Empirical results suggest that both global and local factors contain valuable information in explaining the local currency bond excess returns. We show that economic policy uncertainty causes the excess bond returns to increase while positive innovations in the term spread, CP factor and implied FX volatility have downward impacts on the excess returns. Besides, the high level of spillover from developed markets to EMs may confine the diversification benefits from holding EM local currency bonds.
H63|Sovereign exposures in the Portuguese banking system: evidence from an original dataset|We present an original dataset on exposures of banks operating in Portugal to the domestic public sector, and document the main dynamics of those exposures against the broader backdrop of public sector indebtedness and financing needs. Built from granular information, our dataset takes account of both bond holdings and loans, and ensures comprehensive coverage of both the banking system and public sector entities, either classified inside or outside general government. Domestic banks, unlike those mostly owned by foreigners, played a key role in financing public sector entities in the most acute stages of the sovereign debt crisis, when access to international capital markets was virtually lost. We present evidence of this role in the cases of the Treasury and of state-owned enterprises.
H63|Economic consequences of high public debt and challenges ahead for the euro area|The aim of this paper is to reflect on the economic consequences of high public debt and the challenges ahead for the euro area. The paper reviews the economic risks associated with regimes of high public debt through DSGE model simulations and stresses the need for comprehensive solutions to mitigate such risks in the future. While the large public debt build-up following the global financial and economic crisis acted as a shock absorber for output, keeping public debt at high levels is a source of vulnerability in itself, particularly given the arising fiscal and economic pressures from ageing. Moreover, in the euro area, where monetary policy focuses on the area-wide aggregate, countries with high levels of indebtedness are poorly equipped to withstand asymmetric shocks. Looking at the historical evidence, the paper reviews the menu of tools at hand for euro area governments to further reduce their debt ratios. It posits that the urgency of efforts in this respect depends on risks to public debt sustainability. In the context of the broader reform agenda on how to strengthen EMU resilience, the paper acts as a reminder that further risk reduction and institutional reform is needed.
H63|Optimal Fiscal Policy without Commitment: Beyond Lucas-Stokey|According to the Lucas-Stokey result, a government can structure its debt maturity to guarantee commitment to optimal fiscal policy by future governments. In this paper, we overturn this conclusion, showing that it does not generally hold in the same model and under the same definition of time-consistency as in Lucas-Stokey. Our argument rests on the existence of an overlooked commitment problem that cannot be remedied with debt maturity: a government in the future will not tax on the downward slopping side of the Laffer curve, even if it is ex-ante optimal to do so. In light of this finding, we propose a new framework to characterize time-consistent policy. We consider a Markov Perfect Competitive Equilibrium, where a government reoptimizes sequentially and may deviate from the optimal commitment policy. We find that, in a deterministic economy, any stationary distribution of debt maturity must be flat, with the government owing the same amount at all future dates.
H63|Relationship Networks in Banking Around a Sovereign Default and Currency Crisis|We study how banks' exposure to a sovereign default and a sharp currency devaluation gets transmitted onto the corporate non-financial sector. To do so we use a proprietary data set for the universe of banks and firms in Argentina during the crisis of 2001. We proceed in three steps. First, we exploit the variation in the data at the bank-level to show that there is a negative correlation between banks' pre-crisis exposure to sovereign debt and foreign currency liabilities and their post-crisis lending. Second, we build a model characterized by matching frictions in which firms establish (long-term) relationships with banks that are subject to balance sheet disruptions and derive a set of testable implications. Credit relationships with banks more exposed to the crisis suffer the most (independent of the state of the borrower). However, this relationship level effect might overstate the true cost of the crisis. After the shock, firms with investment opportunities (e.g. exporters after a devaluation) might find profitable to switch lenders, reducing the negative impact on overall credit and activity. Finally, we use linked bank-firm data and data aggregated to the firm level to test the predictions of the model. We find evidence largely consistent with our theory.
H63|Fiscal reaction functions for the advanced economies revisited|We revisit the evidence on the relationship between the Primary Balances/GDP and Debt/GDP ratios (Fiscal Reaction Function, FRF), in the advanced economies, showing that taking carefully into account the stochastic properties of the data leads to question the validity of the current consensus. More precisely, we find that before the 2008 financial crisis long-run FRF's existed only in a small number of advanced economies, and that they were more likely in countries characterized by higher sovereign spreads. Finally, we also find limited evidence of non-linearities leading to fiscal fatigue.
H63|The Economic and Monetary Union: Past, Present and Future|Twenty years of euro history confirms the euro’s stability and position as the second global currency. It also enjoys the support of majority of the euro area population and is seen as a good thing for the European Union. The European Central Bank has been successful in keeping inflation at a low level. However, the European debt and financial crisis in the 2010s created a need for deep institutional reform and this task remains unfinished.
H63|Problems of State Debt Management in Georgia|One of the topical problems of modernity is the investigation of the reasons, which had caused origin of the state debt, its assessment criteria and indicators. The article has investigated reasons causing both the permanent growth of domestic and external debts of developing and post socialist countries and their debt crisis. The article analyzes economic, social and political developments resulting the permanent growth of domestic and external debt in developing and post socialist countries.There are set out conclusions for regulation of financial, foreign exchange, foreign and trade relations. The article suggests concrete efforts aimed to overcome debt crisis. For this reason we suggest to use universal recognized methods and mechanisms, which will support to overcome the debt crisis.
H63|Floating-rate bonds and monetary policy effectiveness: insights from a DSGE model|In Brazil, there exists a government bond whose return is directly indexed to short-term interest rate set by the Central Bank. Some economists suggest that its existence decreases the effectiveness of monetary policy, mainly by clogging the wealth transmission channel. We introduce a floating-rate bond as a new financial asset in a canonical DSGE model and analyze its effects on the model dynamics. The new bond does not seem to change the dynamics of any variable, even in the presence of rule-of-thumb agents. We interpret these results as evidence against the argument that floating-rate bonds lead to a weaker monetary policy.
H63|What drives sovereign debt portfolios of banks in a crisis context?|We study determinants of sovereign portfolios of Spanish banks over a long time-span, starting in 2008. Our findings challenge the view that banks engaged in moral hazard strategies to exploit the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures. In particular, we show that being a weakly capitalized bank is not related to higher holdings of domestic sovereign debt. While a strong link is present between central bank liquidity support and sovereign holdings, opportunistic strategies or reach-for-yield behavior appear to be limited to the non-domestic sovereign portfolio of well-capitalized banks, which might have taken advantage of their higher risk-bearing capacity to gain exposure (via central bank liquidity) to the set of riskier sovereign bonds. Furthermore, we document that financial fragmentation in EMU markets has played a key role in reshaping sovereign portfolios of banks. Overall, our results have important implications for the ongoing discussion on the optimal design of the risk-weighted capital framework of banks.
H63|Optimal Taxation and Debt Management without Commitment|This paper considers optimal fiscal policy in a deterministic Lucas and Stokey (1983) economy in the absence of government commitment. In every period, the government chooses a labor income tax and issues any unconstrained maturity structure of debt as a function of its outstanding debt portfolio. We find that the solution under commitment cannot always be sustained through the appropriate choice of debt maturities, a result which contrasts with previous conclusions in the literature. This is because a government today cannot commit future governments to a particular side of the Laffer curve, even if it can commit them to future revenues. We find that the unique stable debt maturity structure under no commitment is at, with the government owing the same amount of resources to the private sector at all future dates. We present examples in which the maturity structure converges to such a at distribution over time. In cases where the commitment and no-commitment solutions do not coincide, debt converges to the natural debt limit.
H63|Sovereign Debt Restructurings: Delays in Renegotiations and Risk Averse Creditors|Foreign creditors' business cycles influence both the process and the outcome of sovereign debt restructurings. We compile two datasets on creditor committees and chairs and on creditor business and financial cycles at the restructurings, and find that when creditors experience high GDP growth, restructurings are delayed and settled with smaller haircuts. To rationalize these stylized facts, we develop a theoretical model of sovereign debt with multi-round renegotiations between a risk averse sovereign debtor and a risk averse creditor. The quantitative analysis of the model shows that high creditor income results in both longer delays in renegotiations and smaller haircuts. Our theoretical predictions are supported by data.
H63|Sovereign Debt Overhang, Expenditure Composition and Debt Restructurings|Sovereigns' public capital influences sovereign debt crises and resolution. We compile a dataset on public expenditure composition around restructurings with private external creditors. We show that during restructurings, public investment (i) experiences severe decline and slow recovery, (ii) differs from public consumption and transfers, (iii) reduces share in public expenditure, and (iv) relates with restructuring delays. We develop a theoretical model of defaultable debt that embeds endogenous public capital accumulation, expenditure composition, production and multi-round debt renegotiations. The model quantitatively shows severe decline and slow recovery in public investment – “sovereign debt overhang” – delay debt settlement. Data support these theoretical predictions.
H63|Re-examining the debt-growth nexus: A grouped fixed-effect approach|This paper uses panel data for 116 countries over the period 1995-2016 to investigate the heterogeneity of the debt-growth nexus across countries and the factors underlying it. In the first step, the grouped fixed effects (GFE) estimator proposed by Bonhomme and Manresa (2015) is used to classify countries into groups, with group membership being endogenously determined. In the second step, a multinomial logit model is used to explore the drivers of the heterogeneity detected, among them the quality of institutions, the composition of debt-funded public expenditure, the relative public and private indebtedness, and the maturity of debt. Finally, the underlying factors explaining the time-varying impact of public debt on growth in the country groups identified is also investigated.
H63|Does the World Bank Move Markets?|This paper examines the impact of World Bank loans on borrowing country equity markets. We exploit a rich dataset with World Bank loan commitments and stock market returns at the monthly level, allowing us to study short run market reactions to news about loan commitments. Given ex ante uncertainty over the influx of resources, we expect a positive overall response to loan size in terms of the local stock market returns. To address potential endogeneity, we use a supply-push instrument based on countries' historic budget shares and the overall World Bank budget. Estimation results point to a sizable positive short run impact of World Bank loan commitments on local markets that may reduce the cost of capital for local entrepreneurs.

H63|China's Overseas Lending|"Compared with China's dominance in world trade, its expanding role in global finance is poorly documented and understood. Over the past decades, China has exported record amounts of capital to the rest of the world. Many of these financial flows are not reported to the IMF, the BIS or the World Bank. ""Hidden debts"" to China are especially significant for about three dozen developing countries, and distort the risk assessment in both policy surveillance and the market pricing of sovereign debt. We establish the size, destination, and characteristics of China's overseas lending. We identify three key distinguishing features. First, almost all of China's lending and investment abroad is official. As a result, the standard ""push"" and ""pull"" drivers of private cross-border flows do not play the same role in this case. Second, the documentation of China's capital exports is (at best) opaque. China does not report on its official lending and there is no comprehensive standardized data on Chinese overseas debt stocks and flows. Third, the type of flows is tailored by recipient. Advanced and higher middle-income countries tend to receive portfolio debt flows, via sovereign bond purchases of the People's Bank of China. Lower income developing economies mostly receive direct loans from China's state-owned banks, often at market rates and backed by collateral such as oil. Our new dataset covers a total of 1,974 Chinese loans and 2,947 Chinese grants to 152 countries from 1949 to 2017. We find that about one half of China's overseas loans to the developing world are ""hidden""."
H63|Fiscal policy and fiscal fragility: Empirical evidence from the OECD|In this paper, we use local projections to investigate the impact of consolidation shocks on GDP growth, conditional on the fragility of government finances. Based on a database of fiscal plans in OECD countries, we show that spending shocks are less detrimental than tax-based consolidation. In times of fiscal fragility, our results indicate strongly that governments should consolidate through surprise policy changes rather than announcements of consolidation at a later horizon.
H63|10 Jahre Schuldenbremse: Ein Konzept mit Zukunft?|"Aus historischer Perspektive war die Einführung der Schuldenbremse vor 10 Jahren begründet worden. Im Vergleich zu Anfang der 60er Jahre hatte sich die Schuldenstandquote trotz Konso-lidierungsbemühungen unaufhaltsam von rund 20 auf 80 Prozent mehr als vervierfacht. Zudem war aufgrund eines Zinses für Staatsanleihen oberhalb der Zuwachsrate des Bruttoinlandspro-dukts anzunehmen, dass öffentliche Kreditfinanzierung eine intergenerative Umverteilung zu-lasten künftiger Generationen zur Folge hatte. Auf den ersten Blick scheint diese Art der finanziellen Selbstbindung erfolgreich zu sein, denn die Schuldenstandquote näherte sich in den vergangenen Jahren der Maastricht-Grenze von 60 Prozent an. Ob die Schuldenbremse durch verstärkte Konsolidierungsbemühungen tatsächlich dazu beigetragen hat, ist jedoch fraglich, denn die Staatskonsumquote ist heute auf gleichem Niveau wie zu ihrer Einführung. Vielmehr erscheinen die sinkende Zinsenlast, ein Anstieg des realen Steueraufkommens je Einwohner sowie der beachtliche Beschäftigungsaufbau der letz-ten Jahre für fiskalische Spielräume gesorgt zu haben. Mit dem günstigen Zinsumfeld haben sich die Bedingungen für die öffentliche Verschuldung seit der Wirtschafts- und Finanzkrise 2009 grundlegend geändert. Eine intergenerative Umvertei-lung zulasten künftiger Generationen ist deshalb derzeit und absehbar nicht mehr gegeben. An-gesichts eines unübersehbar großen Investitionsbedarfs mindert die Schuldenbremse den poli-tischen Handlungsspielraum und entbehrt einer ökonomischen Grundlage. Im Sinne der ""Gol-denen Regel der Finanzpolitik"" sollte sie daher innovations- und wachstumspolitisch umgesetzt werden. Eine Möglichkeit hierzu bestünde in der Auslagerung kreditfinanzierter gesamtstaatlicher Inves-titionen in einen bundesstaatlichen Vermögenshaushalt. Zudem sollte eine bessere Finanzaus-stattung der Gemeinden den kommunalen Investitionsrückstand adressieren. Außerhalb der In-vestitionsausgaben bliebe es bei der Schuldenbremse, d.h. beim grundsätzlichen Verbot der Kreditfinanzierung mit konjunkturpolitisch symmetrischer Öffnung."
H63|Ein Zukunftsfonds zur Tilgung der kommunalen Kassenkredite in Nordrhein-Westfalen: Handlungsempfehlungen für die Politik|"Die Verschuldung der Kommunen in Nordrhein-Westfalen (NRW) hat in den vergangenen 20 Jahren deutlich zugenommen. Dabei haben sich Bürgermeister und Kämmerer großzügig an Kassenkrediten bedient, die lediglich zur Liquiditätssicherung vorgesehen sind. Der kontinuierliche Anstieg der Kassenkredite zeigt jedoch, dass diese zur allgemeinen Haushaltsfinanzierung eingesetzt werden. Um Städten und Gemeinden wieder mehr Handlungsspielraum zu geben, ist ein Schuldenschnitt in Verbindung mit einer Konsolidierung der Aufwendungen in vielen Fällen erforderlich. Dabei sollten die Kassenkredite im Fokus stehen. Die Überschüsse der öffentlichen Hand bieten die Chance, Altschulden mittels eines ""kommunalen Zukunftsfonds NRW"" zurückzuführen. Für die Konzeptionierung des ""Zukunftsfonds"" kann sich die Politik an vergleichbaren Programmen in Hessen und Niedersachsen orientieren, die ebenfalls bei den Kassenkrediten ansetzen und einen Schuldenschnitt mit einer Haushaltskonsolidierung verknüpfen. Um solide wirtschaftenden Kommunen nicht vor den Kopf zu stoßen, sollte der Schuldenschnitt um eine Investitionsoffensive für Kommunen ohne oder mit nur geringen Kassenkrediten (bis maximal 750 Euro je Einwohner) ergänzt werden, die dafür nicht am Entschuldungsprogramm teilnehmen können. Nach diesen Kriterien nähmen 143 Kommunen in NRW an einem Schuldenschnitt teil, 253 Kommunen würden Investitionszuschüsse erhalten. Je nach Ausgestaltung würde der ""Zukunftsfonds NRW"" Finanzmittel in Höhe von bis zu 25 Milliarden Euro erfordern. Wichtig ist dabei, dass die Kommunen beim Entschuldungsprogramm einen Eigenanteil leisten. Das Land müsste danach rund 18 Milliarden Euro beisteuern. Als Einmalbetrag wirkt dieser Wert aus Landessicht zweifelsfrei hoch, bei einer Streckung auf mehrere Jahre relativiert sich jedoch der Umfang."
H63|Price discovery in Indian government securities market, monetary management and the cost of government borrowing|Over 2017-18 there was a sharp rise in Indian government securities (G-Secs) interest rates unrelated to fundamentals. Examining each of the standard explanatory variables shows them to be inadequate to account for the rise in bond yields in this period. Turning to aspects of Indian structure the reason is found to be the narrow focus of monetary operating procedures, with excessive reliance on making up liquidity shortfalls with short-term liquidity, which was inadequate given large exogenous durable liquidity shocks including foreign inflows. The composition of liquidity, share of reserve money and its sources all matter. Open market operations (OMOs) have a significant impact on yields. Large foreign debt inflows induce OMOs sales as G-Secs are swapped for foreign securities to sterilize the effect of inflows on the money supply. G-Secs yields are then found to rise.

H63|Risk Management for Sovereign Debt Financing with Sustainability Conditions|We develop a model of debt sustainability analysis with optimal financing decisions in the presence of macroeconomic, financial and fiscal uncertainty. We define a coherent measure of refinancing risk, and trade off the risks of debt stock and flow dynamics, subject to debt sustainability constraints and endogenous risk and term premia. We optimize both static and dynamic financing strategies, compare them with several simple rules and consol financing to demonstrate economically significant effects of optimal financing, and show that the stock-flow tradeoff can be critical for sustainability. We quantify the minimum refinancing risk and the maximum rate of debt reduction that a sovereign can achieve given its economic fundamentals, and extend the model to identify optimal timing for debt flow adjustments that allow the sovereign to go beyond these limits. We put the model to the data on three real-world cases: a representative euro zone crisis country, a low-debt country (Netherlands) and a high-debt country (Italy). These applications illustrate the use of the model in informing diverse policy decisions on sustainable public finance. The model is part of the European Stability Mechanism toolkit to assess debt sustainability and repayment capacity of member states in the context of financial assistance.
H63|The Monetary and Fiscal History of Bolivia, 1960–2017|After the economic reforms that followed the National Revolution of the 1950s, Bolivia seemed positioned for sustained growth. Indeed, it achieved unprecedented growth from 1960 to 1977. The rapid accumulation of debt due to persistent deficits and a fixed exchange rate policy during the 1970s led to a debt crisis that began in 1977. From 1977 to 1986, Bolivia lost almost all the gains in GDP per capita that it had achieved since 1960. In 1986, Bolivia started to grow again, interrupted only by the financial crisis of 1998–2002, which was the result of a drop in the availability of external financing. Bolivia has grown since 2002, but government policies since 2006 are reminiscent of the policies of the 1970s that led to the debt crisis, in particular, the accumulation of external debt and the drop in international reserves due to a de facto fixed exchange rate since 2012.
H63|Partial Default|In the data sovereign default is always partial and varies in its duration. Debt levels during default episodes initially increase and do not experience reductions upon resolution. This paper presents a theory of sovereign default that replicates these properties, which are absent in standard sovereign default theory. Partial default is a flexible way to raise funds as the sovereign chooses its intensity and duration. Partial default is also costly because it amplifies debt crises as the defaulted debt accumulates and interest rate spreads increase. This theory is capable of rationalizing the large heterogeneity in partial default, its comovements with spreads, debt levels, and output, and the dynamics of debt during default episodes. In our theory, as in the data, debt grows during default episodes, and large defaults are longer, and associated with higher interest rate spreads, higher debt levels, and deeper recessions.
H63|History Remembered: Optimal Sovereign Default on Domestic and External Debt|Infrequent but turbulent overt sovereign defaults on domestic creditors are a “forgotten history” in Macroeconomics. We propose a heterogeneous-agents model in which the government chooses optimal debt and default on domestic and foreign creditors by balancing distributional incentives v. the social value of debt for self-insurance, liquidity, and risk-sharing. A rich feedback mechanism links debt issuance, the distribution of debt holdings, the default decision, and risk premia. Calibrated to Eurozone data, the model is consistent with key long-run and debt-crisis statistics. Defaults are rare (1.2 percent frequency), and preceded by surging debt and spreads. Debt sells at the risk-free price most of the time, but the government's lack of commitment reduces sustainable debt sharply.
H63|When Governments Promise to Prioritize Public Debt: Do Markets Care?|During the European sovereign debt crisis of 2011-13, some nations faced with rising borrowing costs adopted commitments to treat bondholders as priority claimants. That is, if there was a shortage of funds, bondholders would be paid first. In this article, we analyze the prevalence and variety of these types of commitments and ask whether they impact borrowing costs. We examine a widely-touted reform at the height of the Euro sovereign debt crisis in 2011, in which Spain enshrined in its constitution a strong commitment to give absolute priority to public debt claimants. We find no evidence that this reform had any impact on Spanish sovereign bond yields. By contrast, our examination of the U.S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico suggests that constitutional priority promises can have an impact, at least where the borrower government is subject to supervening law and legal institutions.
H63|Fiscal Austerity in Ambiguous Times|"This paper analyzes optimal fiscal policy with ambiguity aversion and endogenous government spending. We show that, without ambiguity, optimal surplus-to-output ratios are acyclical and that there is no rationale for either reduction or further accumulation of public debt. In contrast, ambiguity about the cycle can generate optimally policies that resemble ""austerity"" measures. Optimal policy prescribes higher taxes in adverse times and front-loaded fiscal consolidations that lead to a balanced primary budget in the long-run. This is the case when interest rates are sufficiently responsive to cyclical shocks, that is, when the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is sufficiently low."
H63|Debt Hangover in the Aftermath of the Great Recession|Following the Great Recession, U.S. government debt levels exceeded 100% of output. We develop a macroeconomic model to evaluate the role of various shocks during and after the Great Recession; labor market shocks have the greatest impact on macroeconomic activity. We then evaluate the consequences of using alternative fiscal policy instruments to implement a fiscal austerity program to return the debt-output ratio to its pre-Great Recession level. Our welfare analysis reveals that there is not much difference between applying fiscal austerity through government spending, the labor income tax, or the consumption tax; using the capital income tax is welfare-reducing.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H63|Episodes of War and Peace in an Estimated Open Economy Model|We analyze the effects of large war episodes (world wars) on the macroeconomic dynamics of four advanced countries (France, Germany, the UK and the U.S.) by means of an estimated open-economy model. The model allows wars to produce specific effects on the economy through capital depreciation, sovereign default and a military draft. These effects, together with large surges in public spending and debt, and significant drops in labor taxes, account for the bulk of fluctuations during wars. We also use our estimations to discuss the size and state-dependence of output multipliers, and the size of welfare losses from fluctuations.
H63|The Monetary and Fiscal History of Brazil, 1960-2016|Brazil has had a long period of high inflation. It peaked around 100 percent per year in 1964, decreased until the first oil shock (1973), but accelerated again afterward, reaching levels above 100 percent on average between 1980 and 1994. This last period coincided with severe balance of payments problems and economic stagnation that followed the external debt crisis in the early 1980s. We show that the high-inflation period (1960–1994) was characterized by a combination of fiscal deficits, passive monetary policy, and constraints on debt financing. The transition to the low-inflation period (1995–2016) was characterized by improvements in all of these features, but it did not lead to significant improvements in economic growth. In addition, we document a strong positive correlation between inflation rates and seigniorage revenues, although inflation rates are relatively high for modest levels of seigniorage revenues. Finally, we discuss the role of the weak institutional framework surrounding the fiscal and monetary authorities and the role of monetary passiveness and inflation indexation in accounting for the unique features of inflation dynamics in Brazil.
H63|Creating a Euro Area Safe Asset without Mutualizing Risk (Much)|"This paper explains and evaluates three proposals to create ""safe assets"" for the euro area based on sovereign bonds, in which sovereign risk is limited through diversification and some form of seniority. These assets would be held by banks and other financial institutions, replacing concentrated exposures to their own sovereigns. The paper focuses on three ideas: (1) to create multitranche ""sovereign bond-backed securities"" (SBBS), of which the senior tranche would constitute a safe asset; (2) to create a senior, publicly owned financial intermediary that would issue a bond backed by a diversified portfolio of sovereign loans (""E-bonds""); and (3) to issue sovereign bonds in several tranches and induce banks to hold a diversified pool of senior sovereign bonds (""multitranche national bond issuance""). Public attention (including public criticism) has so far focused on the first idea; the other two have not yet been seriously debated. We find that none of the competing proposals entirely dominates the others. SBBS do not deserve most of the criticism to which they have been subjected. At the same time, E-bonds and multitranche national bond issuance have several interesting features--including inducing fiscal discipline--and warrant further exploration."
H63|Sovereign Default Triggered by Inability to Repay Debt|The Greek sovereign default episode in 2012 was characterized by its high debt-to-GDP ratio and the severe economic contraction following the default. Conventional strategic default models designed to analyze a government's incentive to default often fail to replicate these characteristics. To address this issue, we provide a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model where a sovereign default is triggered by the government's inability to repay its debt. We show that the inability-to-repay model replicates the empirical features observed in Greece, while the conventional strategic default model calibrated to the Greek economy does not.
H63|The Motives to Borrow|Governments issue debt for good and bad reasons. While the good reasons-intertemporal tax-smoothing, fiscal stimulus, and asset management-can explain some of the increases in public debt in recent years, they cannot account for all of the observed changes. Bad reasons for borrowing are driven by political failures associated with intergenerational transfers, strategic manipulation, and common pool problems. These political failures are a major cause of overborrowing. Budgetary institutions and fiscal rules can play a role in mitigating governments' tendencies to overborrow. While it is difficult to establish a clear causal link from high public debt to low output growth, it is likely that some countries pay a price-in terms of lower growth and greater output volatility-for excessive debt accumulation.

H63|Sraffa, saggio di interesse, sistema fiscale|This paper covers three closely interrelated stages. The first regards Sraffa’s theory. It is argued in particular that: a) Sraffa’s 1925 and 1926 articles are closely linked to Production of Commodities by means of Commodities, inasmuch they state the minimal cost, which informs indirectly the 1960 book; b) minimum costs are linear and parallel to the x axis in competition, so they are independent of the quantity produced; c) any deviation from this situation entails rents; d) rents can derive from decreasing returns (agriculture, mines) or from increasing returns (oligopoly, monopoly). Sraffa’s system solutions are discussed in depth. Particular attention is attached to the determination of the rate of interest. This leads to interconnections with the Keynesian system, which are developed in the second stage. Here the necessity emerges of rendering structural what it now conjunctural, pushing the rate of interest towards zero. This target can be reached by a fiscal instrument, i.e. by levying a tax on gross interest, close to 100%. Thus public debt ceases to be a risk, and the public deficit may increase, as happens in the majority of countries worldwide. The third stage regards the fiscal system. To obtain a similar treatment of interest, and also to try to hit oligopolies effectively, we need to render the fiscal system global. The problem arises with the remaining fiscal structure, now dominated by the principle of a worldwide basis. It is shown that this circumstance has to cease, and that internal revenue must be collected on bases which are exclusively internal. Therefore primarily the direct taxation, and then the indirect, must be reshaped. It is most interesting that a consonance is found with the taxation in vigour up the Seventies, and with De Viti theory of fiscal systems, which is national and based on the benefit principle.
H63|Re-examining the debt-growth nexus: A grouped fixed-effect approach|This paper uses panel data for 116 countries over the period 1995-2016 to investigate the heterogeneity of the debt-growth nexus across countries and the factors underlying it. In the first step, the grouped fixed effects (GFE) estimator proposed by Bonhomme and Manresa (2015) is used to classify countries into groups, with group membership being endogenously determined.

Finally, the underlying factors explaining the time-varying impact of public debt on growth in the country groups identified is also investigated.
H63|"“Increasing contingent guarantees: The asymmetrical effect on sovereign risk of different government interventions"""|Government interventions to support the financial institutions fall into two broad categories: direct interventions (which immediately increase the government's financing need) and off-balance sheet contingent guarantees (which have no immediate impact on debt but will add to government debt as and when a loss materializes). If financial sector losses are independent of sovereign's own risk, all else being equal, they must have the same effect on the sovereign's risk profile, even though they impact the government balance sheet differently. In this paper, we study the nature and effectiveness of a government's interventions on its own risk profile. Our findings suggest that direct assistance has a significantly large effect on sovereign risk, while the effect of contingent guarantees is statistically not significant, being significant only for the euro area founders. Controlling for government interventions, we also find that GDP, perceived government effectiveness, economic sentiment, size of the financial sector, and membership of the euro area reduce the sovereign risk, while asset concentration within financial sector, unemployment and ination have an adverse effect. Our findings support Bresciani and Cossaro (2016)'s claim that during the sovereign debt crisis, governments undertook complex financial operations to change the composition of their interventions towards contingent guarantees.
H63|Demographic Changes in a Small Open Economy with Endogenous Time Allocation and Age-Dependent Mortality|We calibrate an endogenous overlapping generations model of a small open economy to study the effects of population aging and population decline. In an invariant scenario public and foreign debt explode and GDP growth decreases markedly. Among the tested policies to control public nances, the best for the individuals is an increase in the retirement age, which needs to increase 6 years, a similar magnitude as the increase in life expectancy at birth. However, this increase has to happen before the increase in life expectancy materi- alizes itself. Aging has a stronger negative impact on public debt than population decline. We find a positive, but quantitatively modest, behavioral effect in reaction to a higher life expectancy with an impact on the GDP growth rate of only 2 basis points.
H63|The effects of macroeconomic, fiscal and monetary policy announcements on sovereign bond spreads: an event study from the EMU|We assess the impact of announcements corresponding to different fiscal and monetary policy measures on the 10-year sovereign bond yield spreads (relative to Germany) of the 10 EMU countries during the period 01:1999 - 07:2016. Implementing pooled and country-fixed effects OLS regressions, we find that the European Commission’s (EC) releases of the excessive deficit procedure significantly affect the yield spreads. The EC releases of higher debt and better budget balance forecasts contribute to the rise and the decline of spreads, respectively. Moreover, we find that the announcements of the ECB’s key interest rates together with the longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) and the first covered bond purchase programme (CBPP1) negatively affect sovereign yield spreads in our sample of EMU countries.
H63|The Bank-Sovereign Loop and Financial Stability in the Euro Area|We propose a simple model that captures the link between bank and sovereign credit risk. It allows evaluating policy options to address this ‘doom loop’ in which the government may need to raise debt to recapitalise banks, and an increase in government debt raises sovereign risk and in turn generates potential bank losses via their (sovereign) bond holdings. Hence, an initial shock originating either in the banking or sovereign sector is amplified by the feedback relation. We set up a framework based on detailed actual bank balance sheets and test the model on 35 large EU banking groups, across 7 European countries. The effects of the feedback loops in most cases more than double the effect of the initial shock on bank losses and the sovereign risk premium. We show that a single EU bank resolution mechanism, European Stability Mechanism (ESM) direct bank recapitalisations, and bondholder “bail-in” can be effective to dampen the bank-sovereign loop. Addressing the home bias in banks sovereign bond holdings by reducing excessive exposure to domestic sovereigns has only limited benefit in terms of lower crisis doom loop effects as contagion effects increase.
H63|Inflation, Debt, and Default|We show that the co-movement of inflation and domestic consumption growth affects both the pricing and the dynamics of nominal domestic debt. In particular a positive co-movement of inflation and consumption makes returns on government bonds negatively correlated with domestic consumption: this lowers risk premia on nominal domestic debt as seen in the data. However, as this co-movement increases, the debt becomes more risky for the government and reduces its incentives to accumulate debt. We find that debt accumulation is overall stronger the higher the co-movement of inflation and consumption. To assess these joint equilibrium properties of debt and interest rates, we calibrate a simple model of domestic default and nominal debt in the presence of exogenous inflation risk and domestic risk averse agents. Consistent with the data, the model also reveals that increased co-movement of inflation and consumption leads to more volatile interest rates.
H63|Official debt restructurings and development|Despite the frequency of official debt restructurings, little systematic evidence has been produced on their characteristics and implications. Using a dataset covering more than 400 Paris Club agreements, this paper fills that gap. It provides a comprehensive description of the evolving characteristics of these operations and studies their impact on debtors. The progressive introduction of new terms of treatment gradually turned the Paris Club from an institution primarily concerned with preserving creditors’ claims into an instrument to foster development in the world’s poorer nations, among other objectives. Our study finds that more generous restructuring conditions involving nominal relief are associated with an acceleration of per capita GDP growth and with a reduction in poverty and inequality. We also find that countries receiving nominal relief tend to receive lower aid flows subsequently, the opposite being the case for countries receiving high reductions in the net present value of their obligations, but no nominal haircuts.
H63|Selective sovereign defaults|Breaches in intercreditor equity are common ground during sovereign debt restructurings. In this paper I explore residence-based breaches by studying patterns of discrimination between residents and foreign creditors during debt restructurings. I frame the analysis with a simple model of a government's strategic decision to differentiate between the servicing of its domestic and its external debt. In the model, the basic trade-off facing the authorities is to default on external debt and in so doing restricting private access to international capital markets or to default on domestic debt, thereby curtailing the banking sector's capacity to lend. I test the model's conclusions by analyzing 11 recent sovereign restructurings. After distinguishing neutral cases where the sovereign treated creditors equitably and instances of discrimination against residents and foreigners, I present evidence in support of the model. The origin of liquidity pressures, the robustness and depth of the banking system and the extent of the corporate sector's reliance on foreign capital markets vis-a-vis domestic credit markets have the potential to explain the patterns of discrimination observed in the data.
H63|Real Interest Rates, Inflation, and Default|This paper argues that the comovement between inflation and economic activity is an important determinant of real interest rates over time and across countries. First, we show that for advanced economies, periods with more procyclical inflation are associated with lower real rates, but only when there is no risk of default on government debt. Second, we present a model of nominal sovereign debt with domestic risk-averse lenders. With procyclical inflation, nominal bonds pay out more in bad times, making them a good hedge against aggregate risk. In the absence of default risk, procyclical inflation yields lower real rates. However, procyclicality implies that the government needs to make larger (real) payments when the economy deteriorates, which could increase default risk and trigger an increase in real rates. The patterns of real rates predicted by the model are quantitatively consistent with those documented in the data.
H63|Deconstructing delays in sovereign debt restructuring|Negotiations to restructure sovereign debt are time consuming, taking almost a decade on average to resolve. In this paper, we analyse a class of widely used complete information models of delays in sovereign debt restructuring and show that, despite superficial similarities, there are major differences across models in the driving force for equilibrium delay, the circumstances in which delay occurs and the efficiency of the debt restructuring process. We focus on three key assumptions. First, if delay has a permanent effect on economic activity in the defaulting country, equilibrium delay often occurs; this delay can sometimes be socially efficient. Second, prohibiting debt issuance as part of a settlement makes delay less likely to occur in equilibrium. Third, when debt issuance is not fully state contingent, delay can arise because of the risk that the sovereign will default on any debt issued as part of the settlement.
H63|The Hausmann-Gorky Effect|For over a century, legal scholars have debated the question of what to do about the debts incurred by despotic governments; asking whether successor non-despotic governments should have to pay them. That debate has gone nowhere. This paper examines whether an Op Ed written by Harvard economist, Ricardo Hausmann, in May 2017, may have shown an alternative path to the goal of increasing the cost of borrowing for despotic governments. Hausmann, in his Op Ed, had sought to produce a pricing penalty on the entire Venezuelan debt stock by trying to shame JPMorgan into removing Venezuelan bonds from its emerging market index. JPMorgan did not comply, but there was a pricing penalty. Intriguingly, the penalty hit only one bond; an issue by Venezuela’s state-owned oil company that went on the market two days prior to the Hausmann’s piece. That bond then began to carry the name in the market of “Hunger Bond.” Using quantitative data and interviews with investors, we try to understand the causes of the Hunger Bond penalty and ask whether there are lessons for policy makers.
H63|Investment Gaps in IDB Borrowing Countries|TWe estimate public investment gaps in a sample of developing countries using a public investment demand function. We then use GDP per capita projections, forecasts of structural transformation, and three SDG targets (poverty, infant mortality and lower secondary school completion) to predict public investment needs in 2030 among IDB borrowing countries. Our estimates suggest that in 2014 the total public investment gap of IDB borrowers was close to $170 billion (3.1 percent of the Region’s GDP) and that the gap is expected to surpass $717 billion (6.3 percent of the Region’s GDP) by 2030 if the SDGs were to be reached.
H63|Does Public Debt Crowd Out Corporate Investment? International Evidence|Using data for advanced and emerging economies, we show that there is a negative correlation between public debt and corporate investment. Industry-level regressions show that high levels of government debt are particularly damaging for industries that need more external financial resources. Firm-level regressions show that government debt increases the sensitivity of corporate investment to cash flow. These results indicate that the relationship between public debt and investment is likely to be causal and that public debt crowds out corporate investment by tightening credit constraints.
H63|Maduro Bonds|For multiple decades, activists have sought to institute an international legal regime that limits the ability of despotic governments to borrow money and then shift those obligations onto more democratic successor governments. Our goal in this article is to raise the possibility of an alternate legal path to raising the costs of borrowing for despotic regimes. All countries have systems of domestic laws that regulate agency relationships and try to deter corruption; otherwise the domestic economy would not function. Despotic governments, we conjecture, are especially likely to engage in transactions that are legally problematic. The reason being that despotic governments, by definition, lack the support of the populace; meaning that there is a high likelihood that actions that they take on behalf of the populace can be challenged as unrepresentative and contrary to the interests of the true principals. The foregoing conditions, if one translates them into the context of an ordinary principal-agent relationship, would constitute a voidable transaction in most modern legal systems. That means that if opposition parties in countries with despotic governments today were to monitor and make public the potential problems with debt issuances by their despotic rulers under their own local laws, it would raise the cost of capital for those despots. To support our argument, we use both the concrete example of the debt issuance shenanigans of the Maduro government in Venezuela and a more general analysis of the relationship between corruption, democracy and a nation’s borrowing costs.
H63|Rethinking odious debt in the age of predatory lending: Old ideas for new problems|This essay suggests that odious debt needs a restatement to stay relevant in the face of important changes affecting state (i.e. “sovereign”) debt. Today, a major issue affecting creditor-debtor relations in the sovereign sector is the predicament of over-lending. Examples abound of reckless creditors pressuring vulnerable states to borrow for projects they do not need and at conditions they do not fully understand. This development, which recalls the aggressive business tactics used by predatory lenders in consumer lending, has become a ubiquitous problem affecting both developing and developed nations. Yet, this problem remains largely unaccounted for in international law and in the odious debt doctrine in particular. The future of odious debt depends upon a collective endeavor to make the legal doctrine more sensitive to issues of predatory lending. This essay offers insights into the benefits that such efforts may yield on states and their creditors.
H63|Expenditure cascades, low interest Rates, credit deregulation or property booms? Determinants of household debt in OECD countries|The past decades have witnessed a strong increase in household debt and fast growth of private consumption expenditures in many countries. This paper empirically investigates four explanations: First, the expenditure cascades hypothesis argues that an increase in inequality induced lower income groups to copy the spending behaviour of richer peer groups and thereby drove them into debt (‘keeping up with the Joneses’). Second, the housing boom hypothesis argues that increasing property prices encourage household spending and household borrowing due to wealth effects, eased credit constraints, the prospects of future capital gains and changes in mental accounts. Third, the low interest hypothesis argues that low interest rates encouraged households to take on more debt. Fourth, the credit market deregulation hypothesis argues that deregulation boosted credit supply. The paper tests these hypotheses by estimating the determinants of household borrowing using a panel of 13 OECD countries (1980-2011). Results indicate that real estate prices were the most important drivers of household debt which we interpret as the result of speculative dynamics in real estate markets. In contrast we do not find a significant impact of shifts in the income distribution on household sector indebtedness. Our results are consistent with the credit deregulation and low interest rate hypotheses, but their explanatory power for the 1995-2007 period is low.
H63|Does the Federal Constitutional Court Ruling Mean the German Financial Market is Efficient?|Following the landmark ruling by the German Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe on 7th February 2014 in which they endorsed the efficient market hypothesis, we present evidence on the efficiency of the German financial market. Introducing a new variance bound test based on the Component-GARCH model of volatility to analyse the long- and short-runs effects on the efficiency of the German financial market, we test the price volatility of four markets: DAX stock index, German sovereign debt index as provided by Barclays and Bloomberg, Euro gold index by the World Gold Council and Euro currency index by the Bank of England. Our use of the Component-GARCH-T model highlight two key contributions, the first being the analysis of the efficiency of the market in the long and short runs. However, a more important contribution is the result of our variance bound test highlight the relatively strong acceptance of the efficient market hypothesis in both the short and long runs in all the observed financial markets. It must be stated our research is of importance to researches in both applied finance and portfolio management. The influencing question of what moves specific markets is crucial to market participants seeking market alpha for their investments strategies and portfolio optimisations.
H63|Deficit, monetization, and economic growth: a case for multiplicity and indeterminacy|Abstract This paper develops an original analysis of deficit monetization in a growth model with transaction costs, in which economic growth interacts with productive public expenditures. This interaction generates two positive balanced growth paths (BGP) in the long run: a high BGP and a low BGP. The transitional dynamics show that multiplicity cannot be rejected if transaction costs affect both consumption and investment expenditures, with possible indeterminacy of the high BGP. Importantly, deficit monetization is shown to reduce the parameter space producing indeterminacy.
H63|Can Risk Models Extract Inflation Expectations from Financial Market Data? Evidence from the Inflation Protected Securities of Six Countries|We consider an arbitrage strategy which exactly replicates the cash of of a sovereign inflation-indexed bond using infation swaps and nominal sovereign bonds. The strategy reveals a violation of the law of one price in the G7 countries which is largest for the eurozone. Testing the strategy's exposure to deflation, volatility, liquidity, economic and policy risks suggests that the observed pricing differential is an economic tail risk premium which is more pronounced in the eurozone. We conclude that ination expec- tations implied by models that view this pricing differential as compensation for risk are likely to be accurate and useful for policy-making.
H63|Regulation and government debt|Abstract Government debt is large in most developed countries, and while budget deficits may reflect short-term attempts to kick-start the economy in times of crisis by means of fiscal stimulus, the longer-term consequences may be detrimental to investment and growth. Those negative consequences make it important to identify factors that are associated with public debt. While previous studies have related government debt to economic and political variables, they have not incorporated the degree to which the economy is regulated. Using a measure of regulatory freedom (absence of detailed regulation of labor, business and credit) from the Economic Freedom of the World index, we conduct an empirical analysis covering up to 67 countries during the period 1975–2010. The main finding is that regulatory freedom, especially with respect to credit availability, reduces debt accumulation. The effect is more pronounced when the political system is fractionalized and characterized by strong veto players, indicating policy stability and credibility, and when governments have right-wing ideologies.
H63|Managing a Century of Debt|This paper provides a consistent series for the Irish national debt since the foundation of the state. It also provides a continuous series for bond yields over the same period. The paper examines the factors behind the fluctuations in the debt burden over almost a century. The management of the debt burden by the Irish authorities has evolved over time, seeking to minimise both the burden on the economy and the risks which the debt represented to the state. The paper also examines how the cost of borrowing for the Irish government compared to that for the UK and, since the break with sterling, for Germany. This cost of borrowing was, in turn affected by developments in the domestic economy.
H63|Will China Collapse: A Review, Assessment And Outlook|Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, China's economic and political stabilities have been repeatedly called into question. In this paper, we review long-lasting debates as to whether or not China will collapse and explain why we believe China is not going to collapse economically or politically. Our main argument is that Chinese authorities have applied a gradual anti-crisis approach to reform since 1978. This approach means that the Chinese government has both pursued modest reform measures and reacted quickly to internal and external shocks. Structurally speaking, the party and Chinese central government's control over social resources represents an implicit guarantee against potential collapses. This paper then studies current risks of a sudden growth collapse in the form of a debt crisis, a housing bubble bust, and political disintegration, and lays forth why these events are not likely to happen and spark a major Chinese collapse in the near future. We also identify new instabilities in China's economic and political system and discuss how the current gradual anti-crisis approach to reform can be upgraded to deal with these problems.
H63|Growth-indexed Bonds and Debt Distribution: Theoretical Benefits and Practical Limits|Sovereign state-contingent bonds, in particular growth-indexed bonds (GIBs), have rarely been issued in practice despite their theoretical benefits. This paper provides support for this apparent sovereign noncontingency puzzle by deriving the impact of GIBs on the upper tail of the distribution of the public debt-to-GDP ratio. Although this impact varies importantly across countries and indexation formulas, empirical estimates show there is almost no reduction in the upper tail of the distribution under the realistic assumption that GIBs only represent 20 percent of the stock of debt. Moreover, a sustained premium of 100 basis points would actually increase the upper tail of the distribution for most countries.
H63|Does sovereign risk in local and foreign currency differ?|Historically, sovereign debt in local currency has been considered safer than debt in foreign currency. Yet the literature offers scant theoretical or empirical guidance as to why such a gap exists, or why it appears to have slowly and steadily diminished for all regions over the past two decades, as expressed in the ratings widely used by global investors and regulators to assess credit risk. We suggest and empirically test five hypotheses. We find that differences in inflation do not explain the assessed gaps between local and foreign currency credit risk. The banking sector's vulnerability to sovereign debt problems is a significant determinant of the spread, but does not account for its decline over time. Instead, the surge in global reserves, and to lesser extent the reduced reliance on overseas foreign currency borrowing (ie the decline of original sin), as well as lower global volatility, appear to have lessened the gap. But if these variables were to go into reverse, the gap could again widen.
H63|Debt Seniority and Sovereign Debt Crises|Is the seniority structure of sovereign debt neutral for a government's decision between defaulting and raising surpluses? In this paper, we address this question using a model of debt crises where a discretionary government endogenously chooses distortionary taxation and whether to apply an optimal haircut to bondholders. We show that when the size of senior tranches is small, a version of the Modigliani-Miller theorem holds: tranching just redistributes government revenues from junior to senior bondholders, while taxes and government borrowing costs remain unchanged. However, as senior tranches become sufficiently large, default costs on senior debt transpire into a stronger commitment to repay not only the senior tranche, but also the junior one. We show that there is a lower threshold for senior bonds above which tranching can eliminate default on both junior and senior debt, and an upper threshold beyond which the government defaults also on senior debt.
H63|On international integration of emerging sovereign bond markets|The paper investigates the international integration of EM sovereign dollar-denominated and local-currency bond markets. Factor analysis is used to examine movements in bond yields and common sources of variation. Results suggest that EM dollar-denominated debt markets are highly integrated; one common factor, highly correlated with US and EU interest rates, explains 80% of the total variability in yields. Local currency bond markets are not as internationally integrated, and three common factors explain 74% of total variability. But a global interest rates factor still explains 63% of the yield variation accounted for by common factors. Heterogeneity among EMs is explored.
H63|Impact of public and private sector external debt on economic growth|We assess the effect of the Portuguese external debt of the private and public sectors on economic growth for the period 1999-2014. We study the channels through which external debt may affect economic growth: demand, supply and external accounts.Regarding aggregate demand, we evaluated private saving, public investment in volume and real GDP per person employed. The external debt of the public sector showed some evidence of having a detrimental influence on private saving, but a favourable effect on public investment in volume. The gross external debt of the private sector positively influenced public investment. Concerning aggregate supply, we analysed the production function per person employed in the private sector. Private external debt positively affected the gross value added in volume per person employed. Public external debt negatively impacted the gross value added in volume per person employed and the total factor productivity. Regarding external accounts, the private external debt affected the primary income account, though it had a low coefficient.
H63|The Macroeconomic Effects of Public Debt: An Empirical Analysis of Mozambique|Public debt has been rising markedly over the years, which suggests an increase in public expenditure financed by debt instead of taxation. There is no consensus on the economic implications of borrowing to finance public expenditure. We assess empirically the macroeconomic effects of public debt for the case of Mozambique over the period of 2000Q1-2016Q4. We use a Vector Autoregression model to assess these effects through impulse response functions and variance decomposition. We conclude that debt service variables have much more negative effects on this economy than debt variables. Debt variables over the period of this study had no significant impact on the real output and the debt service component depressed the real output, increased the general price level and accounted for the depreciation on the domestic currency.
H63|Fiscal Multipliers in the Eurozone: A SVAR Analysis|We compute the value of fiscal multipliers (for government primary expenditure, Income and wealth taxes and for Production and import ones) in the Eurozone countries since the creation of the currency union (2001Q1-2016Q4), and to understand how the values may vary according to the public debt level, the rhythm of economic growth and the output gap. Imposing quarterly fiscal shocks in the period 2000-2016, the results shown that the government expenditure had a positive effect on output, with an annual accumulated multiplier of 0.64 while the tax multipliers presented negative signs - the Income and wealth and the Production and import taxes stood at -0.10 and -0.32, respectively. Furthermore, the multipliers shown higher values for countries with higher levels of public debt (to small levels, the expenditure multiplier is close to zero and the tax multipliers seem to have positive signs),during recessions, and in countries with positive output gaps.
H63|Evolución de la deuda pública en los países de la Zona Euro. Determinantes y sostenibilidad de la misma|The purpose of this paper is to analyze the evolution and sustainability of the public debt in the Eurozone and in the most important Eurozone countries (Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Finland) during the period between 2001 and 2018 through the traditional accounting approach of accumulation of the debt/GDP ratio. This approach, in addition to quantify the effect of those determinants that have influence over the debt performance, will make possible the assess of the debt sustainability in terms of a State's ability to achieve primary surpluses, if necessary, according to changes in the interest-growth differential.The financial crisis that began in 2008 finished with the global bearish trend of the ratio of debt. Primary deficits began to manifest, there was a major recession in the countries of the European Union and the funding costs increased, what caused important increases in the levels of the debt ratio up to the point of putting in risk its own sustainability. El presente trabajo tiene por objeto analizar la evolución y la sostenibilidad de la deuda pública en la Eurozona y en los países más relevantes de la misma (España, Italia, Grecia, Portugal, Irlanda, Alemania, Francia, Holanda y Finlandia) durante el periodo 2001-2018 a través del enfoque tradicional contable de acumulación de la ratio de deuda/PIB. Este enfoque, además de permitir cuantificar el efecto de los determinantes que inciden en el comportamiento de la deuda, permitirá evaluar la sostenibilidad de la misma, en términos de la capacidad de un Estado para conseguir superávits primarios, en caso de que fuera necesario, acordes a los cambios acontecidos en el diferencial interés-crecimiento. La crisis financiera que comenzó en 2008 acabó con la tendencia global bajista de la ratio de deuda. Los déficits primarios comenzaron a manifestarse, se produjo una gran recesión en los países de la Unión Europea y los costes de financiación aumentaron, lo que desembocó en importantes aumentos de los niveles de la ratio de deuda hasta el punto de poner en riesgo su propia sostenibilidad.
H63|Indian companies’ technological investments in the EU with a special focus on Central and Eastern Europe|India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world whose global share in “outward foreign direct investment” (OFDI) among the developing countries increased from a low level to second only to China. It has not only been a spectacular rise in Indian overseas investment activity, but the nature and the structure of Indian OFDI have also changed in the last decades. In the following paper we will examine the reasons and driving forces behind this spectacular rise, concentrating mostly on those host country characteristics that are the pull factors in attracting Indian investments. We follow the most recent literature on global value-chain specialization as much of Indian outward foreign investment is following a technology-seeking strategy currently. We choose Central and Eastern Europe as our case study because the region combines attributions of both advanced and developing countries in attracting Indian investment.
H63|Economic Policy in a Recession. Lessons from the Past|When an economy drops suddenly into recession, the paramount objective of any policy initiative is to avoid deflation. To that end, quantitative easing has little to offer. Arguments from the 1930s are assessed within the context of the recent Global Financial Crisis, where the preceding twenty years of the Great Moderation had left economists high on hubris. In avoiding their deserved comeuppance, economists continue to parade an ever-more sophisticated intertwining of statistical data within mathematical relationships that is essentially divorced from social and political relevance. Though sorely needed, the broad strokes of a politico-historical perspective are rarely found within the purview of current mainstream economics.
H63|The ECB’s fiscal policy|Abstract While the ECB helped mitigate the euro crisis in the aftermath of Lehman, it has stretched its monetary mandate and moved into fiscal territory. This text describes and summarizes the crucial role played by the ECB in the intervention spiral resulting from its bid to manage the crisis. It also outlines ongoing competitiveness problems in southern Europe, discusses the so-called austerity policy of the Troika, comments on QE and presents two alternative paths for the future development of Europe.
H63|Fiscal competition and public debt|This paper explores the implications of high indebtedness for strategic tax setting when capital markets are integrated. When public borrowing is constrained due to sovereign default or by a binding fiscal rule, a rise in a country's initial debt level lowers investment in public infrastructure and makes tax setting more aggressive in that jurisdiction, while the opposite occurs elsewhere. On net a jurisdiction with higher initial debt becomes a less attractive location. Our analysis is inspired by fiscal responses in severely hit countries after the economic and financial crisis which are consistent with the theoretical predictions. We find a similar pattern on the sub-national level using administrative data from the universe of German municipalities.
H63|Do remittance fl ows promote financial inclusion?|In this paper, we evaluate whether remittances promote financial inclusion in developing countries. We construct an index of financial inclusion and present single equation estimates of the effects of remittances on financial inclusion. The paper uses data on remittance fl ows to 61 developing countries from different regions around the world spanning from 1990-2014 to explore this nexus. The study uses fixed effects estimations as well as GMM IV estimation method of panel data econometric analysis. The regression results confirm the hypothesis that remittances have an impact on financial inclusion through their effect on financial sector development. This can be intuitively explained by the fact that sending and receiving remittances increase senders and recipients use of financial services. The study shows that indeed remittances increase financial inclusion by about 2.49%. Remittances can therefore be considered a catalyst of financial inclusion in development.
H63|Zur strukturellen Finanzlage der Länder: eine aktuelle Auswertung und Methodenkritik|Seit Einfuehrung der neuen Schuldenregel hat sich die Finanzlage der deutschen Bundeslaender deutlich verbessert. Nach unseren Berechnungen mit dem Aggregierten Quotierungsverfahren konnten die meisten Laender ihre strukturellen Budgetdefizite abbauen und im Jahr 2017 schon 14 Laender strukturelle Budgetueberschuesse erzielen; lediglich das Saarland und Nordrhein-Westfalen wiesen strukturelle Defizite auf. Die „strukturelle“ Besserung überzeichnet indes die Konsolidierungsfortschritte, denn sie ist zum grossen Teil dem historisch niedrigen Zinsniveau zu verdanken, das zu erheblichen Einsparungen beim Schuldendienst fuehrte. Da die Finanzierungskonditionen aber nicht dauerhaft so guenstig bleiben wie in den vergangenen Jahren, verdecken die Zinsersparnisse den bei vielen Laendern noch bestehenden Konsolidierungsbedarf. Wir plaedieren daher dafuer, nur nachhaltige Einsparungen bei den Zinslasten als strukturelle Besserung zu klassifizieren und entwickeln ein Bereinigungsverfahren, das neben den Konjunktureinfluessen auch die Verzerrung durch das aeusserst niedrige Zinsniveau beachtet. Unsere Simulationen zeigen, dass nach einer Bereinigung um die nicht nachhaltigen Einsparungen beim Schuldendienst nicht mehr 14, sondern nur neun Laender im Jahr 2017 einen strukturell mindestens ausgeglichenen Haushalt erzielt haben. Bei den verbleibenden sieben Laendern besteht teilweise noch erheblicher Konsolidierungsbedarf. Wir zeigen darueber hinaus, dass die zur quantitativen Vergleichbarkeit der Laenderfinanzen in der Regel verwandten Einwohner-Indikatoren wesentliche Strukturunterschiede zwischen den Laendern unberuecksichtigt lassen und damit zu irrefuehrenden Schlussfolgerungen fuehren koennen. Wir empfehlen daher, bei Laendervergleichen Kennzahlen zu verwenden, die strukturelle Unterschiede zwischen den Laendern bei Erwerbstaetigkeit und Produktivitaet beachten.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H63|The debt multiplier|This paper studies the debt multiplier, that is, the effects of a temporary and pure change in government debt on economic activity. Contrary to an infinitely-lived representative agent model, in an overlapping generations (OLG) framework output increases even after a temporary increase in debt due to a lump-sum tax reduction that is totally reversed in the future. When nominal interest rates are positive, the debt multiplier is generally quite small. However, the debt multiplier is much larger when the nominal interest rate is at the zero lower bound. Hence, the call for fiscal consolidation in recession times seems ill-advised. Moreover, the steady state level of debt matters in an OLG framework. Multipliers tend to increase with the level of debt in steady state. A rise in the steady state debt-to-GDP level increases the steady state real interest rate and thus it provides an alternative route to increase the room for manoeuvre for monetary policy facing de flationary shocks.
H63|Non-Performing Loans, Cost of Capital, and Lending Supply: Lessons from the Eurozone Banking Crisis|This paper develops a theoretical model as a foundation of empirical analysis of the transmission channel of non-performing loans (NPLs) on bank cost of capital, credit and liquidity creation in the Eurozone. Empirical results confirm the model’s predictions and suggest that holding non-performing loans increases the cost of capital for banks in the short-term and the long-term. Moreover, the increased cost of capital reduces credit and liquidity creation, and the more so the less capitalized is the bank. This phenomenon is found to be economically more significant for European periphery country banks than for core country banks. The identification of the transmission channel is robust to the Granger predictability test.
H63|Disentangling the Transmission Channel NPLs-Cost of Capital-Lending Supply|This paper analyses the effects of non-performing loans (NPLs) on the cost of capital, and on lending and liquidity supply, for a sample of 225 Eurozone banks over the period 2002Q1-2016Q4. Our results demonstrate that NPLs increase the cost of capital, which reduces both lending supply and liquidity creation. This phenomenon is comparatively more significant for periphery county banks than for core country banks.
H63|News- Based Indices on Country Fundamentals: Do They Help Explain Sovereign Credit Spread Fluctuations?|This paper revisits the discussion about the role that fundamentals play in asset prices using sovereign credit spread data. We augment the standard macroeconomic proxy set by text-based measures of country and global fundamentals from a database of Reuters news articles between 2007 and 2016. We use a novel methodology that matches fundamental topic expressions and directly links them to tonality and geography information within the text. Our approach resolves several problems of extant text mining methods. We verify that our news indices capture fundamental information within news articles and are uncorrelated with measures of liquidity and investor sentiment. These news indices explain a large part of sovereign credit spread changes not captured by traditional fundamental proxies and thus support a significantly larger role for fundamentals. This additional information derives primarily from omitted expectations and concerns about global fundamentals. We also show that a large part of the covariance between the VIX index and sovereign spreads is related to these global fundamentals.
H63|Sub-Saharan African Eurobond yields: What really matters beyond global factors?|This study explores the drivers of secondary market yields of Sub-Saharan African (SSA) sovereign Eurobonds from 2008 to mid-2017. Our results indicate that, beyond global ‘push’ factors, country specific ‘pull’ factors such as inflation and GDP growth matter too for SSA Eurobond performance. A panel error-correction analysis suggests large heterogeneity in the short-term influence of our global and country variables across countries. We find no significant effect of bond-specific factors on yields when push and pull factors are accounted for. By emphasizing the prominence of country variables, reflecting the quality of countries’ macroeconomic management and their economic performance, our results qualify the common view that SSA countries have little control over their market borrowing costs.
H63|Spillovers in Sub-Saharan Africa’s sovereign Eurobond yields|This paper investigates the possibility of spillovers among Sub-Saharan African (SSA) eurobonds. Twelve SSA countries are examined from January 1, 2015 to June 30, 2017. Following the methodology of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012), we proceed as in Antonakakis and Vergos (2013) to compute both the overall and time-varying total spillover index and directional spillovers using secondary market daily yields. Ours results indicate significant contagion effects among these bonds as, on average, 66.37% of the forecast error variance in our model come from spillovers. The results of the time-varying analysis shows that the total spillover index has been sensitive to major economic events and news announcements over this period. More important, they suggest that less resilient economies transmit more to and receive less from their peers, but that this relationship is not linear: cases of extreme fragility such as that of Mozambique do no translate into higher spillovers to peers. This non-linear relationship between countries’ macroeconomic performance and spillover levels confirms to some extent the market discipline hypothesis in the case of SSA eurobonds as markets have proven able to factor-in and discriminate against issuers’ salient abnormal behaviors.
H63|Triffin: dilemma or myth?|Triffin gained enormous influence by reviving the interwar story that gold scarcity threatened deflation. In particular, he held that central banks needed to accumulate claims on the United States to back money growth. But the claims would eventually surpass the US gold stock and then central banks would inevitably stage a run on it. He feared that the resulting high US interest rates would cause global deflation. However, we show that the US gold position after WWII was no worse than the UK position in 1900. Yet it took WWI to break sterling's gold link. And better and feasible US policies could have kept Bretton Woods going. This history serves as a backdrop to our critical review of two later extensions of Triffin. One holds that the dollar's reserve role required US current account deficits. This current account Triffin is popular, but anachronistic, and flawed in logic and fact. Nevertheless, it pops up in debates over the euro's and the renminbi's reserve roles. A fiscal Triffin holds that global demand for safe assets will either remain dangerously unsatisfied, or force excessive US fiscal debt. Less flawed, this story posits implausibly inflexible demand for and supply of safe assets. Thus, these stories do not convince in their own terms. Moreover, each lacks Triffin's clear cross-over point from a stable system to an unstable one. Triffin's seeming predictive success leads economists to wrap his brand around dissimilar stories. Yet Triffin's dilemma in its most general form correctly points to the conflicts and difficulties that arise when a national currency plays a role as an international public good.
H63|The optimal public and private provision of safe assets|We develop a theory of optimal government debt in which publicly-issued and privately-issued safe assets are substitutes. While government bonds are backed by future tax revenues, privately-issued safe assets are backed by the future repayment of pools of defaultable private loans. We find that a higher supply of public debt crowds out privately-issued safe assets less than one for one and reduces the interest spread between borrowing and deposit rates. Our main result is that the optimal level of public debt does not fully crowd out private lending and maintains a positive interest spread. Moreover, the optimal level of public debt is higher the more severe are financial frictions.
H63|International Spillovers and ‘Ex-ante’ Efficient Bailouts|We study how cross-country macroeconomic spillovers caused by sovereign default affect equilibrium bailouts. Because of portfolio diversification, the default of one country causes a macroeconomic contraction also in other countries. This generates a self-interest for these other countries to bailout the defaulting country. A novel insight of the paper is that bailouts could be efficient not only ex-post (after the debt has been issued) but also ex-ante (before the issuance of the debt). Although anticipated bailouts create the typical moral hazard problem leading countries to issue more debt, this may correct for the under issuance of public debt that would result from the lack of cross-country policy coordination.
H63|Rare Disasters, Financial Development, and Sovereign Debt|We propose a model of sovereign debt where countries vary in their level of financial development, defined as the extent to which countries can hedge rare disasters in international capital markets. We show that low levels of financial development generate the “debt intolerance” phenomenon that plagues emerging markets: it reduces debt capacity, increases credit spreads, and limits the ability to smooth consumption.
H63|History Remembered: Optimal Sovereign Default on Domestic and External Debt|"Infrequent but turbulent overt sovereign defaults on domestic creditors are a ""forgotten history"" in Macroeconomics. We propose a heterogeneous-agents model in which the government chooses optimal debt and default on domestic and foreign creditors by balancing distributional incentives v. the social value of debt for self-insurance, liquidity, and risk-sharing. A rich feedback mechanism links debt issuance, the distribution of debt holdings, the default decision, and risk premia. Calibrated to Eurozone data, the model is consistent with key long-run and debt-crisis statistics. Defaults are rare (1.2 percent frequency), and preceded by surging debt and spreads. Debt sells at the risk-free price most of the time, but the government's lack of commitment reduces sustainable debt sharply."
H63|An Analysis of Puerto Rico's Debt Relief Needs to Restore Debt Sustainability|This paper makes two contributions. First, we examine the macroeconomic implications of Puerto Rico’s Fiscal Plan that was certified in March 2017 for fiscal years 2017-18 to 2026-27. Second, we perform a Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) that incorporates the expected macroeconomic dynamics implied by the Fiscal Plan in order to compute Puerto Rico’s debt restructuring needs. We detect a number of flawed assumptions in the Fiscal Plan that lead to an underestimation of its contractionary effects on the island’s economic activity. We conduct a sensitivity analysis of the expected macroeconomic dynamics implied by the plan that allows us to construct more realistic scenarios of Puerto Rico’s debt restructuring needs. We show that the island’s current debt position is unsustainable, and compute the necessary debt relief to restore sustainability under different sets of assumptions. The paper offers general insights for performing a macro-consistent DSA.
H63|Asymmetric regional dynamics: from bust to recovery|Regional convergence stands out in the severe adjustment of the Portuguese economy that followed the international financial crisis. This result contrasts with increasing regional inequality in other European countries. We show that regions’ GDP growth rates of the Portuguese economy were driven by debt and exports. Our estimates suggest that differences in regional debt-to-GDP and exports-toGDP ratios resulted in asymmetric regional economic dynamics. Highly indebted regions had a more severe recession and a slower recovery. Regions more open to trade had a milder recession and a stronger recovery. Finally, our results suggest that fiscal decentralization may improve regions’ resilience.
H63|The liquidity buffer practices of public debt managers in OECD countries|This paper summarises and discusses results from a survey of the liquidity buffer practices of debt managers in OECD countries. It includes detailed information on their purpose, cost, level and investment. Where possible and relevant, comparisons are made with the results of an earlier survey conducted in 2011. Country case studies for Denmark, Portugal and Turkey provide a deeper insight into liquidity buffer practices.While the level, investment, transparency and other governance features vary, the survey results show that keeping a liquidity buffer is a common practice among debt management offices in OECD countries. Sovereign debt managers view a liquidity buffer as an effective tool to address re-financing risk and liquidity risk that may arise for reasons such as, unexpected increases in borrowing needs, short-term mismatches in fiscal cash flows or the temporary loss of market access.
H63|Sustainable finance for inclusive growth in Thailand|The Partnerships pillar of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development cuts across all the goals focusing on the mobilisation of resources needed to implement the agenda. Thailand’s “sufficiency economy philosophy” encourages the prioritisation of long-term sustainability over short-term benefits. As such, Thailand has a long history of fiscal prudence that has served the country well in times of economic and political instability. However, relying on current fiscal buffers to finance foreseeable expenditure pressures is not sufficient or sustainable. A rapidly ageing population and shrinking workforce will weigh on future public finances and on the ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. To ensure that Thailand is well placed over the medium term to meet growing social, environmental and infrastructure requirements, the government should: (i) increase tax revenues by broadening the tax base and enhancing collection efficiency; (ii) facilitate greater private sector investment in productive infrastructure; and (iii) reform the healthcare and pension systems to increase their efficiency and effectiveness. This Working Paper relates to the Initial Assessment report of the Multi-dimensional Country Review of Thailand. (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/multi-dimensional-review-thailand.htm)
H63|To shorten or to lengthen? Public debt management in the low interest rate environment|With still large government debt and interest payments in many OECD countries, actively adjusting debt maturity can help to minimise debt servicing costs. Temporarily lengthening the maturity of new debt issuance may lower debt servicing costs in the longer term and reduce rollover risks if interest rates increase gradually over a prolonged period and to a high level. However, if market interest rates increase fast and stay high, shortening debt maturity would be financially more beneficial though at the cost of higher rollover risks. Illustrative scenarios considered in this paper show that adjusting debt maturity may take several years before producing fiscal savings. They are likely to be moderate at best for most G7 countries, ranging from less than 0.1% to ⅓ per cent of GDP per year on average, with the exception of Italy where they could be significantly higher. In countries where debt maturity management has small fiscal effects, lengthening the debt maturity may still be pursued to reduce rollover risks.
H63|Costa Rica: Restoring fiscal sustainability and setting the basis for a more growth-friendly and inclusive fiscal policy|Consecutive years of primary deficits have led to mounting public debt of almost 50% of GDP, one of the fastest increases in Latin America over the last decade. Government attempts to restore fiscal health have been undermined by a gridlocked Congress. While only minor reforms have been enacted to contain spending, efforts to curb tax evasion and increase the efficiency of the tax administration are commendable. However, increases in tax revenue have been unable to match mandated increases in spending. As a consequence, sovereign debt ratings have declined to below investment level, and the negative outlook on Costa Rica’s debt signals increasing financing costs. Against this backdrop, the risk of a fiscal crisis is increasing, particularly as global financial conditions become less favourable and debt structure has shifted towards increased reliance on floating rates and dollar-denominated bonds. Enacting a three year fiscal consolidation programme of one percentage point of GDP each year, will enable debt to stabilise at current levels by 2032. The current draft bill to strengthen public finances – Ley de Fortalecimiento de las Finanzas Públicas – proposes a comprehensive fiscal reform package, with measures on both the revenue and the spending side, as well as a fiscal rule. It needs to be complemented with additional measures to contain revenue earmarking. In addition, reducing excessive fragmentation of the public sector would allow the Ministry of Finance to regain control of the budget. There is also room to reduce expenditure on remuneration of public sector workers, one of the fastest growing expenditure items and a source of income inequality. The proposed fiscal rule should be strengthened, including introducing a multi-year expenditure framework and a fiscal council. Debt management should be modernised by stepping up communication with markets and reducing the number of benchmark securities. Over time, improving social spending efficiency and quality as well as modifying the tax structure away from social security contributions and enlarging the tax base would allow for a much stronger contribution of fiscal policy to growth and equity.
H63|Limits to government debt sustainability in middle-income countries|This paper investigates the effect of structural characteristics on debt limits of middle income countries. Two equations relate the probability of default to the interest rate. First, the probability of default is estimated with a logit model. Second, the assumption of non-arbitrage opportunity on the sovereign bond market relates the interest rate, the probability of default and the recovery rate. This model leads to three situations: a single and stable solution at low debt, multiple equilibria with stable and unstable solutions at intermediate debt, and a single solution with dissuasively high risk-premium beyond a debt threshold: this defines the debt limit. It reflects the empirical evidence on default determinants: it increases with perceived government effectiveness, the export to GDP ratio and the expected recovery rate and decreases with the commodity export to GDP ratio, the size of growth shocks, the share of defaults in neighbouring countries, the risk-free rate and investors’ risk aversion. Debt limits are highly sensitive to the expected recovery rate, reflecting the importance of credibility. The multiple equilibria case illustrates the risk of self-fulfilling crises: interest rate shocks can trigger the default below the debt limit.
H63|Sovereign defaults: Evidence on the importance of government effectiveness|This paper provides robust empirical evidence that government effectiveness is a key determinant of sovereign defaults. Government effectiveness is measured by a broad-based perception index of the Worldwide Governance Indicators database (WGI) disseminated by the World Bank. Public debt and sovereign default data cover both external and internal government debt. In a systematic and demanding robustness check with any possible sub-sample of a large set of control variables, the effect of government effectiveness is almost always robust. In addition, the effects of the five other main indicators of the WGI database on default risk are also investigated, showing that the rule of law, regulatory quality, control of corruption and voice and accountability are also robustly linked with default risk. Regressions with the mortality of settlers as an instrument indicate a causal effect from government effectiveness to sovereign default.
H63|Issuing GDP-linked bonds: Supply and demand can match|This paper compares supply and demand to assess to what extent there can be a market for GDP-linked bonds (GLBs). For the government side, simulations illustrate the debt-stabilisation property of GLBs. These simulations consider shock persistence with a VAR structure and large events with shocks drawn from the residuals. Countries where shock persistence and the standard deviation of the interest rate – growth rate differential scaled with the debt level are higher reap more benefits from GLBs and hence can accept a larger risk premium on GLBs. For the investors’ side, risk premia compensating for GDP volatility are calculated with a CAPM, considering not only the size of growth shocks and their correlation with market prices, but also their persistence. Calculations are made with simplifying assumptions going against the case of GLBs: in particular, the possible reduction in the default risk premium is ignored. Even so, both high-risk and low-risk countries can benefit from GLBs: the ones that have to pay a larger risk premium are those that need this insurance against debt crises the most.
H63|Capital Income Taxation, Economic Growth, and the Politics of Public Education|This study considers the politics of public education and its impacts on economic growth and welfare across generations. Public education is funded by taxing the labor income of the working generation and capital income of the retired. We employ probabilistic voting to demonstrate the politics of taxes and expenditure and show that aging results in a shift of the tax burden from the old to the young and a slowdown of economic growth. We then consider three alternative constraints that limit the choice of taxes and/or expenditure: a minimum level of public education expenditure, an upper limit of the capital income tax rate, and a combination of the two. These constraints all create a trade-off between current and future generations in terms of welfare.
H63|Intergenerational policies, public debt, and economic growth: A politico-economic analysis|This study presents a two-period overlapping-generations model with endogenous growth. In each period, the government representing young and old generations provides a public good financed by labor income taxation and public debt issuance, and the government's policies are determined by probabilistic voting. Increased political power of the old lowers economic growth. A debt-ceiling rule is considered to resolve the negative growth effect, but it creates a trade-off between generations in terms of welfare.
H63|The welfare effects of third-degree price discrimination|The welfare effects of third-degree price discrimination are known to be negative when demand functions are linear, marginal cost is constant and all markets are served. This paper shows that discrimination lowers welfare for a more general class of demand functions. Demand varies across markets with additive and multiplicative shift factors. Total welfare (defined as consumer surplus plus profits) with discrimination is lower than with uniform pricing when the density function of consumer valuations satisfies a weak version of concavity that encompasses logconcavity. Most standard demand functions including linear, quadratic, probit, logit, exponential and iso-elastic ones, satisfy this assumption, which is also a weak sufficient condition for existence.
H63|Der Wohlfahrtstaat als Grundbestandteil des modernen demokratischen Staatsgefüges<BR>[The welfare state as a basic component of the modern democratic state structure]|Defining the welfare state is not a simpleminded task. Actually, there are numerous definitions which try to reflect at least some of the basic characteristics of the welfare state or its objectives and its functions. For some, there is primarily an institutional parameter, for others there are functional issues which have to be firstly indicated and for others, the ideological and political factors determine the definition and the attitude towards the welfare state. Apart from all these crucial ascertainments, there are some basic fundamental characteristics and values of the welfare state which render it as a precondition of the existence of the modern state. Unquestionably, it reflects a distinct part of the state but most importantly, it comprises a prerequisite for its existence. This is the exact aim of this paper; to surpass the theoretical diversifications and to find the fundamental common ground which forms the indispensability for the existence of the welfare state.
H63|O retrospectivă analitică a contextului crizei datoriei externe a României din anii 1980<BR>[A deeper insight into the background of 1980s external debt crisis in Romania]|This study, based on more recent research, including disarchived and / or declassificated information regarding the communist period in Romania, both internally and internationally, focuses on exploring the 1980s external debt crisis context and causes, as well as the impact of internal and external factors, having as intention a reevaluation, closer to the reality, of those times state of affaires. At the beginning of the 1980s, the global economy was marked by a severe economic and financial crisis, the first on global-scale in history, felt by more than 30 developing countries as a balance of payments crisis, which resulted in the renegotiation and rescheduling of their sovereign debt. In the case of Romania, the external debt crisis triggered in 1982 has been aggravated, in an extremely severe manner, by overlapping internal vulnerabilities accumulated in previous decades with external shock caused by the major changes in the global economic, financial and geopolitical context at the end of 1979, which led to the explosive rise in interest rates on loans contracted from private commercial banks under floating interest rates, as well as the introduction of conditionalities on loans granted by international financial institutions. The study conclude that the decision of Romanian authorities to liquidate the external debt and the crisis management errors had a destructive impact on the Romanian economy, degenerated in a system crisis at the end of 1989. Many of the external debt crisis were felt also afterwards, slowing down significantly the pace of the transition to the market economy and the positioning of the country on a sustainable development trajectory.
H63|Degrowth and sustainable public finance|Using well-known results from public debt dynamics, it is shown that in case of degrowth a sustainable public debt is very unlikely to achieve. Degrowth requires that negative real interest rates have to be maintained which might imply accelerated inflation, or other severe goal conflicts of public finance will result.
H63|A permanent zero interest rate would maximise GDP|The arguments for government borrowing do not stand inspection, thus the effect of such borrowing is to artificially raise interest rates above their free market level. Since GDP is maximised where prices are at the free market level, absent good reasons for thinking otherwise, it follows that the GDP maximising rate of interest is zero, in the sense that no interest should be offered to those holding base money. It is just possible that there are arguments for a limited amount of borrowing to fund public investments like infrastructure, though conventional thinking on that point is chaotic at the moment. But even if that infrastructure idea is accepted, it does not change the above “permanent zero interest rate” conclusion.
H63|Effect of corporate governance on cost of equity before and after international financial reporting standard implementation|The ability to compete between companies at the time of intercompany production efficiency is no longer a differentiator, the determinant of competitiveness includes the aspect of funding to be one of the determinants of competitiveness. One of the company's competitiveness capabilities is determined by the capital cost or the discount rate used in evaluating a project. The higher the cost of capital will be the lower the competitiveness of the company. There are many factors that determine the cost of a company's capital, but this research focuses only on the aspects of Corporate Governance (CG). Investors will assume that the risk in companies that have good CG quality will be smaller than companies that do not have good CG quality. On the other hand, IFRS implementation has a variety of purposes including improving the implementation of CG in a company, so it is theoretically suspected that IFRS implementation will increase CG's influence on CoE. The approach used is to study the capability of the linear regression model formed and to conduct a comparative analysis among regression models established by data from manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange during 2007-2011 as data prior to IFRS implementation and 2012-2015 for data after IFRS implementation. Based on the results of data processing obtained evidence that Corporate Governance negatively affect the Cost of Equity (CoE). This contradicts the theory because the better the CG value of a firm the CoE will be to decrease. When compared to the period before and after IFRS implementation, there is no evidence of a relationship between CG and CoE.
H63|The Mediation Effect of Regional Development in Relationship Between Community Participation to Sustainable Transportation in The City of Medan, North Sumatra Indonesia|The paper aims is to investigate the mediation effect of regional development on the relationship between community participation to sustainable transportation in the city of Medan, North Sumatra Indonesia. This research was conducted by an explanatory approach using primary data with purposive sampling technique method based on criteria of 300 respondents. Data analysis techniques used was SEM (Structural Equation Modeling). The results of this study indicate that community participation has positive influence on regional development in the city of Medan, regional development has positive direct effect on sustainable transportation in the city of Medan, community participation has positive direct effect on sustainable transportation in the city of Medan, and community participation has positive indirect effect on sustainable transportation in the city of Medan. Regional development has positive mediation effect between community participation to sustainable transportation in the city of Medan, North Sumatra Indonesia.
H63|Dynamic Scoring: An Assessment of Fiscal Closing Assumptions|Analysis of fiscal policy changes using general equilibrium models with forward-looking agents typically requires the modeler to assume a counterfactual adjustment to some fiscal instrument in order to achieve the debt sustainability implied by the government's intertemporal budget constraint. Since the fiscal instrument chosen to close the model can induce economic behavior unrelated to the policy change in models where Ricardian Equivalence does not hold, noise may be introduced into the analysis. In this paper we use such an overlapping generations framework to examine the impact of alternative fiscal closing assumptions on projected changes to economic aggregates over the ten-year `budget window' following a change in tax policy, assessing the extent to which the noise associated with a particular fiscal instrument can be mitigated. We find that while quantitative differences in projected macroeconomic activity can be observed across alternative fiscal instruments, these differences tend to shrink as the date that fiscal instruments begin to adjust is delayed into the future. Since the particular fiscal instrument chosen to achieve debt sustainability can then become relatively unimportant, the reliability of policy analysis obtained using this class of models may be improved.
H63|Deficit financing in developing countries: Application and consequences|This article discusses briefly various aspects and forms of deficit financing in modern economies. It deals with deficit financing (i) within countries and (ii) between the member countries of the International Monetary Fund (IMF} and that institution as aid provider to a member in difficulty. In (i) it focuses mainly on the use of deficit financing as an instrument to part fund development and its consequences. In (ii) it sees deficit financing on a global scale, explains IMF conditionality and the sort of programs it envisaged the aid seeking members to follow; it presents illustration and critique of these programs. In conclusion it contains some observations including a few policy suggestions
H63|Credit Risk and Fiscal Inflation|Is inflation ‘always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon’ or is it fundamentally a fiscal phenomenon? This article augments a standard monetary model to incorporate fiscal details and credit market frictions. These ingredients allow for both interpretations of the inflation process in a financially constrained environment. We find that adding financial frictions to the model generates important identifying restrictions on the observed pattern between inflation and measures of financial and fiscal stress, to the extent that it can overturn existing findings about which monetary-fiscal policy regime produced the pre-crisis U.S. data.
H63|A Frequency-Domain Approach to Dynamic Macroeconomic Models|This article is concerned with frequency-domain analysis of dynamic linear models under the hypothesis of rational expectations. We develop a unified framework for conveniently solving and estimating these models. Unlike existing strategies, our starting point is to obtain the model solution entirely in the frequency domain. This solution method is applicable to a wide class of models and permits straightforward construction of the spectral density for performing likelihood-based inference. To cope with potential model uncertainty, we also generalize the well-known spectral decomposition of the Gaussian likelihood function to a composite version implied by several competing models. Taken together, these techniques yield fresh insights into the model’s theoretical and empirical implications beyond what conventional time-domain approaches can offer. We illustrate the proposed framework using a prototypical new Keynesian model with fiscal details and two distinct monetary-fiscal policy regimes. The model is simple enough to deliver an analytical solution that makes the policy effects transparent under each regime, yet still able to shed light on the empirical interactions between U.S. monetary and fiscal policies along different frequencies.
H63|Modern financial repression in the euro area crisis: making high public debt sustainable?|The sharp rise in public debt-to-GDP ratios in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008 posed serious challenges for fiscal policy in the euro area countries and culminated for some member states in a sovereign debt crisis. This note examines the public policy responses to the euro area crisis through the lens of financial repression with a particular focus on how they contributed to easing government budget constraints. Financial repression is defined in this context as the government’s strategy – supported by monetary and financial policies – to gain privileged access to capital markets at preferential credit conditions and divert resources to the state with the aim to secure and, if necessary, enforce public debt sustainability. Following a narrative approach, this note finds that public debt management and resolution, European financial legislation, EMU crisis support and ECB monetary policy have significantly contributed to relieving sovereign liquidity and solvency stress and generated fiscal space through non-standard means. The respective authorities have in fact applied the tools of financial repression to restore stability after the euro area crisis.
H63|Solicited versus Unsolicited Ratings: The Role of Selection|This paper analyses the extent to which selection explains the observed discrepancy between solicited and unsolicited ratings. I propose a model of selection with truth telling rating agencies and borrowers with the ability to veto the revelation of the rating. The observed difference between the two categories of ratings in different markets is in line with the prediction of the model. In the financial sector, for example, selection of less creditworthy borrowers into unsolicited status makes unsolicited ratings grades lower on average than those solicited. In the government sector, on the other hand, there is a positive selection of borrowers into unsolicited ratings.
H63|Government of Canada Fixed-Income Market Ecology|"This discussion paper is the third in the Financial Markets Department's series on the structure of Canadian financial markets. These papers are called ""ecologies"" because they study the interactions among market participants, infrastructures, regulations and the terms of the traded contract itself. In this ecology, we discuss the Government of Canada's domestic fixed-income market. We begin with an overview of Government of Canada securities and their characteristics. We then outline common market practices and the typical participants in the market. We provide high-level statistics on activity in the market and describe the market infrastructures that support trading. Finally, we discuss risks in these securities markets."
H63|Alternative Futures for Government of Canada Debt Management|This paper presents four blue-sky ideas for lowering the cost of the Government of Canada’s debt without increasing the debt’s risk profile. We argue that each idea would improve the secondary-market liquidity of government debt, thereby increasing the demand for government bonds and thus lowering their cost at issuance. The first two ideas would improve liquidity by enhancing the active management of the government’s debt through market operations used to support the liquidity of outstanding bonds. The second two ideas would simplify the set of securities issued by the government, concentrating issuance in a smaller set of bonds that would each be more highly traded. We discuss the ideas and give an account of the political, legal and operational impediments.
H63|The Government of Canada Debt Securities Data Set|We present the daily time series of the outstanding amounts of all Government of Canada marketable debt securities from July 2001 to June 2017. The data set is accompanied by a matching data set describing the most relevant events for each bond on each day: auction, repurchase, benchmark status and maturity. This previously unavailable data set is designed with academic researchers and market participants in mind and could be regularly updated in the future. We discuss the construction of the data set and potential uses for empirical asset pricing and related studies.
H63|Los retos del desapalancamiento público|Los niveles de deuda pública sobre el PIB en una mayoría de países de la UEM, incluida España, se encuentran en niveles muy elevados de acuerdo con los registros históricos disponibles. La literatura económica es concluyente en señalar que el mantenimiento de ratios de deuda pública muy elevadas durante períodos temporales prolongados puede resultar perjudicial para el crecimiento económico y suponer una fuente de vulnerabilidad para la economía, además de reducir la capacidad estabilizadora del presupuesto público. En este contexto, las reformas del Pacto de Estabilidad y Crecimiento europeo y de la ley de estabilidad presupuestaria española acometidas durante la reciente crisis reforzaron el papel de esta variable en el marco presupuestario. Las simulaciones realizadas en el presente trabajo muestran que, bajo determinados supuestos macroeconómicos, un proceso de desapalancamiento público como el exigido por el Pacto de Estabilidad para el caso de la economía española exigirá un esfuerzo de consolidación fiscal todavía significativo y que debe perdurar en el tiempo.
H63|Previsión de la carga de intereses de las Administraciones Públicas|This document presents a tool, available at the Banco de España, for forecasting General government interest payments in Spain. Contrary to some models, which are very detailed and take into account the specific characteristics and dates of every individual debt instrument issued by the government, the tool presented here aggregates as much as possible, for simplicity reasons, but without losing forecasting capacity, as it is shown in the document. Also, the explanatory variables and the accounting approach used are chosen to be consistent with the regular macroeconomic projection exercises of the Banco de España, of which they are part.
H63|Fiscal buffers, private debt and recession: the good, the bad and the ugly|Focusing on Euro-Area countries, we show empirically that higher private debt leads to deeper recessions while higher public debt does not, unless its level is especially high. We then build a general equilibrium model that replicates these dynamics and use it to design a policy that can mitigate the recessionary consequences of private deleveraging. In the model, in the aftermath of financial shocks, recessions are milder and public debt is more contained when the government lends directly to those households and firms that face binding borrowing constraints. As a consequence, large fiscal buffers are critical to enhance macroeconomic resilience to financial shocks.
H63|Sovereign debt maturity structure and its costs|I propose a theoretical model of a debt contract between a sovereign and its international lenders that determines the optimal debt maturity structure and related costs. It is shaped by two financial frictions: limited liability (the country cannot guarantee that it will not dilute its obligations or default on them) and market incompleteness (only non-contingent assets can be issued). I find that, in equilibrium, debt dilution constrains the amount of long-term debt issuance. I then focus on two aspects that are currently widely debated in both academic and policy fora: the possibility of sovereign debt restructuring with private creditors and international official lending in the event of exclusion from the international capital markets. The possibility of restructuring after default stimulates long-term debt issuance. However, in equilibrium, the proposed crisis management tools are unable to loosen the constraint on long-term debt issuance. Consistently with the empirical literature, I find that even when these policy options for crisis resolution are available, the country tends to issue mainly short-term debt.
H63|Are credit rating agencies discredited? Measuring market price effects from agency sovereign debt announcements|This paper investigates whether the price response to credit rating agency (CRA) announcements on sovereign bonds has diminished since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). We characterize credit rating events more precisely than previous work, controlling agency announcements for the prior credit state - outlook, watch/review, or stable status as well as the level of the credit rating. Emphasizing the transition from one state to another allows us to distinguish between different types of announcement (rating changes, watch and outlook events) and their price effects. We employ an event study methodology and gauge market response by standardized cumulative abnormal returns (SCAR) and directional change statistics in daily credit default swap (CDS) spreads. We find that rating announcements provide a rich and varied set of information on how credit rating agencies in fluence market perceptions of sovereign default risk. CRA announcements continued to have significant effects on CDS spreads after the GFC, but the magnitude of the responses generally fell. Moreover, we find that accurate measurement of these effects depends on conditioning for the prior credit state of the sovereign bond.
H63|Does Sovereign Risk in Local and Foreign Currency Differ?|Historically, sovereign debt in local currency has been considered safer than debt in foreign currency. The literature offers scant theoretical or empirical guidance as to why such a gap has existed or why it appears to have slowly and steadily diminished for all regions over the past two decades, as expressed in the credit ratings widely used by global investors and regulators to assess credit risk. We suggest and empirically test five hypotheses. We find the assessed differences between local and foreign currency credit risk to not be driven by changes in inflation. The banking sector fs vulnerability to sovereign debt problems is a significant determinant of the gap, but does not account for the declining spread over time. Instead, the surge in global reserves, and to lesser extent the declining dependence on foreign currency borrowing overseas (decline of original sin), as well as lower global volatility, appear to have diminished the gap. In case of a trend reversal of these variables, there could be a widening of the gap going forward.
H63|Fiscal adjustment and debt sustainability: Greece 2010-2016 and beyond|This paper reviews the fiscal developments that led Greece from a successful con-vergence process and the adoption of the Euro to an unprecedented prolonged re-cession. Analysis of all fiscal aggregates reveals the policies behind the sovereign crisis, both on the expenditure and the revenue side. We employ a simple macrostatic model to identify the impact of fiscal policies on the economy through the fiscal multipliers, especially during the adjustment programmes. We attempt to explore the extent to which fiscal adjustment may have been self-defeating by developing ex post adjustment scenarios. Following this, we turn to testing debt sustainability in the long run in an interest rate sensitive environment. This is done based on a set of several varying assumptions regarding growth, fiscal performance and debt reprofiling. Analysis of the resulting scenarios points out the risks surrounding debt sustainability and draws the broad lines of future fiscal policies.
H63|Non-Performing Loans, Cost of Capital, and Lending Supply: Lessons from the Eurozone Banking Crisi|This paper develops a theoretical model as a foundation of empirical analysis of the transmission channel of non-performing loans (NPLs) on bank cost of capital, credit and liquidity creation in the Eurozone. Empirical results confirm the model’s predictions and suggest that holding non-performing loans increases the cost of capital for banks in the short-term and the long-term. Moreover, the increased cost of capital reduces credit and liquidity creation, and the more so the less capitalized is the bank. This phenomenon is found to be economically more significant for European periphery country banks than for core country banks. The identification of the transmission channel is robust to the Granger predictability test.
H63|Debt Seniority and Sovereign Debt Crises|Is the seniority structure of sovereign debt neutral for a government's decision between defaulting and raising surpluses? In this paper, we address this question using a model of debt crises where a discretionary government endogenously chooses distortionary taxation and whether to apply an optimal haircut to bondholders. We show that when the size of senior tranches is small, a version of the Modigliani-Miller theorem holds: tranching just redistributes government revenues from junior to senior bondholders, while taxes and government borrowing costs remain unchanged. However, as senior tranches become sufficiently large, default costs on senior debt transpire into a stronger commitment to repay not only the senior tranche, but also the junior one. We show that there is a lower threshold for senior bonds above which tranching can eliminate default on both junior and senior debt, and an upper threshold beyond which the government defaults also on senior debt.
H63|Federal Debt and the Statutory Limit, January 2018|After incorporating the anticipated effects of recent tax legislation and actual spending and revenue amounts in December into its calculations, CBO now projects that the Treasuryâ€™s ability to borrow additional funds using extraordinary measures will be exhaustedâ€”and it will most likely run out of cashâ€”in the first half of March 2018. If that occurred, the government would be unable pay its obligations fully, and it would delay making payments for programs and activities, default on its debt obligations, or both.
H63|The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028|If current laws governing taxes and spending generally remained unchanged, the federal budget deficit would grow substantially over the next few years, CBO projects, with accumulating deficits driving debt held by the public to nearly 100 percent of GDP by 2028. That amount would be far greater than the debt in any year since just after World War II. In CBOâ€™s projections, real GDP growth is relatively strong this year and next, as recent changes in fiscal policy add to existing momentum.
H63|An Analysis of the Presidentâ€™s 2019 Budget|The cumulative deficit under the Presidentâ€™s policies would total $9.5 trillion over the 2019â€“2028 period, $2.9 trillion less than in CBO's baseline. Over that period, the deficit would range from 3.2 percent to 4.5 percent of GDP, averaging 3.7 percent. As a result, federal debt held by the public would increase from 78 percent of GDP this year to 86 percent in 2028.
H63|The 2018 Long-Term Budget Outlook|In CBOâ€™s projections, federal budget deficits grow substantially over the next several years in relation to the size of the economy, stabilize for a few years, and then grow again over the rest of the 30-year period. If current laws generally remained unchanged, the growing deficits would raise federal debt held by the public from 78 percent of gross domestic product this year to nearly 100 percent by the end of the next decade and 152 percent by 2048.
H63|The Deficit Reductions Necessary to Meet Various Targets for Federal Debt|CBO has examined various illustrative scenarios in which the federal government makes debt held by the public smaller than it would be if current laws remained generally unchanged. In those scenarios, the primary deficitâ€”that is, the deficit excluding net outlays for interestâ€”is reduced to make debt equal 41 percent, 78 percent, or 100 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) over the next 15 to 30 years. Two broad strategies are used: reducing the primary deficit by a constant share of GDP over time and reducing the primary deficit by an increasing share of GDP.
H63|The Long-Term Budget Outlook Under Alternative Scenarios for Fiscal Policy|In CBOâ€™s most recent extended baseline projections, federal debt held by the public rises from an amount equal to 78 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018 to 118 percent of GDP in 2038. This report expands on those projections by showing how the federal budget and the nationâ€™s economy would evolve under three alternative scenarios. In those scenarios, laws would be changed to continue certain policies now in place, leading to even higher debt.
H63|Options for Reducing the Deficit: 2019 to 2028|Since 2007, federal debt held by the public has more than doubled in relation to the size of the economy. The Congress faces an array of policy choices as it confronts the challenges posed by such large and growing debt. To help inform lawmakers, CBO periodically issues a volume of optionsâ€”this yearâ€™s installment presents 121â€”that would decrease federal spending or increase federal revenues over the next decade.
H63|Sovereign Defaults in Court|For centuries, defaulting governments were immune from legal action by foreign creditors. This paper shows that this is no longer the case. Building a dataset covering four decades, we find that creditor lawsuits have become an increasingly common feature of sovereign debt markets. The legal developments have strengthened the hands of creditors and raised the cost of default for debtors. We show that legal disputes in the US and the UK disrupt government access to international capital markets, as foreign courts can impose a financial embargo on sovereigns. The findings are consistent with theoretical models with creditor sanctions and suggest that sovereign debt is becoming more enforceable. We discuss how the threat of litigation affects debt management, government willingness to pay, and the resolution of debt crises.
H63|How Much Binding Is the Bill?|We study whether and how much the interest bill conditions the size and composition of public expenditures. The group of EU 15 countries over the 1995-2016 period is the object of analysis. We study both total public expenditures and public expenditures by function of government in order to unveil which sectors are more responsive to an interest bill variation.
H63|Resolving sovereign debt crises: The role of political risk|Sovereign defaults are bad news for investors and debtor countries, in particular if a default becomes messy and protracted. Why are some debt crises resolved quickly, in a matter of months, while others take many years to settle? This paper studies the duration of sovereign debt crises based on a new dataset and case study archive on debt renegotiations between governments and foreign banks and bondholders. Using Cox proportional hazard models, I find that domestic political instability ('political risk') is a significant predictor of negotiation delays, after controlling for macroeconomic conditions. Government crises, resignations, and street protests are particularly disruptive for a quick settlement process. Overall, the evidence suggests that debtor countries often lack the political ability to resolve a debt crisis. Governments in turmoil are unlikely to exit a default quickly.
H63|Reserves For All? Central Bank Digital Currency, Deposits, and their (Non)-Equivalence|"I offer a macroeconomic perspective on the ""Reserves for All"" (RFA) proposal to let the general public use electronic central bank money. After distinguishing RFA from cryptocurrencies and relating the proposal to discussions about narrow banking and the abolition of cash I propose an equivalence result according to which a marginal substitution of outside for inside money does not affect macroeconomic outcomes. I identify key conditions on bank and government (central bank) incentives for equivalence and argue that these conditions likely are violated, implying that RFA would change macroeconomic outcomes. I also relate my analysis to common arguments in the discussion about RFA and point to inconsistencies and open questions."
H63|Fiscal Sustainability in the EU After the Global Crisis: Is there any Progress?|In response to the global crisis a number of new institutional measures have been introduced in the fiscal framework, both on the UE and on the member states’ level, and the question is: have these measures provided better fiscal sustainability outcomes? We approach this question by looking at the evolution of fiscal sustainability in Poland, which is an interesting case of a member state that without significant market pressure (the only EU country without recession during the crisis) actively promoted several changes in the EU fiscal framework (e.g. 6-pack) and effectively internalized some of these key changes in its domestic fiscal policy, including a domestic expenditure fiscal rule. Our analysis reveals that the fiscal sustainability in Poland has significantly improved in the post-crisis period of 2009-2017: we detect both improvement of the fiscal sustainability parameters and structural breaks in the fiscal outcomes after the crisis. Namely, in comparison to the whole sample of 2004-2017 the strength of reaction of the primary deficit to a change of the public debt increased in the post-crisis time by nearly 50%. Importantly, these results are robust with respect to the pension fund reform which led to a one-off redemption of T-bonds in amount of 8.5% of GDP. The analysis also reveals a cycle of structural breaks of 2-and 4 years lags: for the output gap in 2008 Q4, for the primary deficit in 2010 Q4 and for the public debt in 2014 Q1. The case of Poland seems to suggest that the post-crisis EU fiscal measures can be effectively used to increase fiscal sustainability, if properly approached and internalized into the domestic fiscal framework. More research should be devoted to understanding the political and economic conditions under which such positive outcomes were possible.
H63|Reversible Environmental Catastrophes with Disconnected Generations|We study environmental policy in an economy-ecology model featuring multiple deterministic stable steady-state ecological equilibria. The economy-ecology does not settle in either of the deterministic steady states as the environmental system is hit by random shocks. Individual live for two periods and derive utility from the (stochastic) quality of the environment. They feature warm-glow preferences and therefore will engage in private abatement in order to slightly influence the stochastic process governing environmental quality. The government may also conduct abatement activities or introduce environmental taxes. We solve for the market equilibrium abstracting from public abatement and taxes and show that the ecological process may get stuck for extended periods of time fluctuating around the heavily polluted (low quality) deterministic steady state. These events are called environmental catastrophes. They are not irreversible, however, as the system typically switches back to the basin of attraction associated with the good (high quality) deterministic steady state. The paper also compares the stationary distributions for environmental quality and individuals’ welfare arising under the unmanaged economy and in the first-best social optimum.
H63|The Monetary and Fiscal History of Brazil, 1960-2016|Brazil has had a long period of high inflation. It peaked around 100 percent per year in 1964, decreased until the first oil shock (1973), but accelerated again afterward, reaching levels above 100 percent on average between 1980 and 1994. This last period coincided with severe balance of payments problems and economic stagnation that followed the external debt crisis in the early 1980s. We show that the high-inflation period (1960-1994) was characterized by a combination of fiscal deficits, passive monetary policy, and constraints on debt financing. The transition to the low-inflation period (1995-2016) was characterized by improvements in all of these features, but it did not lead to significant improvements in economic growth. In addition, we document a strong positive correlation between inflation rates and seigniorage revenues, although inflation rates are relatively high for modest levels of seigniorage revenues. Finally, we discuss the role of the weak institutional framework surrounding the fiscal and monetary authorities and the role of monetary passiveness and inflation indexation in accounting for the unique features of inflation dynamics in Brazil.
H63|Sostenibilidad de la deuda pública en Colombia|Este artículo presenta un análisis sobre la sostenibilidad de la deuda pública en Colombia para el periodo 2012-2016. Se procede en dos partes: la primera corresponde al estado del arte en esta materia, se incluye una serie de definiciones y distinciones clave, así como los elementos relevantes de la teoría económica —siendo el criterio de sostenibilidad de Blanchard (1990) el indicador más importante—. Al mismo tiempo, se presentan las disposiciones jurídicas que enmarcan el manejo de la deuda por parte del Estado. Adicionalmente, se muestra que la trayectoria de la deuda impacta no sólo las finanzas públicas, sino que también afecta la desigualdad y los objetivos de crecimiento y desarrollo del país. La segunda parte expone la evidencia empírica. Se centra en la discusión de los elementos macroeconómicos y sociopolíticos que han incidido en la dinámica de la deuda durante este periodo. Para ello, se incorpora una simulación de largo plazo del organismo de control y se plantea que la sostenibilidad requiere, más allá del cumplimiento de los criterios de teoría económica —particularmente el de Blanchard— de una serie de decisiones políticas en torno a la estructura tributaria y productiva del país, en relación con los objetivos de crecimiento y desarrollo económico. Para finalizar, se introduce una serie de conclusiones que permiten sintetizar los hallazgos presentados y servir de insumo para las discusiones de política económica que se requieren en torno al manejo responsable y sostenible de la deuda.
H63|Colombia y la deuda externa: revisión de las medidas de cumplimiento en el contexto de la crisis de los 80´s|El elevado endeudamiento externo contraído por los países emergentes latinoamericanos como herramienta complementaria del ahorro interno, desencadenó la crisis de la deuda en los años 80´s. Colombia, a diferencia de sus países vecinos, impulsado por las bonanzas cafeteras y por niveles de gasto inferiores, logró sobreponerse y superar parcialmente la crisis internacional, evitando reestructurar la deuda bajo las condiciones impuestas por entes multilaterales. El gobierno nacional debió entablar relaciones particulares con la banca privada, en busca de créditos sindicados que le garantizaran la liquidez necesaria para continuar efectuando los pagos de la deuda y no declarar una posible moratoria. Colombia, firmó un total de 4 créditos sindicados, permitiendo estos la refinanciación requerida. El país sobresalió como un caso de excepción. ***** The high external debt contracted by the emergent Latin-American countries, as complementary tool of the internal saving, triggered the Crisis of the debt in the Eighties.Colombia, unlike his neighbouring countries, stimulated by the coffee prosperity and by low levels of expense, managed to superimpose and to excel partially the international crisis, avoiding restructuring the debt under the conditions imposed by multilateral entities. Colombian government, begun particular relations with the private banking, in search of unionized credits, which were guaranteeing the necessary liquidity to continue effecting the payments of the debt and to not declare a possible moratorium. Colombia, signed a total of 4 unionized credits, allowing the needed refunding. The country stood out as an exceptional case.

H63|Debt overhang and investment efficiency|Using a pan-European data set of 8.5 million firms, this paper finds that firms with high debt overhang invest relatively more than otherwise similar firms if they are operating in sectors facing good global growth opportunities. At the same time, the positive impact of a marginal increase in debt on investment efficiency disappears if firm debt is already excessive, if it is dominated by short maturities, and during systemic banking crises. The results are consistent with theories of the disciplining role of debt, as well as with models highlighting the negative link between agency problems at firms and banks and investment efficiency.
H63|The Search for a Euro Area Safe Asset|"This paper evaluates four approaches to creating ""safe assets"" or asset portfolios for the euro area: (1) a diversified portfolio of senior tranches of sovereign debt (""national tranching""); (2) a senior security backed by a diversified pool of national sovereign debt (""ESBies""); (3) debt issued by a senior financial intermediary, backed by a diversified pool of national debt (""E-bonds""); and (4) debt issued by a euro area budget or a leveraged wealth fund, based on member state contributions or dedicated direct revenue sources. None of these approaches envisages explicit guarantees by member states, and all could potentially produce safe assets in sufficient quantities to replace euro area sovereign bond holdings in euro area banks. At the same time, the four approaches differ across several important dimensions. A euro area budget or wealth fund could create the largest volume of safe assets, followed by ESBies, E-bonds, and national tranching. A euro area budget or wealth fund is also likely to have the lowest impact on the structure and liquidity of national bond markets, while national tranching would have the largest impact. ESBies and E-bonds occupy an intermediate position. ESBies and potentially bonds issued by a euro area budget would offer their holders greater protection from deep national defaults than the other two proposals. Both ESBies and national tranching would avoid cross-country redistribution by construction, whereas E-bonds and a euro area budget could have significant distributional consequences, depending on their design. E-bonds are unique in that they would raise the marginal cost of sovereign debt issuance at higher levels of debt, thereby exerting fiscal discipline, without necessarily raising average debt costs for lower-rated borrowers."
H63|Does Public Debt Crowd Out Corporate Investment? International Evidence|Using data for advanced and emerging economies, we show that there is a negative correlation between public debt and corporate investment. Industry-level regressions show that high levels of government debt are particularly damaging for industries that need more external ?financial resources. Firm-level regressions show that government debt increases the sensitivity of corporate investment to cash ?flow. These results indicate that the relationship between public debt and investment is likely to be causal and that public debt crowds out corporate investment by tightening credit constraints.
H63|Sovereign Default in a Monetary Union|In the aftermath of the global fi nancial crisis, sovereign default risk and the zero lower bound have limited the ability of policy-makers in the European monetary union to achieve their stabilization objective. This paper investigates the interaction between sovereign default risk and the conduct of monetary policy, when borrowers can act strategically and they share with their lenders a single currency in a monetary union. We address this question in an endogenous sovereign default model of heterogeneous countries in a monetary union, where the monetary authority may be constrained by the zero lower bound. We uncover three main results. First, in normal times, debtors have a stronger incentive to default to induce more expansionary monetary policy. Second, the zero lower bound, or constraints on monetary policy, may act as a disciplining device to enforce repayment of sovereign debt. Third, sovereign default risk induces countries with a preference for tight monetary policy to accept a laxer policy stance. These results help to shed light on the recent European experience of high default risk, expansionary monetary policy and low nominal interest rates.

H63|(At Least) Four Theories for Sovereign Default|Why do some sovereigns repay their debts while others default? I empirically study four theories for default (or its avoidance): (i) reputation, (ii) punishment, (iii) domestic politics, and (iv) international spillovers. Running horse races for a large sample of developing and emerging economies (1970-2015) I find that reputation and spillover effects dominate in terms of economic significance; there is less convincing evidence for punishment effects or political factors. In robustness checks I allow for the transmission of each theory strand through macro-fundamentals, account for capital controls, debt relief, and capital flow bonanzas, investigate domestic, private and present-value external debt, and conduct sample splitting exercises (by exchange rate arrangement, political regime, financial development, and time period). Though they provide more refined insights into the differential mechanisms at work, none of these exercises substantially alter the above conclusions.
H63|Real Interest Rates, Inflation, and Default|This paper argues that the comovement between inflation and economic activity is an important determinant of real interest rates over time and across countries. First, we show that for advanced economies, periods with more procyclical inflation are associated with lower real rates, but only when there is no risk of default on government debt. Second, we present a model of nominal sovereign debt with domestic risk-averse lenders. With procyclical inflation, nominal bonds pay out more in bad times, making them a good hedge against aggregate risk. In the absence of default risk, procyclical inflation yields lower real rates. However, procyclicality implies that the government needs to make larger (real) payments when the economy deteriorates, which could increase default risk and trigger an increase in real rates. The patterns of real rates predicted by the model are quantitatively consistent with those documented in the data.
H63|Fiscal sustainability vs. fiscal stability: tax and debt under entitlement spending|Economists have traditionally used a rule that restricts primary deficits to less than a threshold determined by the interest-growth rate differential and existing debt in order to judge fiscal sustainability. This rule derives from a single period application of the government’s budget constraint. It is not forward looking. It does not allow for the predictable dynamics of spending liabilities, such as entitlement spending, and assumes immediate and infinitely elastic tax or spending adjustments that are unlikely to be feasible in practice. To address this issue, we derive the equivalent dynamic rule: the primary surplus needs to match any expected discounted increases in public spending, the net interest on existing debt, and terms reflecting the cost of extending debt relative to changing taxes. We find strong and robust empirical evidence supporting the model and we calibrate our model to analyze the impact of shocks to future sustainability (as opposed to current stability, a crucial distinctio n) in different countries.
H63|Life after default? Private vs. official sovereign debt restructurings|This paper studies the relationship between sovereign debt default and annual GDP growth taking into account the depth of a debt restructuring and distinguishing between commercial and official sovereign debt restructurings. Analyzing 73 default episodes in 117 countries over the period 1975-2013, I fiÂ…nd that defaults are correlated with contraction of short-term output growth. Most importantly, controlling for the severity of the default, I am able to detect a more lasting and negative link between default and growth. While higher private haircuts imply a negative stigma which is associated to lower growth over a longer period, higher amount of official restructuring may have some costs in the short-run, but are associated to an increase in growth in the long run. Adopting an alternative speciÂ…cation, in which the dependent variable is a countryÂ’'s credit rating, I fiÂ…nd very similar results for private haircuts and official restructurings. They are both associated to lower ratings up to seven years after the default. To the extent that credit ratings is a good proxy for borrowing costs, positive growth prospects for official defaulters seem not to be inÂ‡uenced by a lower reputation in the credit markets.
H63|Curse or Blessing? Has the Impact of Debt Relief Lived up to Expectations? A Review of the Effects of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiatives for Low-Income Countries| As the multilateral debt relief initiatives draw to a close, this article reviews the impacts of debt relief to low-income countries (LICs) building on both the theoretical and empirical literature of past decades. We show that, while the pioneering studies of the early 2000s are inconclusive, the most recent analyses overcome certain methodological impediments to highlight significant multilateral debt relief initiative effects. These analyses hence suggest that these large-scale programmes may well have met expectations, at least in part.
H63|Early Warning System of Government Debt Crises|The European debt crisis has revealed serious deficiencies and risks on a proper functioning of the monetary union. Against this backdrop, early warning systems are of crucial importance. In this study that focuses on euro area member states, the robustness of early warning systems to predict crises of government debt is evaluated. Robustness is captured via several dimensions, such as the chronology of past crises, econometric methods, and the selection of indicators in forecast combinations. The chosen approach is shown to be crucial for the results. Therefore, the construction of early warning systems should be based on a wide set of variables and methods in order to be able to draw reliable conclusions.
H63|Réduction du ratio de dette publique : quels instruments pour quels effets ?|"In the wake of the economic crisis in 2007-2008, european sovereign debt showed a large increase.As a consequence, the possibility of starting a stabilization or a reduction of public debt ratio hasbecome a critical issue for the coming years to restore fiscal sustainability and to ensure compliancewith the european treaties. Against this background, the identification of the most appropriatepolicies to reduce public debt ratio represents a major economic issue, especially in times of loweconomic growth. The purpose of this article is to assess the ability of different fiscal policies instrumentsto reduce public debt ratio. From a methodological point of view, we estimate, based onFrench data, a non-linear model (Threshold VAR) including the main determinants of public debtratio : public spending, tax revenues, GDP and price index. The threshold VAR model allows usto distinguish economic expansion from economic recession and therefore to take into account thevariability of the multipliers over time. We couple the TVAR model with the public debt accountingequation in order to ""transfer"" the effect of a shock from a endogeneous variable to public debtratio. We then show that a cut in public spending can result in an increase in the public debtratio in the short term, moreover this effect is significantly higher in recession times. Inversely, anincrease in tax revenues lead to a decrease in the public debt ratio, in the short term, whatever theconsidered regime."
H63|The effect of non-resident investments on the French sovereign spread|Cross-border investments in public debt securities are a key driver of sovereign yields. Everything else being equal, higher external demand lowers the cost of public financing through debt. However, from a financial stability perspective, it seems important to assess the resilience of sovereign debt against non-resident divestments, as cross-border flows tend to be volatile.Our paper adresses this issue for the French public debt. It relies on estimating the increase in yields that is necessary for the domestic financial sector to reallocate enough of its securities portfolio to compensate for hypothetical non-resident divestments.Our results indicate that if the share of non-residents in non-central bank holdings of French public debt had decreased regularly by an extra 1.25 pp compared to actual evolution, over the year from 2016-Q3 to 2017-Q3 (hence amounting to a 5 pp decrease in total), the sovereign yield would have been by around 40bp higher in 2017-Q3. Given the amount and the maturity of gross debt issuances over this period, and using the German bund yield curves for discounting, the corresponding extra cost for public finances in 2017-Q3 would have been around 6Bn €.
H63|Deficit-debt adjustment (DDA) analysis: an analytical tool to assess the consistency of government finance statistics|This statistical paper describes and explains a specific tool enabling statisticians to gain additional insights and assess the consistency of government finance statistics (GFS): analysis of the deficit-debt adjustment (DDA), or stock-flow adjustment (SFA). The DDA reconciles two key government indicators – the government deficit/surplus and government debt. DDA analysis helps to establish whether these statistics are plausible and reliable by exploring the consistency between governments’ non-financial accounts (measuring the government deficit/surplus) and financial accounts (measuring government debt at market value). It also takes into account valuation differences between the financial accounts and government debt measured at face value (Maastricht debt). Recent years’ GFS for the euro area aggregate and the individual euro area countries (and, where useful, other EU Member States’ data) are used to illustrate DDA analysis. The dataset bridging the government deficit and the change in government debt reveals many aspects of a government’s economic policies. For instance, the components of the DDA shed light on its equity investments or privatisations, its use of investment in financial reserves, some aspects of its debt management and the accumulation of fiscal or social arrears.

H63|Politics, banks, and sub-sovereign debt: Unholy trinity or divine coincidence?|We exploit election-driven turnover in State and local governments in Germany to study how banks adjust their securities portfolios in response to the loss of political connections. We find that local savings banks, which are owned by their host county and supervised by local politicians, increase significantly their holdings of home-State sovereign bonds when the local government and the State government are dominated by different political parties. Banks' holdings of other securities, like federal bonds, bonds issued by other States, or stocks, are not affected by election outcomes. We argue that banks use sub-sovereign bond purchases to gain access to politically distant government authorities.
H63|Beyond spreads: Measuring sovereign market stress in the euro area|We develop a novel composite indicator to measure sovereign bond market stress in the euro area. The indicator integrates yield and liquidity spreads along with volatility into an overall measure of sovereign market stress. An application to the spillover literature suggests that stress mainly originates from a few countries, but that spillover patterns also vary over time.
H63|Government Debt And Banking Fragility: The Spreading Of Strategic Uncertainty|This article studies the interaction of government debt and financial markets. This interaction, termed a “diabolic loop,” is driven by government choice to bail out banks and the resulting incentives for banks to hold government debt instead of self‐insure through equity buffers. We highlight the role of bank equity issuance in determining whether the “diabolic loop” is a Nash equilibrium of the interaction between banks and the government. When equity is issued, no diabolic loop exists. In equilibrium, banks' rational expectations of a bailout ensure that no equity is issued and the sovereign‐bank loop is operative.
H63|Debt overhang and investment eﬃciency|Using a pan-European dataset of 8.5 million firms, we find that firms with high debt overhang invest relatively more than otherwise similar firms if they are operating in sectors facing good global growth opportunities. At the same time, the positive impact of a marginal increase in debt on investment efficiency disappears if firm debt is already excessive, if it is dominated by short maturities, and during systemic banking crises. Our results are consistent with theories of the disciplining role of debt, as well as with models highlighting the negative link between agency problems at firms and banks and investment efficiency. JEL Classification: E22, E44, G21, H63
H63|Gambling traps|I propose a dynamic general equilibrium model in which strategic interactions between banks and depositors may lead to endogenous bank fragility and slow recovery from crises. When banks’ investment decisions are not contractible, depositors form expectations about bank risk-taking and demand a return on deposits according to their risk. This creates strategic complementarities and possibly multiple equilibria: in response to an increase in funding costs, banks may optimally choose to pursue risky portfolios that undermine their solvency prospects. In a bad equilibrium, high funding costs hinder the accumulation of bank net worth and lead to a “gambling trap” with a persistent drop in investment and output. I bring the model to bear on the European sovereign debt crisis, in the course of which under-capitalized banks in default-risky countries experienced an increase in funding costs and raised their holdings of domestic government debt. The model is quantied using Portuguese data and accounts for macroeconomic dynamics in Portugal in 2010-2016. Policy interventions face a trade-off between alleviating banks’ funding conditions and strengthening risk-taking incentives. Liquidity provision to banks may perpetuate gambling traps when not targeted. Targeted interventions have the capacity to eliminate adverse equilibria.

H63|"""We can't pay"": How Italy cancelled war debts after Lausanne"|The paper deals with Italian inter-war debts, against the background of the very contentious international issue of war reparations that many Allied nations wanted to link to war debt repayments. While the bulk of the literature looks at the Lausanne conference of 1932 as an act of forgiveness of war debts, we show that Italy, having first achieved an extremely large haircut by restructuring US and UK debts in 1925-26, defaulted after Lausanne. We also present a new times series on Italian foreign debt from 1925 to 1934, a series that is consistent with the unfolding of relevant historical events.
H63|Public Debt Frontier. A toolkit for analyzing fiscal policy and debt sustainability|This paper provides a twofold contribution. First, it proposes a synthetic and visual indicator to assess public debt sustainability. This indicator summarizes in a single diagram the linkage between economic activity, government’s budget, and the maximum amount of public debt that is sustainable in the long run. The backing theory is a neoclassical growth model augmented with endogenous tax revenues, disaggregated public spending, different production technologies for public and private goods, non-atomistic wage setters in public labor (unions), and a fully specified maturity curve for public bonds. The second contribution of the paper is to develop and present a stand-alone software that analyzes public debt sustainability in response to variations of fiscal policy. This toolkit is useful for managing public debt or to place an additional constraint on government’s budget. We provide an example of its usage for the emblematic case of Greece during the last public debt crisis.
H63|Sovereign Bail-Outs and Fiscal Rules in a Banking Union|This paper studies optimal fiscal rules in a two-country economy in which cross-country linkages between sovereign debts and banking sectors motivate bail-outs among countries. The first-best sovereign borrowing, which is contingent on countries' output gap, cannot be achieved in the presence of asymmetric information on a country's potential output. Because bail-out induces overborrowing, fiscal rules can be implemented to prevent the ensuing inefficiency. A mechanism can be designed to induce a country with low potential output (i.e., a small negative output gap) to run an optimal budget deficit upon receiving a (ex-post) transfer from the other country. We characterize conditions under which this `cyclically- contingent' fiscal mechanism Pareto dominates an alternative `cyclically-adjusted' fiscal rule imposing a unique ceiling on a country's borrowing, independently of its potential output.
H63|Is a Fiscal Policy Council needed in Poland?|Unsustainability and procyclicality of fiscal policy are problems that many developed countries face. The public debt crisis revealed that fiscal rules are a useful but insufficient instrument for mitigating them. A large and growing group of economists are calling for the creation of ‘fiscal policy councils’ – independent collegial bodies made up of experts whose role is to act as independent reviewers of government policy and advise the government and parliament on fiscal policy. Such councils currently exist in at least 40 countries. Poland is the only EU country that does not have a fiscal policy council. The aim of this paper is to address the issue of whether a fiscal policy council is needed in Poland and what kind of additional contribution such a council might make to the public debate on fiscal policy.
H63|Optimizing the Hungarian Government Debt Portfolio|We construct an optimal debt portfolio model with the purpose of optimizing the Hungarian government debt portfolio. To analyze the characteristics of the costs and corresponding risk factors of the Hungarian debt portfolio we simulate issuances of chosen instruments on a specified time horizon. We apply a multiobjective optimization scheme to construct compositions of financing that minimize the costs and risks of the debt portfolio. Our purpose is to find the set of Pareto-optimal solutions that minimize expected costs, volatility of costs and refinancing risks while maximizing average time to re-fixing. The results of the multiobjective optimization can be used to help in constructing a medium term debt management strategy.
H63|Zur strukturellen Finanzlage der Laender: eine aktuelle Auswertung und Methodenkritik|Seit Einfuehrung der neuen Schuldenregel hat sich die Finanzlage der deutschen Bundeslaender deutlich verbessert. Nach unseren Berechnungen mit dem Aggregierten Quotierungsverfahren konnten die meisten Laender ihre strukturellen Budgetdefizite abbauen und im Jahr 2017 schon 14 Laender strukturelle Budgetueberschuesse erzielen; lediglich das Saarland und Nordrhein-Westfalen wiesen strukturelle Defizite auf. Die „strukturelle“ Besserung überzeichnet indes die Konsolidierungsfortschritte, denn sie ist zum grossen Teil dem historisch niedrigen Zinsniveau zu verdanken, das zu erheblichen Einsparungen beim Schuldendienst fuehrte. Da die Finanzierungskonditionen aber nicht dauerhaft so guenstig bleiben wie in den vergangenen Jahren, verdecken die Zinsersparnisse den bei vielen Laendern noch bestehenden Konsolidierungsbedarf. Wir plaedieren daher dafuer, nur nachhaltige Einsparungen bei den Zinslasten als strukturelle Besserung zu klassifizieren und entwickeln ein Bereinigungsverfahren, das neben den Konjunktureinfluessen auch die Verzerrung durch das aeusserst niedrige Zinsniveau beachtet. Unsere Simulationen zeigen, dass nach einer Bereinigung um die nicht nachhaltigen Einsparungen beim Schuldendienst nicht mehr 14, sondern nur neun Laender im Jahr 2017 einen strukturell mindestens ausgeglichenen Haushalt erzielt haben. Bei den verbleibenden sieben Laendern besteht teilweise noch erheblicher Konsolidierungsbedarf. Wir zeigen darueber hinaus, dass die zur quantitativen Vergleichbarkeit der Laenderfinanzen in der Regel verwandten Einwohner-Indikatoren wesentliche Strukturunterschiede zwischen den Laendern unberuecksichtigt lassen und damit zu irrefuehrenden Schlussfolgerungen fuehren koennen. Wir empfehlen daher, bei Laendervergleichen Kennzahlen zu verwenden, die strukturelle Unterschiede zwischen den Laendern bei Erwerbstaetigkeit und Produktivitaet beachten.
H63|Confederation debt management since 1970|This paper presents new data vintages on marketable debt emissions and total outstanding debt. The data are used to analyze the Swiss Confederation’s issuing behavior and debt management. Issuing behavior became more regular and demand-oriented during the early 1990s. The Treasury actively manages roll-over risk by increasing bond maturity with increasing marketable debt to GDP levels. Furthermore, the Treasury engages in active but asymmetric, one-sided interest rate positioning. In other words, the Treasury uses only bonds to affect debt maturity and does so only when the interest rate environment is favorable to lock-in interest rates by issuing longer-term bonds.
