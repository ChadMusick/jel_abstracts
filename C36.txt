C36|“If You Were Me”: Proxy Respondents’ Biases in Population Health Surveys|Proxy respondents are widely used in population health surveys to maximize response rates. When surveys target frail elderly, the measurement error is expected to be smaller than selection or participation biases. However, in the literature on elderly needs for care, proxy use is most often considered with a dummy variable in which endogeneity with subjects’ health status is rarely scrutinised in a robust way. Pitfalls of this choice extend beyond methodological issues. Indeed, the mismeasurement of needs for care with daily activities might lead to irrelevant social policies or to private initiatives that try to address those needs. This paper proposes a comprehensive and tractable strategy supported by various robustness checks to cope with the suspected endogeneity of proxy use to the unobserved health status of subjects in reports of needs for care with activities of daily living. Proxy respondents’ subjectivity is found to inflate the needs of the elderly who are replaced or assisted in answering the questionnaire and to deflate the probability of unmet or undermet needs.
C36|Asymptotic theory for clustered samples|We provide a complete asymptotic distribution theory for clustered data with a large number of independent groups, generalizing the classic laws of large numbers, uniform laws, central limit theory, and clustered covariance matrix estimation. Our theory allows for clustered observations with heterogeneous and unbounded cluster sizes. Our conditions cleanly nest the classical results for i.n.i.d. observations, in the sense that our conditions specialize to the classical conditions under independent sampling. We use this theory to develop a full asymptotic distribution theory for estimation based on linear least-squares, 2SLS, nonlinear MLE, and nonlinear GMM.
C36|Identification and estimation of triangular models with a binary treatment|I study the identification and estimation of a nonseparable triangular model with an endogenous binary treatment. Unlike other studies, I do not impose rank invariance or rank similarity on the unobservable of the outcome equation. Instead, I achieve identification using continuous variation of the instrument and a shape restriction on the distribution of the unobservables, which is modeled with a copula. The latter captures the endogeneity of the model and is one of the components of the marginal treatment effect, making it informative about the effects of extending the treatment to untreated individuals. The estimation is a multi-step procedure based on rotated quantile regression. Finally, I use the estimator to revisit the effects of Work First Job Placements on future earnings.
C36|Asymptotic F Tests under Possibly Weak Identification|This paper develops asymptotic F tests robust to weak identification and temporal dependence. The test statistics are modified versions of the S statistic of Stock and Wright (2000) and the K statistic of Kleibergen (2005), both of which are based on the continuous updating generalized method of moments. In the former case, the modification involves only a multiplicative degree-of-freedom adjustment. In the latter case, the modification involves an additional multiplicative adjustment that uses a J statistic for testing overidentification. By adopting fixed-smoothing asymptotics, we show that both the modified S statistic and the modified K statistic are asymptotically F-distributed. The asymptotic F theory accounts for the estimation errors in the underlying heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation robust variance estimators, which the asymptotic chi-squared theory ignores. Monte Carlo simulations show that the F approximations are much more accurate than the corresponding chi-squared approximations in finite samples.
C36|Let the Data Speak? On the Importance of Theory-Based Instrumental Variable Estimations|In absence of randomized controlled experiments, identification is often aimed via instrumental variable (IV) strategies, typically two-stage least squares estimations. According to Bayes' rule, however, under a low ex ante probability that a hypothesis is true (e.g. that an excluded instrument is partially correlated with an endogenous regressor), the interpretation of the estimation results may be fundamentally flawed. This paper argues that rigorous theoretical reasoning is key to design credible identification strategies, aforemost finding candidates for valid instruments. We discuss prominent IV analyses from the macro-development literature to illustrate the potential benefit of structurally derived IV approaches.
C36|Risk Aversion and Entrepreneurship: New Evidence Exploiting Exposure to Massive Earthquakes in Italy|This paper investigates the impact of risk attitudes on the decision to become an entrepreneur. In contrast to previous research, we handle endogeneity issues relying on an instrumental variables strategy considering as a source of exogenous variation in risk aversion the early exposure to a massive earthquake. Using several waves of the Bank of Italy Survey of Household Income and Wealth (SHIW), we find that individuals experiencing an earthquake become significantly more risk averse. Second-stage estimates show that risk aversion has a significant negative impact on the probability of becoming an entrepreneur.
C36|The Graduation approach for the reduction of extreme poverty: impact evaluation of Sembrando Oportunidades Familia por Familia in Paraguay|Rural poverty, a widespread problem for the Paraguayan government over the last decade –as well as for other economies in the region-, led to the implementation, in 2016 and 2017, of the “Sembrando Oportunidades Familia por Familia” pilot program, an initiative based on the graduation approach to reduce the incidence of extreme poverty in rural areas. Evaluating the intervention results is essential to understand the effectiveness of this approach in reducing poverty in the Paraguayan context, where the government is in charge of its implementation. For this evaluation, an instrumental-variable impact evaluation and a results evaluation were conducted, showing significant positive changes in the treated households’ productive capacity and savings behavior as well in their perception of wellbeing. These results are useful for the design of a program that can help to effectively overcome extreme poverty in this and other developing countries. This exercise is part of the set of evaluations carried out by the Platform for Evaluation and Learning of the Graduation Program in Latin America (www.plataformagraduacionla.info).
C36|Identification with external instruments in structural VARs under partial invertibility|This paper discusses the conditions for indentification with external instruments in Structural VARs under partial invertibility. We observe that in this case the shocks of interest and their effects can be recovered using an external instrument, provided that a condition of limited lag exogeneity holds. This condition is weaker than that required for LP-IV, and allows for recoverability of impact effects also une VAR misspecification. We assess our claims in a simulated environment, and provide an emirical application to the relevant cas of identification of monetary policy shocks.
C36|Mothers and Fathers : Education, Co-residence and Child Health|We use four waves of Demographic and Health Surveys from Zimbabwe to evaluate the effect of mother’s and father’s education on child health outcomes. We identify causal effects using the 1980 education reform. A simultaneous-equation model is estimated to take into account possible selection and endogeneity biases. Our results suggest some specialization within parents, as mothers and fathers do not affect the same health outcomes of their under-5 children. Fathers matter more than mothers, and mother’s education improves health only when she is matched to a low-educated man. There is selection in our sample, as is usual. The inverse Mills ratio capturing the likelihood of living with one’s father or mother significantly affects child health. Last, parental educational sorting is shown to be important, so that estimation that does not take both mother’s and father’s education into account will produce biased results.
C36|Facts and Fiction in Oil Market Modeling|Baumeister and Hamilton (2019a) assert that every critique of their work on oil markets by Kilian and Zhou (2019a) is without merit. In addition, they make the case that key aspects of the economic and econometric analysis in the widely used oil market model of Kilian and Murphy (2014) and its precursors are incorrect. Their critiques are also directed at other researchers who have worked in this area and, more generally, extend to research using structural VAR models outside of energy economics. The purpose of this paper is to help the reader understand what the real issues are in this debate. The focus is not only on correcting important misunderstandings in the recent literature, but on the substantive and methodological insights generated by this exchange, which are of broader interest to applied researchers.

C36|Assortative Mating on Education: A Genetic Assessment|We investigate assortative mating on education using a sample of couples from the Health and Retirement Study. We estimate a reduced-form linear matching function, which links wife's education to husband's education and both wife's and husband's unobservable characteristics. Using OLS we find that an additional year in husband's education is associated with an average increase in wife's education of 0.4 years. To deal with omitted variable bias due to unobservable characteristics, we use a measure of genetic propensity (polygenic score) for husband's education as an instrumental variable. Assuming that our instrument is valid, our 2SLS estimate suggests that an additional year in husband's education increases wife's education by about 0.5 years. Since greater genetic propensity for educational attainment has been linked to a range of personality and cognitive skills, we allow for the possibility that the exclusion restriction is violated using the plausible exogenous approach by Conley et al. (2012). 'True' assortativeness on education cannot be ruled out, as long as one standard deviation increase in husband's genetic propensity for education directly increases wife's education by less than 0.2 years.
C36|Direct and Network Effects of Idiosyncratic TFP Shocks|This study investigates the direct and intersectoral network effects of idiosyncratic TFP shocks on sectors’ growth in the context of US manufacturing industries. To deal with the potential endogeneity of TFP, we propose a novel set of instruments for contemporaneous regressors. These instruments are technology shocks identiﬁed via sign restriction from sectoral SVAR models. Using US input-output tables and industry-level data, we quantify direct and network-based effects of the shocks. Our results show that idiosyncratic technology shocks propagate mostly downstream the network. In addition, we capture strong contemporaneous direct effects of the shocks.
C36|Cash is King - Effects of ECB's Conventional and Unconventional Measures|In this paper we distinguish the responses of conventional and unconventional monetary policy measures on macroeconomic variables, using a high frequency data set which measures the impact of the ECB's monetary policy decisions. For the period 2002:01 to 2019:06 we show that unconventional and conventional monetary policy measures dffer considerably with respect to inflation. While conventional measures show the expected response, i.e. an interest rate cut increases inflation and vice versa, unconventional measure appear to have no signicant influence. But this holds not for QE, which is found to have similar influence on inflation as conventional interest rate changes.
C36|Time-Varying Local Projections| In recent years local projections have become a more and more popular methodology for the estimation of impulse responses. Besides being relatively easy to implement, the main strength of this approach relative to the traditional VAR one is that there is no need to impose any specific assumption on the dynamics of the data. This paper models local projections in a time-varying framework and provides a Gibbs sampler routine to estimate them. A simulation study shows how the performance of the algorithm is satisfactory while the usefulness of the model developed here is shown through an application to fiscal policy shocks.
C36|A Doubly Corrected Robust Variance Estimator for Linear GMM|We propose a new finite sample corrected variance estimator for the linear generalized method of moments (GMM) including the one-step, two-step, and iterated estimators. Our formula additionally corrects for the over-identification bias in variance estimation on top of the commonly used finite sample correction of Windmeijer (2005) which corrects for the bias from estimating the efficient weight matrix, so is doubly corrected. Formal stochastic expansions are derived to show the proposed double correction estimates the variance of some higher-order terms in the expansion. In addition, the proposed double correction provides robustness to misspecification of the moment condition. In contrast, the conventional variance estimator and the Windmeijer correction are inconsistent under misspecification. That is, the proposed double correction formula provides a convenient way to obtain improved inference under correct specification and robustness against misspecification at the same time.
C36|Heterogeneous effects of credit constraints on SMEs’ employment: Evidence from the European sovereign debt crisis|This paper takes advantage of access to detailed matched bank-firm data to investigate whether and how employment decisions of SMEs have been affected by credit constraints during the European sovereign debt crisis. Variability in banks’ financial health following the 2008 crisis is used as an exogenous determinant of firms’ access to credit. Findings, relative to the Belgian economy, clearly highlight that credit matters. They show that SMEs borrowing money from pre-crisis financially less healthy banks were significantly more likely to be affected by a credit constraint and, in turn, to adjust their labour input downwards than pre-crisis clients of more healthy banks. These results are robust across types of loan applications that were denied credit, i.e. applications to finance working capital, debt or new investments. Yet, estimates also show that credit constraints have been essentially detrimental for employment among SMEs experiencing a negative demand shock or facing strong product market competition. In terms of human resources management, credit constraints are not only found to foster employment adjustment at the extensive margin but also to increase the use of temporary layoff allowances for economic reasons. This outcome supports the hypothesis that short-time compensation programmes contribute to save jobs during recessions.
C36|Identiﬁcation with External Instruments in Structural VARs under Partial Invertibility|This paper discusses the conditions for identiﬁcation in SVAR-IVs when only the shock of interest or a subset of the structural shocks can be recovered as a linear combination of the VAR residuals. This condition of partial invertibility is very general, often of empirical relevance, and less stringent than the standard full invertibility that is routinely assumed in the SVAR literature. We show that, underpartial invertibility, the dynamic responsescan be correctly recoveredusing an external instrument even when this correlates with leads and lags of other invertible shocks. We call this a limited lead-lag exogeneity condition. We evaluate our results in a simulated environment, and provide an empirical application to the case of monetary policy shocks.
C36|Asymptotic F Tests under Possibly Weak Identification|This paper develops asymptotic F tests robust to weak identification and temporal dependence.

The asymptotic F theory accounts for the estimation errors in the underlying heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation robust variance estimators, which the asymptotic chi-squared theory ignores. Monte Carlo simulations show that the F approximations are much more accurate than the corresponding chi-squared approximations in finite samples.
C36|Fertility effects of college education: Evidence from the German educational expansion|Using arguably exogenous variation in college expansions we estimate the effects of college education on female fertility. While college education reduces the probability of becoming a mother, college-educated mothers have more children than mothers without a college education. Lower child-income penalties of college-educated mothers of two relative to mothers without college up to nine years after birth suggest a stronger polarization of college graduate jobs into family-friendly and career-oriented as a potential explanation. We conclude that policies aiming at increasing female educational participation should be counteracted by policies enabling especially college graduates to have both a career and a family.
C36|Labour mobility and interprovincial trade in Canada|This study estimates the impact of interprovincial and international migration on interprovincial trade using annual data from 1981- 2016 for Canadian provinces. We apply both the gravity and the spatial trade models for estimation using a number of panel estimators. We find that the endogeneity issue should be addressed when estimating the relationship between migration and interprovincial trade. Estimated results show that interprovincial and international net migrations are positive and significant determinants for interprovincial trade of Canada. Interprovincial immigration is more influential than international immigration in explaining interprovincial trade. Interprovincial imports are influenced more by interprovincial and international migration than interprovincial exports. Province-wise estimates indicate that Quebec, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and New Brunswick are positively affected by interprovincial migration. Among them, all except New Brunswick are also positively affected by international migration. The gravity and the spatial trade models are useful to explain Canadian interprovincial trade. The pooled OLS, fixed effects, 2SLS and SGMM estimators are used in this study. Our results are robust to different estimation methods and alternative measures using both the flow and the stock net migration in Canada’s provinces.
C36|Heterogeneous spillover effects of children's education on parental mental health|Despite extensive research on nonmarket returns to education, direct and spillover effects on mental health are widely unstudied. This study is the first to analyze heterogeneous intergenerational effects of children's education on parents' mental health. Given ambiguous theoretical implications, I explore potential mechanisms empirically. Using Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) data, I estimate IV regressions, exploiting countrylevel variation in compulsory schooling reforms. Increasing children's education reduces parents' long-term probability of developing depression. Fathers and more educated sons drive this beneficial effect. Since mental illness is frequently undiagnosed, the findings may help improve elderly-specific health care provision.
C36|A Consistent Variance Estimator for 2SLS When Instruments Identify Different LATEs| Under treatment effect heterogeneity, an instrument identifies the instrument-specific local average treatment effect (LATE). With multiple instruments, two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimand is a weighted average of different LATEs. What is often overlooked in the literature is that the postulated moment condition evaluated at the 2SLS estimand does not hold unless those LATEs are the same. If so, the conventional heteroscedasticity-robust variance estimator would be inconsistent, and 2SLS standard errors based on such estimators would be incorrect. I derive the correct asymptotic distribution, and propose a consistent asymptotic variance estimator by using the result of Hall and Inoue (2003, Journal of Econometrics) on misspecified moment condition models. This can be used to correctly calculate the standard errors regardless of whether there is more than one LATE or not.
C36|A Note on Specification Testing in Some Structural Regression Models|There is a useful but not widely known framework for jointly implementing Durbin-Wu-Hausman exogeneity and Sargan-Hansen overidentification tests, as a single artificial regression. This note sets out the framework for linear models and discusses its extension to non-linear models.
C36|The (Un)Demand for Money in Canada|A novel dataset from the Bank of Canada is used to estimate the deposit functions for banknotes in Canada for three denominations: $1,000, $100 and $50. The broad flavour of the empirical findings is that denominations are different monies, and the structural estimates identify the underlying sources of the non-neutrality. There is evidence of large and significant deposit costs for the highest-value denomination, the $1,000 banknote, but insignificant costs for the $100 and $50 denominations. The results imply that the interest rate elasticity of deposit is positive for the $1,000 but negative for the $100 and the $50. Third, 5 percent of the $1,000, 30 percent of the $100 and 22 percent of the $50 banknotes ever issued by the Bank of Canada do not circulate through financial institutions (in Canada). Finally, we find evidence that the Lehman Brothers crisis increased the deposit probability by a factor of 2–3 for the $1,000 banknote for a majority of the population in Canada.
C36|Analysis of Asymmetric GARCH Volatility Models with Applications to Margin Measurement|We explore properties of asymmetric generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models in the threshold GARCH (GTARCH) family and propose a more general Spline-GTARCH model, which captures high-frequency return volatility, low-frequency macroeconomic volatility as well as an asymmetric response to past negative news in both autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) and GARCH terms. Based on maximum likelihood estimation of S&P 500 returns, S&P/TSX returns and Monte Carlo numerical example, we find that the proposed more general asymmetric volatility model has better fit, higher persistence of negative news, higher degree of risk aversion and significant effects of macroeconomic variables on the lowfrequency volatility component. We then apply a variety of volatility models in setting initial margin requirements for a central clearing counterparty (CCP). Finally, we show how to mitigate procyclicality of initial margins using a three-regime threshold autoregressive model.
C36|How Long Does It Take You to Pay? A Duration Study of Canadian Retail Transaction Payment Times|Using an exclusive data set of payment times for retail transactions made in Canada, I show that cash is the most time-efficient method of payment (MOP) when compared with payments by debit and credit cards. I model payment efficiency using Cox proportional hazard models, accounting for consumer choice of MOP. I propose two instruments to identify and estimate the causal relationship between MOP and payment time: (1) the value of the transaction, and (2) the duration of the payment preceding the one under observation. Discounting consumer selection underestimates the efficiency of cash relative to cards. Overall, the efficiency of MOPs is an important component of the private and social costs of making and accepting payments. The efficiency of cash helps explain its continued use in Canada, which is motivated by its low cost in terms of payment time for consumers and merchants.
C36|Individual Social Capital and Migration|This paper determines how individual, relative to community, social capital affects individual migration decisions. We make use of nonpublic data from the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey to predict multidimensional social capital for observations in the Current Population Survey. We find evidence that individuals are much less likely to have moved to a community with average social capital levels lower than their own and that higher levels of community social capital act as positive pull-factor amenities. The importance of that amenity differs across urban/rural locations. We also confirm that higher individual social capital is a negative predictor of migration.
C36|Fiscal and Education Spillovers from Charter School Expansion|The fiscal and educational consequences of charter expansion for non-charter students are central issues in the debate over charter schools. Do charter schools drain resources and high-achieving peers from non-charter schools? This paper answers these questions using an empirical strategy that exploits a 2011 reform that lifted caps on charter schools for underperforming districts in Massachusetts. We use complementary synthetic control instrumental variables (IV-SC) and differences-in-differences instrumental variables (IV-DiD) estimators. The results suggest greater charter attendance increases per-pupil expenditures in traditional public schools and induces them to shift expenditure from support services to instruction and salaries. At the same time, charter expansion has a small positive effect on non-charter students' achievement.
C36|"Dismantling the ""Jungle"": Migrant Relocation and Extreme Voting in France"|Can a small scale inflow of migrants affect electoral outcomes? We study whether the relocation of migrants from the Calais “Jungle” to temporary migrant-centers (CAOs) in France affected the results of the 2017 presidential election. Using an instrumental variables approach that relies on the size of holiday villages present in municipalities, we find that the presence of a CAO reduced the vote share increase of the far-right party (Front National) by about 15.7 percent. These effects, which dissipate spatially and depend on city characteristics and on the size of the inflow, point towards the contact hypothesis (Allport (1954)).
C36|The Effect of Multigrade Classes on Cognitive and Non-Cognitive Skills: Causal Evidence Exploiting Minimum Class Size Rules in Italy|We analyse how schooling in multigrade classes affect the formation of student cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Our identification strategy is based on some institutional features of the Italian educational system establishing a minimum number of students per class. Classes that do not reach the minimum number of pupils are organized in multigrade classes. In addition, the Italian law also establishes a maximum number of students for multigrade classes, leaving a narrow range in the number of students per class which is very similar to small class size in single grade classes when the number of students enrolled in the grade is just above the minimum number of students per class. Using census data on 5th grade Italian students, we find that pupils in multigrade classrooms obtain worse test scores both in literacy and numeracy standardized tests compared to comparable pupils in single grade classroom. While the effect is small and not always statistically significant for the literacy score, we find a large and highly statistically significant effect on the numeracy score. No effect is found on grades assigned by teachers. We also find that pupils placed in multigrade classes tend to have a more external centred locus of control. Our results are robust to different specifications including controls for class size and a number of student and school characteristics.
C36|Desbalances en cuenta corriente: sus determinantes y efectos sobre las crisis bancarias|Este documento relaciona los factores que determinan los desbalances en cuenta corriente y su efecto en la probabilidad de crisis bancarias. Para este fin, se usa un panel de 50 países para el periodo 1980-2013, en el cual se aplican cuatro métodos de estimación para encontrar los determinantes tanto de largo como de corto plazo de la cuenta corriente, con el objetivo de incluir aquellos que tengan consistencia estadística y teórica en un modelo Logit cuya variable dependiente es la probabilidad de crisis bancaria. Los resultados muestran que países con balances primarios superavitarios, mejor Posición de Activos Externos Netos y mayor apertura comercial, enfrentan una menor probabilidad de experimentar una crisis bancaria. En contraste, países con mayor participación del crédito privado, incrementan la probabilidad de crisis bancaria.
C36|Shift-Share Instruments and the Impact of Immigration|"A large literature exploits geographic variation in the concentration of immigrants to identify their impact on a variety of outcomes. To address the endogeneity of immigrants' location choices, the most commonly-used instrument interacts national inflows by country of origin with immigrants' past geographic distribution. We present evidence that estimates based on this ""shift-share"" instrument conflate the short- and long-run responses to immigration shocks. If the spatial distribution of immigrant inflows is stable over time, the instrument is likely to be correlated with ongoing responses to previous supply shocks. Estimates based on the conventional shift-share instrument are therefore unlikely to identify the short-run causal effect. We propose a ""multiple instrumentation"" procedure that isolates the spatial variation arising from changes in the country-of-origin composition at the national level and permits us to estimate separately the short- and long-run effects. Our results are a cautionary tale for a large body of empirical work, not just on immigration, that rely on shift-share instruments for causal inference."
C36|Do Dutch dentists extract monopoly rents?|We exploit lottery-determined admission to dental school to estimate the payoffs to the study of dentistry in the Netherlands. Using data from up to 22 years after the lottery, we find that in most years after graduation dentists earn around 50,000 Euros more than they would earn in their next-best profession. The payoff is larger for men than for women but does not vary with high school GPA. The large payoffs cannot be attributed to longer working hours, larger investments while studying (opportunity costs and direct costs), or unpleasant aspects of working as a dentist. A plausible explanation is that dentists earn a monopoly rent. Results from regressions of dentists’ earnings on dentists density are consistent with this, as are the facts that the supply of dentists in the Netherlands is low and that the payoff does not vary with high school GPA.

C36|Liquidity constraints, opportunity cost and post-secondary education. Evidence from Colombia|We provide new and clear evidence about the importance of liquidity constraints for post-secondary vocational education. Using two discontinuities that are used to allocate seats in free vocational education and eligibility for educational grants, we exploit the relationship between OLS and IV estimates of returns to education to test for the presence of short run liquidity in the fashion of Card (2001). Eligibility to financial aid increases enrollment in vocational education between 8 to 13 percentage points. Furthermore, we find that when we instrument post-secondary schooling with eligibility for financial aid IV estimates are larger than OLS estimates, suggesting that compliers to this instrument are individuals with high returns to education but who were not enrolling in post-secondary education before due to liquidity constraints. However, when the instrument is not linked with the cost of education IV estimates are not significantly larger than OLS estimates. Our analysis focuses on access to free vocational education, hence our results shed lights on the importance of the opportunity cost.
C36|Assessing the Productivity Consequences of Agri-Environmental Practices When Adoption Is Endogenous| We address the general problem of selection bias, endemic to analyzing the effects of any policy where adoption is voluntary, with empirical application to environmental policies for agriculture. Many voluntary practices for mitigating the environmental impacts of agriculture provide external benefits while lowering productivity. Policy analysis of the productivity consequences is complicated by the fact that decision-makers can choose their own policy levers, an action that ruins any notion of random assignment. We introduce an identification strategy to correct this kind of endogeneity, combining classic methods from stochastic frontier analysis and selection models. Applying it to micro-level data from Finnish grain farms, we find that more efficient producers are more likely to enroll in subsidized practices. And, because these practices tend to reduce yield, frontier analysis without the endogeneity correction greatly understates productivity losses. In other words, naively basing the frontier estimator on the subset of less productive farms leads to downward bias in the resulting frontier estimates. In fact, average inefficiency more than doubles after the correction in this case. An outlier investigation also suggests that the lowest decile of farms are responsible for most of the selection bias in the uncorrected model.
C36|Individual Social Capital and Migration|This paper determines how individual, relative to community social capital affects individual migration decisions. We make use of non-public data from the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey to predict multi-dimensional social capital for observations in the Current Population Survey. We find evidence that individuals are much less likely to have moved to a community with average social capital levels lower than their own and that higher levels of community social capital act as positive pull-factor amenities. The importance of that amenity differs across urban/rural locations. We also confirm that higher individual social capital is a negative predictor of migration.
C36|In-migration and Dilution of Community Social Capital|Consistent with predictions from the literature, we find that higher levels of in-migration dilute multiple dimensions of a community's level of social capital. The analysis employs a 2SLS methodology to account for potential endogeneity of migration.
C36|Robust inference in models identified via heteroskedasticity|Identification via heteroskedasticity exploits differences in variances across regimes to identify parameters in simultaneous equations. I study weak identification in such models, which arises when variances change very little or the variances of multiple shocks change close to proportionally. I show that this causes standard inference to become unreliable, outline two tests to detect weak identification, and establish conditions for the validity of nonconservative methods for robust inference on an empirically relevant subset of the parameter vector. I apply these tools to monetary policy shocks, identified using heteroskedasticity in high frequency data. I detect weak identification in daily data, causing standard inference methods to be invalid. However, using intraday data instead allows the shocks to be strongly identified.
C36|What underlies the observed hospital volume-outcome relationship?|Studies of the hospital volume-outcome relationship have highlighted that a greater volume activity improves patient outcomes. While this finding has been known for years in health services research, most studies to date have failed to delve into what underlies this relationship. This study aimed to shed light on the basis of the hospital volume effect by comparing treatment modalities for epithelial ovarian carcinoma patients. Hospital volume activity was instrumented by the distance from patients’ homes to their hospital, the population density, and the median net income of patient municipalities. We found that higher volume hospitals appear to more often make the right decisions in regard to how to treat patients, which contributes to the positive impact of hospital volume activities on patient outcomes. Based on our parameter estimates, we found that the rate of complete tumor resection would increase by 10% with centralized care, and by 6% if treatment decisions were coordinated by high volume centers compared to the ongoing organization of care. In both scenarios, the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy would increase by 10%. As volume alone is an imperfect correlate of quality, policy makers need to know what volume is a proxy for in order to devise volume-based policies.
C36|Identification of the Linear Factor Model|This paper provides several new results on identification of the linear factor model. The model allows for correlated latent factors and dependence among the idiosyncratic errors. I also illustrate identification under a dedicated measurement structure and other reduced rank restrictions. I use these results to study identification in a model with both observed covariates and latent factors. The analysis emphasizes the different roles played by restrictions on the error covariance matrix, restrictions on the factor loadings and the factor covariance matrix, and restrictions on the coefficients on covariates. The identification results are simple, intuitive, and directly applicable to many settings.
C36|Fiscal consolidation by intergovernmental transfers cuts? The unpleasant effect on expenditure arrears|For the period 2003–2014, we investigate unexplored effects of fiscal consolidation in decentralized public finance on a large dataset of Italian municipalities. Based on a simple, realistic theoretical model, we show that municipalities increase arrears on committed investment expenditure as a response to intergovernmental transfer cuts. Then, we test our predictions controlling for potential sources of endogeneity, and find that a reduction in intergovernmental transfers causes a significant increase in arrears, in addition to other common adjustments to local fiscal policies (e.g., tax revenues). Our results highlight a perverse effect of fiscal consolidation packages implemented by centrally imposed fiscal restraints.
C36|Heterogeneous Effects of Credit Constraints on SMEs’ Employment: Evidence from the Great Recession|This paper takes advantage of access to detailed matched bank-firm data to investigate whether and how employment decisions of SMEs have been affected by credit constraints in the wake of the Great Recession. Variability in banks’ financial health following the 2008 crisis is used as an exogenous determinant of firms’ access to credit. Findings, relative to the Belgian economy, clearly highlight that credit matters. They show that SMEs borrowing money from pre-crisis financially less healthy banks were significantly more likely to be affected by a credit constraint and, in turn, to adjust their labour input downwards than pre-crisis clients of more healthy banks. These results are robust across types of loan applications that were denied credit, i.e. applications to finance working capital, debt or new investments. Yet, estimates also show that credit constraints have been essentially detrimental for employment among SMEs experiencing a negative demand shock or facing strong product market competition. In terms of human resources management, credit constraints are not only found to foster employment adjustment at the extensive margin but also to increase the use of temporary layoff allowances for economic reasons. This outcome supports the hypothesis that short-time compensation programmes contribute to save jobs during recessions.
C36|A Structural Model of The Demand For Telecare|In this paper, we formulate a structural model of the demand for telecare. We show how the Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services Use, the Almost Ideal Demand System and the Revealed Preference theory can be combined with microeconomic principles of health production to reason about individuals' utility maximizing behavior. We then estimate the model using a strategy that controls for the effects of both observable and unobservable factors, and later conduct a simulation exercise by way of a decomposition analysis.
C36|Collaborative Knowledge Creation: Evidence from Japanese Patent Data|This paper presents micro-econometric evidence for collaborative knowledge creation at the level of individual researchers. The key determinant for developing new ideas is the exchange of differentiated knowledge among collaborators. To stay creative, inventors seek opportunities to shift their technological expertise to unexplored niches by utilizing the differentiated knowledge of new collaborators. Moreover, the knowledge stock of an inventor, proxied by the scope of an inventor’s past research, has positive and negative effects on their productivity. This is because it facilitates successful collaboration; however, simultaneously, the dependence on older knowledge hinders invention possibly due to the obsolescence and exhaustion of niches by imitation.
C36|Identification and Estimation of Dynamic Causal Effects in Macroeconomics Using External Instruments|External sources of asâ€ if randomness â€” that is, external instruments â€” can be used to identify the dynamic causal effects of macroeconomic shocks. One method is a oneâ€ step instrumental variables regression (local projections â€“ IV); a more efficient twoâ€ step method involves a vector autoregression. We show that, under a restrictive instrument validity condition, the oneâ€ step method is valid even if the vector autoregression is not invertible, so comparing the two estimates provides a test of invertibility. If, however, lagged endogenous variables are needed as control variables in the oneâ€ step method, then the conditions for validity of the two methods are the same.
C36|Two Empirical Tests of Hypercongestion|There is a widely-held view that as demand for travel goes up, this decreases not only speed but also the capacity of the road system, a phenomenon known as hypercongestion. We revisit this idea. We propose two empirical tests motivated by previous analytical models of hypercongestion. Our first test uses instrumental variables to empirically isolate the effect of travel demand on highway capacity. Our second test uses an event study analysis to measure changes in highway capacity at the onset of queue formation. We apply these tests to three highway bottlenecks in California for which detailed data on traffic flows and vehicles speeds are available. Neither test shows evidence of a reduction in highway capacity at any site during periods of high demand. Across sites and specifications we have sufficient statistical power to rule out small reductions in highway capacity. This lack of evidence of hypercongestion has important implications for travel supply and demand models and raises questions about highway metering lights and other traffic interventions aimed at regulating demand.
C36|Fiscal and Education Spillovers from Charter School Expansion|The fiscal and educational consequences of charter expansion for non-charter students are central issues in the debate over charter schools. Do charter schools drain resources and high-achieving peers from non-charter schools? This paper answers these questions using an empirical strategy that exploits a 2011 reform that lifted caps on charter schools for underperforming districts in Massachusetts. We use complementary synthetic control instrumental variables (IV-SC) and differences-in-differences instrumental variables (IV-DiD) estimators. The results suggest greater charter attendance increases per-pupil expenditures in traditional public schools and induces them to shift expenditure from support services to instruction and salaries. At the same time, charter expansion has a small positive effect on non-charter students’ achievement.
C36|Linear IV Regression Estimators for Structural Dynamic Discrete Choice Models|In structural dynamic discrete choice models, the presence of serially correlated unobserved states and state variables that are measured with error may lead to biased parameter estimates and misleading inference. In this paper, we show that instrumental variables can address these issues, as long as measurement problems involve state variables that evolve exogenously from the perspective of individual agents (i.e., market-level states). We define a class of linear instrumental variables estimators that rely on Euler equations expressed in terms of conditional choice probabilities (ECCP estimators). These estimators do not require observing or modeling the agent’s entire information set, nor solving or simulating a dynamic program. As such, they are simple to implement and computationally light. We provide constructive identification arguments to identify the model primitives, and establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator. A Monte Carlo study demonstrates the good finite-sample performance of the ECCP estimator in the context of a dynamic demand model for durable goods.
C36|Does domestic demand matter for firms’ exports?|The existence of a link between exports and domestic demand challenges the standard theoretical assumption in international trade models and carries out important policy implications. Being a small open economy and one of the hardest hit economies during the latest economic and financial crisis, Portugal is a natural case study for assessing the role of this channel, in particular given the large export market share gains that mitigated the negative effects on economic activity. A key difference of our empirical approach vis-à-vis previous literature is that the estimated relationship between exports and domestic sales results directly from a monopolistic model of a firm selling to both domestic and external markets. Drawing on an appropriate estimation strategy, it is found a noteworthy negative relationship between domestic demand and firms’ exports covering the manufacturing sector over the period 2009–2016. This result holds for almost all industries although with a heterogeneous magnitude. Additionally, there is also evidence that this effect is stronger for larger firms.
C36|A Study on Regime Type and Globalization in Simultaneous Equation Framework|In this study we build a simultaneous equation model in which the measures of different aspects of globalization (attributable to KOF) and different aspects of democracy (attributable to EIU) are related in seven structural equations. A bi-directional relationship between democracy and globalization is visualized. The model is estimated by the conventional 2-SLS as well as a modified 2-SLS in which Shapley value regression is used at the second stage of 2-SLS. On the basis of our analysis, we document several findings. First, we find that democracy and globalization promote each other and hence there is a bi-directional causality with positive relationships running both ways between democracy and globalization. At a national level, there may be various intermediary conditions that modify the relationship as well as set in motion a complex of positive and/or negative feedbacks to accelerate or retard the pace of globalization and democratization in a country-specific manner. However, when a large number of countries are studied, a clear relationship emerges out. Second, there is a need to estimate the structural coefficients of the model cautiously since the regression equations may be suffering from collinearity among the predictor variables. The Shapley value regression based 2-SLS has performed better than the conventional regression in estimating the structural parameters of the model. Third, the system methods of estimation of the model gives better results than what are obtained by the single equation methods of estimation of structural parameters of the model.
C36|A Simultaneous Equation Model of Globalization, Corruption, Democracy, Human Development and Social Progress|This study builds a simultaneous equation model that establishes inter-connections among the measures of globalization, measures of democracy, human development, corruption perception index and per capita income, which in turn jointly influence social progress. The model has eleven equations in which the response variables and the predictor variables are log-linearly related. The empirical data used for estimation of the model pertain to the period 2006-2016 for 116 countries distributed over all the continents. The model has been estimated by the conventional Two-Stage Least Squares (2-SLS) and alternatively by a modified 2-SLS in which, at the second stage, Shapley value regression has been used to ameliorate the detrimental effects of collinearity among the predictor variables. It has been found that the modified 2-SLS outperforms the conventional 2-SLS. Empirically, it has been established that globalization, democracy, human development and low level of corruption are reinforcing each other and they together explain social progress quite well.
C36|Collaborative knowledge creation: Evidence from Japanese patent data|In this paper, we quantitatively characterize the mechanism of collaborative knowledge creation at the individual researcher level a la Berliant and Fujita(2008) by using Japanese patent data. The key driver for developing new ideas is found to be the exchange of differentiated knowledge among collaborators. To stay creative, inventors seek opportunities to shift their technological expertise to unexplored niches by utilizing the differentiated knowledge of new collaborators in addition to their own stock of knowledge. In particular, while collaborators' differentiated knowledge raises all the average cited count, average (technological) novelty and the quantity of patents for which an inventor contributes to the development, it has the largest impact on the average novelty among the three.
C36|Sharp bounds on the MTE with sample selection|I propose a Generalized Roy Model with sample selection that can be used to analyze treatment effects in a variety of empirical problems. First, I decompose, under a monotonicity assumption on the sample selection indicator, the MTR function for the observed outcome when treated as a weighted average of (i) the MTR on the outcome of interest for the always-observed sub-population and (ii) the MTE on the observed outcome for the observed-only-when-treated sub-population, and show that such decomposition can provide point-wise sharp bounds on the MTE of interest. I, then, show how to point-identify these bounds when the support of the propensity score is continuous. After that, I show how to (partially) identify the MTE of interest when the support of the propensity score is discrete.
C36|Fast and wild: Bootstrap inference in Stata using boottest|The wild bootstrap was originally developed for regression models with heteroskedasticity of unknown form. Over the past 30 years, it has been extended to models estimated by instrumental variables and maximum likelihood and to ones where the error terms are (perhaps multiway) clustered. Like boot- strap methods in general, the wild bootstrap is especially useful when conventional inference methods are unreliable because large-sample assumptions do not hold. For example, there may be few clusters, few treated clusters, or weak instruments. The package boottest can perform a wide variety of wild bootstrap tests, often at remarkable speed. It can also invert these tests to construct confidence sets. As a postestimation command, boottest works after linear estimation commands, in- cluding regress, cnsreg, ivregress, ivreg2, areg, and reghdfe, as well as many estimation commands based on maximum likelihood. Although it is designed to perform the wild cluster bootstrap, boottest can also perform the ordinary (non- clustered) version. Wrappers offer classical Wald, score/Lagrange multiplier, and Anderson–Rubin tests, optionally with (multiway) clustering. We review the main ideas of the wild cluster bootstrap, offer tips for use, explain why it is particularly amenable to computational optimization, state the syntax of boottest, artest, scoretest, and waldtest, and present several empirical examples.
C36|Estimating Models with Dynamic Network Interactions and Unobserved Heterogeneity|In this paper, we propose an approach to estimate models with network interactions in the presence of individual unobserved heterogeneity. The latter may impact the formation of ties and/or exogenous effects, thereby undermining identification of the associated parameters. In a panel setting, we devise a way to cope with these sources of endogeneity by relying on observable variations. When exogenous effects are involved, one can control for unobserved heterogeneity by including time-averages of the endogenous variables. When unobserved individual traits affect the process of network formation, it is possible to explore the role of network statistics. We derive a 2SLS estimator in order to address simultaneity bias, relying on sources of variation provided by the product between successive powers of the network matrix and the matrix of exogenous covariates; we assess the performances of the method via a Monte Carlo exercise, considering various combination of models and different ranges of parameters for both network interactions and the social multiplier. We also separately assess the cases in which unobserved sources hit the network structure only or act on exogenous effects as well. Focusing on the former case, our approach may be also applied when a simple cross-section is available. More generally, it does not require full knowledge of the spectrum of agents' interactions.
C36|Determinants of Violence in Mexico|"This paper determines whether income inequality is the main determinant of violence (measured as the homicide rate) in Mexico, when considering the so-called ""hot zones"" of the country during the period from 2001 to 2013. By Least Squares in Two Stages (2SLS) with fixed effects, it was found that the main determinants to reduce violence are the increase in the number of students studying the secondary level and the better salary conditions. It was also found that the percentage change in wages is decisive to reduce the level of violence, specifically, a 1% increase in salaries decreases violence levels by 1.19%. As of 2007, the entities belonging to the ""hot zones"" had a level of violence 0.74% higher than the rest."
C36|Inference for Iterated GMM Under Misspecification and Clustering|This paper develops a new distribution theory and inference methods for over-identified Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation focusing on the iterated GMM estimator, allowing for moment misspecification, and for clustered dependence with heterogeneous and growing cluster sizes. This paper is the first to provide a rigorous theory for the iterated GMM estimator. We provide conditions for its existence by demonstrating that the iteration sequence is a contraction mapping. Our asymptotic theory allows the moments to be possibly misspecified, which is a general feature of approximate over-identified models. This form of moment misspecification causes bias in conventional standard error estimation. Our results show how to correct for this standard error bias. Our paper is also the first to provide a rigorous distribution theory for the GMM estimator under cluster dependence. Our distribution theory is asymptotic, and allows for heterogeneous and growing cluster sizes. Our results cover standard smooth moment condition models, including dynamic panels, which is a common application for GMM with cluster dependence. Our simulation results show that conventional heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are highly biased under moment misspecification, severely understating estimation uncertainty, and resulting in severely over-sized hypothesis tests. In contrast, our misspecification-robust standard errors are approximately unbiased and properly sized under both correct specification and misspecification. We illustrate the method by extending the empirical work reported in Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, and Yared (2008, American Economic Review) and Cervellati, Jung, Sunde, and Vischer (2014, American Economic Review). Our results reveal an enormous effect of iterating the GMM estimator, demonstrating the arbitrari- ness of using one-step and two-step estimators. Our results also show a large effect of using misspecification robust standard errors instead of the Arellano-Bond standard errors. Our results support Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, and Yared’s conclusion of an insignificant effect of income on democracy, but reveal that the heterogeneous effects documented by Cervellati, Jung, Sunde, and Vischer are less statistically significant than previously claimed.
C36|Bargaining to work: the effect of female autonomy on female labour supply|Female labour supply is an important outcome for measuring gender equality and is therefore regarded as one of the key indicators for women's empowerment. The empowerment of women through greater labour force participation is well documented in the literature. We argue, however, that the relationship between female labour force participation and empowerment is endogenous. We instead turn our attention to understanding whether greater female household autonomy causes participation in the labour market in the first place. Using the roll out of banking cards associated with the South African government cash transfers as an exogenous shock, we show that financial inclusion improves women's decision making power in the household. In response to this redistribution of bargaining power in the household, we provide evidence of increased female labour force participation. Our results show that becoming a primary decision maker leads to a 92 percentage point increase in the probability that women participate in the labour market.
C36|Econometrics with Weak Instruments|Lecture notes on weak instruments
C36|An IV framework for combining sign and long-run parametric restrictions in SVARs|This paper develops a method to impose a long?run restriction in an instrumental variables (IV) framework in a SVAR which is comprised of both I(1) and I(0) variables when the shock associated with one of the I(0) variables is made transitory. This is the identification which is utilized in the small open economy SVAR that we take from the literature. The method is combined with a recently developed sign restrictions approach which can be applied in an IV setting. We then consider an alternate identification in this SVAR which makes the shocks associated with all of the I(0) variables transitory. In this case, we show that another method can be used to impose the long-run restrictions. The results from both methods are reported for the SVARs estimated with Canadian data.
C36|Heterogeneous Effects of Credit Constraints on SMEs' Employment: Evidence from the Great Recession|This paper takes advantage of access to detailed matched bank-firm data to investigate whether and how employment decisions of SMEs have been affected by credit constraints in the wake of the Great Recession. Variability in banks' financial health following the 2008 crisis is used as an exogenous determinant of firms' access to credit. Findings, relative to the Belgian economy, clearly highlight that credit matters. They show that SMEs borrowing money from pre-crisis financially less healthy banks were significantly more likely to be affected by a credit constraint and, in turn, to adjust their labour input downwards than pre-crisis clients of more healthy banks.

In terms of human resources management, credit constraints are not only found to foster employment adjustment at the extensive margin but also to increase the use of temporary layoff allowances for economic reasons. This outcome supports the hypothesis that short-time compensation programmes contribute to save jobs during recessions.
C36|Testing for Stochastic Dominance in Social Networks|This paper illustrates how stochastic dominance criteria can be used to rank social networks in terms of efficiency, and develops statistical inference procedures for assessing these criteria. The tests proposed can be viewed as extensions of a Pearson goodness-of-fit test and a studentized maximum modulus test often used to partially rank income distributions and inequality measures. We establish uniform convergence of the empirical size of the tests to the nominal level, and show their consistency under the usual conditions that guarantee the validity of the approximation of a multinomial distribution to a Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, we propose a bootstrap method that enhances the finite-sample properties of the tests. The performance of the tests is illustrated via Monte Carlo experiments and an empirical application to risk sharing networks in rural India.
C36|Gender Wage Gap and Discrimination in Developing Countries| This study constructs wage equations according to Mincer earnings function for men and women separately, and the equations are estimated by OLS and Heckman selection regression for eleven developing countries. Our results show that the wage equation estimates for five countries including Ukraine, Sri Lanka, Macedonia Lao and Yunnan, China have the selection bias. Comparing the estimates of female wage equations and male wage equations, we find that better education raise wages for women than men, and women who work as high skill white collar receive more benefits than female. In terms of gender wage gap analysis, we conduct the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition for each of countries by the estimates of OLS regression and Heckman regressions. The results reveal a relatively high level of gender wage discrimination in Yunnan province, Macedonia, Sri Lanka and Ukraine. For most of countries, the unexplained wage gap contributes more to the total wage gap, comparing with the explained wage gap. However, this is no strong evidence to show that the wage discrimination is correlated with national economic development.
C36|Smoothed GMM for quantile models|This paper develops theory for feasible estimation and testing of finite-dimensional parameters identified by general conditional quantile restrictions, under much weaker assumptions than previously seen in the literature. This includes instrumental variables nonlinear quantile regression as a special case. More specifically, we consider a set of unconditional moments implied by the conditional quantile restrictions, providing conditions for local identification. Since estimators based on the sample moments are generally impossible to compute numerically in practice, we study feasible estimators based on smoothed sample moments. We propose a method of moments estimator for exactly identified models, as well as a generalized method of moments estimator for over-identified models. We establish consistency and asymptotic normality of both estimators under general conditions that allow for weakly dependent data and nonlinear structural models. Simulations with iid and dependent data illustrate the finite-sample properties. Our in-depth empirical application concerns the consumption Euler equation derived from quantile utility maximization. Advantages of the quantile Euler equation include robustness to fat tails, decoupling of risk attitude from the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, and log-linearization without any approximation error. For the four countries we examine, the quantile estimates of discount factor and elasticity of intertemporal substitution are economically reasonable for a range of quantiles above the median, even when two-stage least squares estimates are not reasonable.
C36|Identifying the Degree of Collusion Under Proportional Reduction|Proportional reduction is a common cartel practice in which cartel members reduce their output proportionately. We develop a method to quantify this reduction relative to a benchmark market equilibrium scenario and relate the reduction to the traditional conduct parameter. Our measure is continuous, allowing us to have an intuitive interpretation as the “degree of collusion” and nesting the earlier models in the existing literature. Furthermore, our methodology addresses Corts’ (1999) critique by estimating time-varying degree of collusion from a short panel of firm-level observations, exploiting firms’ ex post heterogeneity. We illustrate the method using the Joint Executive Committee railroad cartel data.
C36|Control armado y comportamiento electoral: Un cuasi-experimento en el Caguán|La violencia en las guerras civiles no ocurre de forma espontánea y desordenada, tiene lógicas y está unida al uso de variadas estrategias, incluso transformando el comportamiento electoral de los votantes. Este artículo buscará abordar este impacto partiendo de un evento histórico particular, la zona de distensión del Caguán para resolver un problema empírico. La intención de esta aproximación es observar el comportamiento electoral en una zona de control hegemónico insurgente y explorar los cambios de corto y largo plazo que tiene ante el control armado. Los resultados muestran el parcial congelamiento de la política local, el aumento de la hegemonía electoral y su efecto en el presente, la enquistada división partidista en la política subnacional. Estos resultados están en línea con los hallazgos de la literatura sobre la baja participación y la concentración del poder local. ******ABSTRACT: Violence in civil wars is not haphazard, it has logics and is related to the use of different policial strategies, including changing voter composition and behavior. This paper uses a particular historic event in Colombian civil war, the Caguán peace talks in 1996, to assess the long and short time effects of armed actor hegemonic control on political composition of subnational governments. The results shows that under insurgent hegemonic control, elections have more strong winners. This is in line with literature that characterizes Colombia party system as weak and with a low turnout resulting from a besieged democracy.
C36|How to Use One Instrument to Identify Two Elasticities|We show that an insight from taxation theory allows identification of both the supply and demand elasticities with only one instrument. Ramsey (1928) and subsequent models of taxation assume that a tax levied on the demand side only affects demand through the price after taxation. Econometrically, we show that this assumption functions as an additional exclusion restriction. Under the Ramsey Exclusion Restriction (RER) a tax reform can serve to simultaneously identify elasticities of supply and demand. We develop a TSLS estimator for both elasticities, a test to assess instrument strength and a test for the RER. Our result extends to a supply-demand system with J goods, and a setting with supply-side or non-linear taxes. Further, we show that key results in the sufficient statistics literature rely on the RER. One example is Harberger’s formula for the excess burden of a tax. We apply our method to the Norwegian labor market.
C36|Instrumental Variables and Causal Mechanisms: Unpacking the Effect of Trade on Workers and Voters|We identify how German voters responded to the labor market turmoil caused by increasing trade with low-wage manufacturing countries. We first establish that import competition increased voters’ support for only extreme (right) parties. We then decompose this populist ‘total effect’ of trade on voting into a ‘mediated effect’ running through labor market adjustments and an independent ‘direct effect’. Our Causal Mediation Analysis reveals that direct and indirect effect work in opposite directions.
C36|The effect of hospital ownership on quality of care: Evidence from England|We investigate whether quality of care differs between public and private hospitals in England using data on 3.8 million publicly-funded patients receiving 133 planned (non-emergency) treatments in 393 public and 190 private hospital sites. Private hospitals treat patients with fewer comorbidities and past hospitalisations. Controlling for observed patient characteristics and treatment type, private hospitals have fewer emergency readmissions. But patients’ choice of hospital may influenced by their unobserved morbidity. After instrumenting the choice of hospital type by the difference in distances from the patient to the nearest public and the nearest private hospital, the effect of private ownership changes sign and is statistically insignificant. Similar results are obtained with coarsened exact matching. We also find no quality differences between hospitals specialising in planned treatments and other hospitals, nor between for-profit and not-for-profit private hospitals. Our results show the importance of controlling for unobserved patient heterogeneity when comparing quality of public and private hospitals.

C36|Uniform Inference in Panel Autoregression|This paper considers estimation and inference concerning the autoregressive coefficient (?) in a panel autoregression for which the degree of persistence in the time dimension is unknown. The main objective is to construct confidence intervals for ? that are asymptotically valid, having asymptotic coverage probability at least that of the nominal level uniformly over the parameter space. It is shown that a properly normalized statistic based on the Anderson-Hsiao IV procedure, which we call the M statistic, is uniformly convergent and can be inverted to obtain asymptotically valid interval estimates. In the unit root case confidence intervals based on this procedure are unsatisfactorily wide and uninformative. To sharpen the intervals a new procedure is developed using information from unit root pretests to select alternative confidence intervals. Two sequential tests are used to assess how close ? is to unity and to correspondingly tailor intervals near the unit root region. When ? is close to unity, the width of these intervals shrinks to zero at a faster rate than that of the confidence interval based on the M statistic. Only when both tests reject the unit root hypothesis does the construction revert to the M statistic intervals, whose width has the optimal N^{-1/2}T^{-1/2} rate of shrinkage when the underlying process is stable. The asymptotic properties of this pretest-based procedure show that it produces confidence intervals with at least the prescribed coverage probability in large samples. Simulations confirm that the proposed interval estimation methods perform well in finite samples and are easy to implement in practice. A supplement to the paper provides an extensive set of new results on the asymptotic behavior of panel IV estimators in weak instrument settings.
C36|A Note on Optimal Inference in the Linear IV Model|This paper considers tests and confidence sets (CS's) concerning the coefficient on the endogenous variable in the linear IV regression model with homoskedastic normal errors and one right-hand side endogenous variable. The paper derives a finite-sample lower bound function for the probability that a CS constructed using a two-sided invariant similar test has infinite length and shows numerically that the conditional likelihood ratio (CLR) CS of Moreira (2003) is not always very close to this lower bound function. This implies that the CLR test is not always very close to the two-sided asymptotically-efficient (AE) power envelope for invariant similar tests of Andrews, Moreira, and Stock (2006) (AMS). On the other hand, the paper establishes the finite-sample optimality of the CLR test when the correlation between the structural and reduced-form errors, or between the two reduced-form errors, goes to 1 or -1 and other parameters are held constant, where optimality means achievement of the two-sided AE power envelope of AMS. These results cover the full range of (non-zero) IV strength. The paper investigates in detail scenarios in which the CLR test is not on the two-sided AE power envelope of AMS. Also, the paper shows via theory and numerical work that the CLR test is close to having greatest average power, where the average is over a grid of concentration parameter values and over pairs alternative hypothesis values of the parameter of interest, uniformly over pairs of alternative hypothesis values and uniformly over the correlation between the structural and reduced-form errors.
C36|On optimal inference in the linear IV model|This paper considers tests and confidence sets (CSs) concerning the coefficient on the endogenous variable in the linear IV regression model with homoskedastic normal errors and one right‐hand side endogenous variable. The paper derives a finite‐sample lower bound function for the probability that a CS constructed using a two‐sided invariant similar test has infinite length and shows numerically that the conditional likelihood ratio (CLR) CS of Moreira (2003) is not always “very close,” say 0.005 or less, to this lower bound function. This implies that the CLR test is not always very close to the two‐sided asymptotically‐efficient (AE) power envelope for invariant similar tests of Andrews, Moreira, and Stock (2006) (AMS). On the other hand, the paper establishes the finite‐sample optimality of the CLR test when the correlation between the structural and reduced‐form errors, or between the two reduced‐form errors, goes to 1 or −1 and other parameters are held constant, where optimality means achievement of the two‐sided AE power envelope of AMS. These results cover the full range of (nonzero) IV strength. The paper investigates in detail scenarios in which the CLR test is not on the two‐sided AE power envelope of AMS. Also, theory and numerical results indicate that the CLR test is close to having the greatest average power, where the average is over a specified grid of concentration parameter values and over a pair of alternative hypothesis values of the parameter of interest, uniformly over all such pairs of alternative hypothesis values and uniformly over the correlation between the structural and reduced‐form errors. Here, “close” means 0.015 or less for k ≤ 20, where k denotes the number of IVs, and 0.025 or less for 0
C36|Research Design Meets Market Design: Using Centralized Assignment for Impact Evaluation| A growing number of school districts use centralized assignment mechanisms to allocate school seats in a manner that reflects student preferences and school priorities. Many of these assignment schemes use lotteries to ration seats when schools are oversubscribed. The resulting random assignment opens the door to credible quasi‐experimental research designs for the evaluation of school effectiveness. Yet the question of how best to separate the lottery‐generated randomization integral to such designs from non‐random preferences and priorities remains open. This paper develops easily‐implemented empirical strategies that fully exploit the random assignment embedded in a wide class of mechanisms, while also revealing why seats are randomized at one school but not another. We use these methods to evaluate charter schools in Denver, one of a growing number of districts that combine charter and traditional public schools in a unified assignment system. The resulting estimates show large achievement gains from charter school attendance. Our approach generates efficiency gains over ad hoc methods, such as those that focus on schools ranked first, while also identifying a more representative average causal effect. We also show how to use centralized assignment mechanisms to identify causal effects in models with multiple school sectors.
C36|The employment consequences of SMEs’ credit constraints in the wake of the great recession|This article takes advantage of access to confidential matched bank-firm data relative to the Belgian economy to investigate whether and how employment decisions of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have been affected by credit constraints in the wake of the Great Recession. Variability in banks’ financial health following the Great Recession is used as an exogenous determinant of firms’ access to credit. Two-stage least squares and bivariate probit estimates suggest that SMEs borrowing money from pre-crisis less healthy banks were significantly more likely to be affected by a credit constraint and, in turn, to adjust their labour input downwards than pre-crisis clients of more healthy banks. More precisely, estimates show that credit-constrained SMEs were ceteris paribus between 40 and 65% more likely to reduce their workforce than their counterparts not facing such constraints. Yet, findings also indicate that employment consequences of credit shortages depend heavily on the environment in which SMEs operate. Results indeed indicate that credit constraints have been essentially detrimental for employment among SMEs experiencing a negative demand shock or facing severe product market competition. Finally, in terms of adjustment channels, results show that credit-constrained SMEs adjusted their workforce significantly more at the extensive margin (through individual layoffs, reduction of temporary employment and early retirement) than their non-constrained counterparts, but also that they relied more intensively on temporary layoff schemes (for economic reasons).
C36|On the role of the rank condition in CCE estimation of factor-augmented panel regressions|A popular approach to factor-augmented panel regressions is the common correlated effects (CCE) estimator of Pesaran (2006). This paper points to a problem with the CCE approach that appears in the empirically relevant case when the number of factors is strictly less than the number of observables used in their estimation. Specifically, the use of too many observables causes the second moment matrix of the estimated factors to become asymptotically singular, an issue that has not yet been appropriately accounted for. The purpose of the present paper is to fill this gap in the literature.
C36|Heterogeneous returns to education over the wage distribution: Who profits the most?|This study presents evidence of heterogeneous returns to education over the wage distribution. The authors use instrumental variable quantile regression and data from the Swiss Labor Force Survey to identify the causal link between education and wages at different quantiles of the conditional distribution of wages. The results provide evidence that there is no unique causal effect of schooling and that for each individual the effect may deviate from those extensively documented by ordinary least squares or two-stage least squares. In particular, while ordinary quantile regression estimates increasing returns in the quantile index, once the endogeneity of schooling is taken into account the authors instead observe higher returns at lower quantiles of the wage distribution. Interpreting the quantile index as a measure of unobserved ability, the results suggest that higher-ability individuals have higher wages, but the slope of their wage-education profile is flatter than that for lower-ability individuals.
C36|Foreign institutional investment, business groups and firm performance: Evidence from India|The article tries to examine the relationship between equity ownership held by the foreign institutional investors and firm performance both in a static and a dynamic framework. We also examine how the relationship differs between group-affiliated and stand-alone firms. By employing the 2SLS panel data estimation technique on 137 BSE listed Indian firms, the study finds that foreign institutional investment has a positive influence on the firm performance as measured through Tobin’s Q and ROA.Application of linear dynamic panel data estimation in a dynamic framework also yields similar results.The latter method also shows that FII has a positive significant effect on Tobin’s Q in group-affiliated firms. The results are analysed from the perspective of a multi-theoretic approach consisting of agency theory, information asymmetry theory, institutional theory and resource dependency theory.
C36|The effects of revenue diversification and cross border banking on risk and return of banks in Africa|The paper analyses the implications of revenue diversification and cross-border banking for risk and return. We sample 320 banks across 29 African countries and employ System GMM estimator as a methodological approach to shed further light on the diversification-stability nexus by examining the complex interaction between three key variables: cross-border banking, diversification and bank stability. The results suggest that exploration risk reduces diversification as the level of capital increases when banks cross border to diversify across revenue generating activities. Our analyses further show that, banks in Africa derive absolute benefits from diversification if they cross border and diversify their revenue base concurrently. These results are robust to a range of controls including alternative variable specifications, regulatory environment that bank operate and methodology.
C36|Evidence on the Production of Cognitive Achievement from Moving to Opportunity|This paper performs a subgroup analysis on the effect of receiving a Moving to Opportunity (MTO) housing voucher on test scores. I find evidence of heterogeneity by number of children in the household in Boston, gender in Chicago, and race/ethnicity in Los Angeles. To study the mechanisms driving voucher effect heterogeneity, I develop a generalized Rubin Causal Model and propose an estimator to identify transition-specific Local Average Treatment Effects (LATEs) of school and neighborhood quality. Although I cannot identify such LATEs with the MTO data, the analysis demonstrates that membership in a specific demographic group is more predictive of voucher effects than is the group’s average change in school or neighborhood quality. I discuss some possible explanations.
C36|Limitations of Contract Farming as a Pro-poor Strategy: The Case of Maize Outgrower Schemes in Upper West Ghana|Contract farming (CF) arrangements have the potential to address market failures and improve technology adoption, productivity, and welfare. In Ghana, government and donors use CF as a strategy for increasing adoption of new agricultural technologies and developing value chains. Yet to date, there has not been a rigorous assessment of these CF schemes.
C36|Economic development and material use. Evidence from international panel data|Between 1990 and 2008, many industrializing countries have experienced tremendous economic growth, which coincided with a substantial increase in the use of materials. That poses the question how a continued economic convergence of developing nations will affect the use of biomass, fossil fuels, and minerals. Building on the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis, this study investigates whether material use reaches a maximum at a certain level of economic development and declines in income thereafter. Two indicators operationalize material use. Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) measures the apparent use of materials in a country. The Material Footprint (MF) quantifies all materials extracted to produce a country's final demand, including materials embodied in imports. Employing a panel consisting of 144 countries, initial estimations results suggest an S-shaped (cubic) relationship between GDP per capita and material use, but the relationship is monotonically positive over most of the income range. The coefficients of the cubic model tend to become nonsignificant once endogeneity and non-stationarity are accounted for. A linear specification yields a significant (positive) coefficient irrespective of the estimation method and can thus be considered a satisfactory approximation to the income-material use relationship. The linear models that account for endogeneity and non-stationarity suggest a greater income-materials elasticity for MF than for DMC. The long-run income elasticity is estimated to be 0.562 for DMC and 0.752 for MF. The income elasticity of MF is rather uniform across country groups. While being below average for biomass, it is greater than unity for fossil fuels.
C36|An introduction to using twin births as instrumental variables for sibship size|Some families who experience a twin birth get one more child than they had intended and planned for. This is the reason why twin births are used to create instrumental variables (IVs) for the number of children in a family. In this chapter I introduce IV techniques in general and the use of twin births for IVs in particular. IVs based on parity-specific twin births can indeed, under certain circumstances, be valid and reliable. In this chapter I discuss what these circumstances are. I rely heavily on the work by Joshua Angrist and coauthors. In contrast to them I argue that it is important to recognize that IVs based on parity-specific twin births have “heterogenous treatment effects”, meaning that it is only for some families that the twin birth leads to an unintended and unplanned birth. Recognizing this highlights a few assumptions that are not always thoroughly acknowledged in previous research. We, for example, need to make assumptions about the possibility of unintended single births and the families experiencing these. It is also the case that including families that have not yet reached (or surpassed) their desired number of children when using IVs based on parity-specific twin births will lead to estimates that are biased towards zero. Most importantly we need to reduce the claims of estimating generalizable, causal effects when using twin birth instrumental variables.
C36|How to Use One Instrument to Identify Two Elasticities|We show that an insight from taxation theory allows identification of both the supply and demand elasticities with only one instrument. Ramsey (1928) and subsequent models of taxation assume that a tax levied on the demand side only affects demand through the price after taxation. Econometrically, we show that this assumption functions as an additional exclusion restriction. Under the Ramsey Exclusion Restriction (RER) a tax reform can serve to simultaneously identify elasticities of supply and demand. We develop a TSLS estimator for both elasticities, a test to assess instrument strength and a test for the RER. Our result extends to a supply-demand system with J goods, and a setting with supply-side or non-linear taxes. Further, we show that key results in the sufficient statistics literature rely on the RER. One example is Harberger’s formula for the excess burden of a tax. We apply our method to the Norwegian labor market.
C36|The Cobb Douglas marriage matching function: Marriage matching with peer and scale effects|This paper proposes an elementary empirical framework to study behavioral marriage matching models, the Cobb Douglas marriage matching function (CD MMF). It accommodates different kinds of relationships, peer and scale effects, changes in population supplies and gains to relationships. The CD MMF encompasses the Choo and Siow (2006a, CS), Dagsvik (2000), Menzel (2015), Chiappori, Salanie and Weiss (1016) MMFs, and CS with peer and scale effects (CSPE). Given population supplies, the CD MMF equilibrium matching always exists and is unique. The CD MMF is estimated on marriage and cohabitation of the white population in US states from 1990 to 2010. Scale effects are present in US marriage markets. CSPE is not rejected by the data. The paper also extends the framework to consider Brock and Durlauf (2001) peer effects specification in marriage matching models.
C36|Choosing Right from Wrong: Industrial Policy and (De)industrialization in Central and Eastern Europe|Over the past two and a half decades, the economic landscape of Central and Eastern European economies went through several waves of transformation. The demise of traditional industries and the rise of the service sector during the 1990s inclined economic structure towards deindustrialization. The events over the next years paved the way for the rise of new industries in many of these countries and embarked them on the route of reindustrialization. However, in some countries the rise of new industries was more modest and took place at a much slower pace. Such development can be attributed to the process of industrial restructuring as well as industrial policies. The recent rise of awareness about the importance of industrial development for the growth and well-being of nations makes it relevant to investigate the sources behind changes in the economic structure of Central and Eastern European countries. Our findings reveal two groups of CEECs, defined as reindustrializing and those going through deindustrialization. The research identifies loss of competitiveness as the principal driving force of such an outcome. No support was found for horizontal policies. The reindustrialization mainly takes place through productivity improvements in less knowledge and technology intensive activities. Such findings are in line with those on the position of CEECs in global value chains.
C36|The influence function of semiparametric estimators| There are many economic parameters that depend on nonparametric first steps. Examples include games, dynamic discrete choice, average consumer surplus, and treatment effects. Often estimators of these parameters are asymptotically equivalent to a sample average of an object referred to as the influence function. The influence function is useful in formulating regularity conditions for asymptotic normality, for bias reduction, in efficiency comparisons, and for analyzing robustness. We show that the influence function of a semiparametric estimator is the limit of a Gateaux derivative with respect to a smooth deviation as the deviation approaches a point mass. This result generalizes the classic Von Mises (1947) and Hampel (1974) calculation to apply to estimators that depend on smooth nonparametic first steps. We characterize the influence function of M and GMM-estimators.We apply the Gateaux derivative to derive the influence function with a first step nonparametric two stage least squares estimator based on orthogonality conditions. We also use the influence function to analyze high level and primitive regularity conditions for asymptotic normality. We give primitive regularity conditions for linear functionals of series regression that are the weakest known, except for a log term, when the regression function is smooth enough.
C36|Optimal Sup-Norm Rates and Uniform Inference on Nonlinear Functionals of Nonparametric IV Regression|This paper makes several important contributions to the literature about nonparametric instrumental variables (NPIV) estimation and inference on a structural function h_0 and its functionals. First, we derive sup-norm convergence rates for computationally simple sieve NPIV (series 2SLS) estimators of h_0 and its derivatives. Second, we derive a lower bound that describes the best possible (minimax) sup-norm rates of estimating h_0 and its derivatives, and show that the sieve NPIV estimator can attain the minimax rates when h_0 is approximated via a spline or wavelet sieve. Our optimal sup-norm rates surprisingly coincide with the optimal root-mean-squared rates for severely ill-posed problems, and are only a logarithmic factor slower than the optimal root-mean-squared rates for mildly ill-posed problems. Third, we use our sup-norm rates to establish the uniform Gaussian process strong approximations and the score bootstrap uniform confidence bands (UCBs) for collections of nonlinear functionals of h_0 under primitive conditions, allowing for mildly and severely ill-posed problems. Fourth, as applications, we obtain the first asymptotic pointwise and uniform inference results for plug-in sieve t-statistics of exact consumer surplus (CS) and deadweight loss (DL) welfare functionals under low-level conditions when demand is estimated via sieve NPIV. Empiricists could read our real data application of UCBs for exact CS and DL functionals of gasoline demand that reveals interesting patterns and is applicable to other markets.
C36|Knowledge spillovers and patent citations: trends in geographic localization, 1976-2015|" This paper examines the trends in geographic localization of knowledge spillovers via patent citations, considering US patents from the period of 1976-2015. Despite accelerating globalization and widespread perception of the ""death of distance,"" our multi-cohort ""matched-sample"" study reveals signi cant and growing localization effects of knowledge spillovers at both intra- and international levels after the 1980s. We also develop a novel network index based on the notion of ""farness,"" which an instrumental variable estimation shows to be a signifi cant and sizable determinant of the observed trends at the state-sector level."
C36|Class Size in Early Grades, Student Grit and Later School Outcomes|The increasing recognition of non-cognitive skills in economics has led many researchers to investigate how educational practices enhance these skills. In this paper, we focus on the non-cognitive skill known as 'grit', and we study the causal relation between class size and grit. Using data from follow-up surveys of Project STAR, we show that fourth-grade pupils who experienced small classes during early grades are 0.12 standard deviations higher in grit than their peers in regular classes. We also show that grit matters, because nearly half of the effect of smaller classes on test scores operates through grit. The effects of grit are far-reaching: students with higher grit have better grades at the end of compulsory schooling, are more likely to graduate from high school on time and are more likely to take a college entrance exam.
C36|Education Effects on Days Hospitalized and Days out of Work by Gender: Evidence from Turkey|The strong relationship between various health indicators and education is widely documented. However, the studies that investigate the nature of causality between these variables became available only recently and provide evidence mostly from developed countries. We add to this literature by studying the causal effect of education on days hospitalized and days out of work for health reasons. We consider two educational reforms. One is the educational expansion of the early 1960s and the other is the 1997 increase in compulsory level of schooling from five to eight years. However, due to the possibility of weak instruments we do not further pursue this avenue. We focus on individuals in two cohorts namely, 1945-1965 which is an older cohort and 1980-1980 which is a younger cohort. We estimate Tobit models as well as Double Hurdle models. The results suggest that an increase in years of education causes to reduce the number of days hospitalized for both men and women unambiguously and the number of days out of work only for men while an increase in education increases the number of days out of work for a randomly selected women.
C36|An endogenous regime-switching model of ordered choice with an application to federal funds rate target|This paper introduces a class of ordered probit models with endogenous switching among N latent regimes and possibly endogenous explanatory variables. The paper contributes to and bridges two strands of microeconometric literature. First, it extends endogenous switching regressions to models of ordered choice with N unknown regimes. Second, it generalizes the existing zero-inflated ordered probit models to make them suitable for ordinal data that take on negative, zero and positive values and characterized by abundant and heterogeneous zero observations. From a macroeconomic perspective, it is the first attempt to implement regime switching and accommodate endogenous regressors in discrete-choice monetary policy rules. Recurring oscillating regime switches in the three regimes evolving endogenously in response to the state of economy are detected during a relatively stable policy period such as the Greenspan era. The Monte Carlo experiments and an application to the federal funds rate target demonstrate that ignoring endogeneity and regime-switching environment can lead to seriously distorted statistical inference. In the simulations, the new models perform well in small samples. In the application, they not only have better in-sample fit for the Greenspan era than the existing models but also forecast better out of sample for the entire Bernanke era, correctly predicting 91 percent of policy decisions.

C36|Exploring the spatial and temporal determinants of gas central heating adoption|In order to better understand the potential for both policy and technological improvements to aid carbon abatement, long-term historical information on the time-path of transition from more traditional to cleaner fuels is useful. This is a relatively understudied element of the fuel switching literature in both developed and emerging economies. This research adds to this literature by examining the adoption time-path of network gas as a heating fuel. We merge a unique dataset on gas network roll-out over time, with other geo-coded data and employ an instrumental variables technique in order to simultaneously model supply and demand. Results indicate a non-linear relationship between the proportion of households using gas as their primary means of central heating and the length of time the network has been in place in each area. Proximity to the gas network, peat bogs, and areas which have banned the consumption of bituminous coal also affect gas connections. Variations in socioeconomic and dwelling characteristics at area level can also help explain connections to the gas network. A better understanding of this variation is crucial in designing targeted policies and can aid network expansion decisions.
C36|Alternative Graphical Representations of the Confidence Intervals for the Structural Coefficient from Exactly Identified Two-Stage Least Squares|In the case of the just identified model the exact distribution of the two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimator of the coefficient of the endogenous regressor is a ratio of two normally distributed random variables. Robert Basmann (1960, 1961, 1974) used Fieller’s 1932 result to derive the density function of the estimator. In this paper we employ a novel graphical exposition of Fieller’s subsequent 1954 technique to approximate the confidence interval for the ratio. This approach involves the construction of a constraint shape that provides an insight as to how the characteristics of the reduced form estimates influences the comparison of the Delta and the Fieller confidence intervals. In particular, the degree of endogeneity and the relevance of the instrument can be shown to have a direct influence on these shapes. An example application of this approach is then applied to consider two specifications of an exactly identified model.
C36|A model of bank behaviour for the assessment of the potential balance sheet impact of the NSFR liquidity requirement|This paper provides a framework to examine the potential balance sheet adjustments of individual financial institutions for complying with the NSFR liquidity requirement. The suggested approach, which is also flexible enough to be applied in assessing the potential balance sheet impact of other regulatory proposals affecting the balance sheet of financial institutions, is an optimum model of bank behaviour, in which a bank statically rearranges its observed balance sheet by maximizing its profit with respect to constraints representing the balance sheet equality and various regulatory measures. According to our results, banks react to the introduction of the NSFR by strongly increasing their high-quality liquid assets, as well as fundamentally altering their short-term interbank funding to long-term. In addition, assuming no market frictions in the market for long-term funding from financial institutions, lending to the real economy decreases rather moderately as a consequence of the measure.
C36|The employment consequences of SMEs’ credit constraints in the wake of the Great Recession|This article takes advantage of access to confidential matched bank-firm data relative to the Belgian economy to investigate how employment decisions of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have been affected by credit constraints in the wake of the Great Recession. Variability in banks’ financial health is used as an exogenous determinant of firms’ access to credit. Estimates suggest that SMEs borrowing money from pre-crisis less healthy banks were significantly more likely to be affected by a credit constraint and, in turn, to adjust their labour input downwards than pre-crisis clients of more healthy banks. Yet, findings also indicate that employment consequences of credit shortages have been essentially detrimental for SMEs experiencing a negative demand shock or facing severe product market competition. Finally, results show that credit-constrained SMEs adjusted their workforce significantly more at the extensive margin than their non-constrained counterparts, but also that they relied more intensively on temporary layoff schemes.

C36|The Labor Market Effects of Refugee Waves: Reconciling Conflicting Results|An influential strand of research has tested for the effects of immigration on natives' wages and employment using exogenous refugee supply shocks as natural experiments. Several studies have reached conflicting conclusions about the effects of noted refugee waves such as the Mariel Boatlift in Miami and post-Soviet refugees to Israel. We show that conflicting findings on the effects of the Mariel Boatlift can be explained by a sudden change in the race composition of the Current Population Survey extracts in 1980, specific to Miami but unrelated to the Boatlift. We also show that conflicting findings on the labor-market effects of other important refugee waves can be produced by spurious correlation between the instrument and the endogenous variable introduced by applying a common divisor to both. As a whole, the evidence from refugee waves reinforces the existing consensus that the impact of immigration on average native-born workers is small, and fails to substantiate claims of large detrimental impacts on workers with less than high school.
C36|Maimonides Rule Redux|We use the discontinuous function of enrollment known as Maimonides Rule as an instrument for class size in large Israeli samples from 2002-2011. As in the 1991 data analyzed by Angrist and Lavy (1999), Maimonides Rule still has a strong first stage. In contrast with the earlier Israeli estimates, however, Maimonides-based instrumental variables estimates using more recent data show no effect of class size on achievement. The new data also reveal substantial enrollment sorting near Maimonides cutoffs, with too many schools having enrollment values that just barely produce an extra class. A modified rule that uses data on students’ birthdays to compute statutory enrollment in the absence of enrollment manipulation also generates a precisely estimated zero. In older data, the original Maimonides Rule is unrelated to socioeconomic characteristics, while in more recent data, the original rule is unrelated to socioeconomic characteristics conditional on a few controls. Enrollment manipulation therefore appears to be innocuous: neither the original negative effects nor the recent data zeros seem likely to be manipulation artifacts.
C36|Using Instrumental Variables for Inference about Policy Relevant Treatment Effects|We propose a method for using instrumental variables (IV) to draw inference about causal effects for individuals other than those affected by the instrument at hand. Policy relevance and external validity turns on the ability to do this reliably. Our method exploits the insight that both the IV estimand and many treatment parameters can be expressed as weighted averages of the same underlying marginal treatment effects. Since the weights are known or identified, knowledge of the IV estimand generally places some restrictions on the unknown marginal treatment effects, and hence on the values of the treatment parameters of interest. We show how to extract information about the average effect of interest from the IV estimand, and, more generally, from a class of IV-like estimands that includes the two stage least squares and ordinary least squares estimands, among many others. Our method has several applications. First, it can be used to construct nonparametric bounds on the average causal effect of a hypothetical policy change. Second, our method allows the researcher to flexibly incorporate shape restrictions and parametric assumptions, thereby enabling extrapolation of the average effects for compliers to the average effects for different or larger populations. Third, our method can be used to test model specification and hypotheses about behavior, such as no selection bias and/or no selection on gain. To accommodate these diverse applications, we devise a novel inference procedure that is designed to exploit the convexity of our setting. We develop uniformly valid tests that allow for an infinite number of IV--like estimands and a general convex parameter space. We apply our method to analyze the effects of price subsidies on the adoption and usage of an antimalarial bed net in Kenya.
C36|Economic Development and Material Use|Between 1990 and 2008, many industrializing countries have experienced tremendous economic growth, which coincided with a substantial increase in the use of materials. That poses the question how a continued economic convergence of developing nations will affect the use of biomass, fossil fuels, and minerals. Building on the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis, this study investigates whether material use reaches a maximum at a certain level of economic development and declines in income thereafter. Two indicators operationalize material use. Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) measures the apparent use of materials in a country. The Material Footprint (MFP) quantifies all materials extracted to produce a country's final demand, including materials embodied in imports. Employing a panel consisting of 144 countries, initial estimations results suggest an S-shaped (cubic) relationship between GDP per capita and material use, but the relationship is monotonically positive over most of the income range. The coefficients of the cubic model tend to become nonsignificant once endogeneity and non-stationarity are accounted for. A linear specification yields a significant (positive) coefficient irrespective of the estimation method and can thus be considered a satisfactory approximation to the income-material use relationship. The linear models that account for endogeneity and non-stationarity suggest a greater income-materials elasticity for MFP than for DMC. The long-run income elasticity is estimated to be 0.562 for DMC and 0.752 for MFP.
C36|Airport, airline and departure time choice and substitution patterns: An empirical analysis|This paper uses the random-coefficients logit methodology that controls for potential endogeneity of prices and allows for general substitution patterns to estimate various demand systems. The estimation takes advantage of an original ticket-level revealed preference data set on travels from the New York City area to Toronto that contains prices and characteristics of not only flight choices but also of all non-booked alternative flights. Consistent with having higher valuations, our results show that travelers buying closer to departure have a higher utility of flying. Moreover, consumers’ heterogeneity decreases as the flight date nears. At the carrier level, we identify which carriers have more price-sensitive consumers and which carriers face greater competition. In addition, the results suggest that our multi-airport metropolitan area can be considered as a single market and that JFK and Newark are relatively closer substitutes. Overall, consumers are more willing to switch to alternative carriers than between airports or departure times.
C36|Practical considerations for questionable IVs|In this article, we examine several techniques that allow for the con- struction of bounds estimates based on instrumental variables, even when the instruments are not valid. We introduce the plausexog and imperfectiv com- mands, which implement methods described by Conley, Hansen, and Rossi (2012, Review of Economics and Statistics 94: 260–272) and Nevo and Rosen (2012b, Review of Economics and Statistics 94: 659–671). We examine the performance of these bounds under a range of circumstances, which leads to several practical results related to the informativeness of the bounds in different situations.
C36|The use of identity primes to explain behavioral differences between groups: A methodological note|Although economists are increasingly using behavioral experiments to study variation in preferences among human groups (e.g., males vs. females), relatively little attention has been paid to the inferential limitations of such experiments. Focusing on group identity primes, this methodological note considers the conditions under which researchers are able to identify causes and explain differences in behavior or preferences between groups. Main concern is that group identity priming (or other approaches to strengthening causal inference in such experiments) are not a panacea and that a persistent omitted variables problem continues to hamper identification of specific causes of group differences in preferences. This note develops a framework for thinking systematically about the treatment effects of priming individuals’ group identity and possible approaches to clean identification of specific group-level traits explaining differences in preferences between groups. Unpacking observed effects of group membership on preferences and identifying specific causes of group differences is paramount from the perspective of policy implications and I clarify the framework's usefulness using concrete examples.
C36|The link between consumption and leisure under Cobb-Douglas preferences:Some new evidence|The assumption of multiplicative non-separable (Cobb-Douglas) consumer preferences is a key assumption for analyzing the interdependence of consumption and leisure choices. In this paper we solve the consumer utility maximization problem under these preferences and derive a simultaneous system of two equations corresponding to a static and an inter-temporal equation of consumption and leisure choice. The system is estimated with GMM to obtain consistent estimates of the consumer's preference parameters, of which the relative weight of consumption in the utility function is found to be much higher than that commonly assumed in DSGE model calibration exercises.
C36|A New Kind of Two-Stage Least Squares Based on Shapley Value Regression|The Two-Stage Least squares method for obtaining the estimated structural coefficients of a simultaneous linear equations model is a celebrated method that uses OLS at the first stage for estimating the reduced form coefficients and obtaining the expected values in the arrays of current exogenous variables. At the second stage it uses OLS, equation by equation, in which the explanatory expected current endogenous variables are used as instruments representing their observed counterpart. It has been pointed out that since the explanatory expected current endogenous variables are linear functions of the predetermined variables in the model, inclusion of such expected current endogenous variables together with a subset of predetermined variables as regressors make the estimation procedure susceptible to the deleterious effects of collinearity, which may render some of the estimated structural coefficients with inflated variance as well as wrong sign. As a remedy to this problem, the use of Shapley value regression at the second stage has been proposed. For illustration a model has been constructed in which the measures of the different aspects of globalization are the endogenous variables while the measures of the different aspects of democracy are the predetermined variables. It has been found that the conventional (OLS-based) Two-Stage Least Squares (2-SLS) gives some of the estimated structural coefficients with an unexpected sign. In contrast, all structural coefficients estimated with the proposed 2-SLS (in which Shapley value regression has been used at the second stage) have an expected sign. These empirical findings suggest that the measures of globalization are conformal among themselves as well as they are positively affected by democratic regimes.
C36|An Evaluation of Effective Prosperity Measure: A Case of Wellbeing Index|Prosperity has been considered the most desirable real outcome of all human efforts however usually measured through gross domestic output of the economy that may not capable to comprehend it effectively. This paper evaluates wellbeing measured through some economic, social and institutional aspects considering the dynamic behavior of variables based on Legatum Prosperity Index (LPI), Maslow’s theory of human needs and Minsky financial instability hypothesis. Considering the data within the context of economic quality, business, education, health, financial security and environment, a comparative analysis has been made to judge the level of prosperity engrossed through LPI. Annual data related to Pakistan from 1960 to 20016 has been examined for about hundred variables after reducing them into 21 exogenous and four endogenous variables through index-transformation. Two Stage Least Squares (TSLS) regression technique to solve the simultaneous equations models prove relevant. The major findings reveal that LPI has successfully measure the wellbeing scenario in case of Pakistan, further it ascertains that social and institutional dimensions are vital complement for wellbeing in addition to economic dimension which cannot uniquely be relied upon for sustainable prosperity.
C36|The local environment shapes refugee integration: Evidence from post-war Germany|This paper studies how the local environment in receiving counties affected the economic, social, and political integration of the eight million expellees who arrived in West Germany after World War II. We first document that integration outcomes differed dramatically across West German counties. We then show that more industrialized counties and counties with low expellee inflows were much more successful in integrating expellees than agrarian counties and counties with high in inflows. Religious differences between native West Germans and expellees had no effect on labor market outcomes, but reduced inter-marriage rates and increased the local support for anti-expellee parties.
C36|Far Away Gold: How Distance to Host Country Affects Olympic Performance|This paper quantifies the causal effect of distance on relative medal outcomes in Summer Olympic Games by exploiting a panel data set of participating countries for 1960-2016. Potential endogeneity issues of distance between a participant and the host country are accounted for with instrumental variables. Based on the two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimations, it is found that changes in a country’s shares of gold medals are negatively affected by change in distances to host countries. This result is robust under various model specifications. Furthermore, no significant effect is found to exist in silver, bronze, or total number of medals.
C36|The Role of Foreign and Domestic Investment in Promoting Exports and Imports. A Dynamic Panel Approach|The goal of this paper is to evaluate weather domestic or foreign investments are involved in the promotion of exports and imports in eight of the newest European Union member states. We apply the dynamic panel data model for identifying the determinants of both exports and imports in the period 1999-2013. Our main result point that there is a complementary relationship between FDI and both exports and imports. The EU membership is significant for the expansion of the trade activity, but is more relevant for the export activity than for the import one.
C36|Endogenous environmental variables in stochastic frontier models|This paper considers a stochastic frontier model that contains environmental variables that affect the level of inefficiency but not the frontier. The model contains statistical noise, potentially endogenous regressors, and technical inefficiency that follows the scaling property, in the sense that it is the product of a basic (half-normal) inefficiency term and a parametric function of the environmental variables. The environmental variables may be endogenous because they are correlated with the statistical noise or with the basic inefficiency term.
C36|Smoothed GMM for quantile models|This paper develops theory for feasible estimators of finite-dimensional parameters identified by general conditional quantile restrictions, under much weaker assumptions than previously seen in the literature. This includes instrumental variables nonlinear quantile regression as a special case. More specifically, we consider a set of unconditional moments implied by the conditional quantile restrictions, providing conditions for local identification. Since estimators based on the sample moments are generally impossible to compute numerically in practice, we study feasible estimators based on smoothed sample moments. We propose a method of moments estimator for exactly identified models, as well as a generalized method of moments estimator for over-identified models. We establish consistency and asymptotic normality of both estimators under general conditions that allow for weakly dependent data and nonlinear structural models. Simulations illustrate the finite-sample properties of the methods. Our in-depth empirical application concerns the consumption Euler equation derived from quantile utility maximization. Advantages of the quantile Euler equation include robustness to fat tails, decoupling of risk attitude from the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, and log-linearization without any approximation error. For the four countries we examine, the quantile estimates of discount factor and elasticity of intertemporal substitution are economically reasonable for a range of quantiles above the median, even when two-stage least squares estimates are not reasonable.
C36|Errors-in-Variables Models with Many Proxies|This paper introduces a novel method to estimate linear models when explanatory variables are observed with error and many proxies are available. The empirical Euclidean likelihood principle is used to combine the information that comes from the various mismeasured variables. We show that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. In a Monte Carlo study we show that our method is able to efficiently use the information in the available proxies, both in terms of precision of the estimator and in terms of statistical power. An application to the effect of police on crime suggests that measurement errors in the police variable induce substantial attenuation bias. Our approach, on the other hand, yields large estimates in absolute value with high precision, in accordance with the results put forward by the recent literature.
C36|Bonds and bridges, and between: An empirical analysis of group-based trust|"Social capital is often represented by generalized trust - the degree to which one trusts ""most (unknown) people"". It is assumed to be enhanced by diverse group interactions. In the social capital literature, it is opposed by particularized trust, which represents our mutual confidence in individuals close to us, for example, family members and friends. This study, based on a survey with 634 university students from Austria, questions the existing dichotomy between the two trust types. Our results advocate in favour of a third, community determined type of trust. This additional trust dimension is measured by the number of groups the individuals participate in. It changes between particularized and generalized trust, depending on measures of group context, like frequency of interaction or group size. Thus, the results support hypotheses made in the recent literature about the multidimensionality of trust and quantify the effect of group participation on trust."
C36|OTT-messaging and mobile telecommunication: A joint market? - An empirical approach|OTT-messenger such as facebook, WhatsApp have gained wide popularity among mobile users while traffic of text messaging has been in strong decline in several countries. This work is the first to provide an empirical analysis how consumption of OTT-messengers affects demand for text messaging and mobile telephony services. Our findings suggest that social and messaging apps may complement demand for text messaging and mobile voice services. More generally we identify the different nature of mobile telecommunication services as key element to explain why reductions of text messaging traffic have been so drastic in some countries and why an analogue development for mobile voice is rather unlikely.
C36|An Econometric Analysis of The Impact of Telecare on The Length of Stay in Hospital|This paper presents some preliminary results of a study investigating the effect of telecare on the length of stay in hospital using linked administrative health and social care data in Scotland. We make various assumptions about the probability distribution of the outcome measure and formulate three Negative Binomial Models to that effect i.e. a basic Negative Binomial Model, a zero-inflated Negative Binomial Model and a zero-truncated Negative Binomial Model. We then bring the models to data and estimate them using a strategy that controls for the effects of confounding variables and unobservable factors. These models provide an alternative to the Propensity Score Matching technique used by the previous studies. The empirical results show that telecare users are expected to spend a shorter time in hospital than non-users, holding other factors constant. The results also show that older individuals, males, rural residents and individuals with comorbidities have a longer length of stay in hospital, on average, than their counterparts, all things equal. Future research will involve conducting a sub-group analysis, investigating the effectiveness of various telecare devices and determining the impact of telecare on admission to hospital.
C36|Education Effects On Days Hospitalized And Days Out Of Work By Gender: Evidence From Turkey|The strong relationship between various health indicators and education is widely documented. However, the studies that investigate the nature of causality between these variables became available only recently and provide evidence mostly from developed countries. We add to this literature by studying the causal effect of education on days hospitalized and days out of work for health reasons. We consider two educational reforms. One is the educational expansion of the early 1960s and the other is the 1997 increase in compulsory level of schooling from five to eight years. However, due to the possibility of weak instruments we do not further pursue this avenue. We focus on individuals in two cohorts namely, 1945-1965 which is an older cohort and 1980-1980 which is a younger cohort. We estimate Tobit models as well as Double Hurdle models. The results suggest that an increase in years of education causes to reduce the number of days hospitalized for both men and women unambiguously and the number of days out of work only for men while an increase in education increases the number of days out of work for a randomly selected women.
C36|Who Is Covered and Who Underreports: An Empirical Analysis of Access to Social Insurance on the Egyptian Labor Market|This paper investigates the dynamics and determinants of having access to social insurance coverage on the Egyptian labor market among wage and non-wage workers. The paper explores two issues: the worker- and enterprise- level determinants of having access to social insurance and the risk of underreporting insurable wage to the social security authority. Using data from the Egyptian Labor Market Panel Survey for 1998 and 2006, the likelihood of having access to social insurance coverage is estimated by a probit regression model for all workers, for wage and non-wage workers, separately. Given the potential endogeneity between the type of work and social insurance access, instrumental variable technique is applied. Results show that men, older, married, better educated and white collar highly skilled workers are more likely to be socially insured. Underreporting insurable wages is negatively correlated with education and work experience. High contribution rates requested from both the employer and employee, combined with basing benefits on wages level of the last few years of service, and the weak capacity of law enforcement encourage employers and employees to either not participate in the social insurance system or contribute on amounts that are lower than their actual wage. The paper is one of the few studies that focus on the phenomenon of coverage gap and underreporting salaries to the social security administration.
C36|The Local Environment Shapes Refugee Integration: Evidence from Post-war Germany|This paper studies how the local environment in receiving counties affected the economic, social, and political integration of the eight million expellees who arrived in West Germany after World War II. We first document that integration outcomes differed dramatically across West German counties. We then show that more industrialized counties and counties with low expellee inflows were much more successful in integrating expellees than agrarian counties and counties with high inflows. Religious differences between native West Germans and expellees had no effect on labor market outcomes, but reduced inter-marriage rates and increased the local support for anti-expellee parties.
C36|Replication to assess statistical adequacy|"""Statistical adequacy"" is an important prerequisite for securing reliable inference in empirical modelling. This paper argues for more emphasis on replication that specifically assesses whether the results reported in empirical studies are based on statistically adequate models, i.e., models with valid underpinning statistical assumptions that pass relevant diagnostic tests for misspecification. A replication plan is briefly outlined to illustrate what this would involve in practice in the context of a specific study by Acemoglu, Gallego and Robinson (Institutions, human capital, and development, Annual Review of Economics, 2014)."

This work is the first to provide an empirical analysis how consumption of OTT-messengers affects demand for text messaging and mobile telephony services.

C36|Instrumental Variables and Causal Mechanisms: Unpacking the Effect of Trade on Workers and Voters|This paper shows that import exposure affects voting behavior because it affects local labor markets. We develop a new framework for mediation analysis where one instrumental variable is sufficient to identify three causal effects. Using German data from 1987–2009, we find that import exposure increases the support of nationalist parties and causes labor market turmoil. The voting response to import exposure can entirely be explained by the labor market adjustments to import exposure. Individual-level data corroborate our findings. Our novel estimation framework is applicable to a broad range of empirical studies interested in the causal mechanisms behind causal effects.
C36|The Impact of Drinking Water Quality and Sanitation Behavior on Child Health: Evidence from Rural Ethiopia| This paper examines the impact of drinking water quality and sanitation behavior on child health in rural districts of Ethiopia. Using primary household survey data and microbiological water test for Escherichia coli, we use various estimation methods to quantify the impacts of water quality and sanitation behavior on diarrhea incidence among children under five years old. Our results show that uncontaminated household storage water and safe child stool disposal decrease incidence of child diarrhea by 16% and 23% respectively. In contrast, neighborhood concentration of pit latrine increases incidence of child diarrhea by 12%. The latter result casts serious doubt on the assumed health and social benefits of moving from open to fixed-location defecation. Creating open defecation free communities in rural areas is not enough to achieve the desired health benefits of sanitation. To protect rural households from the risk of contracting communicable diseases, existing pit latrines should be upgraded to make them safer to use – fly-proofed and hygienic. There is a need for appropriate policy actions to improve household drinking water quality and to change people’s behavior towards safe sanitation practices. Increasing access to clean water supply and providing means for safe excreta disposal will bring significant health and social gains. Moreover, promotion of hygiene education campaigns about household water treatment, safe water storage and handling, washing hands with soaps at critical times, and adequately removing child feces from the domestic environment can also help ensure that people preserve good health in their household and their community.
C36|Employment Protection Legislation and International Trade|Analyzing the impact of domestic labor regulations on international trade is relevant, in part, because (i) trade negotiations may increasingly constrain countries’ ability to implement trade policies and (ii) concerns over international competition driving countries towards a ‘race to the bottom’ in labor standards are rampant. However, identification of this causal e§ect is challenging due to the potential endogeneity of regulations attributable to crucial unobservables and measurement error. In this light, we use data from more than 30 countries across 21 manufacturing sectors over the period 2001-2009 and examine the impact of employment protection legislation (EPL) on industry-level trade. While a di§erence-in-di§erences type approach controls for several potential confounders, we also employ an instrumental variables (IV) strategy. Across all specifications, EPL is found to significantly encourage imports in relatively labor-intensive industries. Further, the IV estimates uncover a more pronounced e§ect and find concerns over endogeneity to be relevant. Key Words: Employment Protection Legislation, International Trade
C36|Estimation of counterfactual distributions with a continuous endogenous treatment|Policy makers are often interested in the distributional effects that a policy would have. In this paper I propose a method to estimate such effects when the treatment variable is endogenous, continuous, and has a heterogeneous effect. I consider a triangular system of equations in which the unobservables are related by a copula that captures the endogeneity of the model. The copula is nonparametrically identified by inverting the quantile processes conditional on a vector of covariates. I estimate both conditional quantile processes using existing quantile regression methods, and propose a parametric and a nonparametric estimator of the copula, showing the asymptotic properties of the estimators. I consider three kinds of counterfactual experiments: changing the distribution of the treatment, changing the distribution of the instrument, and changing the determination of the treatment, discussing the estimation for each counterfactual. I illustrate these methods by estimating several counterfactuals that affect the distribution of the share of food consumption.
C36|Intergovernmental transfers and expenditure arrears|Local governments may increase expenditure arrears to relax the financial constraints induced by intergovernmental transfer cuts. We assess this hypothesis using information from accounting and financial reports from Italian municipalities for the period 2003-2010. By exploiting the long-lasting effect of the 1977-1978 structural reform of Italian local public finance, we employ an instrumental variable approach to address endogeneity concerns. We find robust empirical evidence that the lower the intergovernmental grants, the larger the use of arrears in public investment expenditures by municipalities. We argue that, when local governments are not subject to effective controls on the formation of arrears but fiscal rules impose binding budget constraints, a cut in intergovernmental transfers can partially diminish the effectiveness of fiscal consolidation at local level.
C36|Bonanzas y crisis de la actividad petrolera y su efecto sobre la economía colombiana|Este documento describe la importancia del petróleo en la economía colombiana y cuantifica su impacto sobre la deuda del gobierno, la tasa de cambio real y la actividad económica en los últimos treinta años. El trabajo resulta útil por la importancia histórica del petróleo y por el impacto macroeconómico que ocasionó la caída reciente del precio internacional del crudo. Para el ejercicio empírico se utiliza una metodología de Vectores Autoregresivos con parámetros cambiantes en el tiempo, VAR-PCT, la cual supone que la relación entre los precios y/o la producción de petróleo con las variables macroeconómicas cambia dinámicamente. Los resultados confirman que hay diferentes patrones de volatilidad estocástica de las variables incluidas en el modelo. De acuerdo con las funciones impulso respuesta, los choques positivos al precio del petróleo no causaron efectos significativos sobre la tasa de cambio real, excepto en 2004, cuando se observó una apreciación real. No obstante, para enero de 2015, un choque negativo al precio del 10% generaría una depreciación real de aproximadamente 8%. Así mismo, un choque positivo al precio no afectaría la deuda del gobierno ni en junio de 1999 ni en enero de 2007. Sin embargo, un choque negativo al precio en enero de 2015 del 10% reflejaría un aumento de la deuda anual hasta de 8.9%.
C36|Voluntary Work And Wages|The effects of voluntary work on earnings have recently been studied for some developed countries such as Canada, France and Austria. This paper extends this line of research to Italy, using data from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) dataset. A double methodological approach is used in order to control for unobserved heterogeneity: Heckman and IV methods are employed to account for unobserved worker heterogeneity and endogeneity bias. Empirical results show that, when the unobserved heterogeneity is taken into account, a wage premium of 2.7 percent emerges, quite small if compared to previous investigations on Canada and Austria. The investigation into the channels of influence of volunteering on wages gives support to the hypotheses that volunteering enables the access to fruitful informal networks, avoids the human capital deterioration and provides a signal for intrinsically motivated individuals.
C36|Identification and estimation using heteroscedasticity without instruments: The binary endogenous regressor case|Lewbel (2012) provides an estimator for linear regression models containing an endogenous regressor, when no outside instruments or other such information is available. The method works by exploiting model heteroscedasticity to construct instruments using the available regressors. Some authors have considered the method in empirical applications where an endogenous regressor is binary (e.g., endogenous Diff-in-Diff or endogenous binary treatment models). The present paper shows that the assumptions required for Lewbel’s estimator can indeed be satisfied when an endogenous regressor is binary. Caveats regarding application of the estimator are discussed.
C36|Unsurprising Shocks: Information, Premia, and the Monetary Transmission|"The use of narrow time frames to measure monetary policy surprises using interest rate futures is potentially not sufficient to guarantee their exogeneity as proxies for monetary policy shocks. Raw monetary “surprises"" are, in fact, predictable. These findings are interpreted as suggesting that time-varying risk premia and news shocks are likely to be captured in the measurement. The resulting violation of the identifying assumptions in Proxy SVARs induces non-trivial distortions in the estimation of the contemporaneous transmission coefficients: consequences for the estimation of structural IRFs can be dramatic, both qualitatively and quantitatively. This paper analyses the informational content of monetary surprises and proposes a new method to construct futures-based external instruments that conditions on both central banks' and market participants' information sets. Identification of monetary policy shocks via the orthogonal proxies is shown to retrieve contemporaneous transmission coefficients that are in line with macroeconomic theory even in small, potentially informationally insufficient VARs."
C36|On the Stock–Yogo Tables|A standard test for weak instruments compares the first-stage F -statistic to a table of critical values obtained by Stock and Yogo (2005) using simulations. We derive a closed-form solution for the expectation from which these critical values are derived, as well as present some second-order asymptotic approximations that may be of value in the presence of multiple endogenous regressors. Inspection of this new result provides insights not available from simulation, and will allow software implementations to be generalised and improved. Finally, we explore the calculation of p -values for the first-stage F -statistic weak instruments test.
C36|Reconstruction Multipliers|"Following the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake, financing of reconstruction by the Italian central government resulted in a sharp and unanticipated discontinuity in grants across municipalities that were ex-ante very similar. Using the emergency financing law as an instrument, we identify the causal effect of municipal government spending on local activity, controlling for the negative supply shock from the earthquake. In our estimates, this ""reconstruction multiplier"" is around unity, and we show that the grants provided public insurance. Economic activity contracted in municipalities that did not receive the grants, while it expanded--or at least did not contract--in municipalities that did receive them. Our results suggest several policy implications with respect to the allocation mechanism of such grants."
C36|Some Empirical Evidence of Loan Loss Provisions for Albanian Banks|In this paper we used a panel of Albanian banks for the period 2004-2014 to examine the main determinants of loan loss provisions. In addition, we tested how the latest crisis has affected provisioning behaviour of the banks. We find that loan loss provisions of banks are driven by non-discretionary components and economic fluctuations. Furthermore, we find a positive and significant result between earnings before interest, taxes and provisions and loan loss provisions, thus confirming the income smoothing hypothesis. Our estimated results do not support the capital management and signalling hypotheses. We also find that the global crisis has contributed significantly to the procyclicality of loan loss provisioning in Albania and banks continued to do income smoothing during the crisis.
C36|To work or not to work? The effect of higher pension age on cardiovascular health|The study explores the possible unintended health effects of reforms aimed at making eligibility criteria for occupational retirement more severe. The causal link between retirement age and hospitalization for cardiovascular diseases is investigated in a large sample of male Italian retirees (N=94,521). Endogeneity is addressed by an Instrumental Variable identification strategy, in a quasi-natural experiment set-up. The instrument exploits the variation in pension age determined by the standardization of the labour market transitions, which induce workers born during the first months of the year to retire at an older age. The analysis is performed on a longitudinal dataset that combines several Italian administrative archives on pensions, working histories and hospitalization. Results show a significant health detrimental effect of extended working life. A one-year delay in retirement increases the incidence of hospitalization for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) at 68-70 years old by 2.4 percentage points (p-value
C36|Does Income Inequality Lead to Terrorism?|We analyze the effect of income inequality on terrorism for a sample of 114 countries between 1985 and 2012. We provide evidence, robust to various methodological changes (e.g., different dependent variables, instrumental-variable approaches), that higher levels of income inequality are associated with more terrorism. Consistent with relative deprivation theory, we argue that this effect is a direct consequence of frustration over the distribution of income within a society, resulting in terrorism to voice dissent and achieve a redistribution of wealth. Furthermore, we provide evidence of an indirect effect of inequality on terrorism, where inequality may also contribute to terrorism by leading to weaker institutions. Finally, we show that redistributional efforts can be effective in reducing inequality and, consequently, terrorist activity.
C36|Third Country Effect of Migration: the Trade-Migration Nexus Revisited|This paper proposes a new channel through which migrants can affect the import demand of the host country. In migrating from origin to destination country, migrants observe a change in the prices of the bundle of consumable goods. In particular, the migration decision can reflect a reduction in the price of imported goods (due to lower applied tariff) for the consumption bundle of migrants: emigration towards less (tariff) protected countries allows the consumption of products that were prohibitively protected in the origin countries of migrants. To test this channel we estimate the import demand effect of migrant groups coming from third high (tariff) protected countries. We use a theory-grounded gravity estimations and a fresh econometric techniques able to address both the zero migration flows problem and the endogeneity of migrants. Our results suggest that such a third-country immigrant effect is significant and positive.
C36|Isolating causality between gender and corruption: An IV approach|Abstract: We address the persistent reverse causality problem in estimating the causal effect of female labor force participation (FLFP) on corruption. Employing plow usage as an instrumental variable, an increase in FLFP by one standard deviation is suggested to improve the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI, ranging from zero to ten) by 0.52 points. This effect is stronger than a one standard deviation change of education levels, government size, or ethnic fractionalization.
C36|Visitor Attitudes to Deaccessioning in Italian Public Museums: An Econometric Analysis|Deaccessioning is a largely controversial practice involving the sale or disposal of objects from a museumâ€™s collection. Although it has received increasing attention in the past few decades as a solution to museumsâ€™ financial concerns, its implications have rarely been researched in academia which is mainly due to the â€˜barely legalâ€™ status of deaccessioning as a management practice. Previous research suggests that visitorsâ€™ responses may vary depending on some factors, such as the destination of income generated by deaccessioning operations and the publicâ€™s perception of the museum collection as a public good. We address this question by analysing visitorsâ€™ responses in Italian public museums. Specifically, we hypothesize that stronger public cultural identity of the collection and the purpose of the income generated by deaccessioning strongly affect the attitudes to deaccessioning. Using structural equation modelling, we estimate several important determinants of visitorsâ€™ responses. We also show that attitudes to deaccessioning do not influence the decision to visit a museum. The findings of the article have implications for museum governance and particularly for the knowledge about deaccessioning in cultural economics and museum management.
C36|Being Central and Productive? Evidence from Slovenian Visual Artists in the 19th and 20th Century|Slovenian art history has received very little (if any) attention from the viewpoint of network theory although there were several examples of artists co-working or working in groups, collectives or even loosely organized clusters (groups from the impressionist Sava in 1904 to postmodern Irwin in 1984). This may be interpreted as a way to acquire better positions in the national and international art circles and on the art market. In our article we use web-based dataset of Slovenska biografija (operated by the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts), which contains data on numerous notable persons throughout Slovenian history to analyze the centrality of individual artistic figures and movements throughout Slovenian art history. We also study the influence of network centrality on cultural production controlling for endogeneity following the instrumental variable approach, proposed in the literature while using a new instrumental variable to solve the problem. Finally, we present results which show that women visual artists used their network positions more intensively than men and provide some first explanations for this observed relationship. In conclusion, we provide some reflections on the importance of these findings for further research work in the area.
C36|Estimation des échelles déquivalence des ménages seniors et dâge actif en France|To fix the scales of compulsory levies and social benefits for households of different size and composition, public authorities rely on the equivalence scale. Accounting for economies of scale achieved in households (shared public goods), the equivalence scale allows to calculate the additional amount of expenditures or income of a given household, in order to reach the utility level of a one-person household. The value of the equivalence scale depends on the consumption structure or equivalently the lifestyle of households. Is the equivalence scale currently used (applicable to the entire population) and implemented in the 1990s still relevant despite the changes in lifestyles ? Are they adapted to senior households (60 years and more) and working-age households (less than 60 years) whose consumption structure is different from that of the whole population ? How has consumption-specific scales evolved since the 1990s? This paper uses survey data on family budget (les enquêtes budget des familles) from 1979 to 2010 to estimate the overall equivalence scales applicable to (i) the general population, (ii) subpopulations of seniors and (iii) working-age households as well as (iv) the consumption- specific scales. Our results suggest that the implemented scale in the middle of 1990s is still adapted to current lifestyle. However, this scale underestimates the living standards and economies of scale achieved in senior households and overestimates those of the working-age households.
C36|Testing for monotonicity under endogeneity|This paper develops a test for monotonicity of nonparametric regression models under endogeneity, which in its generality is novel in the literature. The test statistic, which is built upon a second order U-process, introduces ‘correction terms’ based on control functions that purge the endogeneity. The test has a non-standard asymptotic distribution from which asymptotic critical values can directly be derived. Furthermore, the test statistic is extended to accommodate multivariate (exogenous) regressors. Consistency against general alternatives is proved and the finite sample properties of the test are examined in a Monte Carlo experiment. The test is used to formally assess the monotonicity of the reservation wage as a declining function of elapsed unemployment duration, which has implications for underlying job search models. This relationship is difficult to measure due to the simultaneity of both variables. Results for UK data indicate that reservation wage functions do in fact not decline monotonically thereby contradicting some partial equilibrium job search models.
C36|A weak instrument F-test in linear IV models with multiple endogenous variables|We consider testing for weak instruments in a model with multiple endogenous variables. Unlike Stock and Yogo (2005), who considered a weak instruments problem where the rank of the matrix of reduced form parameters is near zero, here we consider a weak instruments problem of a near rank reduction of one in the matrix of reduced form parameters. For example, in a two-variable model, we consider weak instrument asymptotics of the form π1=δπ2+c/n where π1 and π2 are the parameters in the two reduced-form equations, c is a vector of constants and n is the sample size. We investigate the use of a conditional first-stage F-statistic along the lines of the proposal by Angrist and Pischke (2009) and show that, unless δ=0, the variance in the denominator of their F-statistic needs to be adjusted in order to get a correct asymptotic distribution when testing the hypothesis H0:π1=δπ2. We show that a corrected conditional F-statistic is equivalent to the Cragg and Donald (1993) minimum eigenvalue rank test statistic, and is informative about the maximum total relative bias of the 2SLS estimator and the Wald tests size distortions. When δ=0 in the two-variable model, or when there are more than two endogenous variables, further information over and above the Cragg–Donald statistic can be obtained about the nature of the weak instrument problem by computing the conditional first-stage F-statistics.
C36|Endogeneity in stochastic frontier models|Stochastic frontier models are typically estimated by maximum likelihood (MLE) or corrected ordinary least squares. The consistency of either estimator depends on exogeneity of the explanatory variables (inputs, in the production frontier setting). We will investigate the case that one or more of the inputs is endogenous, in the simultaneous equation sense of endogeneity. That is, we worry that there is correlation between the inputs and statistical noise or inefficiency.
C36|A discontinuity test for identification in triangular nonseparable models|This paper presents a test for the validity of control variable approaches to identification in triangular nonseparable models. Assumptions commonly imposed to justify such methods include full independence of instruments and disturbances and existence of a reduced form that is strictly monotonic in a scalar disturbance. We show that if the data has a particular structure, namely that the distribution of the endogenous variable has a mass point at the lower (or upper) boundary of its support, validity of the control variable approach implies a continuity condition on an identified function, which can be tested empirically.
C36|The self-medication hypothesis: Evidence from terrorism and cigarette accessibility|We use single equation and system instrumental variable models to explore if individuals smoke during times of stress (the motivation effect) and if they are successful in self-medicating short-term stress (the self-medication effect). Short-term stress is a powerful motivator of smoking, and the decision to smoke could trigger biological feedback that immediately reduces short-term stress. We use data on self-reported smoking and stress from 240,388 current and former smokers. We instrument short-term stress with temporal distance from September 11, 2001 (using date of interview). We instrument smoking with cigarette accessibility measures of cigarette price changes and distance to state borders. In the absence of accounting for endogeneity, we find that smoking is associated with increases in short-term stress. However, when we account for endogeneity we find no evidence of smoking affecting short-term stress. We do find a consistent positive effect of short-term stress on smoking.
C36|Genetic markers as instrumental variables|The use of genetic markers as instrumental variables (IV) is receiving increasing attention from economists, statisticians, epidemiologists and social scientists. Although IV is commonly used in economics, the appropriate conditions for the use of genetic variants as instruments have not been well defined. The increasing availability of biomedical data, however, makes understanding of these conditions crucial to the successful use of genotypes as instruments. We combine the econometric IV literature with that from genetic epidemiology, and discuss the biological conditions and IV assumptions within the statistical potential outcomes framework. We review this in the context of two illustrative applications.
C36|Does home care for dependent elderly people improve their mental health?|While theoretical models on long-term care decisions assume that the health production function of dependent elderly depends positively on the care received, it has not received much attention in the empirical literature. We estimate the effects of both informal and formal home care on the mental health of elderly individuals in France needing help with daily activities. We adjust for the endogeneity of care with instrumental variables, using characteristics of adult children and geographical disparities in access to public long-term care coverage. The results show that informal care reduces the risk of depression of dependent elderly and that formal care increases their general mental health.
C36|Effects of incorrect specification on the finite sample properties of full and limited information estimators in DSGE models|In this paper we analyze the small sample properties of full information and limited information estimators in a potentially misspecified DSGE model. Therefore, we conduct a simulation study based on a standard New Keynesian model including price and wage rigidities. We then study the effects of omitted variable problems on the structural parameter estimates of the model. We find that FIML performs superior when the model is correctly specified. In cases where some of the model characteristics are omitted, the performance of FIML is highly unreliable, whereas GMM estimates remain approximately unbiased and significance tests are mostly reliable.
C36|The role of wealth in the start-up decision of new self-employed: Evidence from a pension policy reform|We study whether wealth affects transitions from wage-employment to self-employment using a large sample from administrative panel data for the Netherlands. To isolate the causal effect of wealth, we rely on a reform of the pension system that abolished preferential tax treatment of early retirement for cohorts born after January 1, 1950. This exogenous reduction in pension wealth has a significant negative effect on the transition into self-employment. We compute that the average reduction of net future pension wealth by 16,000 euros in our sample, triggered by the reform, reduces the transition rate into self-employment by 38%.
C36|Tail risk spillovers and corporate cash holdings|This paper investigates tail risk spillovers from the financial sector to real economy firms in the United States and the United Kingdom from 2003 to 2011. We measure these spillovers by evaluating the number of joint occurrences of extreme negative returns in a nonfinancial firm conditional on an extreme negative return in the financial sector. Such spillovers increased dramatically in the 2007–2009 crisis. We also examine whether cash holdings act as a buffer in mitigating these spillovers. Our results indicate that greater cash holdings are associated with lower levels of tail risk spillovers for financially constrained firms and more strongly so among constrained firms with high hedging needs and no ratings (i.e., firms with restricted external financing sources). Overall, our findings support the view that the greater cash holdings of constrained firms act as a shock absorber against costly external financing.
C36|How corporate derivatives use impact firm performance?|It is an empirical question over whether the use of derivatives hedging among firms is actually effective in mitigating financial risks, and hence positively contributes to firm performance. This study uses three performance models (firm market value, ROA and ROE) and a two-stage regression to simultaneously estimate the performance and derivatives use models, to address any possible endogeneity problem. It provides empirical evidence, which is rare in Malaysia and developing markets, of the effectiveness of using derivatives for hedging among firms. Specifically, this study finds that capital market imposed a ‘discount’ on derivatives users – derivative use is negatively associated with firm market value. However, derivative use contributes to better ROA (and ROE), a key driver of firm market value. Firms with lower operating income margin tend to use derivatives to protect this already thin margin from the potential financial risks. Finally, derivatives users are, overall, better at generating sales from assets than non-users because derivatives use allow them to manage the associated incremental financial risks better.
C36|An analysis of Delta Air Lines' oil refinery acquisition|Delta Air Lines acquired an oil refinery in April 2012 as a strategic move to hedge against higher fuel prices. Our paper analyzes the impact of the oil refinery acquisition, a backward integration strategy, on the airline's financial and operational performance, for the period Q1 2010 to Q2 2015, and we argue that the resource dependence theory best explains Delta Air Lines’ acquisition. The methodology involves descriptive statistics and short-term stock performance as well as an econometric model that estimates the impact of the oil refinery acquisition on Delta Air Lines' net income using quarterly financial and airline operating metrics data. The results indicate that it is too early to ascertain whether Delta Air Lines' oil refinery acquisition has any positive impact on its financial performance since the variable of interest is insignificant in predicting the airline's net income. Despite the apparent lack of positive impact of its oil refinery acquisition, however, the stock market has rewarded Delta Air Lines' strategy resulting in its share prices outperforming the S&P 500 and the XAL, an index of major airline stocks, in the 60-trading day period following the announcement of its acquisition.
C36|Key Determinants of Demand, Credit Underwriting, and Performance on Government-Insured Mortgage Loans in Russia|This research analyses the process of lending from Russian state-owned mortgage provider. Two-level lending and insurance of mortgage system lead to substantially higher default rates for insured loans. This means that underwriting incentives for regional operators of government mortgage loans perform poorly. We use loan-level data of issued mortgage by one regional government mortgage provided in order to understand the interdependence between underwriting, choice of contract terms including loan insurance by borrower and loan performance. We found an evidence of a difference in credit risk measures for insured and uninsured loans and interest income.
C36|Demand-side management by electric utilities in Switzerland: Analyzing its impact on residential electricity demand|In this paper, we use panel data from a survey conducted on 30 utilities in Switzerland to estimate the impact of demand-side management (DSM) activity on residential electricity demand. Using the variation in DSM activity within utilities and across utilities over time we identify the impact of DSM programs and find that their presence reduces per customer residential electricity consumption by around 5%. If we consider monetary spending, the effect of a 10% increase in DSM spending causes a 0.14% reduction in per customer residential electricity consumption. The cost of saving a kilowatt hour is around 0.04CHF while the average cost of producing and distributing electricity in Switzerland is around 0.18CHF per kilowatt hour. We conclude that current DSM practices in Switzerland have a statistically significant effect on reducing the demand for residential electricity.
C36|Intergovernmental transfers and expenditure arrears|Local governments may increase expenditure arrears to relax the financial constraints induced by intergovernmental transfer cuts. We assess this hypothesis using information from accounting and financial reports from Italian municipalities for the period 2003-2010. By exploiting the long-lasting effect of the 1977-1978 structural reform of Italian local public finance, we employ an instrumental variable approach to address endogeneity concerns. We find robust empirical evidence that the lower the intergovernmental grants, the larger the use of arrears in public investment expenditures by municipalities. We argue that, when local governments are not subject to effective controls on the formation of arrears but fiscal rules impose binding budget constraints, a cut in intergovernmental transfers can partially diminish the effectiveness of fiscal consolidation at local level.
C36|Assortative Mating on Education: A Genetic Assessment|Abstract: Social scientists have overwhelmingly documented a strong and increasing educational homogamy between spouses. When estimating sorting by education, the presence of measurement error in the education variables or random factors in the matching process may underestimate the actual degree of assortative mating, simultaneity bias may overestimate it, while omitting other individual characteristics relevant in the marriage market may under- or overestimate it. We address these issues using an instrumental variables approach based on exploiting genetic variation in polygenic scores and controlling for population stratification. Specifically, we instrument spousal education with his/her educational polygenic score while controlling for own educational polygenic score. If the exclusion restriction is satisfied, our findings indicate that (1) assortative mating is underestimated when using OLS, and that (2) male education is correlated with other matching-relevant socioeconomic characteristics, while female education is productive per se in the matching. If the exclusion restriction is not satisfied, our evidence is consistent with (2). This suggests that individual socioeconomic attractiveness in the marriage market is multidimensional for men, but can be summarized with education for women.
C36|Identifying macroeconomic effects of refugee migration to Germany|The underlying note investigates migration impacts on the German economy, explicitly distinguishing between refugee and non-refugee immigration. For this purpose, we propose a macroeconometric modelling approach complemented by instrumental variables. We find that refugee migration causes positive short-run reactions that would typically be connected to the demand side of the economy. However, it exerts negative effects on GDP and the labour market in the medium run. In contrast, non-refugee immigration turns out to have more beneficial medium-run effects.
C36|Couples' Retirement under Individual Pension Design: A Regression Discontinuity Study for France|Retirement policies are individually designed but the majority of people of retirement age live as couples. We estimate the effects of a French pension reform on spouses' employment decisions. We use labor-force survey data, pooled over different years, on fifty thousand French couples and apply a regression discontinuity framework, also controlling for couple's unobserved heterogeneity. We conclude that the reform immediately reduced both spouses' retirement probability. The wife's retirement probability also drops by 1 to 4 percentage points if the husband is hit by the reform, and vice-versa. Instrumenting spousal retirement with legal retirement age, own retirement probability rises by 2 to 6 percentage points upon spousal retirement.
C36|Missing data, imputation, and endogeneity|Bassmann (1957, 1959) introduced two-stage least squares (2SLS). In subsequent work, Basmann et al. (1971) investigated its finite sample performance. Here we build on this tradition focusing on the issue of 2SLS estimation of a structural model when data on the endogenous covariate is missing for some observations. Many such imputation techniques have been proposed in the literature. However, there is little guidance available for choosing among existing techniques, particularly when the covariate being imputed is endogenous. Moreover, because the finite sample bias of 2SLS is not monotonically decreasing in the degree of measurement accuracy, the most accurate imputation method is not necessarily the method that minimizes the bias of 2SLS. Instead, we explore imputation methods designed to increase the first-stage strength of the instrument(s), even if such methods entail lower imputation accuracy. We do so via simulations as well as with an application related to the medium-run effects of birth weight.
C36|Can human capital variables be technology changing? An empirical test for rural households in Burkina Faso|In this article, we assess the role that human capital indicators play as technology changing variables in smallholder households in Burkina Faso. We use recent nationally representative household level data and regression analysis to empirically assess the role of weight-for-height, formal education and age of adult household members active in agriculture, in smallholder production. Recognizing the endogeneity of weight-for-height and variable inputs, we use instrumental variables regression and model the coefficients in the production function as functions of human capital variables. Our results reveal that human capital indicators can indeed be considered as technology-changing affecting both the slope and the intercept of the production function. Weight-for-height enhances returns to land but negatively affects returns to female labor. Formal education enhances the productivity of male labor but negatively affects returns to land. Differentiating households by landholding quintiles reveals that the technology changing role of human capital variables is much more evident for households with larger landholdings.

C36|Terrorism and philanthropy: the effect of terror attacks on the scope of giving by individuals and households|Abstract Behavioral reactions to terrorism may be displayed in different ways. While some individuals react by holding back on their financial and charitable activities following stressful events, others may express more generosity by increasing their giving due to solidarity and empathy with the victims, or out of heightened nationalism and patriotism. Using a longitudinal analysis of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict as a case study to uncover the relations between terrorism and philanthropic behavior, we find that terror attacks increase considerably the scope of giving by individuals and households. Our empirical approach relies on a unique panel dataset of 152,731 tax itemizer philanthropists and terrorism data from 1999 to 2011. The results are statistically significant and robust across a multitude of model specifications. Furthermore, we use an instrumental variable approach to identify a causal link and address potential endogeneity concerns. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to empirically identify and quantify the effect of sequential terror attacks on philanthropy over a relatively long period using detailed micro-level information.
C36|Multidimensional Auctions for Public Energy Efficiency Projects: Evidence from Japanese Esco Market|Abstract Competitive bidding is an important policy tool for governments to procure goods and services at the lowest possible cost in the market. Under the traditional public procurement system, however, it is difficult to purchase a highly customized object, such as energy efficiency services, because not only prices but also other nonmonetary aspects need to be taken into account. Multidimensional auctions are useful in such cases. The paper examines the cluster of characteristics of the winning bids of multidimensional auctions for public energy service company (ESCO) projects in Japan. As theory predicts, it is found that the competition effect is significant. Other institutional aspects—such as preannouncement of an energy savings target—are also found important to promote energy efficiency. The results also indicate that the public sector should absorb the regulatory and institutional risks that are related to ESCO projects.
C36|Dual-class versus single-class firms: information asymmetry|Abstract I examine information asymmetry in dual-class firms in general and when they need (do not need) additional external capital. In general the results show that dual-class firms have higher information asymmetry than single-class firms. When dual-class firms need additional external financing, the gap in information asymmetry between dual-class firms and single class firms is narrower. I find that as the need of additional external capital increases, the difference in information asymmetry between dual-class and single-class firms decreases (consistent with increased disclosures). It decreases, up to a point that there is no difference in information asymmetry with single-class firms that also needs additional external capital. When using adverse selection component of bid-ask spread, the paper finds that as the need of external financing gets high, dual-class firms show lower information asymmetry 1 year before they need additional external capital.
C36|Applications of simultaneous equations in finance research: methods and empirical results|Abstract The main purposes of this paper are: (1) to review finance literature using simultaneous equations method, (2) to discuss the difference among two-stage least squares (2SLS), three-stage least squares (3SLS) and generalized method of moments (GMM) methods under different assumptions, and (3) to investigate the interrelationship among investment, financing, and dividend decisions as an example to demonstrate the discussion. We review studies that apply the simultaneous equations estimation on capital structure, corporate investment, payout decisions, ownership structure, corporate governance, stock return, firm performance and/or other corporate issues. In addition to these three methods, we also present Pagan and Hall’s (Econom Rev 2:159–218, 1983) test of heteroskedasticity and weak instruments test for selecting the applicable method and testing the validity of instruments. Finally, we investigate the interrelationship among investment, financing and dividend decisions using 2SLS, 3SLS, and GMM methods based on the US listed firm annual data between 1965 and 2012. Our results show that these three corporate decisions are co-determined and the interaction among them should be taken into account in a simultaneous equations framework.
C36|The Effect of Country Risk on Foreign Direct Investment: A Dynamic Panel Data Analysis for Developing Countries|Issues created by inconsistency make difficult for investors to make healthy decisions. Risks and uncertainty may lead investors to have bad decisions which result in low level of profit from investments. The purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of country risk on the direct foreign investments (FDI). In the study in which annual data between the years of 2002 and 2014 belong to 49 countries are utilized, the relationships between the variables are analyzed through two phase system-GMM dynamic panel method. Three model assumptions are made for the study. According to the assumption results of the first model which focus on the country risk’s effect on the FDI inflows; the decrease in the country risk increases the FDI inflows. The results of second model through which the effects of sub elements of country risk (financial, economic and political risk) on the FDI are analyzed separately show that financial risk does not create statistically meaningful effect while the decrease in economic and political risk affects the FDI inflows in positive means. Finally, according to the results of the third model which focus on the effect of FDI inflows on the country risks; FDI creates a decreasing effect for country risk and indirectly inconsistencies.
C36|Evidence of the Impact of Children´s Domestic and Market Labor on Learning from School Census Data in Brazil|In this study we analyze the impact of domestic and market child labor on learning using Prova Brazil census data from 2007 and 2011. To do that, we created a large panel dataset with students in 5th and 9th Grades. To measure the impact of children working in the labor market and/or in their households on Portuguese and Mathematics test scores, we estimated fixed effect models. An instrumental variable approach, proposed by Lewbel, was applied to the models to control for the endogeneity of child labor. Possible attrition bias was taken into account through inverse probability weights. Results show that the work performed by children either in the household, or in the labor market was detrimental to their academic performance, with working only in the labor market showing the largest impact for both girls and boys, followed by working both in the market and inside the house, and by working in the house alone. The largest impact was for 5th Grade girls who suffered a reduction of 19% in their Portuguese test scores when they worked only in the labor market. The largest impact for boys was a reduction of 14% in their 5th Grade Portuguese test scores when they worked only in the labor market.
C36|The bivariate probit model, maximum likelihood estimation, pseudo true parameters and partial identification|This paper examines the notion of “identification by functional form” for two equation triangular systems for binary endogenous variables by providing a bridge between the literature on the recursive bivariate probit model and that on partial identification. We evaluate the impact of functional form on the performance of (quasi) maximum likelihood estimators, and investigate the practical importance of available instruments in both cases of correct and incorrect distributional specification. Finally, we calculate average treatment effect bounds and demonstrate how properties of the estimators are explicable via a link between the notion of pseudo-true parameters and the concepts of partial identification.
C36|Demand effects of fiscal policy since 2008|The Great Recession of 2007â€“2009 has led to controversies about the role of fiscal policy. Academically this has translated into renewed interest in the effects of fiscal policy. Several studies have since suggested that fiscal multipliers are substantially larger in downswings or depressions than in upswings. In terms of economic policy reactions, countries have differed substantially in their fiscal stance. It is an important open question how big the impact of these policies on economic growth has been. The paper uses the regime-dependent multiplier estimates by Qazizada and Stockhammer (2015) and by Gechert and Rannenberg (2014) to calculate the demand effects of fiscal policy for Germany, the USA, the UK, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain since 2008. This allows us to assess to what extent fiscal policy explains different economic performances across countries. We find expansionary fiscal policy in 2008â€“2009 in all countries, but since 2010 fiscal policies have differed. While the fiscal effect was roughly neutral in Germany, the UK and the USA, it was large and negative in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain.
C36|Disability Insurance Benefits and Labor Supply Choices: Evidence from a Discontinuity in Benefit Awards|This paper explores the effects of disability insurance (DI) benefits on the labor market decision of existing DI beneficiaries using a fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) design. We identify the effect of DI benefits on the decision of working full-time, part-time or staying out of the labor force by exploiting a discontinuity in the DI benefit award rate above the age of 55. Overall, our results suggest that the Swiss DI system creates substantial lock-in effects which heavily influence the labor supply decision of existing beneficiaries: the benefit receipt increases the probability of working part-time by about 41%-points, decreases the probability of working full-time by about 42%-points but has little or no effects on the probability of staying out of the labor force for the average beneficiary. Therefore, DI benefits induce a shift in the labor supply of existing beneficiaries in the sense that they reduce their work intensity from working full-time to part-time which adds a possible explanation for the low DI outflow observed all across the OECD.
C36|Modeling Inflation in the WAEMU's Zone|This paper introduces a simple AS-AD model to examine the determinants of inflation for the members of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). On the supply side, we found France's inflation, rainfall, and real crude oil inflation to be the most important drivers of domestic inflation. On the demand side, we found the output gap to be a significant determinant of domestic inflation. Given the estimated size of the effect of the output gap on inflation, we can conclude that the short-run aggregate supply curve may be relatively flat; bolstering the Keynesian view that monetary policy could be extremely effective in stabilizing output in the short-run.
C36|Investigating the Relationship Between DSGE and SVAR Models|DSGE models often contain variables for which data is not observed when estimating. Although DSGE models generally imply that there is a finite order SVAR in all the variables this may no longer be true for SVARs just in observable variables, and so there is a VAR-truncation problem. The paper examines this issue. It looks at five different studies using DSGE models that appear in the literature. Generally it emerges that the truncation issue is probably not that important, except possibly in small open economy models with external debt. Even when there is no truncation problem in VARs which control the dynamics) the structural impulse responses from both models may be different due to differing initial responses. It is shown that DSGE models incorporate some strong restrictions on the nature of SVAR models and these would need to employed for the two approaches to give the same initial estimates.
C36|Endogeneity in Casino Revenue and Crime Rates: The Case of Las Vegas, Nevada|This paper investigates relationships among casino revenue, crime rates, and the number of visitors in Las Vegas, Nevada. Numerous studies have attempted to assess the impact of casino activities on crime rates but have provided inconclusive results. Some studies have found that casino activities increase crime rates, while others find no significant relationship between casino gambling and crime rates. But all studies that have found casinos increase crime rates do not adjust the crime rate for the number of visitors to the area. The impact of casino activities on crime rates disappears, however, when crime rates are adjusted for visitors. This study revisits the question with consideration for the potential endogeneity among variables. This paper addresses endogeneity concerns by estimating the impact of casino activities on crime using a system of equations to represent casino activities, adjusted crime rates, and visitors. Three stage least squares is used to estimate the system. Results show that the impact of casino activities on crime rates persists even after crime rates are adjusted for the visitors. Efforts to reduce crime can be effective in boosting the Las Vegas regional economy.
C36|Peer Networks and Tobacco Consumption in South Africa|This paper deepens the empirical analysis of peer networks by considering simultaneously their effects smoking participation and smoking intensity. Peer network is key in determining the smoking behaviour of youths, but the magnitude of the effects is still debated, questioned and inconclusive. I used a control function approach, a two-step least square and the fixed effect method to address the potential endogeneity of peer network. The results suggest positive and signicant peer effects on smoking participation and intensity. While the magnitude of the estimates of smoking participation varies across methodological approaches (ranging between 4 and 20 percent), that of smoking intensity ranges between 3 and 22 percent. Including older adults in the peer reference group increases the peer eects. The findings suggest that policies (excise tax) that directly aect the decision to smoke and the smoking intensity of the peer reference group are likely to aect own smoking behaviour.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
C36|Adoption Of Electronic Commerce In Thai Travel Small And Medium Enterprises|This paper is aim to investigate factors affecting the adoption of e-commerce based on technological, organizational, and environmental (TOE) framework and the extended Model of Internet Commerce Adoption (eMICA). An online survey was employed to collect data from Thai travel small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that have company websites are registered with the Thai Department of Business Development and are a member of the Tourism Authority of Thailand. Data from 125 usable cases was analyzed using multiple regression. Results revealed that (1) only competition intensity positively affected the first (promotion) stage of EC adoption, (2) relative advantage and organizational readiness were found to be the determinants of EC adoption in the second stage of the provision of information and services, and (3) only organizational readiness was found to influence EC adoption in the third (processing) stage. Implications for practice and research are discussed.
C36|Measuring the consequences of short-termism in business – the econometric evidence for a sample of European companies|The problem of short-termism leads to too much focus of the executives on short- -term goals at the cost of long-term objectives of their firms. In order to investigate the consequences of this phenomenon, we use the panel data on 1024 of the largest companies listed on the European stock markets over the 1998–2013 period. In our econometric specifications, we measure the consequences of short-termism, distinguishing between the short- and long-run effects of CEO tenure on the company’s performance, approximated by its market capitalization and ROE. In order to investigate the impact of short-termism on the company’s performance in the short run and to account for the potential endogeneity of CEO tenure, we use the system GMM and compare it with more standard panel specifications. As regards the measurement of the long run impact of distinct variables on the company’s performance, we use the cross-sectional models based on the long-run transformations of our dataset. Our results show that the longer the CEO tenure, the better the company’s performance due to, among other things, a higher propensity to invest, which – despite adversely affecting company’s market capitalization in the short run – increases the company’s long-term value and average profitability.
C36|Granger Causality and Structural Causality in Cross-Section and Panel Data|Granger non-causality in distribution is fundamentally a probabilistic conditional independence notion that can be applied not only to time series data but also to cross-section and panel data. In this paper, we provide a natural de nition of structural causality in cross-section and panel data and forge a direct link between Granger (G-) causality and structural causality under a key conditional exogeneity assumption. To put it simply, when structural e¤ects are well de ned and identi able, G-non-causality follows from structural non-causality, and with suitable conditions (e.g., separability or monotonicity), structural causality also implies G-causality. This justi es using tests of G-non- causality to test for structural non-causality under the key conditional exogeneity assumption for both cross-section and panel data. We pay special attention to heterogeneous populations, allowing both structural heterogeneity and distributional heterogeneity. Most of our results are obtained for the general case, without assuming linearity, monotonicity in observables or unobservables, or separability between observed and unobserved variables in the structural relations.
C36|Grade retention and unobserved heterogeneity| We study the treatment effect of grade retention using a panel of French junior high‐school students, taking unobserved heterogeneity and the endogeneity of grade repetitions into account. We specify a multistage model of human‐capital accumulation with a finite number of types representing unobserved individual characteristics. Class‐size and latent student‐performance indices are assumed to follow finite mixtures of normal distributions. Grade retention may increase or decrease the student's knowledge capital in a type‐dependent way. Our estimation results show that the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) of grade retention on test scores is positive but small at the end of grade 9. Treatment effects are heterogeneous: we find that the ATT of grade retention is higher for the weakest students. We also show that class size is endogenous and tends to increase with unobserved student ability. The average treatment effect of grade retention is negative, again with the exception of the weakest group of students. Grade repetitions reduce the probability of access to grade 9 of all student types.
C36|On the econometric modelling of consumer sentiment shocks in SVARs|Abstract This paper applies recently developed methods for modelling systems of I(0) and I(1) variables to SVARs of consumer sentiment. We first model the shock associated with the structural equation for the I(0) consumer sentiment variable as having a permanent effect on the I(1) variables. Here it appears to convey news about future productivity. The contribution of the accumulated consumer sentiment shock to the permanent component of consumption and GDP increases substantially from 2000 to 2007, a finding we relate to recent work on boom–bust productivity episodes. We then model the sentiment shock as having a transitory effect on the I(1) variables. Here it appears to convey little news and is best thought of as an ‘animal spirits’ shock unrelated to productivity. The impact responses suggest that ‘animal spirits’ are not important in either model.
C36|Health status and labor force participation: evidence for urban low and middle income individuals in Colombia|Abstract This paper analyzes the relationship between individual health status and labor force participation using the first wave of the Colombian Longitudinal Survey. The empirical modeling strategy accounts for the presence of potential endogeneity between these two variables. The results show that there is a positive relationship between health and labor force participation in both directions, indicating that better health is likely to lead to a higher probability of participation in the labor market, but also that individuals who participate in the labor market are more likely to report better health. Interesting differences are uncovered when comparing the results by gender and/or age groups. For instance, for younger females, health status and higher education positively affect the probability of labor participation, whereas having children under the age of 5 and being married reduce their probability of participation. Our findings also highlight the importance of public policy to guarantee good health conditions of the population which could also have a positive impact on labor productivity and consequently on long-run economic growth.
C36|Latent Instrumental Variables: A Critical Review|This paper considers the estimation problem in linear regression when endogeneity is present, that is, when explanatory variables are correlated with the random error, and also addresses the question of a priori testing for potential endogeneity. We provide a survey of the latent instrumental variables (LIV) approach proposed by Ebbes (2004) and Ebbes et al. (2004, 2005, 2009) and examine its performance compared to the methods of ordinary least squares (OLS) and IV regression. The distinctive feature of Ebbesâ€™ approach is that no observed instruments are required. Instead â€˜optimalâ€™ instruments are estimated from data and allow for endogeneity testing. Importantly, this Hausman-LIV test is a simple tool that can be used to test for potential endogeneity in regression analysis and indicate when LIV regression is more appropriate and should be performed instead of OLS regression. The LIV models considered comprise the standard one where the latent variable is discrete with at least two fixed categories and two interesting extensions, multilevel models where a nonparametric Bayes algorithm completely determines the LIVâ€™s distribution from data. This paper suggests that while Ebbesâ€™ new method is a distinct contribution, its formulation is problematic in certain important respects. Specifically the various publications of Ebbes and collaborators employ three distinct and inequivalent statistical concepts exchangeably, treating all as one and the same. We clarify this and then discuss estimation of returns of education in income based on data from three studies that Ebbes (2004) revisited, where â€˜educationâ€™ is potentially endogenous due to omitted â€˜ability.â€™ While the OLS estimate exhibits a slight upwards bias of 7%, 8%, and 6%, respectively, relative to the LIV estimate for the three studies, IV estimation leads to an enormous bias of 93%, 40%, and -24% when there is no consensus about the direction of the bias. This provides one instance among many well known applications where IVs introduced more substantial biases to the estimated causal effects than OLS, even though IVs were pioneered to overcome the endogeneity problem. In a second example we scrutinize the results of Ferguson et al. (2015) on the estimated effect of campaign expenditures on the proportions of Democratic and Republican votes in US House and Senate elections between 1980 and 2014, where â€˜campaign moneyâ€™ is potentially endogenous in view of omitted variables such as â€˜a candidateâ€™s popularity.â€™ A nonparametric Bayesian spatial LIV regression model was adopted to incorporate identified spatial autocorrelation and account for endogeneity. The relative bias of the spatial regression estimate as compared to the spatial LIV estimate ranges between -17% to 18% for the House and between -25% to 7% for the Senate.
C36|Political Lending|Using a unique dataset provided by the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP), we document a direct channel through which financial institutions contribute to the net worth of members of the U.S. Congress, particularly those sitting on the finance committees in the Senate and the House of Representatives. These individuals report greater levels of leverage and new liabilities as a proportion of their total net worth, relative to when they are not part of the finance committee or relative to other congressional members. Politicians increase new liabilities by over 30% of their net worth in the first year of their finance committee membership. We do not find similar patterns for members of non-finance powerful committees. We find no evidence that finance committee members arrange new personal liabilities ahead of their appointments to the committees. Finance committee members also report liabilities with lower interest rates and longer maturities. Finally, focusing on banks that lend to U.S. Congress members, we find that the weaker performing financial institutions lend to more finance committee members and provide more new debt to these politicians. Our findings suggest that lenders may create political connections with finance committee members in an attempt to obtain regulatory benefits.
C36|Parallelization Experience with Four Canonical Econometric Models Using ParMitISEM|This paper presents the parallel computing implementation of the MitISEM algorithm, labeled Parallel MitISEM . The basic MitISEM algorithm provides an automatic and flexible method to approximate a non-elliptical target density using adaptive mixtures of Student- t densities, where only a kernel of the target density is required. The approximation can be used as a candidate density in Importance Sampling or Metropolis Hastings methods for Bayesian inference on model parameters and probabilities. We present and discuss four canonical econometric models using a Graphics Processing Unit and a multi-core Central Processing Unit version of the MitISEM algorithm. The results show that the parallelization of the MitISEM algorithm on Graphics Processing Units and multi-core Central Processing Units is straightforward and fast to program using MATLAB. Moreover the speed performance of the Graphics Processing Unit version is much higher than the Central Processing Unit one.
C36|Can environmental policy reduce infant mortality? Evidence from the Ganga Pollution Cases|In many developing countries, environmental quality remains low and policies to improve it have been inconsistently effective. We conduct a case study of environmental policy in India, focusing on unprecedented Supreme Court rulings that targeted industrial pollution in the Ganga River. In a difference-in-differences framework, we find that the rulings precipitated reductions in river pollution and one-month infant mortality, both of which persist for more than a decade. We then estimate a pollution-mortality dose-response function across twenty-nine rivers in the Ganga Basin, instrumenting for pollution with its upstream counterpart. The estimation reveals a significant external health burden of river pollution, not just in the district of measurement, but also on downstream communities. It further provides suggestive evidence that reducing pollution was an important driver behind declines in infant mortality observed after the rulings.
C36|IV Quantile Regression for Group‐Level Treatments, With an Application to the Distributional Effects of Trade| We present a methodology for estimating the distributional effects of an endogenous treatment that varies at the group level when there are group‐level unobservables, a quantile extension of Hausman and Taylor, 1981. Because of the presence of group‐level unobservables, standard quantile regression techniques are inconsistent in our setting even if the treatment is independent of unobservables. In contrast, our estimation technique is consistent as well as computationally simple, consisting of group‐by‐group quantile regression followed by two‐stage least squares. Using the Bahadur representation of quantile estimators, we derive weak conditions on the growth of the number of observations per group that are sufficient for consistency and asymptotic zero‐mean normality of our estimator. As in Hausman and Taylor, 1981, micro‐level covariates can be used as internal instruments for the endogenous group‐level treatment if they satisfy relevance and exogeneity conditions. Our approach applies to a broad range of settings including labor, public finance, industrial organization, urban economics, and development; we illustrate its usefulness with several such examples. Finally, an empirical application of our estimator finds that low‐wage earners in the United States from 1990 to 2007 were significantly more affected by increased Chinese import competition than high‐wage earners.
C36|IT outsourcing and firm productivity: Eliminating bias from selective missingness in the dependent variable|Missing values are a major problem in all econometric applications based on survey data. A standard approach assumes data are missing-at-random and uses imputation methods, or even listwise deletion. This approach is justified if item non-response does not depend on the potentially missing variables' realization. However, assuming missing-at-random may introduce bias if non-response is, in fact, selective. Relevant applications range from financial or strategic firm-level data to individual-level data on income or privacy-sensitive behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to deal with selective item nonresponse in the model's dependent variable. Our approach is based on instrumental variables that affect selection only through potential outcomes. In addition, we allow for endogenous regressors. We establish identification of the structural parameter and propose a simple two-step estimation procedure for it. Our estimator is consistent and robust against biases that would prevail when assuming missingness at random. We implement the estimation procedure using firm-level survey data and a binary instrumental variable to estimate the effect of outsourcing on productivity.
C36|On Bootstrap Validity for Subset Anderson-Rubin Test in IV Regressions|This paper sheds new light on subset hypothesis testing in linear structural models in which instrumental variables (IVs) can be arbitrarily weak. For the first time, we investigate the validity of the bootstrap for Anderson-Rubin (AR) type tests of hypotheses specified on a subset of structural parameters, with or without identification. Our investigation focuses on two subset AR type statistics based on the plug-in principle. The first one uses the restricted limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) as the plug-in method, and the second exploits the restricted two-stage least squares (2SLS). We provide an analysis of the limiting distributions of both the standard and proposed bootstrap AR statistics under the subset null hypothesis of interest. Our results provide some new insights and extensions of earlier studies. In all cases, we show that when identification is strong and the number of instruments is fixed, the bootstrap provides a high-order approximation of the null limiting distributions of both plug-in subset statistics. However, the bootstrap is inconsistent when instruments are weak. This contrasts with the bootstrap of the AR statistic of the null hypothesis specified on the full vector of structural parameters, which remains valid even when identification is weak; see Moreira et al. (2009). We present a Monte Carlo experiment that confirms our theoretical findings.
C36|Post-Selection and Post-Regularization Inference in Linear Models with Many Controls and Instruments|We consider estimation of and inference about coefficients on endogenous variables in a linear instrumental variables model where the number of instruments and exogenous control variables are each allowed to be larger than the sample size. We work within an approximately sparse framework that maintains that the signal available in the instruments and control variables may be effectively captured by a small number of the available variables. We provide a LASSO-based method for this setting which provides uniformly valid inference about the coefficients on endogenous variables. We illustrate the method through an application to demand estimation.
C36|Did Gender-Bias Matter in the Quantity- Quality Trade-off in the 19th Century France ?|Recent theoretical developments of growth models, especially on unified theories of growth, suggest that the child quantity-quality trade-off has been a central element of the transition from Malthusian stagnation to sustained growth. Using an original censusbased dataset, this paper explores the role of gender on the trade-off between education and fertility across 86 French counties during the nineteenth century, as an empirical extension of Diebolt-Perrin (2013). We first test the existence of the child quantity-quality trade-off in 1851. Second, we explore the long-run effect of education on fertility from a gendered approach. Two important results emerge: (i) significant and negative association between education and fertility is found, and (ii) such a relationship is non-unique over the distribution of education/fertility. While our results suggest the existence of a negative and significant effect of the female endowments in human capital on the fertility transition, the effects of negative endowment almost disappear at low level of fertility.
C36|Food crop marketing and agricultural productivity in a high price environment: evidence and implications for Mozambique|Abstract This paper assesses the relationships between smallholder agricultural productivity and market participation in a high food price environment in Mozambique. To understand the bi-directional nature of these relationships we used panel data methods to evaluate the relative importance of market participation (measured in terms of sales intensity) compared to household and farm-level factors in explaining productivity changes; and the relative importance of crop productivity versus marketing investments in explaining household market participation. Results indicate that, for smallholder farmers in Mozambique, investments that lead to increased adoption of productivity enhancing technologies could have significantly higher impacts on sales intensity than efforts to increase sales intensity could have on productivity. The magnitude of estimated effects is relatively stronger for cereals and beans/groundnuts than for roots/tubers, reflecting the role of the latter as food reserve/insurance crops. The results indicate that productivity investments for cereals and beans/groundnuts crops can help boost production and sales intensity significantly in a time when market participation rates are on the rise in response to better prices. For roots/tubers, investing in processing facilities and creating demand for processed root products combined with improvements in farm-level productivity may provide better long-term prospects than improvements in productivity alone.
C36|The Effects of Smallholder Agricultural Involvement on Household Food Consumption and Dietary Diversity: Evidence from Malawi| We investigate how household agricultural involvement affects food consumption and dietary diversity in Malawi. Ceteris paribus, a 10% increase in onfarm income share increases food consumption/capita by 2.9%, calorie intake/person/day by 1.7%, and leads to small improvements in dietary diversity. There are significant differences in the relationship between on-farm income shares and caloric shares: a positive and significant relationship with the shares from energy dense/low protein cereals/grains, but not significant with shares from nuts/pulses and sugars. Negative relationships are found with shares from roots/tubers, vegetables/fruits, oils/fats, and meat/fish/milk. While food consumption and dietary diversity increase with agricultural involvement, the quality of diets is an issue. As purchased calories are associated with richer/high quality diets, particularly protein rich, households with lower dependency on agriculture meet those diets more easily, highlighting the importance of crop and income diversification to dietary diversity. Nutrition education and crop diversification programs can improve food security and nutritional outcomes.
C36|Gender differential Impact of NERICA adoption on Total Factor Productivity: evidence from Benin Republic| This study examines the relationship between adoption of NERICA varieties and the Total Factor Productivity among men and women. Data were collected from 342 rice farmers randomly selected in the central and northwest Benin. Total Factor Productivity was estimated using a Cobb-Douglass production function. The impact was estimated using the Local Average Treatment Effect. Results show that the adoption of NERICA variety improves Total Factor Productivity of potential adopters and it benefits men and women differently. Potential women adopters got a higher gain on their Total Factor Productivity than men. This finding suggests that targeting women with NERICA increase significantly rice productivity more than the case where men are targeted.
C36|Preference for Redistribution and Inequality Perception in China: Evidence from the CGSS 2006|"In this paper I investigate the conditional correlation between preference for redistribution and the perceived role of ""circumstances"" and ""effort"" using the Chinese General Social Survey. I found very signi?cant correlations, thus validating the hypothesis of ""sense of justice"" for China. The migrant worker group who has dual identity (living/working in an urban area while being registered as a rural individual) is analysed in order to identify a discrimination effect (induced by the Chinese rural-urban segmentation policy) upon attitudes. However, being migrant is an endogenous variable to the attitude variables and the consistent estimate of this effect is much more important than the effect produced by a naïve estimate. The econometric model is a multivariate triangular LDV system with a binary endogenous explanatory variable estimated via a GHK simulator method. To implement the GHK calculations, I propose a parametric constraint to impose the positivity of the 3 × 3 correlation matrix. A generalisation for higher dimension cases is provided."
C36|Trade regimes and bilateral trade in the EU enlargement process: Focus on the Western Balkans|This paper aims at investigating the role of different trade regimes in determining the bilateral trade of Western Balkan countries and the enlarged European Union between 2001–2010. Special focus is laid on the intra-regional trade of Western Balkan countries and complementarities of this sub-regional trade integration and the EU accession process. Using panel data, we estimated the gravity model of bilateral exports from Western Balkan and Central Eastern European countries to the core EU members in the 2001–2010 period. The results confirm the importance of EU membership for the development of acceding countries’ trade and shed light on asymmetrical trade regimes as important factors of boosting the bilateral trade flows. Additionally, CEFTA 2006 has a significant contribution to intra-regional Western Balkans trade.
C36|Convergence of the risk for nonparametric IV quantile regression and nonparametric IV regression with full independence|In econometrics some nonparametric instrumental regression models and nonparametric demand models with endogeneity lead to nonlinear integral equations with unknown integral kernels. We prove convergence rates of the risk for the iteratively regularized Newton method applied to these problems. Compared to related results we relay on a weaker non-linearity condition and have stronger convergence results. We demonstrate by numerical simulations for a nonparametric IV regression problem with continuous instrument and regressor that the method produces better results than the standard method.
C36|Renforcer l’efficacité de la convergence macroéconomique dans la CEMAC|Within a multilateral monitoring framework, EMCCA countries have been pursuing the process of macroeconomic convergence since 1994. In this context, this paper seeks to illustrate if that process is economic growth-enhancing. To achieve this objective, use is made of an augmented Solow growth model. Results show that the implementation of the convergence criteria registered no significant effect on economic growth among member countries. These findings were largely attributable to the high degree of heterogeneity among EMCCA economies. Restructuring the existing multilateral monitoring mechanisms, with this in mind, would unleash the desired economic growth impact. Codes JEL: C33, C36, F020, O55.
