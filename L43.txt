L43|Persuasion Meets Delegation|A principal can restrict an agent’s information (the persuasion problem) or restrict an agent’s discretion (the delegation problem). We show that these problems are generally equivalent - solving one solves the other. We use tools from the persuasion literature to generalize and extend many results in the delegation literature, as well as to address novel delegation problems, such as monopoly regulation with a participation constraint.
L43|Organizing Competition for the Market|The paper studies competition for the market in a setting where incumbents (and, to a lesser extent, neighboring incumbents) benefit from a cost advantage. The paper first compares the outcome of staggered and synchronous tenders, before drawing the implications for market design. We find that the timing of tenders should depend on the likelihood of monopolization. When monopolization is expected, synchronous tendering is preferable, as it strengthens the pressure that entrants exercise on the monopolist. When instead other firms remain active, staggered tendering is preferable, as it maximizes the competitive pressure that comes from the other firms.
L43|Narrowing the 'Digital Divide': The Role of Complementarities Between Fixed and Mobile Data in South Africa|We study substitution between fixed and mobile broadband services in South Africa using survey data on 134,000 individuals between 2009 and 2014. In our discrete-choice model, individuals choose fixed or mobile voice and data services in a framework that allows them to be substitutes or complements. We find that voice services are complements on average but data services are substitutes. However, many consumers see data services as complements. Our results show that having a computer and access to an internet connection at work or school are more important than reducing mobile data prices by 10% in driving broadband penetration.

L43|The European Framework for Regulating Telecommunications: A 25-year Appraisal|Abstract The European telecommunications sector has been radically transformed in the past 25 years: from a group of state monopolies to a set of increasingly competitive markets. In this paper we summarize how this process has unfolded—for both fixed and mobile telecommunications—by focusing on the evolution of the regulatory framework and by drawing some parallels with the evolution of the sector in the US. Given the major strategic importance of the sector, we highlight some of the challenges that lie ahead.
L43|Pros and cons of liberalization of romeâ€™s local public transport service|The research presented in this paper contributes to the ongoing debate on the public vs private ownership by re-examining the case of Romeâ€™s local public transport (LPT) system. After having illustrated the main reasons that led Roman citizens to ask for a referendum, the research provides a brief historical overview of Romeâ€™s LPT system and discusses the main stylized facts presented in the institutional literature surveyed. Finally, the summary statistics are built using publicly available data. The results of the analysis highlight how ATACâ€™s inefficiency is only partially endogenous, as the â€œimportedâ€ territorial inefficiency is not negligible. This issue deserves more attention as, even if liberalization might enter a new â€œgolden ageâ€ , the existence of structural inefficiencies might reduce the margins needed to convince private providers to enter the market, at least in those production segments more related to public interests.
L43|State Trading Deregulation and Prairie Durum Wheat Production|We estimate the impact of the 2012 removal of the Canadian Wheat Board’s (CWB) single-desk on the spatial pattern of durum wheat acres in Western Canada. We analyze changes in durum seeded acres with a panel regression and Census Agricultural Region data from 2004–2016. Our results indicate that removal of the CWB single-desk had a significant impact on total durum production in Western Canada. In addition, we find that the spatial distribution of durum wheat acres shifted towards drier areas, an improvement in the efficiency of resource allocation.​
L43|Going Places: Rail Transport in Japan|The purpose of this short paper is to summarize the state of rail transportation in Japan and to recount recent developments. Points of focus here are organization and types of competition in the rail industry in Japan, the evolution of passenger and freight rail transportation, yardstick regulation as a competition tool, and recent vertical separation in Japan. Several distinguishing factors of the Japanese rail industry are discussed. First, passenger rail transportation is still vital in Japan, but the freight rail business is weaker than in other major industrial countries. The second notable feature of the rail industry in Japan is the extraordinary number of rail operators, the vast majority of which are privately owned passenger railways. Third, most railways are vertically integrated, and entry into and exit from the market are not free but are regulated. Fourth, there are eight types of competition, among which is yardstick competition, an indirect form that is applied to separate markets and has existed in Japan since the 1970s. Fifth, as for the evolution of passenger and freight rail transportation, two developmentsâ€”the Ekinaka business for passenger rail and the Eco-Rail-Mark certificate system for freightâ€”are underway in the rail industry. Sixth, yardstick regulation is effective to some degree, but it is unknown how long the effect will continue. Last, while vertical integration is the norm in Japan, there are cases of vertical separation in some urban area operations. Recently, however, new types of vertical separation have been emerging, mostly for financial reasons. As competition in Japanâ€™s rail industry has been very limited up to now, Japanese policy makers would be wise to seek lessons from the European experience.
L43|Optimal certification policy, entry, and investment in the presence of public signals|We explore the optimal disclosure policy of a certification intermediary in an environment where (i) the seller's decision on entry and investment in product quality are endogenous and (ii) the buyers observe an additional public signal on quality. The intermediary mutes the seller's entry incentives but enhances investment incentives following entry, and the optimal policy maximizes rent extraction from the seller in the face of this trade-off. We identify conditions under which full, partial or no disclosure can be optimal. The intermediary's report becomes noisier as the public signal gets more precise, but if the public signal becomes too precise, the intermediary resorts to full disclosure. In the presence of an intermediary, a more precise public signal may also lead to lower social welfare.
L43|Screening instruments for monitoring market power: The return on withholding capacity index (RWC)|While markets have been liberalized all over the world, incumbents often still hold a dominant position, e.g. on energy markets. Thus, wholesale electricity markets are subject to market surveillance. Nevertheless, consolidated findings on abusive practices of market power and their cause and effect in these markets are scarce and non-controversial market monitoring practices fail to exist. Right now, the Residual Supply Index (RSI) is the most important instrument for market monitoring. However, a major drawback of this index is its focus on just one specific aspect of market power in wholesale electricity markets whereas different consequences of market power are possible. Hence, markets could be distorted in several ways and we propose the 'Return on Withholding Capacity Index' (RWC) as a complementary index to the RSI. The index is a measure of the firms' incentive to withhold capacity. The benefits and practicability of the RWC is shown by an application on data for the German-Austrian electricity wholesale market in 2016.
L43|Restructuring the Chinese Freight Railway: Two Scenarios|Twenty years of debate regarding the restructuring of the Chinese freight railway have failed to yield a consensus. Early policy statements favoring the creation of above-the-rail competition over a monopoly infrastructure – the “European” model of rail restructuring – have broadened into a lively policy and scholarly debate that includes as an alternative the division of the system into competing vertically integrated railways – the “Americas” model of restructuring. To date, however, there have been no tangible reform steps beyond organizational restructuring, the construction of new coal railroads, some with private-sector participation, and the introduction of scheduled service, especially for containers, between China and Europe. In this paper we argue in favor of the Americas model as a basis for restructuring and offer two alternative scenarios for the creation of multiple vertically integrated freight railways. Both plans enable competition between independent firms and routes for import/export traffic, one a southern, One Belt/One Road path, the other a northern path via the Trans-Siberian Railway.
L43|One Markup to Rule Them All: Taxation by Liquor Pricing Regulation|Government often chooses simple rules to regulate industry even when firms and consumers are heterogeneous. We evaluate the implications of this practice in the context of alcohol pricing where the regulator uses a single markup rule that does not vary across products. We estimate an equilibrium model of wholesale pricing and retail demand for horizontally differentiated spirits that allows for heterogeneity in consumer preferences based on observable demographics. We show that the single markup increases market power among upstream firms, particularly small firms whose portfolios are better positioned to take advantage of the policy. For consumers, the single markup acts as a progressive tax by overpricing products favored by the rich. It also decreases aggregate consumer welfare though 16.7% of consumers are better off under the policy. These consumers tend to be older, less wealthy or educated, and minorities. Simple policies therefore generate significant cross-subsidies and may be an effective tool for government to garner favor of key constituencies.
L43|Persuasion Meets Delegation|There are two common ways for a principal to influence the decision making of an agent. One is to manipulate the agent's information (persuasion problem). Another is to limit the agent's decisions (delegation problem). We show that, under general assumptions, these two problems are equivalent; so solving one problem solves the other. We illustrate how the methods developed in the persuasion literature can be applied to address unsolved delegation problems by considering monopoly regulation with a participation constraint.
L43|Do economic regulatory agencies matter to private-sector involvement in water utilities in developing countries?|This paper suggests that, for developing countries, the creation of economic regulatory agencies, separate from the ministry in charge of water and sanitation, may not be a necessary or sufficient condition to stimulate large scale private involvement (PPPs) in the sector. The odds of an impact are higher for Latin American countries than other regions and for countries with higher income levels. They are also better when inflation is high. At the margin, the odds are unrelated to the contract type, except for greenfield projects, for which they may be contraindicated.
L43|Estimating the impact of co-investment in fiber to the home coverage|Does co-investment enhance fiber to the home (FTTH) coverage? We combine several French municipality-level datasets to answer this question. We find that a 1% co-financing share by co-investors leads to an increase in FTTH coverage by 0.8% during the 2013-2016 study period and a 0.6% annual progression. This result is robust to changes in the specification and instrument and is consistent with the outcome of a simple difference-in-differences analysis comparing FTTH coverage in co-investment areas with areas with no co-investment ceteris paribus. In addition, we find that a 1% co-investment increases FTTH adoption among Orange's fixed broadband customers by 1.2% and decreases Orange's total fixed broadband penetration for asymmetric digital subscriber lines (ADSL) plus FTTH coverage by 1.1%, which benefits competitors. Our findings confirm that co-investment supports the policy objectives of coverage, adoption and competition and should be supported by regulation.
L43|Competition agency guidelines and policy initiatives regarding the application of competition law vis-à-vis intellectual property: An analysis of jurisdictional approaches and emerging directions|Competition agency guidelines, policy statements and related advocacy are an important vehicle for policy expression and the guidance of firms across the full spectrum of anti-competitive practices and market conduct. The role of guidelines and policy statements has, arguably, been particularly important in the context of the competition policy treatment of intellectual property rights, given the complexity of this area, the importance that competition agencies attach to it, and its importance for innovation, technology transfer and economic growth. As such, this important normative material also provides a useful empirical foundation for mapping relevant trends and the evolution of policy thinking over time and across jurisdictions. In this light, the paper examines the competition agency guidelines, policy statements and related initiatives regarding intellectual property (IP) of the following three sets of jurisdictions: (i) the United States, Canada, the European Union and Australia; (ii) Japan and Korea; and (iii) the BRICS economies (Brazil, China, India, Russia, and South Africa). It focuses, to the extent possible, on a common set of issues addressed in one way or another in the majority of these jurisdictions, comprising: (i) the treatment of licensing practices, including refusals to license; (ii) anti-competitive patent settlements; (iii) issues concerning standard-essential patents (SEPs); (iv) the conduct of patent assertion entities (PAEs); and (v) competition advocacy activities focused on the IP system. Additionally, while the primary focus of the paper is on competition agency guidelines, policy statements and advocacy activities relating to IP, reference is also made to enforcement and case developments where they are helpful in illustrating relevant approaches and trends. Overall, the analysis suggests, firstly, that, in contrast to the situation prevailing twenty or thirty years ago, interest in the systematic application of competition law vis-à-vis IP certainly is no longer a preoccupation of only a few traditional developed jurisdictions. Secondly, we find evidence of significant cross-jurisdictional learning processes and partial policy convergence across the jurisdictions surveyed. Thirdly, the analysis also reveals the continuing potential for coordination failures in regard to the approaches taken by national authorities in this area, for example where jurisdictions take different approaches to specific practices such as refusals to license and/or give differing weights to industrial policy as opposed to consumer welfare or other objectives in their policy applications.
L43|You are judged by the company you keep: Reputation leverage in vertically related markets|This paper analyzes a mechanism through which a supplier of unknown quality can overcome its asymmetric information problem by selling via a reputable downstream firm. The supplier’s adverse-selection problem can be solved if the downstream firm has established a reputation for delivering high quality with the supplier. The supplier may enter the market by initially renting the downstream firm’s reputation. The downstream firm may optimally source its input externally, even though sourcing internally would be better in terms of productive efficiency. Since an entrant in the downstream market may lack reputation, it may suffer from a reputational barrier to entry arising from higher input costs—this constitutes a novel theory of downstream barriers to entry.
L43|Aggregate multi-factor productivity: Measurement issues in OECD countries|This paper analyses for 34 OECD countries the extent to which the calculation of aggregate multi-factor productivity (MFP) is sensitive to alternative parameterisations. The starting point is the definition of MFP used in previous work in the OECD’s Economics Department (e.g. Johansson et al. 2013). They include alternative MFP measures, with human capital included or excluded, with different measures of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates, using time-varying capital depreciation rates and different measures of capital stock and labour input (headcount against hours worked). The main result of the paper is that whether or not human capital is included in MFP makes a significant difference for the level and dynamics of MFP. At the same time, MFP measures are less sensitive to other parameters of the calculation.
L43|Transition from copper to fiber broadband: The role of connection speed and switching costs|We estimated a mixed logit model using data on the broadband technologies chosen by 94,388 subscribers of a single European broadband operator on a monthly basis between January and December 2014. We found that consumers have similar valuation of DSL connection speeds in the range between 1 and 8 Mbps. Moreover, in January 2014, the valuation of FttH connections with a speed of 100 Mbps was not much higher than of DSL connections with a speed of 1 to 8 Mbps, but it has increased quickly over time and became significantly higher at the end of the period in December 2014. The small initial difference in the valuation of DSL and FttH connections may be because consumers’ basic Internet requirements such as browsing, emailing, reading news, shopping, and even watching videos online could be satisfied with a connection speed below 8 Mbps. We also found that consumers face significant switching costs when changing broadband tariff plans, which are substantially higher when switching from DSL to FttH technology. According to counterfactual simulations based on our model, switching costs between technologies are the main factor which slows down consumer transition from DSL to FttH.
L43|Mail Stream as a Platform: Patterns of Recipients? Reactions|Letter volumes in advanced economies decreased significantly in the past decade, and postal operators are reconsidering their pricing strategies in light of the mail?s value compared to its electronic substitutes. This paper examines the interdependencies be-tween various types of mail in terms of the recipients? reaction to their mail by means of an empirical analysis based on a Swiss data set of 2016. It shows that a balanced mail mix of advertisement and transactional mail significantly increases the probability of the recipient reacting positively to addressed advertisement (direct mail). For example, higher shares of non-advertisement as well as private mail in the recipients? mailbox in-crease positive response rates to advertisement, thereby increasing the advertisers? will-ingness to pay for postal services. Moreover, we find that females show a significantly lower odd of showing a positive reaction conditional on the mail mix than men do and that the odds of a firm using advertisement mail to attract customers being contacted are significantly higher for recipients with a positive mail mix. A similar finding holds for the odds of searching the internet for more information on advertised goods. Our find-ings suggest significant interdependencies between various types of mail which postal operators should take into account in their product development and pricing strategies.
L43|On the estimation of the price elasticity of electricity demand in the manufacturing industry of Colombia|Abstract: This paper presents an estimation of the reaction of electricity demand to changes in price levels of forward contracts in the manufacturing industry of Colombia. To that end, a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model was developed, considering several economic activities at different voltage levels. The industrial sectors under study showed an electricity demand not significantly sensitive to price variations. However, the food and drink sectors, plastic and rubber manufacturing, as well as retail trade turned out to be more sensitive to price shocks than the chemical industry or textile manufacturing. Such inelasticity could be softened if information concerning prices and quantity demanded were of common knowledge, or if the forward curve were observable. Resumen En este artículo se presenta una estimación de la reacción de la demanda a niveles de precios de contratos forward de electricidad en la industria manufacturera de Colombia. Se desarrolló un modelo de vectores autorregresivos estructurales (SVAR) considerando varias actividades económicas a diferentes niveles de tensión. Los sectores industriales bajo estudio no mostraron una demanda de electricidad significativamente sensible a variaciones de precios. Sin embargo, los sectores de alimentos y bebidas, caucho y plástico, así como el sector comercial minorista resultaron ser más sensibles a choques de precios que la industria química o el sector de manufactura de textiles. Dicha inelasticidad podría suavizarse si la información concerniente a precios y cantidades demandadas fuera de conocimiento común, o si la curva forward pudiera ser observable.

L43|El nuevo modelo de recolección de basuras en Bogotá: ¿Populismo saliente o monopolización entrante?|En febrero de 2018, Bogotá percibió un cambio rotundo en el sistema de recolección de residuos sólidos, pasando de un modelo regido por la compañía Aguas de Bogotá (AB) –de composición pública- a un esquema ejecutado únicamente por entidades privadas, en medio de los escándalos de corrupción, negligencia, parcialismo y sanciones millonarias alrededor del servicio de aseo. Se presenta pues un dilema entre el populismo saliente y la monopolización entrante. El presente documento despliega las diferencias entre los esquemas de recolección de basuras en Bogotá, teniendo como eje central las condiciones técnicas y sociales de las empresas y los inconvenientes que tuvieron que padecer los usuarios, estas personas fueron terriblemente afectadas en términos de la salud pública, ya que la acumulación de residuos orgánicos e inorgánicos, la presencia de diferentes plagas (roedores, insectos) y fuertes olores, todo gracias a la ineficiencia burocrática y administrativa que se reflejaron con mayor acuciosidad el 12 de febrero de 2018. Para ello, se analizó la información recopilada de varias fuentes periodísticas, además de emplear documentación oficial de las entidades relacionadas con el fin contrastar las realidades expuestas por los agentes inmersos en la problemática.
L43|Utilities Governance, Incentives, and Performance: Evidence from the Water Sector in India|Network utilities across the world are subject to regulation and political scrutiny. In developing countries, managing the trade-offs between socioeconomic and environmental objectives in public water and energy utilities is particularly challenging. These industries share important underlying technical and economic features. Therefore, many economic, governance, and policy lessons are transferable across these sectors. In India, the water sector suffers from mounting financial losses, lack of access, and poor quality of service. There is a dearth of literature on the multi-faceted nature of utility performance related to water utilities. We examine the socioeconomic and environmental aspects of urban water supply in India. We use a stochastic frontier analysis approach and distance functions to analyse the performance of 304 urban water supply utilities in three Indian states during the period 2010-2015. The results suggest that incentive-based economic reform and regulation would help the utilities improve their performance. More specifically measures to improve cost recovery, billing efficiency and reduce losses would help the utilities to enhance service delivery, expand coverage and induce efficiency in the sector. The results also show the dependence of water utilities on groundwater sources which is unsustainable in the long run. We highlight the need for designing economic incentives to improve the performance of utilities and enable them to achieve social and sustainability objectives.
L43|Regulation, Institutions and Aggregate Investment: New Evidence from OECD Countries|Abstract This paper investigate the relationship linking investment (capital stock) and structural policies. Using a panel of 32 OECD countries from 1985 to 2013, we show that more stringent product and labour market regulations are associated with less investment (lower capital stock). The paper also sheds light on the existence of non-linear effects of employment protection legislation (EPL) on the capital stock. Several alternative testing methods show that the negative influence of EPL is considerably stronger at higher levels. Finally, and importantly, the paper uncovers important policy interactions between product and labour market policies. Higher levels of product market regulations (covering state control, barriers to entrepreneurship and barriers to trade and investment) tend to amplify the negative relationships between EPL and the capital stock and ETCR and the capital stock. Equally important is the finding that the rule of law and the quality of (legal) institutions alters the overall impact of regulations on capital deepening: better institutions reduce the negative effect of more stringent product and labour market regulations on the capital stock, possibly through the reduction of uncertainty as regards the protection of property rights. This result also implies that the benefit from product and labour market reforms may be smaller in countries with weaker institutions.
L43|The HSR competition in Italy: How are the regulatory design and practices concerned?|Italy is nowadays the only European country to have organized a head-on competition on its whole high speed railway (HSR) network. This paper discusses the issues of this new market structure for the Italian Rail Regulator, both in terms of regulatory design and economic regulation practices. Such HSR competition and regulation took place in a very specific and ambivalent context (including declining Italian railway demand, negative European macroeconomic environment), together with a new ambitious and innovating private competitor (NTV) and strong reactions from the incumbent (Trenitalia). The Italian Rail Regulator's interventions look like more or less a set of everyday life decisions and empirical trade-off than a duly achieved economic doctrine and policy. The level of access charges seems to be a strategic variable to enlarge the scope for profitable entry in Italy. However, this new context still does not answer the question whether HSR operators reach their economic equilibrium in open access competition.
L43|Transmission Network Investment across National Borders: The Liberalized Nordic Electricity Market|The world’s first multinational electricity market was formed with the creation of the Nordic power exchange, Nord Pool. We analyze the incentives to undertake transmission network investment in the context of the liberalized Nordic electricity market. Welfare improving investment in a multinational electricity market requires accounting for the cross-border effects of capacity expansion. We propose methods to increase voluntary cooperation on international infrastructure projects, with an aim to increase aggregate efficiency and achieve equitable distribution of the gains from market integration.​
L43|Ratings Design and Barriers to Entry|" I study the impact of consumer reviews on the incentives for firms to participate in the market. Firms produce goods of heterogeneous, unknown quality that is gradually revealed via consumer reviews, and face both entry and exit decisions. A platform combines past reviews to construct firm-specific ratings that help guide consumer search. When the platform integrates all reviews into ratings - full transparency - consumers form queues at the highest-rated firms. This demand cliff induces an S-shaped continuation value for firms as a function of ratings, generating both low entry rates as well as unwanted selection effects - high-quality firms exit early. Whereas firms prefer more feedback when starting out and less feedback when established, equilibrium induces precisely the reverse profile. I then study the design of ratings systems. The platform must balance the need to provide consumers with accurate information against the need to encourage high-quality firms to enter and remain active. The key insight is that optimal rating systems involve upper censorship, i.e. the suppression of reviews from highly-rated firms' ratings, as a means of incentive provision. This makes the task of ""climbing the ratings hill"" less daunting, stimulating participation. An exploratory calibration using data provided by Yelp! estimates a consumer welfare gain of roughly 7% from adopting the optimal policy."
L43|Referral, Learning and Inventory Decision Making in a Social Network| We examine the impact of social learning in a referral program where customers' preferences are correlated in a social network. We characterize customers purchasing strategies based on their information and their types, and derive the demand distributions when customers are involved in social learning in a referral program. We find that the bias and variance trade-off in the demand distribution. The existence of uninformed customers will bring more bias to the demand. Social learning can moderate this effect at the expense of increasing demand variance. We investigate the firm's inventory decision in a referral program. We find that the stock-out of one product will influence the demand of the other product when customers are involved in social learning. Multiple referral reduces the effect of stock-out but dramatically increase the demand variance. We design the optimal referral so that it generates sufficient market exposure without incurring too much on the inventory cost.

L43|Service regulations, input prices and export volumes: evidence from a panel of manufacturing firms|Using a panel of firm-level data from Spanish manufacturers, this study shows that better service regulation reduces the price of intermediate inputs paid by downstream firms. The beneficial cost effects of services reforms extend to both large and small-to-medium sized corporations (SMEs), but the former tend to enjoy greater gains. This feature also manifests itself in international markets. We identify an input cost channel through which service regulations affect the volume of exports of large manufacturers, while the evidence of such channel is weaker for SMEs. Our estimates indicate that, from 1991 till 2007, large firms increased their volume of exports by an average of 22% as a result of the direct input cost effect of services reforms, such that the firms that benefited the most typically belonged to industries more dependent on service inputs. Furthermore, convergence to the “best practice” regulatory framework in services would have raised exports at least by an additional 10%. We conclude that firm size is relevant for the connection between services reforms, intermediate input prices and export volumes
L43|Regulatorische Herausforderungen für Multi-Use-Speicher in Stromverteilnetzen – ein Ausschreibungsmodell|Stromspeicher erscheinen derzeit vor allem in Form von Multi-Use-Speichern wirtschaftlich darstellbar, die nach Bedarf für Netzzwecke eingesetzt werden und um am Strommarkt Handelserlöse zur erzielen. Die technischen Anforderungen aus Netzsicht erfordern in der Regel, dass die Initiative für einen solchen Speicher vom Netzbetreiber ausgeht. Darf ein rechtlich entflochtener Verteilnetzbetreiber (VNB) jedoch selbst einen solchen Speicher errichten und betreiben, wenn sich kein günstigerer Marktinvestor findet? Die regulatorischen Herausforderungen liegen vor allem in den Entflechtungsregeln, die eine direkte Handelsaktivität untersagen. Das in diesem Beitrag skizzierte Drei-Stufen-Modell zeigt, wie eine entflechtungskonforme Bereitstellung und der Betrieb auch eines VNB-eigenen Speichers mittels Ausschreibungen erreicht werden können. Fragen der Diskriminierungspotenziale und Effizienzanreize werden durch die Form der regulatorischen Kostenbehandlung adressiert: Um effiziente Anreize in beiden Ausschreibungen sicherzustellen, sollte der Gebotspreis des VNB maßgebend für die Kostenanerkennung sein.
L43|Regulation, Institutions, and Productivity: New Macroeconomic Evidence from OECD Countries|This paper seeks to understand the drivers of country-level multi-factor productivity (MFP) with a special emphasis on product and labour market policies and the quality of institutions. For a panel of OECD countries, we find that anticompetitive product market regulations reduce MFP levels and that higher innovation intensity and greater openness result in higher MFP. We also find that the impact of product market regulations on MFP may depend on the level of labour market regulations. Better institutions, a more business friendly environment and lower barriers to trade and investment amplify the positive impact of R&D spending on MFP. Finally, we also show that cross-country MFP variations can be explained to a considerable extent by cross-country variation in labour market regulations, barriers to trade and investment and institutions.
L43|Mail Composition and Recipients? Reaction to Direct Mail|This paper examines the relevance of interdependencies between various types of mail in analogy to other platform markets. It then empirically analyzes the interdependencies of various mail types based on a Swiss data set of 2016. It shows that a balanced mailmix increases the probability of the recipient reacting positively to addressed advertisement significantly. For example, a higher share of non-advertisement mail in the recipients? mailbox increases response rates to direct advertisement, thereby increasing the advertisers? willingness to pay for postal services. If so, postal services with a high share of advertisement mail might, in particular if they are not restricted by direct competition from competing deliverers, aim to reflect externalities between different mail types in their pricing. More explicitly, such postal services might want to increase the price of advertising mail and decrease the price of mail pieces that recipients like to receive in their mailbox.
L43|What future for the Post Office network?|Incumbent postal operators are particularly challenged by rapid technological developments and especially by digitalization which substitutes their letter mail, yet generally boosts parcel volumes. As a consequence, they have to rethink their strategy, especially for their post office network. The paper presents potential strategies and discusses the main trends in postal network evolution among incumbent postal operators, focusing in particular on the examples of Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Italy and the United States, and assesses these strategies against a set of key performance and development indicators.
L43|Do Private Water Utilities Operators Care about Regulatory Agencies in Developing Countries ?|This paper shows that the creation of an independent regulatory agency (IRA) is often not a necessary or sufficient condition to help countries attract private participation in the operation and financing of the water and sanitation sector of developing countries. The odds of an impact are, however, significantly higher for Latin American and Caribbean countries and to a lesser extent Eastern European countries, than for any other region. Higher income levels and higher prices are also correlated with a higher effectiveness of IRAs in attracting private sector financing. The analysis of the impact on the various types of PPP contracts shows that, at the margin, IRAs are irrelevant in general, to the contract choice, except for greenfield projects for which IRAs may be counterproductive at the margin.
L43|Specification of merger gains in the Norwegian electricity distribution industry|Electricity distribution often exhibits economies of scale. In Norway, a number of smaller distribution system operators exist and thus there is potential to restructure the industry, possibly through mergers. However, the revenue cap regulatory model in Norway does not incentivize firms to merge as merging leads to a stricter revenue cap for the merged company. Thus the regulator compensates the firms in order to create such incentives. The amount of compensation is based on the potential gains of the merger estimated using a data envelopment analysis (DEA) based frontier approach introduced by Bogetoft and Wang (2005). DEA is however only one of many possible frontier estimators that can be used in estimation. Furthermore, the returns to scale assumption, the operating environment of firms and the presence of stochastic noise and outlier observations are all known to affect to the estimation of production technology. In this paper we explore how varying assumptions under two alternative frontier estimators shape the distribution of merger gains within the Norwegian distribution industry. Our results reveal that the restructuring policies of the industry may be significantly altered depending how potential gains from the mergers are estimated.
L43|Should I go by bus? The liberalization of the long-distance bus industry in France|The opening up of the French long-distance bus industry is one of the outcomes of the Loi Macron. In this study, we build a unique data set of several representative bus routes and show that the effects of the liberalization have been encouraging in terms of fares, new entry, higher frequency, and higher quality. First, with regard to international routes that used to be under cabotage, we find that relaxing quantitative restrictions has led to the expected results on the Lyon–Torino and Paris–London routes. Second, with regard to domestic routes newly created from the Loi Macron, mostly all procompetitive expected variations in the variables have been observed, except for fares. Indeed, we show that bus operators used an initial aggressive pricing strategy to induce demand for the new services and then increased fares once customers became accustomed with the service.
L43|Regulating national firms in a common market under asymmetric information|In a supranational common market, national regulation can produce inefficiencies. National regulators typically care only for domestic welfare and they tend to push national firms in the common market. When information about production costs is held privately by firms and is unknown to the regulator, competition between national and foreign firms can help to reduce the information rents captured by national producers and thus increase efficiency. This is more likely when the production costs of national and foreign firms are highly correlated, for instance because firms use similar technologies. In other cases, market share rivalry pushes national regulators to inefficiently expand the production of national firms, also increasing the information rents. When the ex-ante uncertainty of the production costs is high, the creation of a common market is more likely to increase expected welfare, as compared to separated national markets.
L43|Deregulation and Regional Specialization: Evidence from Canadian Agriculture|For about seventy years, the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) was one of the world’s largest export “single desk” state traders in agriculture, until it was deregulated in 2012 and stripped of its marketing powers. One of the main crops controlled by the CWB was barley. We estimate the impact of the removal of the CWB’s single desk on the spatial pattern of malting barley production in Western Canada. We find that deregulation encouraged growers located closer to malt barley plants to increase production relative to growers located further from the plants. Additionally, malting barley production shifted to regions with more of a natural advantage arising from climatic conditions. This change in cropping patterns after deregulation can be explained by efficiency gains, combined with transportation and handling cost savings.

L43|Identifying the Effect of Mobile Operating Systems on the Mobile Services Market|Modern economic theory predicts that tying can serve as a tool for leveraging market power. In line with this economic theory, competition authorities regulate the tying of Microsoft Windows with its Media Player or Internet browser in the EU and Japan. The authorities also take note of the market power of mobile handset operating systems (OSs) over competition in the app and services markets. However, no empirical evidence has thus far been presented on the success of government intervention in the Microsoft case. To assess the effectiveness of government intervention on mobile handset OSs, we identify the extent to which complementarity and consumer preferences affect the correlation between mobile handset OSs and mobile service app markets (mail, search, and map). We find significant positive complementarity between the mail, search, and map services, and mobile handset OSs. However, the elasticities of the mobile handset OS–mobile service correlations are rather small. We conclude that taking action to restrict mobile handset OSs is less effective than acting on mobile services market directly.
L43|Short-run effects of product markets’ deregulation: a more productive, more efficient and more resilient economy?|This paper assesses the short-term impact of product market deregulation in upstream sectors on the productivity growth of firms in downstream sectors (i.e. those firms using the output of the reformed sectors as inputs in their production process). Relying on a firm level database for the period 2004-2014 covering all Portuguese firms, we show that the most productive firms - those at the sectoral technological frontier - grasp short-run benefits from these reforms, which are then spread to the other existing firms via spillover mechanisms. In addition, reforms potentiate the exit of the least productive firms, improving the resource allocation in the economy. Finally, we show that the adoption of product market reforms in upstream sectors leads to a more resilient economy, better equipped to face adverse shocks.
L43|Social Media and the News Industry| The growing influence of internet platforms acting as content aggregators is one of the most important challenges facing the media industry. We develop a parsimonious model to understand the impact of content bundling by a social platform. In our model consumers can access news either directly through a newspaper's website, or indirectly through a platform, which also offers social content. Even though the platform shares revenues with newspapers whose content it publishes, content bundling harms newspapers. Its effect on news quality and news consumption depends on the media market structure and on whether the platform can personalize the content bundle.
L43|The effect of switching costs on prices: an application to the Peruvian mobile phone market|" Based on a game theoretical model I previously developed, I present some evidence of the effect of the unlocked-handset policy recently implemented in Peru based on market analysis and reduced form empirical methods using consumer panel data. From the market analysis, declining prices are observed with the implementation of the policy in January 2015, also the switching rate rocketed since then. To retain consumers and attract rival's consumers, companies responded also with very low on-net prices through their ""private network"" with unlimited minutes, which may have increased the network effects in the market. From my estimation, I found a significant negative effect of switching costs on demand for voice traffic (which suggest a positive effect of the unlocked-handset policy on demand) and positive network effects on the demand."
L43|Product markets’ deregulation: a more productive, more efficient and more resilient economy?|This paper assesses the impact of product market deregulation in upstream sectors on the productivity growth of firms in downstream sectors (i.e. those firms using the output of the reformed sectors as inputs in their production process). Relying on a firm level database for the period 2004-2014 covering all Portuguese firms, we show that reforms bring productivity gains already in the short-run and that are sustained in the long-run. The effects are more positive for those further away from the technological frontier and are also heterogeneous across sectors. In addition, reforms potentiate the exit of the least productive firms, improving the resource allocation in the economy by a process of selection – for the least productive, only those that have scope to catch-up with the frontier are able to remain. Finally, we show that the adoption of product market reforms in upstream sectors leads to a more resilient economy, better equipped to face adverse shocks.
L43|Endogenous Mergers in Markets with Vertically Differentiated Products|This paper studies the incentives of firms selling vertically differentiated products to merge. To this aim, we introduce a three-stage game in which, at the first stage, three independent firms can decide to merge with their competitors via a sequential game of coalition formation and, at the second and third stage, they can optimally revise their qualities and prices, respectively. We study whether such binding agreements (i.e. full or partial mergers) can be sustained as subgame perfect equilibria of the coalition formation game, and analyze their effects on equilibrium qualities, prices and profits. We find that, although profitable, the merger-to-monopoly of all firms is not an outcome of the finite-horizon negotiation, where only partial mergers arise. Moreover, we show that all stable mergers always include the firm initially producing the bottom quality good and reduce the number of variants on sale.
L43|Estimación de la Elasticidad-Precio de Corto Plazo de la Demanda de Electricidad en República Dominicana<BR>[An Estimation of the Short-Run Price Elasticity of Electricity Demand in the Dominican Republic]|This paper presents a theoretical model for the optimization of the decision-making process of power purchase of the electric utility companies of the Dominican Republic, taking into account the demand of end-users of the service, the short-term marginal cost of energy in the wholesale power market, and the budgetary constraints of the utility companies. This model was applied to estimate the short-term price elasticity of electricity demand for the three largest electric utility companies of the Dominican Republic, during the period 2007-2016; this evaluation was made using time series analysis techniques. The elasticities estimated were in the range of -0.012 to -0.018. It is also explored if these values undergo intraday variations. The paper closes outlining some welfare implications of the results obtained as well as policy recommendations.
L43|The Impact of Telecommunication Regulatory Policy on Mobile Retail Price in Sub-Saharan African Countries|This paper examines the eect of regulatory policies on mobile retail prices. Using quarterly data for 8 African countries for the period 2010:Q4 to 2014:Q4 we estimate structural demand and supply equations. We nd that mobile termination rates (MTR) have significant positive impact on mobile retail prices. A decline in average MTR of 10% decreases average mobile retail prices by 2.5%. On the other hand, mobile number portability (MNP) has an insignicant eect on price and subscriptions in selected African countries. This may be due to inadequate implementation of MNP and consecutively low demand for porting numbers. The average market conduct in mobile telecommunications industry for selected African countries can be approximated by Cournot Nash equilibrium, while price elasticity of demand is on average -0.27.
L43|Patent thickets, defensive patenting, and induced R&D: an empirical analysis of the costs and potential benefits of fragmentation in patent ownership|Abstract Patent thickets are sets of overlapping intellectual property rights that occur in fragmented technology markets. Their potential impacts on innovation have become an increasing concern in recent years. I estimate the direct and indirect effects of patent thickets on market value of publicly traded manufacturing firms. I find that patent thickets decrease the market value of firms, holding R&D and patenting activities of these firms constant. I also find that while firms do not change their R&D activities in response to patent thickets, they do reduce negative cost effects of patent thickets on market value through defensive patenting.
L43|Competing with Big Data|This paper studies competition in data-driven markets, that is, markets where the cost of quality production is decreasing in the amount of machine-generated data about user preferences or characteristics, which is an inseparable byproduct of using services offered in such markets. This gives rise to data-driven indirect network effects. We construct a dynamic model of R&D competition, where duopolists repeatedly determine their innovation investments, and show that such markets tip under very mild conditions, moving towards monopoly. In a tipped market, innovation incentives both for the dominant firm and for competitors are small. We also show under which conditions a dominant firm in one market can leverage its position to a connected market, thereby initiating a domino effect. We show that market tipping can be avoided if competitors share their user information.

L43|Allocating essential inputs|Regulators must often allocate essential inputs, such as spectrum rights, transmission capacity or airport landing slots, which can transform the structure of the downstream market. These decisions involve a trade-off, as provisions aimed at fostering competition and lowering prices for consumers, also tend to limit the proceeds from the sale of the inputs. We first characterize the optimal allocation, from the standpoints of consumer and total welfare. We then note that standard auctions yield substantially different outcomes. Finally, we show how various regulatory instruments can be used to implement the desired allocation.
L43|Endogenous Recombinant Growth And Intellectual Property Rights|We show that, even in a framework in which monopolistic exploitation of patents does not occur, patents still give rise to serious drawbacks. We build on Weitzman’s (1998) recombinant growth model which provides a stylized but clear description of the formation of knowledge externalities. In our framework a benevolent government buys immediately new patents in a competitive market and releases their contents for free. We show that inefficiencies nevertheless arise and welfare can be improved by correcting the market price through a tax-subsidy scheme. We characterize the (asymptotic) steady state equilibrium, and some properties of the transitional path. We show that if certain conditions are met, then the economy will converge to its (asymptotic) balanced growth path, and along such a path growth will be independent of the policy parameter; conversely, transition dynamics are affected by the choice of the policy parameter. We then quantitatively analyze the effect of different policy interventions on welfare, and show that stricter tax (weaker appropriability) regimes lead to higher social welfare.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L43|Assessing Kuwaiti Energy Pricing Reforms|From mid-2014 Kuwait has experienced a substantial drop in its petroleum export price and,consequently, government revenue, causing a severe fiscal deficit and impaired economic performance. Cutting energy subsidies has become a policy priority. In the face of widespread opposition, the government raised gasoline prices in August 2016, proclaiming such reform the key to solving economic problems; yet recent policy discussions have not addressed the mechanism of pricing reforms. The paper offers a quantification and assessment of energy pricing reform in the current low petroleum price environment via a general equilibrium model of the Kuwaiti economy that embodies the structure of its economy and its labor market, its oligopolistic industries, and external flows associated with its sovereign wealth fund. Simulations clarify the required adjustments, including the seldom discussed expatriate labor exit and the decline in oligopoly rents. While necessary, subsidy reform implies trade-offs, notably between fiscal stabilization and cost of living sustainability. The results confirm that successful implementation must be accompanied by carefully designed mitigation measures and associated microeconomic reforms.
L43|A Tale of Two Cities: An Examination of Medallion Prices in New York and Chicago|This paper examines the institution of taxicab medallions in two of the largest cities of the U.S.: New York and Chicago and changes in the prices of those medallions during the period 2009-2016 (for New York City) and 2007-2016 (for Chicago). We document a drop of roughly 50% in the prices of these medallions in New York and roughly 80% in Chicago from their peak in 2013/2014 to the present. We also find that medallion prices are positively correlated with taxicab revenues and negatively correlated with proxies for the intensity of adoption of Uber and Lyft in both cities.
L43|OTT-messaging and mobile telecommunication: A joint market? - An empirical approach|OTT-messenger such as facebook, WhatsApp have gained wide popularity among mobile users while traffic of text messaging has been in strong decline in several countries. This work is the first to provide an empirical analysis how consumption of OTT-messengers affects demand for text messaging and mobile telephony services. Our findings suggest that social and messaging apps may complement demand for text messaging and mobile voice services. More generally we identify the different nature of mobile telecommunication services as key element to explain why reductions of text messaging traffic have been so drastic in some countries and why an analogue development for mobile voice is rather unlikely.

L43|The application of competition policy vis-à-vis intellectual property rights: The evolution of thought underlying policy change|This paper examines the evolution of national competition (antitrust) policies and enforcement approaches vis-à-vis intellectual property rights (IPRs) and associated anti-competitive practices in major jurisdictions over the past several decades. It focuses especially on the underlying process of economic learning that has, the authors suggest, driven relevant policy changes. Part 2 of the paper outlines the breakthroughs in understanding that have underpinned the evolution of competition policy approaches toward intellectual property licensing arrangements in the US, Canada and the EU. Part 3 elaborates the foundational insights that have motivated competition policy interventions with respect to 'newer' issues such as anti-competitive patent settlements and hold-ups in relation to standard setting processes, in addition to the modern focus on mergers that potentially lessen incentives for innovation and on abuse of dominance/single firm exclusionary practices in IP-intensive network industries. Part 4 outlines some of the core policy concerns and insights driving the increased emphasis that leading competition authorities now devote to policy advocacy and research in relation to the scope and definition of IP rights. Overall, the analysis suggests, firstly, that competition policy applications in the intellectual property sphere are matters of fundamental importance for economic advancement and prosperity, having a direct bearing on innovation, growth and the diffusion of new technologies. Indeed, the roles of IP and competition policy are now sufficiently intertwined and interdependent that neither can be well understood or applied in an optimal fashion in the absence of the other. Secondly, the thought evolution described herein implies that successful policy applications require careful study of market structure and behaviour, not in the abstract but with reference to the particular markets affected. Thirdly, it augurs favourably for the prospects of continuing gradual and incremental convergence in national approaches in this area, even spanning developed and developing countries, on the basis of continual learning and informed self-interest.
L43|Patterns of entry and exit in the deregulated German interurban bus industry|We study patterns of entry and exit in the German interurban bus industry in the first three years after its deregulation in January 2013. Using a comprehensive data set of all firm and route entries and exits, we find that the industry grew much quicker than originally expected – with particularly a few new entrants being most successful in quickly extending their route networks from regional to national coverage. Although the clear majority of routes is operated on a monopoly basis, competition does play a key role on routes with a sufficiently large base of (potential) customers. From a spatial perspective, three years after deregulation, the entire interurban bus network connects 60 percent of all 644 larger German cities – with the intensity of entry being dependent on the number of inhabitants, average income, the share of under 24 years old and the presence of intermodal competition by intercity railway services.
L43|Reforming and Restructuring Ukrzaliznytsia: A Crucial Task for Ukrainian Reformers|If the Ukrainian economy is to be successfully restructured going forward, a restructured railway system will have to be part of the picture. Ukraine’s economy depends on the production and sale of a number of bulk commodities, including coal, iron ore, steel, and agricultural products, that require shipment by rail in order to reach both domestic and export markets economically. In this paper we first discuss in more detail the crucial role that UZ plays in the Ukrainian economy. We follow with a survey of the world experience with railways restructuring: a large number of countries have already undertaken the task of converting aging government-owned monopoly railways into more dynamic and competitive transport enterprises, and their experience in very diverse settings may have important lessons to offer. We then examine the current state of rail reform plans in Ukraine. We conclude with discussions of an alternative path forward that seems most likely to be successful in Ukraine, based on both the experience elsewhere and the country’s current situation.

The strange case of Italian railways, and how adjustments to the government’s reforms could achieve gains for rail users and taxpayers]|The Italian government is proceeding with the privatisation of the Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane group, and is considering a merger with the government-owned highways company. In this article, we argue that changes could be made to the privatisation and reform process, learning from the British experience, which would bring substantial benefits to Italian rail users and taxpayers.
L43|Approaches to Czech Passenger Railway Market Liberalisation|Competition on the Czech railway passenger market has been developing recently. It is possible to distinguish two types of competition - unregulated competition (competition on the market) and regulated competition (competition for the market). Competition on the market is present on the Prague-Ostrava route and competition for the market has been applied in a few public tenders for subsidised services. However, the substantial part of the Czech railway passenger market has remained closed and there is a question how to proceed with the competition development - whether to promote competition on the market or competition for the market. Based on European and modelling experience, there is an argument for more competition for the market.
L43|Wage Effects of Unionization and Occupational Licensing Coverage in the United States|Recent estimates in standard models of wage determination for both unionization and occupational licensing have shown wage effects that are similar across the two institutions. These cross-sectional estimates use specialized data sets, with small sample sizes, for the period 2006 to 2008. The authorsâ€™ analysis examines the impact of unions and licensing coverage on wage determination using new data collected on licensing statutes that are then linked to longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) from 1979 to 2010. They develop several approaches, using both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, to measure the impact of these two labor market institutions on wage determination. The estimates of the economic returns to union coverage are greater than those for licensing statutes.
L43|Risky utilities|Abstract We develop a theory of “risky utilities,” i.e., private firms that manage an infrastructure for public service and that may be tempted to engage in excessively risky activities, such as reducing maintenance expenditures (at the risk of provoking a breakdown of the system) or in speculation (at the risk of incurring massive losses it cannot bear). These risky utilities include financial utilities like exchanges, clearinghouses or payment systems, as well as standard utilities like electricity transmission networks. Continuation of service is essential, so risky utilities cannot be liquidated. The optimal regulatory contract minimizes the social cost among the contracts that steer the firm away from risky activities. It is simple and implemented with a capital (equity) adequacy requirement and a resolution mechanism when that requirement is breached. The social cost function is explicitly computed, and comparative statics can be simply derived.
L43|Welfare effects of unbundling under different regulatory regimes in natural gas markets|Abstract In this paper, we develop a theoretical model that enriches the literature on the pros and cons of ownership unbundling vis-à-vis lighter unbundling frameworks in the natural gas markets. For each regulatory framework, we compute equilibrium outcomes when an incumbent firm and a new entrant compete à la Cournot in the final gas market. We find that the entrant’s contracting conditions in the upstream market and the transmission tariff are key determinants of the market structure in the downstream gas market (both with ownership and with legal unbundling). We also study how the regulator must optimally set transmission tariffs in each of the two unbundling regimes. We conclude that welfare maximizing tariffs often require free access to the transmission network (in both regulatoy regimes). However, when the regulator aims at promoting the break-even of the regulated transmission system operator, the first-best tariff is unfeasible in both regimes. Hence, we study a more realistic set-up, in which the regulator’s action is constrained by the break-even of the regulated firm (the transmission system operator). In this set-up, we find that, for a given transmission tariff, final prices in the downstream market are always higher with ownership unbundling than with legal unbundling.

Le prospettive dopo il Ddl Concorrenza 2015|Il disegno di legge annuale per la concorrenza 2015 prevede il superamento della maggior tutela e la piena liberalizzazione dei prezzi retail dellenergia elettrica a partire dal 1 gennaio 2018. Questo passaggio e' importante sia come elemento di coerenza col piu' generale disegno di mercato sia perch la piena apertura dei mercati retail in tutti gli Stati membri funzionale allintegrazione dei mercati europei. La liberalizzazione dei mercati finali dellenergia rappresenta uno stimolo allinnovazione, sia dal lato della domanda sia dal lato dellofferta. Questo paper presenta le ragioni teoriche e le evidenze empiriche a supporto del nesso tra la concorrenza e linnovazione nei mercati retail dellenergia elettrica. Italys 2015 Annual Competition Law provides for phasing out electricity retail prices regulation, as well as the implementation of full retail liberalization, starting on January 1st, 2018. This is a significant reform not just for the sake of consistency with the broader market design for electricity. Indeed, retail liberalization is instrumental for the full integration of EU electricity market. In fact, the full opening of retail markets provides a great opportunity for innovation, both on the demand side and on the supply side. This paper investigates the theoretical reasons, and presents some empirical evidence, on the competition-innovation nexus in retail electricity markets.
L43|Repeated interaction in standard setting|Standardization may allow the owners of standard‐essential patents to charge higher royalties than would have been negotiated ex ante. In practice, however, standard‐setting efforts are often characterized by repeated interaction and complementarities among technologies. These features give firms that contribute technology to standards both the ability and the incentive to avoid excessive royalties by threatening to exclude other technology contributors from future rounds of standardization if they charge royalties exceeding ‘fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory’ (FRAND) levels. We show that such an outcome can be sustained as a subgame‐perfect equilibrium of a repeated standard‐setting game and examine how the decision‐making rules of standard‐setting organizations (SSOs) affect the sustainability of FRAND royalties. Our analysis provides a novel justification for super‐majority requirements and other rules frequently adopted by SSOs.
L43|Competition in Retail Electricity Markets : An Assessment of Ten Years Dutch Experience|This paper examines a decade of retail competition in the Dutch electricity market and discusses market structure, regulation, and market performance. We find a proliferation of product variety, in particular by the introduction of quality-differentiated green-energy products. Product innovation could be a sign of a well-functioning market that caters to customer’s preferences, but it can also indicate a strategic product differentiation to soften price competition. Although slightly downward trending, gross retail margins remain relatively high, especially for green products. Price dispersion across retailers for identical products remains high, as also across products for a single retailer. We do not find evidence of asymmetric pass-through of wholesale costs. Overall, the retail market matured as evidenced by fewer consumer complaints and higher switching rates. A fairly intensive regulation of mature energy retail markets appears to be needed to create benefits for consumers.

L43|The long-term effects of alcohol availability on mortality: Evidence from an alcohol reform|"I examine the long-term mortality effects of an exogenous shock in alcohol availability using Census data, mortality data and data on distance to alcohol outlets. In 1969, Finland underwent significant changes in alcohol availability both via Minimum Legal Drinking Age (MLDA) and distribution channels. The geographical alcohol availability increased especially for the previously ""dry"" rural Finland. The main results suggest that reducing MLDA from 21 to 18 had a positive effect on alcohol-related deaths in the long term for the 18-19 year-olds that were immediately affected by MLDA. I do not find evidence that the reduction of physical alcohol availability in rural areas resulted into diminishing difference of alcohol-related death rates between urban and rural areas."
L43|Margin Squeeze: An Above-Cost Predatory Pricing Approach|We provide a new legal perspective for the antitrust analysis of margin squeeze conducts. Building on recent economic analysis, we explain why margin squeeze conducts should solely be evaluated under adjusted predatory pricing standards. The adjustment corresponds to an increase in the cost benchmark used in the predatory pricing test by including opportunity costs due to missed upstream sales. This can reduce both the risks of false positives and false negatives in margin squeeze cases. We justify this approach by explaining why classic arguments against above-cost predatory pricing typically do not hold in vertical structures where margin squeezes take place and by presenting case law evidence supporting this adjustment. Our approach can help to reconcile the divergent U.S. and EU antitrust stances on margin squeeze.
L43|Substitution between fixed, mobile, and voice over IP telephony: Evidence from the European Union|Developments in the EU telecommunications markets require a recurrent redesign of the regulatory framework for telecommunications services. In this regard, the analysis of the substitution effects between different types of telephony is the cornerstone of market definition and therefore of effective regulation. This paper explores the access substitution between fixed-lines, mobiles, and managed VoIP in a unified EU cross-country framework. We employ a half-yearly dataset for 20 EU countries for the 2008-2011 period and apply dynamic panel data methods. Our analysis demonstrates strong access substitution between fixed-lines and mobiles and provides indicative evidence on the substitution between fixed-lines and VoIP. Overall, we find evidence in favor of access substitution and therefore of joint market definition. Regulatory obligations imposed on the market for access to fixed telephone networks might therefore be redundant.
L43|Mobile-only consumers arise from heterogeneous valuation of fixed services|Mobile-only users are usually considered as a consequence of fixed-mobile substitution. Via a unique dataset based on a a large European country survey and consumers' invoice data, this study reveals heterogeneous preferences for fixed services among consumers. The data is fitted in a mixed logit model and willingness to pay (WTP) for fixed communications services are estimated. Results show that mobile-only consumers have a WTP for fixed services of 15 € per month, while the WTP of users of both fixed and mobile services is thrice higher. Considering that a typical monthly fee for fixed services is around 30 € the heterogeneous preferences for fixed services constitute an alternative explanation for the existence of mobile-only users, despite the complementarity of fixed and mobile broadband.
L43|How to fill the digital gap? The (limited) role of regulation|This paper provides evidence on the migration from an 'old' technology to a 'new' technology, taking into account the impact that regulatory interventions on the old one might have on the incentives to invest and adopt the new one. This analysis has been applied to a sample of EU27 countries using panel data from 2004 to 2014 on the adoption, coverage and take-up rate of ultra-fast broadband infrastructures, whose development is one of the flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 programmes. Results show that a 1% increase in the regulated price to access the old technology increases the adoption and the investment on the new broadband technology by ~0.45% and ~0.47%. These effects are not homogeneous across countries and are weakened in Eastern European countries, where the existing old broadband infrastructures are less developed than in the rest of Europe. It has also been shown that the access price to old networks negatively affects the take-up rate of the new technology-based services, thus calling for the need of more specific and complementary demand side policy incentives to enhance service adoption.
L43|Antitrust, Patents, and Cumulative Innovation: Evidence from Bell Labs|How large is the impact of intellectual property on cumulative innovation in electronics, computers and communications? Following an antitrust lawsuit against Western Electric and AT&T, Bell Labs had to license all patents published by 1956 for free. We find that this removal of patent rights increased subsequent citations to Bell’s patents by 7%. Patenting in affected patent subclasses increased by 17%. The effect comes from young and small firms in fields in which Bell did not remain commercially active. Placebo regressions support the identification assumption of parallel trends in citations.

The (Limited) Role of Regulation|This paper provides evidence on the migration from an “old” technology to a “new” technology, taking into account the impact that regulatory interventions on the old one might have on the incentives to invest and adopt the new one. This analysis has been applied to a sample of EU27 countries using panel data from 2004 to 2014 on the adoption, coverage and take-up rate of ultra-fast broadband infrastructures, whose development is one of the flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 programmes. Results show that a 1% increase in the regulated price to access the old technology increases the adoption and the investment on the new broadband technology by ~0.45% and ~0.47%. These effects are not homogeneous across countries and are weakened in Eastern European countries, where the existing old broadband infrastructures are less developed than in the rest of Europe. It has also been shown that the access price to old networks negatively affects the take-up rate of the new technology-based services, thus calling for the need of more specific and complementary demand side policy incentives to enhance service adoption.
L43|Coasean Quality of Regulated Goods|The quality of goods provided by public utilities depends on infrastructure features and operational inputs. I compare the economic efficiency that results from price ceilings and minimum quality standards (i. e., compliance with environmental, chemical, and performance standards and norms) imposed by a benevolent regulator to a Coasean bargaining solution between a median consumer and a monopolist. When quality is non-excludable and non-rival, rate-of-return regulation yields higher economic efficiency than price cap regulation.
L43|Why Corporate Taxation Means Source Taxation - A Response to the OECD?s Actions against Base Erosion and Profit Shifting|It is widespread practice around the world that corporate entities pay taxes to the country where they are formally registered and to the country in whose territory they have a permanent establishment. While the former is generally known as the ?country-of-residence? the latter is usually referred to as the ?country-of-source?. This article questions separate taxation based on this distinction between the country-of-residence and the country-of-source. It argues for a departure from the traditional international allocation of the right to tax corporate income and suggests that a corporate entity should instead pay income tax exclusively to the countries in which it has relevant business activities. Moreover, in examining the question of where business activities of multinational corporations effectively take place, this article describes criteria for determining source countries. Furthermore, it offers a method for formulary apportionment of corporate income between those countries in which a given multinational corporation generates income. The article argues that source taxation of corporate income would be coherent with the economic nature of corporate income taxation. Source taxation of corporate income would also make the arbitrary concept of corporate residence irrelevant, and it would allow the outdated legal concept of permanent establishment to be abolished. This article takes an interdisciplinary approach to argue from both legal and economic perspectives. It adds to the body of literature that discusses how countries should tax corporate entities doing business across national borders. It also contributes to the ongoing debate about the OECD?s recent controversial efforts to prevent corporations shifting profits between countries to minimize their exposure to national tax systems (base erosion and profit sharing, or BEPS).
L43|The Mailstream as a Platform|This paper interprets the postal mailstream as a platform with two market sides in a theoretical model: On the one side of the market, advertisers (senders of direct mail) and senders of transactional mail are customers for mail services. On the other side of the market, there are the recipients. The value of direct mail for its sender depends on the quality of the mailmix, i.e. the number of transactional mail items in the mailstream. Hence, there is an interdependency between the two types of mail. This interdependency effects the equilibrium allocation, especially optimal prices. The paper analyzes these effects in two frameworks: A postal monopoly and (direct) postal competition within the mailstream as a platform. It also discusses their implications for (indirect) competition with other communication platforms. A postal monopolist has a strong incentive to lower transactional mail's price in order to increase the mail platform's attractiveness for direct mail. Electronic substitution of transactional mail thwarts these efforts. In addition, direct competition degrades the mailmix because new postal operators tend to focus on bulk and direct, rather than transactional mail. Thereby, direct competition indirectly contributes to the substitution of direct mail.
L43|Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrencies: Opportunities for Postal Financial Services|This paper explores opportunities arising from blockchain technology for postal operators. Blockchain technology has lately received a lot of interest by the media and the industry, especially in financial services. In the past years an entire ecosystem of new companies has developed, offering hundreds of different blockchain applications. Blockchains are a new kind of decentralized, secure and fast means of record-keeping. The first application of blockchain technology are cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which have become an alternative to commodity money and fiat money, but postal operators may be able to exploit this technology in a number of different ways.
L43|On The Sources Of Heterogeneity In Banking Efficiency Literature|This study reviews the empirical literature on banking efficiency by conducting a metaâ€ regression analysis. The metaâ€ dataset consists of 1661 observations retrieved from 120 papers published over the period 2000â€“2014. While the role of study design and methodâ€ specific characteristics of primary studies is evaluated, the focus concerns regulation in banking. The results are fourfold. First, parametric methods always yield lower levels of banking efficiency than nonâ€ parametric studies. Second, banking efficiency is higher in studies using the valueâ€ added approach rather than the intermediation method. Third, efficiency scores also depend on the journal's ranking and on the number of observations and variables used in the primary papers. Finally, regulation matters: primary papers focusing on countries with a liberalized banking industry provide higher values for efficiency scores.
L43|Local Loop Unbundling in the UK Does Not Affect Broadband Penetration - but It Does Lead to Better Service|Under an open access policy, incumbent broadband providers in all EU countries are required to let new market entrants access their networks through bitstream or local loop unbundling (LLU). This type of regulatory provision aims to increase competition among all broadband providers, and is strongly recommended in markets where the prohibitively high cost of setting up a distribution network means that market power is concentrated in the hands of a few players - or even one single player (such as in the case of telecommunications). This analysis uses data from the UK to investigate whether such a policy stimulates market entry and broadband penetration and/or leads to an increase in broadband quality. In contrast to what is commonly believed LLU does not increase internet penetration significantly or sustainably. It does, however, stimulate market entry as well as investments that substantially increase service quality. Thus this open access policy does not contribute to a digital divide in access. Although these results are based solely on experiences in the UK, they do point to the general advantages of infrastructure-based competition (based on LLU) over service-based competition (based on bitstream).

L43|Open Access im Breitbandmarkt hat keine Auswirkung auf die Verbreitung, fördert jedoch die Internetqualität: das Beispiel Großbritannien|Under an open access policy, incumbent broadband providers in all EU countries are required to let new market entrants access their networks through bitstream or local loop unbundling (LLU). This type of regulatory provision aims to increase competition among all broadband providers, and is strongly recommended in markets where the prohibitively high cost of setting up a distribution network means that market power is concentrated in the hands of a few players - or even one single player (such as in the case of telecommunications). This analysis uses data from the UK to investigate whether such a policy stimulates market entry and broadband penetration and/or leads to an increase in broadband quality. In contrast to what is commonly believed LLU does not increase internet penetration significantly or sustainably. It does, however, stimulate market entry as well as investments that substantially increase service quality. Thus while this open access policy does not contribute to a digital divide in access, it does clearly contribute to a divide in broadband quality. Although these results are based solely on experiences in the UK, they do point to the general advantages of infrastructure-based competition over service-based competition. In allen EU-Ländern sind die ehemals monopolistischen Breitbandanbieter im Rahmen einer Open-Access-Politik verpflichtet, neuen Anbietern über sogenannten Bitstrom oder die Entbündelung der TeilnehmerInnenanschlussleitung (Local Loop Unbundling, LLU) Zugang zu ihren Netzen zu gewähren. Diese Art der Regulierung soll für mehr Wettbewerb zwischen den Breitbandanbietern sorgen und wird besonders in Märkten wie der Telekommunikationsbranche empfohlen, in denen die hohen Kosten für die Errichtung eines Verteilnetzes die Konzentration der Marktmacht in den Händen weniger, wenn nicht sogar nur eines Marktteilnehmers begünstigen. Die vorliegende Analyse untersucht anhand von Daten aus Großbritannien, ob eine solche Politik stimulierend auf den Markteintritt, die Breitbandverbreitung und die Breitbandqualität wirkt. Anders als allgemein angenommen wird die Internetverbreitung durch Local Loop Unbundling nicht signifikant und nachhaltig erhöht. LLU fördert jedoch den Markteintritt und Investitionen, die die Qualität der Dienste erheblich verbessern. Somit trägt die Entbündelung der Anschlussleitungen nicht zu einer digitalen Kluft beim Internetzugang bei. Auch wenn die Ergebnisse auf den Erfahrungen in Großbritannien basieren, weisen sie auf den allgemeinen Vorteil hin, den ein infrastrukturbasierter Wettbewerb (LLU) im Vergleich zu einem dienstbasierten Wettbewerb (auf Grundlage von Bitstrom) haben kann.

L43|Public-Private Participation in Energy Infrastructure in Middle East and North African Countries: The Role of Institutions for Renewable Energy Sources Diffusion|Investment in infrastructure, although historically dominated by public intervention, are experiencing a growing role for public and private partnership. This trend traced a steady increase since the start of privatization and liberalization process that took place in most OECD countries in the 90s and peaked in 2012. Middle East and North African (MENA) countries are hungry for infrastructural investment, but looking at the consolidated global trends in energy investment, it emerges that its performance is particularly poor in attracting private participation. However, Morocco was able to figure among the top destination countries for energy investment. Together with Jordan they represent the only two countries able to attract energy investment in the region mostly in renewable energy technology. Evidence shows that Morocco and Jordan are those that perform better in terms of political stability score and rule of law score according to the World Bank. The institutional and political endowment in MENA countries appear to be inappropriate to secure the level of infrastructural investment in the energy sector, in particular when dominated by long lead times and irreversibility. In this context, renewable energy sources investment offer a valid alternative, when the necessary pre-conditions are put in place and when the regulatory design is able to offset, at least partially, the higher country risk that investor are likely to face.
L43|Merchant guilds, taxation and social capital|We develop a theory of the emergence of merchant guilds as an efficient mechanism to foster cooperation between merchants and rulers, building on the complementarity between merchant guilds’ ability to enforce monopoly over trade and their social capital. Unlike existing models, we focus on local merchant guilds, rather than alien guilds, accounting for the main observed features of their behavior, internal organization and relationship with rulers. Our model delivers novel predictions about the emergence, variation, functioning, and eventual decline of this highly successful historical form of network. Our theory reconciles previous explanations and the large body of historical evidence on medieval merchant guilds. In doing so, we also shed novel light on the role of the guilds’ social capital, and its importance for taxation, welfare, and the development of towns and their government in medieval Europe.
L43|Determinants of investment under incentive regulation: The case of the Norwegian electricity distribution networks|Investment in electricity networks, as regulated natural monopolies, is among the highest regulatory and energy policy priorities. The electricity sector regulators adopt different incentive mechanisms to ensure that the firms undertake sufficient investment to maintain and modernise the grid. Thus, an effective regulatory treatment of investment requires understanding the response of companies to the regulatory incentives. This study analyses the determinants of investment in electricity distribution networks using a panel dataset of 129 Norwegian companies observed from 2004 to 2010. A Bayesian Model Averaging approach is used to provide a robust statistical inference by taking into account the uncertainties around model selection and estimation. The results show that three factors drive nearly all network investments: investment rate in previous period, socio-economic costs of energy not supplied and finally useful life of assets. The results indicate that Norwegian companies have, to some degree, responded to the investment incentives provided by the regulatory framework. However, some of the incentives do not appear to be effective in driving the investments.
L43|Fast charging stations: Simulating entry and location in a game of strategic interaction|This paper uses a game of strategic interaction to simulate entry and location of fast charging stations for electric vehicles. It evaluates the equilibria obtained in terms of social welfare and firm spatial differentiation. Using Barcelona mobility survey, demographic data and the street graph we find that only at an electric vehicle penetration rate above 3% does a dense network of stations appear as the equilibrium outcome of a market with no fiscal transfers. We also find that price competition drives location differentiation measured not only in Euclidean distances but also in consumer travel distances.
L43|The need for more efficient public funding of new communications infrastructure in EU member states|Ubiquitous coverage of new high-speed broadband networks, as foreseen by the European Commission, still appears to be a rather unrealistic objective in most European Union member states without government intervention in terms of funding network deployment in unprofitable areas. We contend, however, that the current contract practice of fixing ex ante targets for network expansion is inefficient given the uncertainty about future returns on high-speed broadband services and the public authorities’ incomplete information about the costs of the network provider. This paper suggests delegating the choice of the network expansion to the typically much better informed network operator. Furthermore, we show that such contracts can be implemented based on existing accounting data and that it is not necessary to undertake any additional ex post verification of cost or demand data as is currently the case under claw-back rules.
L43|Net neutrality and innovation at the core and at the edge|How would abandoning Internet net neutrality affect content providers that have different sizes? We model an Internet broadband provider that can offer a different quality of service (priority) to heterogeneous content providers. Internet users can potentially access all content, although they browse and click ads with different probabilities. Net neutrality regulation effectively protects innovation done at the edge by small content providers. Prioritization, instead, increases both infrastructure core investment and welfare only if it sufficiently stimulates innovation from the large content provider.
L43|Transaction and transition costs during the deregulation of the Swedish Railway market|The research on regulatory reform has identified and measured three types of costs associated with the shift from monopoly to competition: transaction costs, misalignment costs and transition costs. In this article we use a case study approach to measure and compare these costs during the deregulation of the Swedish railway system from 2000–2015. Our case studies confirm earlier research that vertical separation and the introduction of competition in the railway markets result in comparatively small direct transaction costs. Extraordinary transaction costs in the form of interrupted contracts are also a minor problem for the railway system as a whole but might create major problems for the affected region. Our research concurs with earlier research on the British railway system and a CER study that misalignment costs seem to be significantly bigger and more troublesome to handle than direct transaction costs. Railway maintenance costs in Sweden using competitive tenders are increasing four to five times faster than railway operations with no measurable improvement in performance. Transition costs have been and continue to be important in the deregulated Swedish railway system. First, procrastination in the form of delayed changes in the allocation of train paths results in misalignment costs that seem to be growing. Second, adjustment costs in the form of handouts to the former monopolist have been ten times higher than the costs for interrupted contracts.
L43|Can market power be controlled by regulation of core prices alone? An empirical analysis of airport demand and car rental price|Many firms offer “core” and “side” goods in the sense that side-good consumption is conditional on core-good consumption. Airports are a common example where the supply of runway and terminal capacity is the core good and the supply of various concession services (for example, car rental services) is the side good. While side-good supply can be responsible for a major share in total revenue, monopoly regulation typically concentrates on the control of core-good prices (“core prices” in short). Whether market power can indeed be effectively controlled by the regulation of core prices alone then depends on whether core-good consumption is a function of the price for side goods. This study empirically shows that a one-dollar increase in the daily car rental price reduces passenger demand at 199 US airports by more than 0.36%. A major implication of our findings is that for the case of airports, the effective control of market power may require regulation of both prices for core and side goods.
L43|Japan's oligopolies: potential gains from third arrow reforms|"Progress has been made in economic reform under the ""Abenomics"" first (monetary policy) and second (taxation reform) ""arrows"". The third, which emphasises structural reforms, has been more politically difficult, thus far yielding mixed results. This paper explores the gains that are possible from the labour market, tax and competition reforms embodied in the third arrow program. Economic rents and industry concentration levels are first identified from Nikkei firm specific data and used to construct an economy-wide model that represents oligopoly behaviour and its regulation explicitly. The analysis finds that modest gains in efficiency are available labour growth and, when it is accompanied by corporate governance reform, the switch between company and consumption taxation. Larger gains are shown to be available from active competition policy and, particularly, from productivity enhancing FDI in services. Central to the results is that a resurgent Japanese economy requires efficiency improvements that raise home rates of return and rebalance its large home and foreign asset portfolio toward home investment and capital growth."
L43|Professions réglementées du droit et aiguillon concurrentiel: réflexions sur la loi du 6 août 2015 pour la croissance, l'activité et l'égalité des chances économiques|La réglementation appliquée à certaines professions est plus souvent analysée sous le prisme d'une protection indue contre la concurrence que sous celui de la défense de l'intérêt général, i.e. de la prévention d'une défaillance de marché. Dans le cadre de la réforme de la réglementation applicable à certaines professions du droit inaugurée en France par la loi Macron d'août 2015, nous interrogeons le cadre réglementaire initial avant de nous attacher aux impacts possibles sur les prix et sur la qualité du service rendu de la réforme en cours.
L43|Specification of merger gains in the Norwegian electricity distribution industry|Electricity distribution often exhibits economies of scale. In Norway, a number of smaller distribution system operators exist and thus there is potential to restructure the industry, possibly through mergers. However, the revenue cap regulatory model in Norway does not incentivize firms to merge as merging leads to a stricter revenue cap for the merged company. Thus the regulator compensates the firms in order to create such incentives. The amount of compensation is based on the potential gains of the merger estimated using a data envelopment analysis (DEA) based frontier approach introduced by Bogetoft and Wang (Journal of Productivity Analysis, 23, 145–171, 2005). DEA is however only one of many possible frontier estimators that can be used in estimation. Furthermore, the returns to scale assumption, the operating environment of firms and the presence of stochastic noise and outlier observations are all known to affect to the estimation of production technology. In this paper we explore how varying assumption under two alternate frontier estimators shape the distribution of merger gains within the Norwegian distribution industry. Our results reveal that the restructuring policies of the industry may be significantly altered depending how potential gains from the mergers are estimated.
L43|The short-term impact of product market reforms: A cross-country firm-level analysis|This paper analyses the effects of product market reforms in the short and medium term across 10 regulated industries and 18 advanced economies for the period 1998-2013 using internationally comparable firm-level data based on Orbis. It provides four key insights. First, product market reforms have positive effects on capital, output and employment and their effects increase over time. After two years, they raise capital by 4%, output by 3% and employment by 1.5%. Second, differences in production technology and the nature of product market regulations across sectors generate important differences in the mechanisms through which reforms operate. In network industries, reforms tend to benefit small firms, while the opposite is observed in retail trade. Product market reforms also promote firm entry, particularly those that reduce entry barriers. Third, credit constraints can play an important role in weakening the positive impact of product market reform on investment. Fourth, product market reforms also tend to have positive effects on firms in downstream sectors—both at home and abroad—that make intensive use of intermediate inputs from deregulated sectors. L'incidence à court terme des réformes des marchés de produits : Une analyse au niveau des entreprises de plusieurs pays Le présent document analyse les effets à court et moyen terme des réformes pratiquées sur les marchés de produits de dix secteurs réglementés dans dix-huit économies avancées sur la période de 1998 à 2013, à partir de données d'entreprises comparables au niveau international issues de la base Orbis. Cette analyse livre quatre grands enseignements. Premièrement, les réformes des marchés de produits ont, sur le capital, la production et l'emploi, des effets positifs qui s'accroissent avec le temps. Après deux ans, l'augmentation constatée est ainsi de 4 % pour le capital, 3 % pour la production et 1.5 % pour l'emploi. Deuxièmement, les différences dans les technologies de production et la nature de la réglementation des marchés de produits d'un secteur à l'autre engendrent d'importantes disparités dans les mécanismes par lesquels les réformes opèrent. Ainsi, dans les industries de réseau, les réformes ont tendance à profiter surtout aux petites entreprises, à l'inverse de ce que l'on observe dans le commerce de détail. Les réformes des marchés de produits favorisent aussi l'entrée d'entreprises sur le marché, en particulier lorsqu'elles ont pour effet de réduire les obstacles à l'entrée. Troisièmement, les restrictions du crédit peuvent jouer un rôle important en affaiblissant l'effet positif des réformes sur l'investissement. Enfin, quatrièmement, les réformes des marchés de produits tendent à avoir des effets positifs sur les entreprises des secteurs d'aval –tant nationaux qu'étrangers – faisant un usage intensif de ressources intermédiaires en provenance de secteurs déréglementés.
L43|Substitution between fixed-line and mobile access: the role of complementarities|Abstract We study substitution from fixed-line to mobile voice access, and the role of various complementarities that may slow down this process. We use survey data of 160,363 households from 27 EU countries during 2005–2011. We estimate a discrete choice model where households may choose one or both voice technologies, possibly in combination with internet access. We obtain the following main findings. First, there is significant fixed-to-mobile substitution, especially in recent years: without mobile telephony, fixed-line penetration would have been 14.1 % higher at the end of 2011. But there is substantial heterogeneity across households and EU regions, with a stronger substitution in Central and Eastern European countries. Second, the decline in fixed telephony has been slowed down because of a significant complementarity between the fixed-line and mobile connections offered by the fixed-line incumbent operator. This gives the incumbent a possibility to protect its position in the fixed-line market, raising market share by 2.7 %, and to leverage it into the mobile market, raising market share by 5.4 % points. Third, the decline in fixed telephony has also been slowed down because of the complementarity with broadband internet: the introduction of DSL avoided an additional decline in fixed-line penetration of 8.7 % points at the end of 2011. The emergence of fixed broadband has thus been the main source through which incumbents maintain their strong position in the fixed-line network.
L43|Regulating networks in decline|Abstract Demand for some services provided on traditional postal, electricity, gas and fixed telecommunications networks can be characterized as being in decline in some jurisdictions. Declining demand can give rise to difficult questions for regulators, in particular, the extent to which network operators can fully recover the costs of historic investments, and the efficiency and distributional effects of applying different rate structures. It can also raise fundamental questions about: the on-going rationale for regulation; the essential functions provided by network operators; and whether regulations should be applied symmetrically to traditional and alternative suppliers. Depending on the pace and scale of the decline, regulation may need to adapt. Proposals for adapting regulation are identified and critically examined in this paper, particularly in terms of the approach to setting the allowed level of revenues and the determination of rate structures.
L43|Freight Rail Costing and Regulation: The Uniform Rail Costing System|Abstract Railroad regulation in the post-Staggers Act regime compares the revenues earned to a measure of the “variable cost” of the shipment. While revenues are readily observed, the “variable cost” is calculated using the “Uniform Rail Costing System” (URCS) that was developed by the Interstate Commerce Commission. We characterize the properties of the URCS rail costing methodology and its role in rate regulation, and we assess whether it produces an economically valid estimate of the cost caused by a rail shipment. We find that the URCS methodology is an accounting cost allocation procedure that does not recover an estimate of the cost of a rail shipment that a rational railroad operator would use to make pricing or operating decisions. We then explain why in the post-Staggers Act regime, even if an economic meaningful shipment cost measure were available, this information would not come any closer to solving the problem of determining what is an unreasonable price for a railroad to charge. We conclude by arguing that the use of the URCS methodology should be abandoned in railroad rate reasonableness regulation and replaced with a price benchmarking approach.
L43|Product Market Deregulation's Winners and Losers: US Railroads between 1981 and 2001|To properly account for labor effects of deregulation, one needs data sets that account for workers and firm heterogeneity. We investigate a comprehensive data set on US railroads. It contains detailed finance, output, employment and wage information for six different skill groups. We identify the effect of product market strategies and mergers on employment and earnings of workers. Railroads have downsized and they have restructured the composition of their human resources. The majority of employee groups have benefitted in terms of compensation. Low-skilled workers blue collars and administrative staff have been the main losers following deregulation, in terms of employment. The main winners are managers and locomotive drivers. The right-to-manage model we use has a good fit, except for executives, which indicates relevance of other types of personnel practices, for instance incentive contracts.
L43|Low-quality Patents in the Eye of the Beholder: Evidence from Multiple Examiners|Low-quality patents are of considerable concern to businesses operating in patent-dense markets. There are two pathways by which low-quality patents may be issued: the patent office may apply systematically a standard that is too lenient (low inventive step threshold); or the patent office may grant patents that are, in fact, below its own threshold (so-called ‘weak’ patents). This paper uses novel data from inventions that have been examined at the five largest patent offices and an explicit model of the grant process to derive first-of-their-kind office-specific estimates of the height of the inventive step threshold and the prevalence of weak patents. The empirical analysis is based on patent applications granted at one office but refused at another office. We estimate that the fraction of patent grants associated with a patent standard that is lower than that of other countries ranges from 2-15%, with Japan having the tightest standard and the United States and China the loosest. The fraction of grants that are inconsistent with the office’s own standard ranges from 2-6 per cent. The fraction of grants that are inconsistent in this sense is generally higher in newer fields such as software and biotechnology, and lower in traditional fields such as mechanical engineering. Our estimates of invalidity are much lower than those that have been derived from litigation studies, consistent with litigated patents being highly non-representative of the population.
L43|The economic power of large corporations and regional development|The article develops the approach to the phenomenon of large corporations in Russian economy based on the concept of economic power.

The paper considers the effects of this increase and of the preferences given to large corporations including those aimed at the development of the territories with sustainable resource specialization.
L43|Structural reforms to boost inclusive growth in Greece|This paper takes stock of the main structural reforms that Greece has undertaken since 2010, those currently proposed and that are in the process of implementation, and quantifies the medium and long‑term effects on output. Special attention is given to three issues that are relevant to understanding reform dynamics in Greece: i) the short-term impact of reforms; ii) the effect of some reforms on income inequality and other socioeconomic outcomes; iii) implementation problems that might undermine the ability of structural reforms to deliver their expected outcomes. The reforms, if fully implemented, could raise output by more than 13% over the next decade. Reforms in product markets are particularly important in boosting growth. Poverty and inequality have increased despite policies to mitigate the social impacts of Greece’s deep depression since 2009. Better social policies are needed to strengthen the social safety net and make growth more inclusive. Much of the burden of adjustment has been borne by labour. Labour market institutions should balance the objectives of increasing jobs, reallocating workers to where they can earn the most, and ensuring the fruits of the economic recovery are widely shared. Des réformes structurelles pour une croissance inclusive en Grèce Ce document a pour objet de faire le point sur les principales réformes structurelles que la Grèce a engagées depuis 2010, tant celles qui sont actuellement proposées que celles qui sont en cours de mise en oeuvre, et de chiffrer les effets à moyen et à long terme de ces réformes sur la production. Une attention particulière est accordée aux trois aspects qui comptent pour appréhender la dynamique des réformes en Grèce : i) les effets à court terme des réformes ; ii) les effets de certaines réformes sur les inégalités de revenu et sur d’autres résultats socioéconomiques ; iii) les difficultés de mise en oeuvre qui pourraient compromettre l’obtention des résultats attendus des réformes structurelles. Si elles sont pleinement mises en oeuvre, les réformes pourraient permettre d’accroître la production de plus de 13 % au cours des dix prochaines années. Les réformes des marchés de produits sont particulièrement importantes pour la dynamisation de la croissance. La pauvreté et les inégalités se sont aggravées malgré les mesures prises pour atténuer les conséquences sociales de la profonde dépression dans laquelle la Grèce est plongée depuis 2009. Il faut améliorer les politiques sociales pour renforcer le système de protection sociale et rendre la croissance plus inclusive. Le fardeau de l’ajustement a reposé pour une bonne partie sur la main-d’oeuvre. Il conviendrait que les institutions du marché du travail parviennent à concilier les objectifs que sont la création d’emplois, le redéploiement des travailleurs vers les emplois les mieux rémunérés et un large partage des fruits de la reprise économique.

L43|Distribution Planning and Pricing in View of Increasing Shares of Intermittent, Renewable Energy in Germany and Japan|In response to the global climate challenge many countries are faced with increasing shares of energy from renewable sources in their power supply. The integration of RES (renewable energy sources) generation however entails technical as well as institutional challenges for power grids. This study relies on recent experiences of German distribution network operators in network planning and network pricing and looks at their transferability to Japan. Distributed generation may cause problems of voltage variation and asset overloading in conventional power grids. Technical solutions for these problems are available and well-known yet require considerable investments. The study presents regulatory incentives for network operators to take efficient means to maintain supply quality. With distributed generation self-supplying customers may contribute too little to network cost and new generators and flexible consumers may cause significant investment by uncoordinated siting and operation. An adequate pricing scheme can serve to sustainably finance the infrastructure while at the same time giving incentives to coordinate network users. This study points out options for network charging in grids with high shares of distributed generation from renewable sources.
L43|Service Oligopolies and Australia's Economy-Wide Performance|" type=""main"" xml:lang=""en""> Australia's services industries now contribute almost four-fifths of gross domestic product. The microeconomic reforms of the 1990s left behind numerous regulated private service oligopolies that contribute one-quarter. Using an economy-wide modelling approach that represents service oligopoly behaviour explicitly, the extent of sectoral interactions and the potential economy-wide gains from price cap regulation are assessed. Non-linear interaction between oligopoly industries is shown to support economy-wide over sectoral analysis. Moreover, the results from the economy-wide modelling suggest that the cost of unabated oligopoly distortions would amount to one-third of Australia's gross domestic product."
L43|Unbundling The Incumbent: Evidence From Uk Broadband| We consider the impact of a regulatory process forcing an incumbent telecom operator to make its local broadband network available to other companies (local loop unbundling, or LLU). Entrants are then able to upgrade their individual lines and offer Internet services directly to customers. Employing a very detailed data set covering the whole of the United Kingdom, we find that, over the course of time, many entrants have begun to take advantage of unbundling. LLU entry only had a positive effect on broadband penetration in the early years, and no longer in the recent years as the market reached maturity. In contrast, LLU entry continues to have a positive impact on the quality of the service provided, as entrants differentiate their products upwards compared to the incumbent. We also assess the impact of competition from an alternative form of technology (cable) which is not subject to regulation, and what we discover is that inter-platform competition has a positive impact on both penetration and quality.
L43|Strategic Investment under Open Access: Theory and Evidence|" type=""main""> We examine the incentives of access-regulated firms to invest in infrastructure facilities they must share with competitors. We show that investment incentives can be decomposed into a non-strategic and a strategic part. The non-strategic part implies that investment depends positively on market size. The strategic incentives imply that investment also depends on market composition, namely, the market shares of the facility owner and its competitors. Using a dataset of regulated electric utilities in the United States, we find evidence that transmission investments are indeed made strategically. Ceteris paribus, utilities are less likely to invest, and investment levels are lower, when competitors occupy a larger share of the market."
L43|Using Forward Contracts to Reduce Regulatory Capture|A fully unbundled, regulated network firm of unknown efficiency level can untertake unobservable effort to increase the likelihood of low downstream prices, e.g. by facilitating downstream competition. To incentivize such effort, the regulator can use an incentive scheme paying transfers to the firm contingent on realized downstream prices. Alternatively, the regulator can force the firm to sell the following forward contracts: the firm pays the downstream price to the owners of a contract, but recieves the expected value of the contracts when selling them to a competivitve financial market. We compare the two regulatory tools with respect to regulatory capture: if the regulator can be bribed to suppress information on the underlying state of the world (the basic propability of high downstream prices, or the type of the firm), optimal regulation uses forward contracts only.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L43|Postal strategies in a digital age|Electronic communications impact all of postal operators? businesses. While letter mail volumes are decreasing due to electronic substitutes, parcels are thriving. Postal operators react in differ-ent ways to these challenges and opportunities. Some try to compensate the loss in their mail business by converging their services toward telecommunications, e.g. by offering hybrid or electronic mail. Some focus on parcels and electronic commerce solutions. Some try to reduce their universal service obligations and try to cut costs. Some leverage their networks, e.g. post offices into banks or retail centers, or mail carriers into community service providers. And many apply a mix of those strategies. This paper explores various approaches by means of selected case studies and an overview of performance indicators. The indicators reveal particularly successful strategies, namely those that leverage infrastructure, reputation and competencies. Based on the results, generic strate-gies are derived. Special attention is given to the legal and regulatory environment which criti-cally affects the post?s ability to adopt a successful business strategy.
L43|Cryptocurrencies: New Opportunities for Postal Financial Services|Contrary to traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies neither have physical form nor are they guaranteed or backed by any central authority. They simply attain value by usage and the confidence of those participating in the respective system. A crypto-paymentsystem is a technology which allows for payments between individuals digitally without relying on central institutions, intermediaries or further infrastructure as required for conventional payment systems. While its legitimacy as currency has been questioned due to its high exchange rate volatility, the significant potential of the Bitcoin technology as a payment system is undeniable. As postal operators typically have a role as financial intermediaries and act in an inter-national and increasingly digital environment, crypto-paymentsystems may be of particular interest to them. In fact, as the post has a wide network of access points and is highly trusted by the general public, it may be well-suited to offer services which counter some disadvantages of crypto-paymentsystems and cryptocurrencies, while retain-ing the benefits of their technology. By turning to crypto-paymentsystems postal operators may extend their role as a financial intermediary with new domestic and interna-tional services. Furthermore, postal operators may even issue their own cryptocurrency to protect customers from the high exchange-rate volatility of cryptocurrencies.
L43|Commercial and regulatory challenges for postal e-services in Switzerland|Swiss Post has been innovating for years, strengthening its expertise as an actor in the digital world and exploiting the unique selling propositions it owns in the physical world. The emergence of the internet in combination with gradual liberalization has given rise to new customer needs, increased and changing competition as well as new business models in the postal sector. The rationale for Swiss Post?s investment in postal e-services is twofold: First, new ser-vices may enhance the value of traditional services by adding complementary services; second, they may compensate losses due to the progressing substitution of physical letter mail which progresses at a rate of about 2 percent per year. This paper documents digital postal services in Switzerland in the context of the postal regulatory and business environment. The paper wraps up the development of postal e-services in Switzerland, puts it in a commercial and regulatory perspective and provides an outlook to future developments.
L43|Leverage and Risk Taking|We study a continuous time contracting problem with risk taking in which size plays a role. The agent may take on excessive risk to enhance short-term gains; doing so exposes the principal to large, infrequent (poisson) losses. The optimal contract must use size as an instrument; there is downsizing along the equilibrium path to preserve incentive compatibility. We characterize the value function, present properties of the optimal contract and derive stark comparative statics. The contract is implemented using the full array of financial securities (equity, debt, covenants), or as a regulation contract specifying a leverage ratio. We price these securities and show that holding equity is essential to curb risk taking. Firms that are less prone to risk taking can afford a higher leverage. This work is, therefore, particularly pertinent to leverage regulation.

L43|Energy reform in Mexico: Imperfect unbundling in the electricity sector|Mexico is in the midst of enacting new energy market reform. After one year of presidential proposals, 21 laws were enacted in August, 2014. The analysis shows inconsistencies and lacunae in defining an open electricity market. According to the proposed reform, incumbent Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) will keep transmission and distribution vertically integrated with newly created subsidiaries subject to third-party subcontracting, while private generation participants will compete in a wholesale market operated by Centro Nacional de Control de Energía (CENACE). Following an institutional economics approach and a framework to account for transition and coordination issues, the problem of misaligned incentives is analyzed along two governance dimensions: regulatory failure and market foreclosure. The research predicts negative effects of energy reform on grid investments and government coordination in Mexico.
L43|Development of Competition Laws in Korea|Economic development policies that were export-focused and biased toward unbalanced growth were initially implemented through government-led initiatives in Korea since the 1960s. These resulted in many problems as well as a big success. Korean competition policies were born and developed to take the role of correcting and complementing economic development policies. Today competition policies have become a major force in Korea’s economic policy. Many parts of industrial policies were replaced by sectoral competition policy in substance. After the 2008 global financial crisis, Korea is faced with new challenges. Recent economic difficulties seem to ask for a bigger role to protect SMEs and fairness in society to address so-called bipolarisation. The economic policy to improve productivity in the name of so-called ‘creative economy’, designed to overcome limits of existing growth strategy, requires proper regulations against abuse of IPRs to supplement strengthened protection of intellectual property rights. All in all, Korea’s antitrust policy remains generally very active in building sound market competition
L43|Territorial Restrictions and Consumer Welfare in a Mixed Oligopoly: The Japanese Gas Supply Market (in Japanese)|This study empirically examines the welfare effects of territorial restrictions on town gas services in Japan by modeling the choice of gas service made by a set of households. The Japanese gas market includes two major types of gas services: the liquefied petroleum (LP) gas service and the town gas service. Although LP gas prices and LP gas service areas are not regulated, town gas prices and town gas service areas are heavily regulated by the government. Particularly, territorial restrictions on town gas services essentially prohibit providers of town gas from expanding their service area. Logically, the government should readjust town gas service areas frequently in response to demand. However, town gas service areas have not been readjusted. Territorial restrictions on town gas service areas could cause a loss in consumer welfare. Using data on the Japanese gas market for the period from 1998 to 2005, and deploying a two-stage procedure, this study analyzes whether territorial restrictions on Japanese town gas services cause a loss in consumer welfare. First, a demand model, assumed to have a nested logit structure, is estimated. The estimation reveals that the characteristics of gas services play a significant role in demand substitution between town gas and LP gas. Second, using the estimated demand parameters, a simulation exercise is conducted; the outcome indicates that an expansion of town gas services to areas without town gas pipelines has allowed some households to switch from LP gas to town gas. In the static Cournot competition among LP gas suppliers, this switch results in an intensification of competition among these suppliers, leading to a decrease in LP gas prices (5.8%) and a consequent improvement in consumer welfare (13.8%). These results suggest that the government should facilitate an expansion of town gas services to areas without town gas pipelines. JEL Classification: L43, L95
L43|Privatisation without Liberalisation? The Strange Case of Italian Railways, and How Adjustments to the Government’s Reforms Could Achieve Gains for Rail Users and Taxpayers|The Italian government is proceeding with the privatisation of the Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane (FSI Group), and is considering a merger with the government-owned highways company. A further proposal has been made to merge the FSI Group with Azienda Nazionale Autonoma delle Strade SpA (ANAS), the state-owned company which owns and manages large parts of the national road network. In this article both aspects will be examined. We argue that changes could be made to the privatisation and reform process, learning from the British experience, which would bring substantial benefits to Italian rail users and taxpayers.
L43|Cartels Destroy Productivity: Evidence from the New Deal Sugar Manufacturing Cartel, 1934-74|The idea that cartels might reduce industry productivity by misallocating production from high to low productivity producers is as old as Adam. However, the study of the economic consequences of cartels has almost exclusively focused on the losses from higher prices (i.e., Harberger triangles). Yet, as the old idea suggests, we show that the rules for quotas and side payments in the New Deal sugar cartel led to significant misallocation of production. The resulting productivity declines essentially destroyed the entire cartel profit. The magnitude of the deadweight losses (relative to value added) was large: we estimate a lower bound for the losses equal to 25 percent and 42 percent in the beet and cane industries, respecttively.
L43|Using discrete choice experiments to regulate the provision of water services: do status quo choices reflect preferences?|Discrete choice experiments (DCE) are increasingly used to quantify the demand for improvements to services provided by regulated utility companies and inform price controls. This form of preference elicitation, however, often reveals a high frequency of status quo (SQ) choices. This may signal an unwillingness of respondents to evaluate the proposed trade-offs in service levels, questioning the welfare theoretic interpretation of observed choices and the validity of the approach for regulatory purposes. Using the methodology for DCE in the regulation of water and sewerage services in England and Wales, our paper contributes to the understanding of SQ choices in several novel dimensions. First, we control for the perception of the SQ and the importance of attributes in day-to-day activities. Second, we use a split sample design to vary both the description of the SQ and the survey administration mode (online vs. in-person). Third, the service attributes can both improve or deteriorate, so that the SQ is not necessarily the least-cost option. Fourth, we examine SQ choices in individual choice tasks and across all tasks so as to identify the determinants of serial SQ choices. Our results suggest that individual SQ choices mostly reflect preferences and thus represent important information for the regulator. However, serial SQ choices are mainly driven by cognitive and/or contextual factors, and these responses should be analysed as part of standard validity tests.

L43|Paving the way for better telecom performance: Evidence from the telecommunication sector in MENA countries|Since the 1980s, developing countries started adopting telecom reforms due to pressures from international institutions. However, Middle East and North African (MENA) countries lagged in adopting such reforms. Even after introducing telecom reforms in the MENA region beginning in 1995, not all countries became better off in terms of various performance indicators. Therefore, this paper empirically assesses the effects of regulation, privatization and liberalization reforms, as well as their simultaneous presences, in the telecommunication sector on the sector's performance using a sample of 17 MENA countries for the period 1995-2010. We assume that different reforms are affected by institutional, political and economic variables with respect to the level of democracy, the legal origin, the natural resources rents per country and the year of independence from colonization. We correct for the endogeneity of telecom reforms, and we use IV-2SLS (Instrumental Variable-Two Stages Least Squares) estimation to analyze their effect on telecom performance in terms of access, productivity and affordability. We find that the privatization of the main incumbent operator and the fixed-line market's liberalization affect the sector's performance negatively in terms of fixed access and affordability. Moreover, we find that the simultaneous presence of an independent regulator and a privatized incumbent helps to eliminate the drawbacks on the sector performance resulting from privatization. However, the simultaneous presences of the other reforms in terms of regulation-competition and privatization-fixed competition do not help to improve the sector's performance
L43|Powering Up Developing Countries through Integration?|Power market integration is analyzed in a two-country model with nationally regulated firms and costly public funds. If the generation costs between the two countries are too similar, negative business stealing outweighs efficiency gains so that, subsequent to integration, welfare decreases in both regions. Integration is welfare enhancing when the cost difference between two regions is large enough. The benefits from export profits increase the total welfare in the exporting country, whereas the importing country benefits from a lower price. In this case, market integration also improves incentives to invest compared to autarky. The investment levels remain inefficient, however, especially for transportation facilities. Free riding reduces incentives to invest in these public-good components of the network, whereas business stealing tends to decrease the capacity to finance new investment.
L43|Aides d’Etat aux aéroports régionaux: une analyse biface|A lot of cases had arouse in the past decade about agreements between regional airports and low-cost carriers. These agreement are challenged on the basis of the State Aids European control as they rise concerns not only about competition distortions between airlines but also about fiscal competition risks among Member States or local governments. Such phenomena could be expected as regional airports are characterized by significant overcapacities and overlapping inducing a substitutability for airlines. Surprisingly, the new 2014 guidelines on State Aids granted to airlines open the way to transitory operating aid schemes, an option apparently at odds with the European longstanding principles. Our purpose in this paper is to demonstrate that such agreements can make sense from the economic point of view provided that the relationship between the carrier and the airport is no longer analysed as a vertical chain, inducing an assessment in terms of economic dependence, but as a two-sided market. The favourable usage terms granted to low cost carriers generate additional flows on the other side, with commercial revenues from shops or parking. Consequently, subsidizing operating costs might be rational, even for a private investor in a market economy, and might be a perennial device.
L43|Aides d'état aux aéroports régionaux : une analyse biface|Un abondant contentieux concurrentiel a été suscité par des conventions liant des aéroports secondaires et des compagnies aériennes à bas coût. Ces dernières ont en effet été passées au crible de l’encadrement européen des aides publiques car elles risquaient de donner lieu tant à des distorsions de concurrence entre opérateurs qu’à des phénomènes de concurrence fiscales entre des infrastructures souvent en situation de surcapacités et entretenant des rapports de substituabilité. La Commission a modifié les lignes directrices en 2014 en ouvrant la possibilité d’aides à l’exploitation mais pour une durée limitée. Cette avancée semble s’inscrire en contradiction avec les principes de base de l’encadrement des aides publiques. Notre contribution montre néanmoins, à l’aide d’un modèle économique, que de tels dispositifs peuvent faire sens dès lors que la relation n’est pas conçue comme une chaîne verticale, induisant une dépendance économique de l’aéroport secondaire vis-à-vis de la compagnie aérienne mais comme s’intégrant dans un marché biface dans lequel il fait sens économiquement de subventionner des flux de passager sur l’une des faces pour maximiser d’autres revenus commerciaux (boutiques, parkings) sur l’autre face. Ce faisant, une aide publique à l’exploitation peut être justifiée économiquement et n’a pas obligatoirement à être transitoire. Ainsi, un soutien à une desserte (par exemple sous forme de réduction des redevances aéroportuaires) pourrait s’intégrer dans une logique d’investisseur privé en économie de marché.
L43|Governing smart grids: the case for an independent system operator|The next years should bring about a rapid transformation of the electricity sector towards high levels of renewable generation and increasing numbers of electric vehicles. Smart grids are seen as the silver bullet responding to the challenge of integrating renewables, managing flexibility, and keeping the costs down in distribution networks. Network unbundling on the other hand is essential for competition in the liberalized electricity industry. It forces independence of the networks and thereby eliminates concern that incumbent integrated (network) firms discriminate against new entrants. With smart grids the unbundling questions become relevant for distribution networks, because active control in smart grids entails discrimination potentials. However, smart grids exhibit coordination needs for efficient system operation and unbundling eliminates firm-internal coordination. Accounting for both aspects, this paper proposes an independent system operator to govern smart distribution grids. It eliminates discrimination incentives and serves coordination needs, thereby striking a balance between both competition and efficiency goals. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2015
L43|Overusing a bypass under cost-based access regulation: underinvestment with spillovers|We explain how underinvestment in infrastructure upgrades is aggravated under access regulation with a cost-based access charge. When a cost-based access charge is imposed on an incumbent, the incumbent has a weak incentive to invest in infrastructure upgrades due to insufficient rewards for the investment. Then, the incumbent’s underinvestment induces the overuse of a bypass by an entrant that chooses productively efficient technology, when the degree of spillover is large, the production cost of the bypass is low, and the incumbent’s investment cost is high. The overuse of a bypass decreases the incumbent’s profits, which further reduces the incumbent’s incentive for investment. Thus, the overuse of a bypass generates a vicious cycle of underinvestment in infrastructure upgrades. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
L43|How EU sector-specific regulations and competition affect migration from old to new communications infrastructure: recent evidence from EU27 member states|In a time of rapidly increasing global digitalization, providers of communications networks find themselves confronted with huge growth in broadband-intense demand and hence must address the need to expand high-performance fiber optic networks. However, since deployment of fiber access networks is subject to high risk for operators, a core question faced by regulatory institutions is how to optimally design the regulatory framework to incentivize investment. This work employs recent EU27 panel data and examines the role of regulatory policies and competition controlling for relevant supply and demand side factors and the investment dynamics. The results indicate that relevant forms of previous broadband access regulation have a negative impact on investment in new fiber infrastructure. Furthermore, infrastructure-based competition from mobile operators and the replacement effect stemming from the incumbents’ existing infrastructure exert a negative impact on investment incentives. Finally, there is clear evidence of adjustment costs underlying the fiber deployment process. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
L43|Estimating the Economic Effects of Deregulation: Evidence from the Turkish Airline Industry|This paper mainly studies the effect of deregulation on prices and quantity. For this aim, we employ cointegration methodology with structural breaks to empirically investigate the simultaneous relationship between deregulation, ticket prices, and the number of passengers in the Turkish airline industry. The findings confirm that deregulation increases quantity and decreases prices through accessibility to air transport service and actual competition, respectively. Also, structural breaks suggest that deregulation of prices and entry into the market has remarkable effect on the change in ticket prices and the number of passengers.
L43|Transversal Agency and Crowding Out|A country's competition agency is transversal in the sense of being active in the whole economy. We study the interaction between the competition agency and sectoral regulators and establish a scope for sectoral regulators to crowd out each other's efforts: More effort on monitoring anticompetitive behavior by one sectoral regulator causes others to do less. We also find that when government agencies interact under consensus the competition agency spends more effort on the industry with the more consumer-biased sectoral regulator, while the opposite is true under independent decisions.

L43|Use and Misuse of Regulation in Fighting Betting Related Corruption in Sport – The German Example|Betting related corruption in sports has increased considerably during the last years, heavily driven by the globalization and digitalization of the worldwide betting market. Using recent data by Sportradar, we examine the particular case of manipulation control in the context of betting regulation in Germany. Here, the legislator recently introduced the possibility for private betting companies to legally enter the sports betting market. However, after 3 years by now, none of the planned licenses has been granted to any company, leaving the whole market in a legally un-regulated “grey area”. Instead, further restrictions for many betting types are under discussion (e.g. the ban of almost all live bets), officially motivated by the aim of preventing betting related corruption. Our analysis yields the following results, whose validity is not restricted to Germany: 1) Market regulations causing the growth of illegal/informal/grey betting markets are counterpro-ductive. 2) The delegation of the supervision of betting markets (including fraud detection sys-tems) to an independent authority is recommended. The same applies to the sanctioning of sus-pected cheaters, which should not be left to the sport federations alone. 3) The government should play the central role in fighting betting related corruption. One fundamental tool for law enforcement is the creation of a legal basis for criminal prosecution. Such a sport-specific ele-ment of crime, labelled e.g. “sport fraud”, could be part of a legislation covering many types of sports manipulation, including doping.
L43|To Regulate Or To Deregulate? The Role Of Downstream Competition In Upstream Monopoly Vertically Linked Markets|This paper attempts to cast light to the effect of monopoly regulation in Cournot markets compared to its effect in Bertrand markets. To this purpose, we use a simple model of a vertically linked market, where an upstream regulated natural monopoly is trading via twoâ€ part tariff contracts with a downstream duopoly. Combining our results to those of the existing literature on deregulated markets, we argue that when the downstream competition is in prices, efficiency dictates regulating the monopoly with a marginal cost based pricing scheme. However, this type of regulation leads to significant welfare loss, when the downstream market is characterized by Cournot competition.
L43|Functional or structural separation to deal with vertical foreclosure effects in the electronic communications industry, pending the Second British Telecoms Review (2015)|The paper tackles the discussion about vertical separation in the electronic communications sector, in its two main forms functional and structural. The author will argue how mandatory structural separation under certain conditions could be a possible option. The evidence is provided by the analysis of recent commitment decisions adopted by the European Commission in the energy sector, and by structural separation undertakings signed in Australia and New Zealand in the past few years. The paper considers the theoretical background, such as the various forms of separation identified by the OECD in 2001 and 2011, but also the current discussion around the Second Telecoms Review (2005-2015) in the United Kingdom.

L43|Oddziaływanie regulacyjne Unii Europejskiej na rynek usług telekomunikacyjnych|Celem artykułu jest dokonanie oceny wyników dotychczasowej unijnej polityki regulacyjnej, prowadzonej w obszarze rynku usług telekomunikacyjnych (RUT), ukierunkowanej na stworzenie rynku konkurencyjnego. Nawiązując do przyjętego celu, skoncentrowano rozważania na udzieleniu odpowiedzi na następujące pytania badawcze: 1) czy podjęty przez UE model otwierania RUT na konkurencję okazał się skuteczny? 2) czy można już mówić o zakończeniu zaplanowanego zadania stworzenia w UE konkurencyjnego RUT? Przy pisaniu artykułu wykorzystano metodę krytycznej analizy literatury, zastosowaną do przedstawienia stanu wiedzy na temat istoty regulacji oraz powodów regulowania RUT, metodę przyczynowo-skutkową służącą do wykazania związków między konkretnymi rozwiązaniami regulacyjnymi i generowanymi przez nie efektami ekonomicznymi i społecznymi oraz metodę syntezy, pozwalającą na dokonanie kompleksowej oceny unijnej polityki regulacyjnej odnoszącej się do RUT, jak i wskazanie głównych, współczesnych dylematów tej polityki. W wyniku przeprowadzonych badań stwierdzono, iż prowadzone w UE liberalizowanie RUT doprowadziło do usunięcia monopolu telekomunikacyjnego i starych struktur regulacyjnych, oraz stworzenia i umocnienia konkurencji w obszarze świadczenia usług telekomunikacyjnych dla klientów końcowych. Mniej korzystnie przedstawiają się efekty budowania konkurencji w obszarze hurtowego dostępu do sieci (dla nowych operatorów telekomunikacyjnych). Uzyskane wyniki pozwalają na wyprowadzenie następujących wniosków: a) zastosowany przez UE model otwierania RUT na konkurencję okazał się - jak dotychczas - częściowo skuteczny, b) w istniejącej sytuacji nie można mówić o zakończeniu zaplanowanego zadania stworzenia w UE konkurencyjnego RUT, c) ważnym zadaniem prowadzonej przez UE polityki regulacyjnej w obszarze RUT powinno być wzmocnienie konkurencji w obszarze hurtowego dostępu do sieci telekomunikacyjnej.
L43|Faut-il autoriser des aides d'exploitation pérennes versées par les aéroports régionaux aux compagnies à bas coûts ? une analyse économique en termes de marché biface|"Les conventions liant des aéroports secondaires et des compagnies aériennes à bas coût ont donné lieu à un abondant contentieux concurrentiel. La compatibilité de ces dernières avec l'encadrement européen des aides publiques peut être interrogée en regard des risques induits de distorsions de concurrence entre opérateurs et de concurrence fiscale entre infrastructures. Les aéroports secondaires sont souvent en situation de surcapacités et se caractérisent par une relative substituabilité pour les compagnies concernées. La persistance de ces contentieux, déjà à l'origine de premières lignes directrices en 2005, couplée à la transformation de l'économie du secteur du transport aérien, a amené la Commission à modifier à nouveau ses lignes directrices en 2014. Elles ouvrent désormais la possibilité d'aides à l'exploitation et non plus seulement au démarrage, assouplissant ainsi les principes traditionnels de l'encadrement des aides publiques. Nous analysons économiquement ces mesures de soutien, basées par exemple sur des ristournes sur les redevances aéroportuaires, pour montrer qu'elles peuvent s'avérer rationnelles pour le gestionnaire d'une infrastructure aéroportuaire, et donc être compatibles avec le critère de l'investisseur privé en économie de marché, issu de la jurisprudence européenne. A cette fin, nous proposons une modélisation de l'aéroport comme une plateforme biface, en mesure d'arbitrer entre revenus liés à ses activités aéronautiques et revenus liés à ses activités commerciales. Nous montrons en outre qu'un lien existe entre l'intensité de l'aide et le mode de régulation ex ante des redevances aéroportuaires. Si ces dernières sont régulées par prix plafonds, la compagnie aérienne dont le pouvoir de négociation est plus élevé pourra s'approprier la plus large part des gains de l'échange. A l'inverse, une régulation par prix plancher permet de limiter cette appropriation et permet bien évidemment de ""plafonner"" ex ante le montant de l'aide potentielle."
L43|Will the U.S. and EU telecommunications policies converge? A survey|Currently, U.S. and EU telecommunications policies differ in many respects. For example, wholesale access to local loops is largely deregulated in the U.S. but continues to be regulated in the EU. Or, the U.S. has an elaborate universal service policy with a set of universal service funds and specific policies for high-cost regions and low-income users, while universal service policies in the EU are much more sporadic. Will the forceful technical and market developments that are associated with IP convergence, next generation access (NGA) and mobile broadband (4G) lead to a convergence of telecommunications policies in the U.S. and EU? Based on a survey of the relevant U.S. and EU related economics literature the current paper addresses this issue for the five policy areas of interconnection, wholesale loop access, net neutrality, spectrum policy and universal service. While IP convergence and the spread of 4G are likely to enhance policy convergence, NGA could have a different effect to the extent that the penetration of and the competitive properties of NGA depend on legacy infrastructures that differ between the two continents.

L43|Mergers between regulated firms with unknown efficiency gains|In an industry where regulated firms interact with unregulated competitors, we investigate the welfare effects of a merger between regulated firms when efficiency gains are uncertain before the merger and their realization becomes private information of the merged firm. The optimal merger policy trades off potential efficiency gains against regulatory distortions from informational problems. We show that, as a consequence of this trade-off, fiercer competition between unregulated firms induces a more lenient merger policy. However, if the regulated firms diversify into a competitive segment of the market, softer competition can relax the optimal merger policy. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015
L43|Can market power be controlled by regulation of core prices alone?: An empirical analysis of airport demand and car rental price|Many firms offer “core” and “side” goods in the sense that side-good consumption is conditional on core-good consumption. Airports are a common example where the supply of runway and terminal capacity is the core good and the supply of various concession services (for example, car rental services) is the side good. While side-good supply can be responsible for a major share in total revenue, monopoly regulation typically concentrates on the control of core-good prices (“core prices” in short). Whether market power can indeed be effectively controlled by the regulation of core prices alone then depends on whether core-good consumption is a function of the price for side goods. This study empirically shows that a one-dollar increase in the daily car rental price reduces passenger demand at 199 US airports by more than 0.36 percent. A major implication of our findings is that for the case of airports, the effective control of market power may require regulation of both prices for core and side goods.
L43|Registered cartels in Austria: an overview|Abstract Cartels were legal to a large extent in Austria until the country’s EU accession in 1995. We examine archival material on registered horizontal cartels to learn about their inner working. Applying content analysis to legally binding cartel contracts, we comprehensively document different collusion methods along the lines described by Stigler (J Political Econ 72:44–61, 1964). Quota cartels employ regular reporting schemes and use compensation mechanisms for departures from set quotas. Specialization cartels divide markets, and rely the least on information exchange and punishment. Price and payment condition cartels primarily aim to prevent secret price cuts, requiring information provision upon request, allow for discretionary decision-taking and (sometimes immediate) punishment. These stylized facts on the contractual arrangements suggest that the possibility to write legally binding agreements was employed to address the usual obstacles to sustain collusion.
L43|Facility- and service-based competition and investment in fixed broadband networks: Lessons from a decade of access regulations in the European Union member states|This paper employs firm-level panel data of 57 incumbent and entrant firms for 23 European countries in the decade from 2003 to 2012. We examine the impact of service- and facility-based competition on firm-level investment as well as the strategic effects underlying infrastructure investment decisions. At the same time we explicitly model the structural dynamics of broadband investment by means of a flexible accelerator model. The empirical specification employs dynamic panel estimation techniques which allow us to account for various sources of endogeneity. We find that facility-based competition exerts a positive and significant impact on both incumbents and entrants implying that incumbents’ and entrants’ investment decisions are strategic complements. Moreover, we find that intermodal competition in terms of fixed-mobile substitution exerts different effects at the firm level. Finally, we show that service-based competition appears to have no significant impact on the investment decision of incumbents and entrants. However, with respect to the later phase of market liberalization, service-based competition exerts a negative impact on entrants’ investment. Our results thus also provide relevant policy guidance on the role of service-based competition in regulating emerging high-speed broadband infrastructure.

Does FTTH deployment influence the interaction?|We estimate the interaction between fixed and mobile usage both for voice and data services using consumer level data from April 2013 to March 2014 in a European country. We find a significant proportion of fixed voice consumption could be substituted by mobile voice, and vice versa. However, a substantial proportion of fixed data consumption, and also mobile data consumption, is generated by fixed-mobile interaction in both directions. FTTH deployment has no significant impact on fixed-mobile voice substitution. The fixed data consumption generated by mobile to fixed interaction appears to increase with FTTH deployment.
L43|The Impact of Alternative Public Policies on the Deployment of New Communications Infrastructure – A Survey|This survey of the theoretical and empirical literature on alternative policies to promote new fiber-based communications infrastructures addresses (i) various kinds of ex ante sector-specific regulations, (ii) deregulatory approaches based on effective competition law implementation and competitive market structures including co-investment models, and (iii) public subsidies to cover non-profitable (white) areas. The authors identify significant research gaps and present a generic framework for policy recommendations. Public subsidies emerge as the dominant policy alternative in white areas, whereas access regulations can be the preferred policy in white or gray areas, where only monopoly structure or co-investment models lead to private investment. Deregulatory policies might be preferable in gray areas, provided there is sufficient pressure from competitive outside options and if competition law is strong. Finally, deregulatory policies including soft regulation are the dominant policy in black areas, where several independent infrastructure operators exist.
L43|Competition in the German interurban bus industry: A snapshot two years after liberalization|We study competition in the German interurban bus industry two years after its liberalization in January 2013. In addition to a brief characterization of the liberalization process and several general market developments, we provide a detailed analysis of selected market characteristics such as concentration and competitive interaction, fares as well as service quality. We use the gained insights to discuss two recent policy issues - industry consolidation and possible abuses of market power by incumbents - and derive several recommendations to secure effective competition in the industry.
L43|Legal and illegal cartels in the European cement industry|Due to being much better documented, legal cartels have recently attracted the interest of many researchers who aim to understand the functioning of illegal cartels in detail. This paper contributes to the question of what we can learn from legal cartels by taking a closer look at the cement industry which has a rich history of both legal and illegal cartels. We undertake a cross-country comparison for Austria, Germany, Poland and Norway, providing narrative evidence for many traits of the cases based on a variety of detailed sources. We identify similarities between legal and illegal cartels in aspects such as monitoring efforts, information exchange, the importance of industry associations and the role of capacities, whereas we also find substantial differences in the allocation of clients, reactions to deviations and pricing schedules.
L43|市场化改革促进了电力行业的增长吗？<BR>[Electricity Sector Reform in China：an Econometric Assessment of the Effects of Competition, Ownership and Regulation]|经历了上世纪80年代到本世纪初的市场化改革黄金期之后，近年电力市场化改革几乎处于停滞的状态，可能会对电力行业的长期发展造成影响，对已有的改革进行绩效评价和经验总结，对继续深化电力体制改革具有重要的意义。有鉴于此，采用1999—2010年的中国分省面板数据，从市场竞争、产权改革和管制政策三个维度对电力市场化改革进行绩效评价研究，在实证过程中采用附加工具变量估计方法来克服改革变量潜在的内生性问题。实证结果表明：在控制了经济增长、人口规模、城镇化率、工业化率和对外开放度等宏观经济变量后，市场竞争和产权改革变量均对电力行业增长具有显著的正向效应，且市场竞争的效果更为显著；管制政策对电力行业增长具有正向效应，但显著性和稳健性较弱。进一步地考察市场化改革对电力细分子行业发展影响的差异性以及改革过程中子行业间的相互关系，研究发现，火电和水电两个子行业间存在着显著的竞争替代关系；市场化改革对两者的影响存在差异：市场竞争对提高两者的经济绩效均具有显著的正向效应；火电行业的产权改革效应要优于水力行业；管制政策对火电行业绩效的影响要优于水电行业。以期本文的研究结论为继续深化电力体制改革提供现实借鉴。
L43|Benchmarking Methods in the Regulation of Electricity Distribution System Operators|This paper examines the regulation of distribution system operators (DSOs) focused on the Czech electricity market. It presents an international benchmarking study based on data of 15 regional DSOs including two Czech operators. The study examines the application of yardstick methods using data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). We find that the cost efficiency of each of the Czech DSOs is different, which indicates a suitability of introduction of individual efficiency factors in the regulatory process.
L43|The “regulatory authority dixit” defence in European competition law enforcement|The European Commission (EC) and the European Courts have being reaffirming in the Deutsche Telekom and Telefónica cases that guide-prices established by sector regulators upon electronic communications incumbents cannot per se exclude that conducts with anticompetitive foreclosure effects, such as margin squeeze, undertaken within the boundaries of those pre-established prices, can be considered abusive under Article 102 TFEU. The paper aims at showing that the reasoning put forward by the EC and the Courts not only dismantles the defensive reasoning put forward by the incumbents before the EC and on appeal before the Courts but actually reaffirms the centrality of the enforcement activity of the EC. The paper examines the reasoning behind the “regulatory authority’s instructions defence” – the argument of the incumbents stating that their actions were justified because they had set their wholesale access prices and retail prices in line with the guidelines imposed by the sectorial regulators. Recalled in this context were also the principles of proportionality, subsidiarity and fair cooperation between the EC and individual Member States. The affirmation of the “heliocentric” doctrine that puts the EC at the hearth of competition law enforcement vis á vis national regulators and domestic legislation (provided decisions of the regulatory authorities can be considered secondary law sources) should take into consideration the important precedent of Consorzio Industrie Fiammiferi. The latter affirms that competition authorities can automatically put aside legislation that goes against Article 101 TFEU. However, they cannot impose pecuniary fines when certain behaviours are imposed by national legislation (while they can impose fines if those behaviours were suggested or facilitated by national legislation).
L43|Competition in the Fixed Telecommunication Market Segment: Challenges and Theories|The persistence of the market power in the fixed telecommunication markets in both developed and developing economies is due to the technical and economic features of this industry. This paper provides an overview of these characteristics and changes. It also suggests a comparative critical survey of the access pricing theories that are “the key” to the transition to the competition in the fixed telecommunication segment. Through this overview, we aim to underline among that the central role that the regulation should play to ensure the establishment of sustainable competition in the fixed telecommunication markets.
L43|Cross-sectoral cooperation between regulators The use of regulatory and competition powers; new investment in UK infrastructure, and consumer welfare|Economic regulation and competition have a big role in helping to ensure investment is efficient, and to reconcile the interests of consumers and investors. In this context, regulatory coherence and stability – the theme of today’s conference - has rarely been so important. This paper discusses: • the relationship between competition and regulation, and the way regulators use their powers; • the importance of independent regulation in ensuring efficient service delivery for consumers, particularly against a background of major investments in UK infrastructure; and • how the regulators are working together to improve the effectiveness, consistency and efficiency of economic regulation.
L43|The incentive regulation of Britain’s rail infrastructure|This paper for the economic conference of the Autorité de régulation des activités ferroviaires (ARAF) describes the role, evolution and operation of inventive regulation in the UK's framework of economic regulation of railway infrastructure.
L43|A better deal for consumers and an attractive environment for investors: How the UK’s economic regulators are developing the use of regulatory and competition powers|There are great expectations in the UK for infrastructure and its role in delivering for customers and society, promoting efficiency and economic growth. These expectations are matched by an ambitious forward programme of investments in renewal and expansion of network capacity and quality across sectors, in some cases backed by the government and in others by private investors. Economic regulation and competition have a big role to play in aligning the interests of investors with the interests of customers and society. Specifically, in relation to investors, economic regulation and competition help to ensure investment is efficient, with the right investment taking place the right place, at the right time and at efficient cost. In this context, regulatory coherence and stability has rarely been so important. 2 In this paper we discuss • the relationship between competition and regulation, and the way regulators use their powers; • the importance of independent regulation in helping to ensure the delivery of what customers and society need, want and can afford from regulated sectors, particularly against a background of major investments in UK infrastructure; • how economic regulation needs to learn and evolve if it is to continue to help ensure delivery of what customers and society expect, given that regulated sectors and the environment in which they operate change over time; and • how the regulators are working together to maximise the benefits from coordination or read across between sectors.
L43|Coopération trans-modale et utilisation des pouvoirs de régulation et de concurrence au Royaume-Uni<BR>[Cooperation between sectoral regulators and the use of regulatory and competition powers in the United Kingdom]|This conference provides an opportunity to examine how regulators collaborate with each other in the UK and compare this with the experiences of our European neighbours. This paper discusses: • the relationship between competition and regulation, as well as the way regulators use their powers; • the importance of independent regulation to ensure that consumer services are delivered efficiently, particularly in the context of major infrastructure investments in the United Kingdom; and • how UK economic regulators work together to improve the efficiency, uniformity and productivity of economic regulation.
L43|Una proposta di modifica per lo statuto delle Local Utility dei servizi a rete|Local utilities managing grids need more and more means to meet their aims: (i) to maintain the assets’ lifespan over the time; (ii) to upgrade the assets to the state-of-the-art; (iii) to increase the assets to fulfill the new requests in order to universal service. So that it’s essential to minimize the dividend payment because, in this kind of companies, cash is not available for the shareholders: it is predestined and it serves the purpose of rebuilding the grids in the amount of depreciation. Local Utilities, effectively, are not cash cow; the value is captured, over the time, into their assets.Furthermore, the local utilities sector needs long-term investors, not businessmen. The question if it’s better a public operator or a private operator to run the business has no sense.
L43|Assessment of EU Postal Sector Policy during the Second Barroso Administration (2010-2014)|This paper assesses the EU postal sector policy of the second Barroso Commission from 2010 to 2014. The main goal of the Commission is to achieve a single European market for postal services. The paper distinguishes between the following three objectives, whose implementation should lead to the achievement of an internal postal market: implementation of the Third Postal Directive; fostering e-commerce and parcel delivery; and enforce its State aid framework in the postal sector. The analysis shows that almost all Member States have transposed the Directive into national law and fully liberalized their markets, but nevertheless competition in all Member States has only developed to a limited extent. While there is strong growth of the e-commerce sector, a consistent alignment of State Aid policy with USO and full market opening is still under development. The current design of the USO and its financing may not be appropriate in times of fast changing technology and consumer needs. Therefore, the paper presents new approaches, suggesting to include new technologies or even proposing to establish an intermodal USO for postal and telecommunication services.
L43|Marco regulatorio y empresas públicas en Uruguay|La existencia de empresas públicas es un fenómeno habitual y económicamente significativo en la mayoría de los países. En este trabajo se analiza la existencia de empresas estatales en la región y en Uruguay, considerándose los motivos para su creación; las propuestas de reforma surgidas en los noventa; y el marco regulatorio en el que actúan estas empresas En particular, en Uruguay los controles constitucionales y legales previstos para las empresas públicas tienen como objetivo implícito controlar los incentivos que éstas pueden tener en descuidar la eficiencia, sin embargo no están diseñados para atender las particularidades de cada sector y se rigen en base a criterios generales que se aplican tanto a la administración pública como a las empresas públicas. En los últimos años se observa un retroceso en la institucionalidad de los órganos reguladores, el que se verifica en una mayor libertad de estas empresas para actuar en sus mercados con prescindencia del entorno.
L43|La riforma della distribuzione gas in Italia: implicazioni patrimoniali, finanziarie e di regulation|The effects of a complex liberalisation process in local gas distribution are examined in this paper. The aim of this analysis is to emphasise the multidimensional aspects of such a reform in gas market regulation at local level. First of all, Local Public Finance will bear strong losses due to minimisation of local public networks' remuneration and as a consequences of potential losses in local public small/medium firms. Also effective competition will be very feeble, due to strong financial barriers to entry the market. An oligopolistic scenario is probable, if not almost sure, for Gas Distribution Industry in the next few years, as the announced reform will be implemented without any correction in Public Regulation.
L43|Asymmetry in Boom-Bust Shocks: Australian Performance with Oligopoly|Australia’s comparatively small and open economy is subject to boom-bust shocks that centre on its exporting mining and agricultural industries which, in average years, are minor contributors to its GDP. The associated real exchange rate effects, however, have important implications for overall performance and its distribution between traded industries and largely non-traded services, the latter contributing four-fifths of its GDP with much of it dominated by oligopolies. A common inference concerning the recent “China” boom has been that the following bust will be seriously contractionary, indirectly implying symmetry in economic responses. This paper explores this issue using an economy-wide approach that represents oligopoly behaviour and its regulation explicitly. The results show considerable asymmetry, with booms having proportionally larger effects on performance than busts. This is shown to be affected by oligopoly but to have its roots in neoclassical behaviour. Key implications are that busts do not place all boom gains at risk. Tight regulatory control of pure profits raises and better distributes gains during booms but it prevents pure losses or exits during busts and so exacerbates downturns.
L43|Screening instruments for monitoring market power in wholesale electricity markets: Lessons from applications in Germany|"While liberalization in energy markets has been a widely successful process all over the world, incumbents often still hold a dominant position. Thus, electricity wholesale markets are subject to market surveillance. Nevertheless, consolidated findings on abusive practices of market power and their cause and effect in wholesale electricity markets are scarce and non-controversial market monitoring practices fail to exist. Our application of the established measure of market concentration RSI shows that it serves as a decent indicator for the rents that can be gained in the market but also reveals considerable weaknesses of the RSI. Therefore, we propose and apply the ""Return on Withholding Capacity Index"" (RWC) representing a measure of the firms' incentive of withholding capacity as a complementary index to the RSI."
L43|Towards a green internal electricity market: The self-regulation of European Transmission System Operators for Electricity within EU multilevel governance|Due to the 3rd Energy Package of 2009 the regulation of European electricity transmission did change considerably. Before, cross-border electricity issues have been regulated by voluntary contractual agreements between Transmission System Operators. Now, the new-founded Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) are guiding this process together with the European Commission. Currently, these organizations are developing network codes to be implemented as binding EU electricity transmission regulation within the next years. This paper analyzes, if this new regulation process does promote the creation of an internal electricity market as well as a better integration of intermittent renewable ('green') energies due to the multilevel governance approach.
L43|Deregulating fixed voice services? Empirical evidence from the European Union|This paper deals with the relationship between the traditional fixed-line, mobile and Voice over IP telephony in the EU.We estimate the supply and demand for fixed-line telephony using data on 25 EU member states for the 2006:Q2 - 2011:Q4 period. Employing instrumental variable approach, we obtain the following results. First, lower prices of Voice over IP and mobile reduce the demand for fixed-line telephony. This indicates some demand-side substitution. Second, we find no relationship between Voice over IP and fixed-line prices. Third, there is a positive and significant relationship between mobile and fixed-line prices. Estimated own- and cross-price elasticities are in the inelastic range. Hence, calls to deregulate fixed-line telephony may be too premature.
L43|Estimating demand for quadruple-play tariffs: The impact on consumer surplus|This paper estimates demand for quadruple play mobile tariffs using a database of subscribers to a single mobile operator from a single town in a European country which has full coverage with both ADSL and FTTH broadband technologies. Based on the demand estimation we find that consumer valuation of FTTH broadband in 2013 increased over time while ADSL lost on attractiveness relative to FTTH but also in absolute terms, which suggests that consumers increasingly care about the speed of connection offered by FTTH. The consumer surplus increased substantially due to the introduction of quadruple play tariffs, and especially with the introduction of FTTH, and ongoing transition of consumers from less valued quadruple play tariffs with ADSL to more valued with FTTH. We also find that for quadruple play subscribers mobile data is complementary to fixed broadband access, which suggests that these consumers use Internet access via mobile handsets to sample online content but they complete their online activity using fixed Internet access at home. On the other hand, mobile voice usage is a substitute to fixed broadband access and consumers reduce their voice consumption once they get broadband connection. We also find that there are substantial switching costs between tariffs, which other things being equal greatly decrease consumer surplus.
L43|Deregulating fixed voice services? Empirical evidence from the European Union|This paper analyzes the relationship between the traditional fixed-line, mobile and Voice over IP (VoIP) telephony in the EU. In doing so, it aims at filling the gap in the empirical literature on the substitution patterns between these technologies in a comprehensive way. It relies on demand estimation for fixed-line telephony using a unique data set comprising 25 EU member states for the 2006:Q2 - 2011:Q4 period. Employing instrumental variable approach, demand-side substitution for VoIP as well as mobile telephony services is found to be prevalent. Estimated short-run own- and cross-price elasticities are in the inelastic range, however, in the long run demand is clearly elastic. Hence, our results underpin the Europeans Commission's current decision to lift the ex ante regulation on the fixed-line telephony market.
L43|Competition for access provision: Infrastructure upgrades with spillovers|We examine a game of competition with access provision in which service quality is endogenously determined through infrastructure upgrades with spillovers. There are two types of equilibria in the free competition regime. In particular, voluntary access provision with an access charge higher than access cost occurs in equilibrium, irrespective of the degree of spillover and the investment cost. However, foreclosure also occurs in equilibrium when the degree of spillover is small and the investment cost is low. We also show that, when voluntary access provision occurs in equilibrium, access regulation is socially desirable only if the degree of spillover is small and the investment cost is high. On the contrary, access regulation is socially desirable in the broader range of investment cost under foreclosure than under voluntary access provision.

L43|Efficient contracts for government intervention in promoting next generation communications networks|Although the future socio-economic benefits of a new fibre-based ('next generation access', NGA) telecommunications infrastructure seem to be uncontroversial, a universal NGA coverage appears to be a rather unrealistic objective without government intervention. We contend, however, that the current contract practice of fixing ex ante targets for network expansion is inefficient given the uncertainty about future returns on NGA infrastructure-based services and the public authorities' incomplete information about the capital costs of the network provider. This paper puts forward to delegate the choice of the network expansion to the NGA provider.

L43|Registered cartels in Austria: Coding protocol|In the period following WW II. until the country accessed the European Union, cartels were legalized in Austria, upon registration with the Austrian Cartel Court. We obtained access to the registration data, and scanned them all towards a microeconomic analysis of contracting behavior between firms competing, in principle, in their respective markets. In this paper, we give a detailed account of our procedure of coding the data from the scanned documents.
L43|The impact of regulation and competition on the migration from old to new communications infrastructure: Recent evidence from EU27 member states|Fibre-deployment of next-generation communications networks is currently a major challenge for investing firms as well as for national regulators and is also subject to hot debates at EU level. This work examines the role of regulatory policies and competition controlling for relevant supply and demand side factors. Our econometric model employs dynamic panel data methods that take into account potential endogeneity due to omitted heterogeneity, reverse causality and the dynamic investment specification. Our results indicate that relevant forms of previous broadband access regulations have had a negative impact on investment in new infrastructure. Furthermore, infrastructure-based competition from mobile operators and the replacement effect stemming from the incumbents' existing infrastructure exert a negative impact on ex ante investment incentives. As regards the dynamics of the adjustment process, we find that there are both short-term and long-term effects towards the desired infrastructure level.
L43|Does anti-competitive service sector regulation harm exporters? Evidence from manufacturing firms in Spain|In a panel study of firm-level data from Spanish manufacturers, we show that reducing anti-competitive regulation in the provision of upstream services has a positive and sizeable effect on the volume of exports of downstream firms. Our estimates indicate that deregulation is very beneficial for the export performance of large corporations, especially if they are foreign-owned multinationals, while the evidence for SMEs is much weaker. Hence, firm characteristics matter for the connection between regulation and exports. Simulation exercises suggest that large firms increased their volume of exports by an average of 49% as a result of deregulation, such that the industries that benefited the most were typically more dependent on service inputs. The improvements in the regulatory framework of transportation services and energy provision that took place over the 1990s and 2000s in Spain had particularly strong effects on the volume of foreign sales.
L43|Network Unbundling and Flawed Coordination: Experience from the Electricity Sector|What is a good balance between competition and coordination? On the upside, unbundling in network industries promotes competition, but this should be balanced against the downside of unbundling, that is, the cost of coordination. Firm-internal coordination falls away and must be replaced by external market mechanisms. This is a non-trivial task. The cost of flawed coordination resulting from frag- mentation can be substantial and policy should focus more on market mechanisms and governance structures to secure better coordination. This paper examines the problem of coordination and discusses with real-world examples why the market faces difficulty in providing effective coordination.
L43|Unbundling of Electricity Transmission System Operators in Germany – An Experience Report|The purpose of this research is to evaluate the impact of vertical unbundling on German electric utilities. Our research mainly relies on in-depth interviews with sector-experts from the German utilities. We will discuss both short-term changes and the long-term impact on competition in the electricity market as well as the impact on costs and security of supply. Overall, we have two main conclusions. First, the major step in the unbundling process is from “lean legal unbundling” to “fat legal unbundling”; additional steps beyond that are small, both in benefits and in costs. Second, the benefits of unbundling in terms of increased competition do not come for free: unbundling is costly and it is important to balance cost and benefits in the reform process.
L43|Information Governance in Smart Grids – A Common Information Platform (CIP)|The commercial value added in electricity distribution networks and smart grids is increasing. Concerns about competition on a level-playing field are raised and the debate on vertical network unbundling is beginning to address the level of the distribution networks. With regard to the unbundling discussion for distribution networks, we introduce a new approach: the Common Information Platform (CIP). The CIP tries to balance better between competition and coordination. The CIP adds two new dimensions. First, it “unbundles” information and data management as the key step in the value chain, not network ownership or system operation. The other stages of the value chain can remain integrated. Correspondingly, the CIP avoids such drastic measures as network ownership unbundling. Second, it does not “separate” information and data management from the sector, but rather involves third parties in the rule-making process; the governance structure is “common” instead of “independent”.

L43|Significance of Foreign Direct Investment for the Development of Russian ICT sector|The paper contains an overview of main FDI theories. The focus is on the role of FDI inflows within development of national ICT sector (case of Russia). General trends (volumes, structural distribution) in FDI inflows in Russian ICT sector are identified and summarized. Some recommendations regarding the opportunities to attract FDI in Russian ICT sector are given.
L43|ICT Modernization and Globalization: Russian Perspectives|The development of ICT is considered as an important indicator of globalization. The main hypothesis is that the development of ICT and global activities of both countries and regions are positively correlated. As criteria for global activities the exports and FDI-inflows are taken. The hypothesis is tested with the example of the world economy, post-socialist countries and Russia. Russian regional differences in ICT development in the context of the global activities of Russian regions are analyzed.
L43|Mobile Telecommunications and Digital Innovations|This paper describes and analyzes the most recent international trends in the development of mobile communications. The first part deals with the key sectors of the mobile communications market: mobile network, handsets and smartphone operating systems. We focus on the current deployment of Long Term Evolution networks and present the main factors of their worldwide success and their advantages over previous mobile technologies. Furthermore, special attention is given to the historical development of the mobile communications sectoral system of innovation, which contributes to a better understanding of the success of 2G (GSM) and challenges faced by 3G (UMTS) technologies. Finally, we analyze the international diffusion of mobile communications from the lead market perspective, suggest new promising directions of research and outline policy measures for the promotion of mobile communications.
L43|Dynamic Efficiency and Incentive Regulation: An Application to Electricity Distribution Networks|Efficiency and productivity analysis is a central concept in incentive-based regulation of network utilities. However, the efficiency measures obtained from benchmarking predominantly reflect short term performance and hence, provide only a snapshot of the firm's path towards its long run equilibrium. On the other hand, the factors affecting the short run behaviour of firms may not be adjusted instantaneously when firms undertake investment. In these instances, short run inefficiency caused by investments will be transmitted to subsequent periods. This effect, which arises from costs associated with the adjustment of capital stock or production capacity, is problematic under incentive regulation with ex-post regulatory treatment of capital expenditure. This is because it adversely affects the firms' short term efficiency and, consequently, regulated revenue. This paper analyses the dynamic behaviour of inefficiency for a balanced panel of 128 Norwegian electricity distribution companies from 2004 to 2010. We show that, in a given period, inefficiency is a combination of period-specific effects (shocks) plus a carry-over component from previous periods due to adjustment costs. Also, we estimate these two components of inefficiency along with the rate of inefficiency transmission between periods.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L43|Sustainable Electricity Grid Development and the Public: An Economic Approach|Increasingly, local opposition to new electricity grid development projects cause lengthy delays and places financial and practical strain on the projects. The structure of the electricity industry is in transition due to the emergence of smaller but more numerous electricity generation facilities. Also, the general public and local communities are increasingly active and engage with energy and environmental issues. Thus, the traditional decision making frameworks and processes are proving less effective in solving the present time conflicts between local communities and other stakeholders. This paper proposes an economic approach to resolve such conflicts. This paper discusses how compensation, benefit sharing, and property rights can play a role in reducing community opposition to new grid developments. We argue that these methods need to be part of an overarching societal strategy and policy towards environmental effects of grid development. We then propose that such impacts can be addressed within the framework of 'weak' versus 'strong' sustainability. Finally, we suggest that the concepts of 'collective negotiation' and 'menu of options' in regulatory economics can be adapted to operationalize this sustainability-based approach to community engagement with new grid projects<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L43|Market Regulations and USO in the Revised Swiss Postal Act: Provisions and Authorities|This paper analyzes the market regulations and USO as defined in the Swiss Postal Act and their interaction with competition law. Specifically, the paper covers the following aspects of the regulatory framework for the postal sector in Switzerland: First, the scope of the USO, consisting of provisions on the range of products to be offered and their prices, on the density and accessibility of the postal outlet network as well as the coverage and frequency of delivery. Second, it analyzes the financing of the USO, consisting of provisions on the calculation of the net cost, a residual monopoly for letters up to 50 grams and a regulatory cost allocation mechanism to ensure consistency of price regulation and the financing of the USO. Third, it presents the relevant regulatory authorities, consisting of the allocation of competences and the interfaces between the regulators (PostCom, OFCOM, ComCo, Price Supervisor).
L43|Assessment of EU Postal Sector Policy during the Second Barroso Administration (2010-2014)|This paper assesses the EU postal sector policy of the second Barroso Commission from 2010 to 2014.

The paper distinguishes between the following three objectives, whose implementation should lead to the achievement of an internal postal market: implementation of the Third Postal Directive; fostering e-commerce and parcel delivery; and enforce its State aid framework in the postal sector. The analysis shows that almost all Member States have transposed the Directive into national law and fully liberalized their markets, but nevertheless competition in all Member States has only developed to a limited extent. While there is strong growth of the e-commerce sector, a consistent alignment of State Aid policy with USO and full market opening is still under development.The current design of the USO and its financing may not be appropriate in times of fast changing technology and consumer needs. Therefore, the paper presents new approaches, suggesting to include new technologies or even proposing to establish an intermodal USO for postal and telecommunication services.
L43|The Economics of Margin Squeeze|The paper discusses economic theories of harm for anti-competitive margin squeeze by unregulated and regulated vertically integrated firms. We review both predation and foreclosure theories, as well as the mere exploitation of upstream market power. We show that foreclosure provides an appropriate framework in the case of an unregulated firm, whereas a firm under tight wholesale regulation should be evaluated under the predation paradigm, with an adequate test that we characterize. Finally, although non-exclusionary exploitation of upstream market power may also induce a margin squeeze, banning such a squeeze has ambiguous effects on the competitive outcome; hence, alternative measures, such as a cap on the access price, may provide a better policy.
L43|Merit order effect and strategic investments in intermittent generation technologies|"This paper studies the strategic interactions between two electricity generators, the first producing with a \traditional"" technology and the second employing a \renewable"" technology characterized by the random availability of capacity due to the intermittency of its power source. The competition between the \traditional"" and the \renewable"" power producers is examined through a modified version of the two stage Dixit model for entry deterrence (Dixit, 1980) with Cournot competition in the post entry stage. The outcome of the game suggests that the \renewable"" generator exploits the merit order rule which governs spot electricity markets to invest and produce as if it were a sort of Stackelberg leader. While in most cases producer's preferences over strategies do not depend on the average value of capacity availability, according to the value of this parameter the market may lead to an equilibrium which benefits both the \renewable"" producer and the consumers. Given that production of electricity from the renewable source depends on actual weather conditions, the analysis of ex-post payoffs reveals that \renewable"" producer's preferences over strategies may be reversed for small errors in the forecasting of the true value of the average capacity availability factor when the investment cost in the renewable technology is relatively low. In this case, the incentives for strategic behaviour of the \renewable"" producer may be even stronger. The main insights of the model seem to be barely sensitive to changes in the market power of competitors: even when the \renewable"" generator behaves as a competitive fringe in the spot market, it is able to infuence equilibrium outcome to its own advantage through investment choices although to a smaller degree than in the standard setting."
L43|Looking inward for transformative growth|Export led growth has been very effective in modernising China's economy and establishing a large high-saving middle class. Notwithstanding political opposition from trading partners, this growth strategy has also offered the rest of the world improved terms of trade in both product and financial markets, in the form of cheaper light manufactures and cheaper credit. Yet slowing demand in export destinations has forced a transition to inward-sourced growth. This paper uses a numerical model of the Chinese economy with oligopoly behaviour to examine the available “inward” sources of transformative growth along with the policies needed to exploit them. The potential for further “transformative” growth is shown to be considerable though it will require accelerated skilled labour supply growth and the politically difficult extension of industry policy reform to heavy manufacturing and services.
L43|Distributed generation, storage, demand response and energy efficiency as alternatives to grid capacity enhancement|The need for investment in capital intensive electricity networks is on the rise in many countries. A major advantage of distributed resources is their potential for deferring investments in distribution network capacity. However, utilizing the full benefits of these resources requires addressing several technical, economic and regulatory challenges. A significant barrier pertains to the lack of an efficient market mechanism that enables this concept and also is consistent with business model of distribution companies under an unbundled power sector paradigm. This paper proposes a market-oriented approach termed as “contract for deferral scheme” (CDS). The scheme outlines how an economically efficient portfolio of distributed generation, storage, demand response and energy efficiency can be integrated as network resources to reduce the need for grid capacity and defer demand driven network investments.
L43|The impact of regulation, privatization and competition on gas infrastructure investments|In recent years we have witnessed several reforms in network industries, as privatization, regulatory changes and opening to competition in certain segments of the value chain. In sectors such as electricity and gas, this opening to competition is possible only in certain activities (i.e. generation, storage of natural gas and supply), maintaining as a natural monopoly the activities of distribution and transmission, and therefore still subject to regulation.
L43|Market definition for broadband internet in Slovakia – Are fixed and mobile technologies in the same market?|This paper uses a rich survey of 6446 households in Slovakia to estimate price elasticities of demand for Internet access, and draw implications for market definition. We estimate a mixed logit model, in which households choose between different broadband technologies: DSL, cable modem, fibre, WiFi and mobile. We find that a number of household characteristics influence the technology choices, and there is also significant unobserved heterogeneity. Demand for Internet access is highly price sensitive. The price elasticity of demand for DSL is −3.02, which falls in the middle of the range of elasticities for the other technologies. Furthermore, the price elasticity of demand at the level of all fixed broadband technologies (DSL+cable modem+fibre+WiFi) is equal to −1.98. For a reasonable range of profit margins, this estimate implies that mobile broadband should be included in the relevant antitrust market of fixed broadband. Our findings have implications for competition policy in Central and Eastern European countries where due to poor copper networks mobile broadband is an important alternative to fixed broadband.
L43|Efficiency of uniform pricing in universal service obligations|We provide an efficiency justification for the imposition of the uniform pricing constraint in universal service obligations (USO), where USO are defined as a set of constraints imposed on firms belonging to a network industry. In addition to the uniform pricing (UP) constraint, which is an obligation to serve all consumers at an identical price, constraints considered are the coverage constraint (CC), which is an obligation imposed on one of the firms to serve a given segment of the market, and the license constraint (LC), which is a minimum or a maximum coverage restriction that is imposed on entrants. We show that adding the UP constraint to both a CC and a LC leads to an increase in welfare. Our contribution comes from the full recognition of the role of a LC in well-designed USO and we illustrate this role with the particular case of linear demand.
L43|The reform of passenger rail in Switzerland: More performance without competition|The Swiss railway system is known for its high quality of service and integration in a particularly dense public transport system. People are generally less aware of ongoing institutional reform. This article strives to shed light on passenger transport reform, and more particularly on regional traffic. Which institutional frameworks are implicated? What have been the results obtained both for public finances and for travelers? What are the key elements for explaining recorded performance gains? What lessons could be drawn for railway reform? In summary, it appears that improved performance has been possible in Switzerland even in the absence of competition. These improvements are due to the nature of public governance and its impact on the various stakeholders. Public authorities have imposed ambitious but negotiated targets on operators, coupled with severe financial constraints, in a context of decentralization of public procurement. Given this new institutional framework, railway companies and especially the former state-owned railway, the national incumbent SBB have achieved significant productivity increases through management and technical innovation. Client satisfaction, at the heart of the reform, also contributes to these successes.
L43|Fixed-to-mobile substitution in the European Union|This paper analyzes substitution between access to fixed-line and mobile telephony in the European Union using cross-section panel data on households’ choices of telecommunications technologies in years 2005–2010. We estimate a structural model of household׳s demand for access to: (i) fixed-line only; (ii) mobile only; and (iii) both fixed-line and mobile. We find that growing Internet usage increases the share of ‘fixed + mobile’ households, which suggests that households keep their fixed-line connection to access Internet. However, the spread of 3G and cable broadband access decreases the share of ‘fixed + mobile’ households and increases the share of ‘mobile only’ households. Hence, fixed-to-mobile substitution was slowed down by the spread of Internet but it may continue with the spread of mobile broadband. Furthermore, bundling of telecommunications services increases the share of ‘fixed + mobile’ households and decreases the shares of ‘mobile only’ and ‘fixed only’ households. Therefore, operators which can bundle fixed-line connection with Internet or mobile services may slow down fixed-to-mobile substitution.
L43|Analysing the Short Run Effects of China’s Economic Reform Agenda|China’s size limits its capacity to source further growth from exports and so the inevitable turn inward is in progress, as suggested by declining gross flows on its balance of payments relative to its GDP. Thus far, key home policy drivers have been fiscal expansion and public investment, though provincial indebtedness will constrain these in future and growth will be driven by the government’s reform agenda, which includes further industrial reform and “internationalisation”. The short run effects of these domestic policy and external shocks are examined using a model of the Chinese economy that takes explicit account of oligopoly behaviour. The results confirm that further fiscal expansions, even with large public investment components, will not contribute the major share of new growth, but industrial reform in heavy manufacturing and services would reduce costs and foster growth in output, private consumption and modern sector employment. At the same time, while China’s private investment, and hence its overall performance, will be sensitive to the uncertain effects of internationalisation increased nominal exchange rate flexibility would offer a reliable cushion.
L43|Asymmetry in Boom-Bust Shocks: Australian Performance with Oligopoly|Australia’s comparatively small and open economy is subject to boom-bust shocks that centre on its exporting mining and agricultural industries which, in average years, are minor contributors to its GDP. The associated real exchange rate effects, however, have important implications for overall performance and its distribution between traded industries and largely non-traded services, the latter contributing four-fifths of its GDP with much of it dominated by oligopolies. A common inference concerning the recent “China” boom has been that the following bust will be seriously contractionary, indirectly implying symmetry in economic responses. This paper explores this issue using an economy-wide approach that represents oligopoly behaviour and its regulation explicitly. The results show considerable asymmetry, with booms having proportionally larger effects on performance than busts. This is shown to be affected by oligopoly but to have its roots in neoclassical behaviour. Key implications are that busts do not place all boom gains at risk. Tight regulatory control of pure profits raises and better distributes gains during booms but it prevents pure losses or exits during busts and so exacerbates downturns.
L43|Dynamic Efficiency and Incentive Regulation: An Application to Electricity Distribution Networks|Efficiency and productivity analysis is a central concept in incentive-based regulation of network utilities. However, the efficiency measures obtained from benchmarking predominantly reflect short term performance and hence, provide only a snapshot of the firm's path towards its long run equilibrium. On the other hand, the factors affecting the short run behaviour of firms may not be adjusted instantaneously when firms undertake investment. In these instances, short run inefficiency caused by investments will be transmitted to subsequent periods. This effect, which arises from costs associated with the adjustment of capital stock or production capacity, is problematic under incentive regulation with ex-post regulatory treatment of capital expenditure. This is because it adversely affects the firms' short term efficiency and, consequently, regulated revenue. This paper analyses the dynamic behaviour of inefficiency for a balanced panel of 128 Norwegian electricity distribution companies from 2004 to 2010. We show that, in a given period, inefficiency is a combination of period-specific effects (shocks) plus a carry-over component from previous periods due to adjustment costs. Also, we estimate these two components of inefficiency along with the rate of inefficiency transmission between periods.
L43|Sustainable Electricity Grid Development and the Public: An Economic Approach|Increasingly, local opposition to new electricity grid development projects cause lengthy delays and places financial and practical strain on the projects. The structure of the electricity industry is in transition due to the emergence of smaller but more numerous electricity generation facilities. Also, the general public and local communities are increasingly active and engage with energy and environmental issues. Thus, the traditional decision making frameworks and processes are proving less effective in solving the present time conflicts between local communities and other stakeholders. This paper proposes an economic approach to resolve such conflicts. This paper discusses how compensation, benefit sharing, and property rights can play a role in reducing community opposition to new grid developments. We argue that these methods need to be part of an overarching societal strategy and policy towards environmental effects of grid development. We then propose that such impacts can be addressed within the framework of 'weak' versus 'strong' sustainability. Finally, we suggest that the concepts of 'collective negotiation' and 'menu of options' in regulatory economics can be adapted to operationalize this sustainability-based approach to community engagement with new grid projects
L43|How consumer information curtails market power in the funeral industry|Based on the French market, the purpose of this article is to show that contrary to common opinion in France about the impossibility of having a deregulation of the business of funeral services without observing abuses of many locally dominant suppliers, improvement in consumer information, along with the entry of a special storing facility service (“chambre funéraire”), imposes enough competitive pressure on the various suppliers, especially the former monopolist. With a Discrete Choice Experiment implemented in Lyon, France, we find evidence that even in this very emotionally charged market, consumer behavior has changed in favor of a better assessment of the different possibilities of services supplied and of their relative prices (e.g., high price elasticities). We also implement simulations in local markets and show that with good consumer information the market power of supposedly dominant firms is far less important than generally believed. Lastly, simulations stress the procompetitive effects of any business setting up a new storing facility. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2014
L43|Regulation Performance and Investment in Telecommunications in the European Union: a policy evaluation approach|According to the European Regulatory Framework in Telecommunications sector, one of the main tasks required from the NRAs is to promote efficient investment and innovation in the field. The aim of this paper is to estimate the relevance of regulation for the growth of investment across 16 EU Countries. This is done estimating how regulation affects revenues and investment elasticity to incumbents’ market power. To do so, we use the panel structure of our data and the timing of the introduction of regulation to carry out two “quasi experiments”, where incumbents are ideally splitted in two groups, according to whether they are subject to a specific regulation or not. We consider a sample of 16 EU countries from 1997 to 2011. The results seem to to suggest that New Regulatory Framework has little reduced the impact of market share on firm’s revenues and investment in the recent years. Over a longer time span instead, being a regulated country does not imply lower revenues and investment by telecommunication companies. Instead, in regulated countries it is likely that the telecom sector benefits from a better economic and institutional environment, which makes firms more productive for a given level of market power. Finally, in countries with a long-lasting regulatory tradition, an increase in market share represents a more significant increase in firm’s market power than in a nonregulated country, so that in regulated countries, elasticity of investment to market share turns to be higher
