A19|Access to finance constraints in adopting latest technologies for business production in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)|The small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play crucial role in supporting the economies of developing countries. However, with globalization and open market trends, SMEs need to compete with new entrants to maintain their market share and growth. The degree of technology adaptation and level of process sophistication help the SMEs to achieve their targeted level of growth through improvement of business effectiveness and efficiency. Access to finance is a critical success factor in such endeavor and supports the SMEs to alleviate growth constraints. This paper presents research data on the degree that access to finance impacts the abilities of SMEs to grow through improvement of process sophistication for enhanced business production. The raw data was gathered from over 400 firms independently using one unified assessment tool over a period of five years. This data is then analyzed using inferential statistics through one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to evaluate and compare the average scores associated with the research variables. Furthermore, the post hoc analysis is applied to assess the extent and direction of variation in the scores and moderated across different years. The results showed that the adopted level of process sophistication is positively correlated with the availability of technology with limited role played by access to finance. These relationships are discussed and analyzed in the context of local market growth, sophistication, financial capabilities, and financial facilities. The research aims to assist SME stakeholders and governing bodies in recognizing the impact of changes on macroeconomic scale from SMEs growth and sustainability perspectives.
A19|Impact of entrepreneurship education on youth unemployment: A Case of Ummaru Ali Shinkafi Polytechnic Sokoto, Nigeria|Educational orientation of youths in Nigeria is white-collar job directed, which is one of the factors responsible for the youth unemployment in the country, because the educational system itself fails to empower the ones passing through it. To solve the problem of unemployment in this situation, there is need to reorient the youths to think of job creation away from the mindset of job seekers, by inculcating entrepreneurship skill into the youths and building their interests towards entrepreneurship, especially while they are still in school. The study examined the strength of entrepreneurship education on impacting the right skills and attitudes to students and determined the extent to which students exposed to entrepreneurial education are willing to undertake the establishment of their own enterprises. The methodology adopted was based on Descriptive survey design which relied on primary and secondary sources of gathering data, through the use of structured questionnaires. Two hundred (200) questionnaires were administered, and one hundred and fifty four (154) were returned. The study adopted simple random sampling technique. The data was analyzed and Presented using Descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages) and chi-square was adopted to analyze data. The study shows that entrepreneurial education in Ummaru Ali Shinkafi polytechnic is effective in imparting entrepreneurial skills and attitudes to students as well as building their interests towards establishing their own businesses.The study recommends that tertiary institutions, government, parents and the international donors supporting higher education projects must work together to create an ecosystem of support including training, mentorship, and access to finance Start -up Capital should be provided through micro-finance banks and other specialized agencies to adequately empower young entrepreneurs. There is an urgent need for the government to provide an enabling environment in the forms of efficient and available basic infrastructural facilities.
A19|Evolution towards higher net profit in a population of ensembles of ensembles leads to division of labour|In this model the basic ensemble consists of a source and a sink, three basic ensembles constitute an organism or company (both an ensemble of ensembles) and nine organisms/companies form a population or a branch of industry. Each organism is composed of either connected or unconnected ensembles. Linear cost-functions and saturating benefit-functions create superadditivity (better net profit) through a rational and peaceful transfer of substrate within a basic ensemble. Transfers by force and deception are not jet considered. All ensembles have an identical and limited concentration range and all concentrations are of the same probability. Random mutations change cost factors (cf), Michaelis-Menten constants (Km) and the maximal reaction velocities (Vmax) in source and sink of the basic ensemble. Km and Vmax shape a saturating benefit-function in Michaelis-Menten type enzyme kinetics resembling the utility function in economics. The result of mutations in the basic ensemble is a higher or lower cumulative superadditivity of an organism/company and its master if installed. The most effective organisms or masters prevail within the population. Recombination of ensembles between organisms accelerates evolution. Independent of the starting point and with or without a fix cost I observe the evolution towards strong asymmetry and inequality with a division of labour resulting in the development of a collector and a manufacturer. Although I observe a win-win situation reciprocity will become a necessity.

A19|Is any benefit prohibited in Islam?|"It is a well-established rule in the Shariah (Islamic law) that a loan contract is of a charitable nature and as such the lender may not stipulate any excess or benefit from the borrower. However, it is also known in the Shariah that if the benefit from a loan comes to the lender voluntarily and it is not stipulated in the loan contract then it is permissible. This exception derives from some reports that the Prophet used to repay his debt with some increment, and to this effect he said: ""The best amongst you are those who benevolently repay their debts”. Moreover, within Islamic law there exist some juristic opinions allowing the lenders to derive some indirect benefits from the loan contract, such as stipulating that the repayment of the debt is to be made in a place different from the one where the loan was first initiated, as this may save transfer costs and effort, or in utilizing, with conditions, the assets mortgaged against the loan. These exceptions may in principle nullify the general understanding that “any loan which results in a benefit is considered a form of usury” in Islam. The paper comes to define the prohibited benefits on a loan in Islam, thereby building the basis for addressing important questions, such as: i) are reciprocal loans prohibited in Islam? ii) is repaying the loan with excess to cater for inflation lawful? iii) is the benefit that pertains to the lender and does not harm or burden the borrower lawful? Answering these questions shall help set out the parameters for what constitutes unlawful benefits obtainable from a loan contract."

A19|Socio-economic differences of regions in Lithuania|Regional development differences in Lithuania are the result of various factors such as available natural resources, human capital, access to transport, public services etc.The aim of this paper is to assess socio-economic development of regions in Lithuania over the 2011-2016. The research has been focused on both aspects ? regional differences and changes over time. The research was based on the data of the Statistics Lithuania (http://www.stat.gov.lt). Study uses ten regional indicators which represent Lithuanian counties classified by NUTS 3 administrative unit. Kruskal-Wallis test (K-W) was used to determine if there are statistically significant differences among counties and years. The conducted analysis showed, that there was a statistically significant difference of the activity rate, the average disposable income and the number of households that have internet access, comparing by years. During the analysed period, these indices were increasing in all of the counties. It is possible to conclude that regional contrasts in Lithuania are still strong. Summing up the results of the analysis, there is a clear predominance of three regions ? Kaunas, Klaip?da and Vilnius counties. The highest GDP is in Vilnius County. The highest number of investments was in Vilnius and Klaip?da counties. The activity rate increased the most in Tel?iai County. The disposable income was growing unevenly in the counties. Comparing 2016 and 2011 years, the difference between the highest disposable income of Vilnius County and the lowest disposable income of another county has doubled. The research on regional differences in Lithuania has shown that present regional policy should be revised. The disparities in the level of regions contrasts in the population living standards can lead to social tension.
A19|The difficulties of becoming an E- patient from Google ? patient. A qualitative research in Hungary|Information technology is changing rapidly worldwide and so the communication. According to the literature the digital revolution will have a huge impact on how physicians interact with patients. The internet has become a powerful healthcare tool for a lot of people. As a result of these changes e-patient movement has evolved. These changes will have an important affect on the doctor ? patient communication and the direction of these relationship became a fundamental question. According to the literature the paternalist physician - patient communication should be replaced by a common decision however, this process requires significant change of attitude from both the patient and the physician.We made in-depth interviews with five patients with serious illness and with five doctors. We used the grounded theory method for analyzing data about the doctor ? patient communication. From the results we can see, that there are many appearances of needs to becomes from google patient to e-patient but the habitual barriers of paternalistic doctor-patient communication overwrite this efforts.
A19|Semantic Encoding Strategy Training in Foreign Language Acquisition: The Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) Model|This presentation represents a paper devoted to pedagogical participation in researches conducted in applied linguistics literature, seeking to take an active role in maximizing the effectiveness of foreign language (FL) teaching and learning strategies. The paper highlights an innovative foreign language teaching strategy, that is, applying ?semantic-encoding strategy training? in foreign language acquisition, giving weight to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) teaching and learning strategies. Three research questions guided the paper topic:RQ1: How can foreign language learners acquire new input effectively?RQ2: What Brodmann?s cortical areas are involved in semantic encoding processing during intentional encoding?RQ3: How can MSA instructors conduct semantic encoding strategy training effectively in classroom? The researcher initiated the paper by reminding of ?information processing? in human brain to indicate the role of ?semantic encoding? in foreign language acquisition. The paper referred to two experiments conducted by two teams of practitioners composed of psychologists, radiologists and psychiatrists, who were interested in investigating the role and function of Brodmann?s cortical areas assigned to language learning:1. Demb et al: Semantic encoding and retrieval in the left inferior prefrontal cortex (LIPC): A functional MRI study of task difficulty and process specificity. 2. Kirchhoff et al: Cognitive and neural effects of semantic encoding strategy training in older adults.The researcher demonstrated Brodmann?s cortical areas involved in semantic encoding processing during intentional encoding, as well as the particular function of each area during language learning: ?Area 45- Pars Traingularis (Broca?s area),?Area 46- Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex,?Area 47 ? Inferior Prefrontal Gyrus, ?Medial superior fontal gyrus (Areas 8, 9&10),?Right prefrontal gyrus (Area 4),?Left caudate (Area 22),?Prefrontal lateral temporal (includes areas 9 & 46), and?Left lateral temporal (Area 21).The researcher introduced ?Systematically- Linguistic Structured Pattern? (SLSP) as ?a systematic-linguistic pattern facilitates perceiving the linguistic concept of the interlocking and intertwined grammatical components and linguistic characteristics of a language taught as a target language (TL) and serves as semantic encoding-based-teaching approach.?. The researcher concluded the paper by providing a model of ?semantic encoding strategy training? application employing SLSP in MSA instruction, which can be implemented in MSA learning setting, aiming at reducing\eliminating the challenges that learners encounter during MSA acquisition.
A19|Intergenerational field transitions in economics|This note documents trends of socialization and intergenerational mobility across research networks (fields) in economics. Using data on advisor–advisee pairs, we find that intergenerational field similarity is more prevalent in larger and successful fields. We then show that researchers who do choose different fields than those of their advisors are more likely to switch to highly demanded fields in the job market. These results are consistent with the equilibrium of a model in which advisors’ have concerns for their advisees’ socialization and production outcomes. We also document a positive relation between field productivity and the median level of co-authorship at the field level, which is consistent with complementaries between socialization and productive efforts.
A19|Sequential order as an extraneous factor in editorial decision|Abstract Does the sequential order in which manuscripts are submitted to an academic journal have any effect on the editorial decision? As an extraneous factor, the order of submission has no relation to the manuscript’s content. However, an editor facing a list of new submissions could be subject to decision fatigue or order bias, which would in turn affect the editorial decision. Empirical analysis of nearly 10,000 (first) submissions to a leading academic journal shows that manuscripts which were submitted earlier on a given day were up to 7% more likely to be desk rejected, without any order effect on the likelihood of a rejection after peer review.

A19|Utopian Left-Wing Expectations and the Social Consequences of the 3rd Memorandum in Greece|In January 2015 the radical left SYRIZA has won the Greek national elections and formed a coalition government with Independent Greeks (ANEL), a right-wing populist party. After a seven-month negotiation with Greece’s creditors and the agreement for the implementation of a third memorandum of fiscal adjustment, SYRIZA announced the conduction of a second round of national elections in September 2015. After a second electoral victory, SYRIZA formed again a coalition government with ANEL. The main characteristic of SYRIZA’s pre-electoral campaign was that it has primarily focused on the commitment for austerity measures termination and on the implementation of tax alleviation. Even during the second electoral campaign in September 2015, after the agreement for the implementation of the third memorandum of fiscal adjustment, SYRIZA was promising that its implementation will be socially endued in order to reduce negative social consequences, such as those created by the previous memoranda. Practically though, after the first months of the new memorandum implementation, it is obvious that the government has introduced an unprecedented tax policy. Interestingly, this policy is not different from a traditional left logic of tax enforcement but actually leads to the implementation of horizontal austerity policies which firstly affect the socially vulnerable groups. From this point of view, while SYRIZA emphatically declare that it aims at resolving the crisis, its policies seem to deepen the depression. For instance, its inability to find alternative options to finance the social security system, leads to the implementation of restrictive policies which dismantle the welfare state. This paper aims at analyzing the policies of the first left government in Greece by focusing on the tentative social consequences of the third memorandum and at the same time, studying some of the basic factors for its electoral victory, such as populism.
A19|An Elo ranking for economics journals|Rankings for sports such as chess or table tennis are based on the so called Elo rating system. In this paper, we apply this rating system to rank economics journals. One main advantage of the Elo ranking compared to existing ones is its explicit consideration of a journal's performance path. Another advantage is the easy application of the system to any journal metric that is published on a regular basis. Our application is based on data from Web of Science that comprises the impact factors of 382 economics journals for the period from 1997 to 2016. The most recent Elo ranking is quite different for rather 'middle-class' journals compared to other existing rankings. However, also some differences for the top 30 emerge.

A19|Effects of Prices and Yields on the Choice of Farming Tobacco, Results from Uganda|Objective:Tobacco farming is important amongst smallholder farm households, and controversial within policy circles and tobacco control lobbyists. There is little knowledge about why farmers farm tobacco. We examined, cross-sectionally, why farmers grow tobacco and tested whether price and yield stimuli of tobacco and non-tobacco crops would influence the choice of farming tobacco. Methods: A cross-sectional based survey with a sample of 126 farm households (mean farm acreage 5) in the West Nile sub-region of Uganda were surveyed in 2014. We assessed the structure of their land system, access to finance, input use, production and farm expenditure of tobacco and non-tobacco crops. Regression analyses tested whether price and crop yield ratios, controlling for resources were related to the choice of growing tobacco. Results: Tobacco farmers are less likely to farm tobacco leaf if there is an increase in the price ratio of coffee to tobacco, -0.800 p
A19|Piecewise Solutions to Big Data|Outliers in the financial market data often carry important information, which requires attention and investigation. Many outlier detection techniques, including both parametric and nonparametric, have been developed over the years which are specific to certain application domains. Nonetheless, outlier detection is not an easy task, because sometimes the occurrence of them is pretty easy and evident, but in some other times, it may be extremely cumbersome. Financial series, which are not only pretty sensitive in reflecting the world market conditions due to the interactions of a very large number of participants in its operation, but also influenced by other stock markets that operate in other parts of the world, produce a non-synchronous process. In this research, we detect the presence of outliers in financial time series over the S&P 500 during the year 2016. We detect the beginning of some shocks (outliers) such as the Brexit referendum and the United States Presidential election held in the year 2016. Generally, the impacts of these events were not drastic. Histogram time series was implemented over a daily closing price on intervals of five minutes for the S&P 500 index during 2015 and 2016. In this case, the linear dependency between days of atypical returns were analyzed on quantiles [0 ?? 40]% and [60 ?? 100]%, while Wassertein distance and an approximation of entropy were used to quantify the presence of instant shocks in the index.
A19|Beyond wishful thinking: Explorative Qualitative Modeling (EQM) as a tool for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)|The UN's Sustainable Development Goals in their generalized form need to be further reflected in order to identify synergies and trade-offs between their (sub-)targets, and to apply them to concrete nations and regions. Explorative, qualitative cause and effect modeling could serve as a tool for adding crucial factors and enabling a better understanding of the interrelations between the goals, eventually leading to more informed concrete measures better able to cope with their inherent obstacles. This work provides and describes a model that could serve as a template for concrete application. The generalized model already points to some potential ambivalences as well as synergies that can be reflected on using some of the latest theories and concepts from economics and transition research, among other fields. Its first analyses cautiously raise doubts that some possible assumptions behind the original Sustainable Development Goals might overlook some systemic boundaries. For example, an undifferentiated increase of productivity contradicts a lessened environmental impact and need for resources in light of potential planetary boundaries.

After expiry of the normalized lifetime of lifting equipment (overhead cranes, cranes, etc.). arises determination of residual functioning so that under normal safety to function at a normal operating capacity or diminished but not more than 15-20%. For exemplification is considered the investigation of a high gantry crane, MPT 20/5 â€“ 20/4/4 m. In conclusion, after our determinations, the machine can operate with kinematics parameters set initially, but with reduced nominal load of 133 kN, i.e. approx. 13 t, and the lifetime of approx. 7.5 years.
A19|Mining Technological System's Performance Analysis|The mining production systems, both for underground and open pit extraction consist mainly in a string of equipment starting with the winning equipment (shearer loader, in case of underground longwall mining or bucket wheel excavator in case of open pit mining), hauling equipment (armored face conveyor in longwall mining or the on-board belt conveyor in case of excavators), main conveying equipment (belt conveyor in both cases), transfer devices, stock pile or bunker feeding equipment. This system of mainly serially connected elements is characterized by the throughput (overall amount of bulk coal respectively overburden rock produced), which is dependent on the functioning state of each involved equipment, and is strongly affected also by the process inherent variability due to the randomness of the involved processes (e.g. the cutting properties of the rock). In order to model and simulate such production systems, some probabilistic methods are applied arising from the artificial intelligence approach, involving unit operations and equipment, as the overall system as a whole, namely the Monte Carlo simulation, neural networks, fuzzy systems, and the Load Strength Interference methods. The results obtained are convergent and offer the opportunity for further developments of their application in the study of mining production systems.
A19|Pseudo-Scientific Economic Policies Of Moldova Association To The Eu: Methodology, Problems, Solutions|Economic policies and decisions on EU association starting with the begginig of 90’s were pseudoscientific, contradictory, incoherent because those policies have not based themselves on modern and current economic theories elaborated and promoted by the EU. Actuality. The topic is actual from the perspective of the factors’ analysis which were conducting to delay the association process of Moldova to the EU. At the same time, those were increasing instability, disequilibrium in the national economy and raise of social vulnerability and constraint levels which ultimately increased the gap between the national and EU economic development levels. During the period of 2000-2015, the socio-economic policy of the Republic of Moldova is described more as small and fragmented steps on conceiving economic and financial instruments for the integration into the EU which were reflected in the Neighbourhood Partnership and Association Agreement with the EU. These processes conducted for the state incapacity to define its own objectives and social-economic priorities for the association as well as legitimated a continuous stage of transition to the market economy. The scope of the present article is to propose a real change of the development and social-economic association policies for achieving final objective on integration to EU. The proposals would consist in emphasizing and implementation of the EU economic principles reflected in the neoclassic synthesis and neo-conservative theories; the elaboration and implementation of a new Strategy on economic supervision, coordination and anticipation of the economic disequilibrium; achieve economic stability for diminishing the negative effects of the global and regional crisis on national economy and adaptation of the development policies to the national socio-economic conditions. The methods used for the elaboration and achieving the expected results of the study were analysis and synthesis of the reliable data on economic processes’ trends as well as macroeconomic prognoses for designing a set of development scenarios. Results were reflected in elaboration of a system of actions which includes EU as a monitoring mechanism for preventing and anticipating the disequilibrium that may occur during the association process. Stimulation of consumption, of the research and technological progress and targeting foreign investments in the innovation development priorities are some of other actions that are recommended in the article
A19|Concordian economics and the economic bubble|In Concordian economics, a bubble is defined as a separation of monetary values from values of real wealth. This separation is effected by the fundamental proposition of Concordian economics: Investment is income minus hoarding. This definition, in turn, allows us to identify a set of crucial relationships that exist in the economic process, namely more hoarding, less investment and less growth; more hoarding, more inflation; more hoarding, more poverty.

A19|Wie können ökonomische Chancen der Antibiotikaresistenzen realisiert werden?- Eine Analyse am Beispiel von akuten Atemwegsinfekten im ambulanten Bereich|The growing resistance of bacterial pathogens to chemical antibiotics worldwide dictates to reduce the use of antibiotic medicines. This goes specifically for the excessive numbers of frequently unjustified prescriptions in outpatient care in cases of acute respiratory tract infections. Tue need to reduce the use of such medicines may harbour not just in view of the side effects and follow-up consequences of chemical antibiotics and not least because respiratory tract infections frequently have viral causes and are self-limiting pertinent economic opportunities. With a view to find an approach for exploiting such economic opportunities, a survey has been conducted among 100 patients to verify how the patients deal with respiratory tract infections contracted in outpatient care. In a heavily frequented practitioner's office, it has been verified whether for patients with symptoms of a respiratory tract infection contracted in outpatient care, antibiotics are indicated, how soon the patients seek out a practitioner's office once the symptoms occur and what is their stance on non-antibiotic measures. According to the results, there is a need for comprehensive medical consultancy and ahigh need for information. Both are key with a view to the viral causes of the frequently self-limiting respiratory tract infections and pertinent use of non-antibiotic measures to alleviate the symptoms that do not have tonecessarily include a practitioner's visit. There has been a growing role in medical consultancy of the media. There are economic opportunities to be potentially exploited providing the insights gained from this study are used on a more comprehensive and consistent basis tomodify patient behaviour.

A19|The Impact of Citation Timing: A Framework and Examples|The literature on research evaluation has noted important differences in citation time patterns between disciplines, high and low ranked journals and types of publications. Delays in the receipt of citations suggest that the diffusion of knowledge following discovery is slower and given the passage of time the research contribution may be less valuable. This paper provides a framework for the comparison of different citation time patterns. Using principles drawn from the literature on stochastic dominance we show that comparisons of time patterns can be based on very general characteristics of cost of delay functions. When a particular function is used to represent the cost of delay, the magnitude of the impact of differences in citation time patterns can be assessed using simple exponential discounting. We demonstrate the application of this framework in assessing different citation time patterns by applying it to comparisons of 10-year citation records for: leading journals in economics, different business subject areas, journals in economics compared with those in neuroscience and the research output of individual economists.
A19|A quantitative analysis of the academic economic literature regarding the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES)|This article presents a systematization and quantitative evaluation of the economic literature regarding the Brazilian Development Bank – BNDES – produced since its foundation, in 1952, until 2013. We identified, catalogued, read and analyzed approximately 1000 studies, in order to understand what were the major themes and questions raised in this literature, what types of methodologies were employed and how these changed over time, as well as indicators of authorship, collaboration and institutional affiliation. Using this database, a quantitative analysis was carried out using the following indicators: (i) production, which evaluates both the quantity and characteristics of these publications, (ii) impact, which measures the repercussion of this production and (iii) relational, which evaluates citation, co-citation and co-authorship networks. The results showed a growing trend in the number of publications, especially in the last two decades. Additionally, this analysis revealed that the distribution of these publications was significantly concentrated in terms of the most cited documents, the most prolific authors and the institutions which sponsored these publications. Furthermore, a network analysis showed a reduced density in the citation and co-authorship networks, as well as isolated debates on certain themes..
A19|Educational System - A Priority Concern Of The European Union|orld for children and their families. Maybe, in our days, education should represent a priority also to local communities and nations around the world in order to reach out a welfare state without hunger and poverty. Due time, it became a painful true that education matters. Painful not because of the sacrifices that one must make to have an education, nor because of the family efforts made to sustain their children during the time that they are in school, but because the fact that after almost a decade of learning, more than 25% of the young people find themselves in the front of a lack of employment on the labour market. And then they ask themselves if it’s worth learning or not. And this question is a real problem for humanity. Important changes and diversity of the contemporary world affected EU member countries, bringing profound changes in all areas: political, diplomatic, legal, social, financial, economic, technical and technological, religious, informational, environmental, military etc. But, even with all these domains in crises, everybody has to realize that the world’s future development goals cannot be fulfilled without education.

It is shown that the main effect of development of these technologies is the substitution of reality by the ""picture"" formed for external users, transformation of this ""picture"" into the self-purpose. The reason of this is the change of paradigms of trust. Society has passed from trust in authorities with their right to make decisions on the basis of professional judgment to trust in procedures and standards, trust in ""picture"". We have changed trust in result to trust in processes of its receiving."

A19|Indian Manufacturing Sector: Competitiveness at Stake|Productivity is a matter of survival for any business. Higher productivity is sine-qua-non for “survival and growth” of business prospects. India’s series of economic reforms since 1991 have accelerated economic growth but not productivity. India’s productivity remained low compared to global but peers as well. High productivity is good for business, consumers and economy. Higher the productivity, higher the profit, lower the price. Productivity in manufacturing sector in the last two decades remains stagnant, but nobody sincerely has bothered to measure and improve. India’s various global indices, ranking and score relevant to measure productivity, including manufacturing productivity remains poor. This paper attempts to identify role and lacuna by manufacturing sector in productivity.
A19|Financing Sport in the EU: Is That a Business or a Social Enterprise?|The focus of this paper is to evaluate conceptions, perceptions, and interpretations of ?financing sport? throughout the European continent. The paper will aim to shed light on the ways that policy contexts dictate the application of sport financing as well as sport practices. While many sport facilities were developed from the 1970s onwards it was not until the 1980s and 1990s that a field began to emerge from the utilitarian presumption that the promotion of sport would have beneficial outcomes for social and civic order. This paper would like to focus some attention to the increasing involvement of central and local governments in sport financing despite an ongoing decrease in sport participation worldwide. Moreover, in pursuing this line of interrogation this paper asserts that opportunity structure for the organization and development of sporting activities has shifted from developmental to managerial throughout the 21st century.

Is becoming an important issue as food security, which requires companies need to closely monitor the flow processes .
A19|Human Smuggling And Turkey|Turkey has been a busy destination for immigration and it will always beas it is the geographical and cultural exit door of the East and the entrance door of the West. Among these immigrations, we can see the victims of human trafficking, human smuggling, refugees and those who came here to work and live. Human smuggling, which is one of the movements of illegal immigration, is the specific subject of this work.The fact that our country lies on the transportation destinations between the continents of Asia, Europe and Africa, the crime of human smuggling is highly committed in our country. The aim of the victims of human smuggling is to go to a more developed country to have higher standards of living, to get a better job and to escape from the economic and social instability of their countries. The human smuggling, which has gathered pace due to the improvements in communication and transportation, is not a regional issue and has become one of the most important problems for almost all countries.Accordingly, the reasons, methods and extent of human smuggling will be dealt firstly. Later, it will be studied why Turkey is preffered in human smuggling. Finally, statistical data will be given to show how much human smuggling has gone far in Turkey and the study will be finished with that what is being done and what can be done to prevent it.
A19|Are Researcher Rankings Stable Across Alternative Output Measurement Schemes in the Context of a Time Limited Research Evaluation? The New Zealand Case|This paper focuses on the stability of rankings of academics by research productivity in the context of short-term decision making. In particular, the growing use of national research assessment exercises (NRAE) has increased interest in identifying the contributions of individual researchers to an assessment unit’s output and ranking. Our primary finding is that despite statistical evidence of a high degree of rank stability across a number of plausible journal weighting schemes, the journal selection process is of great importance to individual researchers. This applies with particular force to academics working within a NRAE environment based on individual assessment such as New Zealand’s PBRF.
A19|Nobel Lectures in Economic Sciences (2006–2010)|In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden's central bank) established the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, founder of the Nobel Prize. The Prize in Economic Sciences is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm, according to the same principles as for the Nobel Prizes that have been awarded since 1901. This volume is a collection of the Nobel lectures delivered by the prizewinners, together with their biographies and the presentation speeches, for the period 2006–2010.
A19|Practical Correlation Bias Correction in Two-way Fixed Effects Linear Regression|When doing two-way fixed effects OLS estimations, both the variances and covariance of the fixed effects are biased. A formula for a bias correction is known, but in large datasets it involves inverses of impractically large matrices. We detail how to compute the bias correction in this case.
A19|Debates on Intellectual Property Rights|This paper supports the understanding of the definition of intellectual property rights and strong connection with intangible assets and, on the other hand, provides a brief presentation of the organizations supporting the protection of such rights. The essential aim of this article is represented by the detailed information obtained as a result of research carried out in order to define, identify and study the application of IPR in general and especially in our country. At the end of the paper I mentioned what involves protecting intellectual property rights and brought little concerned how our country is perceived to protect such rights. Most often, intellectual property is defined as a formal document of title, like a lease, which means that the property is a legal concept distinct from real property that are actually good without concrete material form. Constitute a special category of assets being perceived as an original creation, derived from creative ideas; has or may have a commercial value due to its contribution to earnings for its owner.The need for protection of intellectual property rights has emerged because of the changes in the contemporary society. The aim and purpose of which is to protect human intelligence product and, at the same time, ensuring that consumers benefit from the use of the attributes of this product. Always remember that the violation of intellectual property rights, causes injury to major economic, signifying a strong threat to the consumers health and safety.
A19|Determinants of School Choice: Evidence from Rural Punjab, Pakistan|The objective of this study is to understand why parents in rural areas of Punjab, Pakistan, choose to send their children to private schools when free public schools are available. The study utilizes the Privatization in Education Research Initiative (PERI) school choice dataset compiled by the Lahore School of Economics in collaboration with the Punjab Bureau of Statistics. These data provide rich information on parents’ perception of their child’s school relative to alternative schools he or she could have attended. The findings suggest that parents’ perceptions play an important role in school choice. In particular, their perceptions of school quality and employment opportunities emerge as key determinants of private school choice. Additionally, expenditure on and access to private schooling relative to public schooling as well as the socioeconomic status of the household have a significant impact on parents’ probability of choosing a private school for their child.
A19|Quality of Services between Expectations and Performance|"In this paper we highlighted the importance and the role of service quality in increasing the quality of welfare. In the twentieth century quality has become a fundamental and necessary value for progress, indispensable for ""mastering"" the future, in which the customer is important, he has absolute priority being a central character, and the company management must consider improving the production process, finding solutions, and involving staff. Therefore, quality leads to lasting customer satisfaction, meets the needs and expectations and helps to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Quality in services contributes to attracting new customers, the loss of fewer clients by providing quality services that require the presence of skills, wisdom, determination, and energy among the basic characteristics of the service provider. The importance of quality is reflected in its ability to meet people’s needs and to increase the standard of living."
A19|The Genesis of a Compressed Society Ruled by Dictatorial Forces thru Terror Installment|The latest novel by Alexandru Ivasiuc, ,,The crawl fish” (,,Racul”, Albatros Publishing House, 1976), deals with the human condition, excelling thru parables, psychoanalysis, a world of contrast and human decay up to zoomorphism. Alexandru Ivasiuc used different literature genres to bring into debate the problem of individual loneliness, political, ethical and social themes of his contemporaneity. Living in actuality and process, he harbor’s stasis and eternity utopia, easily wielding the artistic artifact technique. Today’s novel reader ,,The crawlfish” will be surprised by the freshness of the subject, by the paralelism that can easely be made between it and the social, political and moral context of its time. Alexandru Ivasiuc stratifies the truth in his novels, creating a protective shield against Communist censorship without dimming the force of dogma and the ethos’s echantment in any way. Third person storyteller fiction novel, ,,The crawl fish” is full of political, social, behavioral issues and reaction regarding institutional anomalies of the main characters or different social groups.
A19|Self Identity Tension onto Compensation, Secret Will Mythology (Gnosiology Study upon Night Knowledge Novel Theme)|Alexandru Ivasiuc (born July the 12th 1933, Sighet - died March the 4th 1977, Bucharest), known and renown journalist and essayist during 1967-1977, managed to awake thru his writings (essays, short stories and novels) public interest and time critics. His appearance as a novelist was steep and surprising due to the fact that this writer had the courage to tackle social, politic and existential tendency subjects of realism and an extremely sharp sense of criticism. But his works generally treated subjects that could annoy the newly installed and strongly supported by the Communist Block political class in the country. This is the reason of which the reader wakes up most of times in front of some encrypted texts with a communist march musicality, but from which the alarm signs come like extreme sounds that the author raises with desperation almost, looking at the social, political and system abnormalities.
A19|Labour Supply In The Labour Market In Rural Areas In Poland|Since the beginning of the political transformation in Poland, it's been more than twenty years, however, the situation on the labor market in rural areas is not the best. Deteriorating statistics on the labor market in Poland, manifested by high unemployment and a growing number of people in rural areas is the main reason for the formulation of the main as: analysis of the supply side of the labor market in rural areas in Poland in the years 20o0-2011. Discussion is focused on the employment and unemployment rates in Poland and the total isolation of rural areas. The presented figures were derived from calculations made on the basis of Polish Statistical Yearbooks, Annals of rural population censuses and agricul-tural Census available at the Central Statistical Office in Warsaw and Olsztyn, and the Foundation for the Development of Polish Agriculture.
A19|The prospects of developing Suez Canal Region ? A futuristic vision|Located strategically between three continents which hold thousands of markets and industrial global zones, the Suez Canal is considered to be the shortest link between the east and the west due to its unique geographic location.This importance is getting augmented with the evolution of maritime transportation of the world trade, being the cheapest means of transportation, whereas more than 80% of the world trade volume is transported via waterways.Saving the distance for ships has its potential effect on the cost of time and on operational costs for materials and commodities that are shipped through the Canal, maximizes this importance.After the Egyptian revolution on 2011 and the increasing need to develop the national economy of Egypt, a major project to develop the Suez Canal passage way was launched by the Egyptian government on 2012. This paper aims to investigate the impact of developing the region of the Suez Canal passage on Egyptian economy and the world economy. In order to achieve this purpose a research methodology consisting of literature review is used to achieve an in depth understanding of the importance of Suez Canal in global trade. Second part of the paper investigates the plans laid by the Egyptian government to develop the corridor as a world logistics hub. The third part introduces the idea of constructing a similar route of Suez Canal in Sinai to maximize the benefits of the developed area and the impact this can have on Egyptian and global trade.
A19|The Effect of Current Account Deficit on Economic Growth: The Case of Turkey|Current account deficit ise a measurement of a country?s trade in which the value of goods and services it imports exceeds the value of goods and services it exports. Current account deficit has an important role on economic growth for developing countries. The objective of this study is to analyse the relationship between economic growth and current account deficit for Turkey using time series analysis. For this purpose, Gross Domestic Product and Current Account Deficit data of Turkey between the quarterly data including 2002-2013 were used. Empirical findings show that current account deficit affect economic growth negatively for Turkish economy.
A19|Challenges before Bulgarian state universities for development of financial management and control systems in spending public funds|After accession of Bulgaria to the European Union, the Bulgarian government performed new initiatives and some actions related to the implementation of major reforms in the field of financial control, in order to ensure good financial management of public funds. Among several new acts, the Financial Management and Control in the Public Sector Act was focused on managerial accountability and requires the managers of public sector organisations to manage resources so as to achieve the objectives of the organisation, and to ensure the protection of public interests. They have an obligation to introduce adequate and effective financial management and control systems and to ensure the internal audit function. ?Prof. D-r Assen Zlatarov? University is the only state university in Southeastern Bulgaria. The University faced the challenge of designing and implements a system for financial management and control after legislative amendments that were passed to implement the adopted strategy for the overall development of public internal financial control in Bulgaria after 2006. Difficulties have risen from the differentiation of the various components of the integrated framework for financial management and control, as well as misunderstanding how important the implementation of these systems is. The internal rules adopted by that time have launched a dynamic process of development of the internal controls in this public institution. In 2012, the financial management and control system of the University was updated in accordance with five interrelated components, based on the Integrated Internal Control Framework, as well as with the organisational structure and its specific activities, contributing to the consistent application of the regulatory framework in the country. The financial management and control is carried out through financial management and control systems, including policies, procedures and internal rules established by the management of the organisations for the purposes of providing reasonable assurance that the goals of the organisation have been achieved through: 1. Compliance with legislation and internal acts and contracts; 2. Reliability, comprehensiveness and accuracy of financial and operational information; 3. Economy, efficiency, effectiveness and transparency of operations; 4. The safeguarding of assets and information; 5. Promoting compliance with prescribed management policies.One of the biggest challenges facing Bulgarian higher education institutions in the implementation of the financial management and control is the process of risk management, which should provide a better understanding of potential threats, actions or events that may positively or negatively affect the ability of public institutions to achieve their objectives.
A19|An Economics Evaluation on the HPC based Modeling and Simulation in SME Industry|To overcome the global economy crisis, industries must take a revolutionary step and look for modern technologies. A computer modeling and simulation process has brought about dramatic innovation in the field of engineering. In the process of product design and performance verification, computer aided engineering utilizing HPC (High Performance Computer) and software for industrial products has significantly reduced product cost and time for development, thereby giving industries an opportunity to overcome the current crisis. Despite growing interest over developing HPC based modeling and simulation, there has been a poor return on investment in building effective and efficient HPC based modeling and simulation technologies. In this study, we also analyze the direct economic benefits from TCO(total cost of ownership) and SA (sales analysis)and not just the indirect benefits of each elementary technology into related industries. Furthermore, an economic assessment has been made by estimating B/C (benefit/cost) analysis for the benefits returned versus TCO of the system. The results showed that SME (Small-Medium sized Enterprise) industry showed a high benefit where the acquisition of the system resulted in 1.9 hundred million won of direct B/C effect and 0.9 hundred million won of indirect (B/C) effect. Even in the pessimistic scenario, the calculated B/C exceeded the current public discount rate of 6.25%. Consequently, the investment was fairly justified.
A19|Modeling & Simulation 4.0 : A Plan For The Promotion Of Manufacturing Service In South Korea|Manufacturing industry has been playing a central role in the economic development of South Korea. According to Deloitte?s report, the manufacturing industry of South Korea accounts for 30% of GDP and was ranked 5th in 2013 for its manufacturing competitiveness index. South Korean manufacturing companies have grown rapidly in the past decade, but productivity gains and overseas expansion have made it a ?jobless growth?. Employment and job creation in South Korea have shifted from the manufacturing sector to the service sector after the 1990?s. Fortunately, manufacturing service has become a new source of job creation in South Korea. In general, manufacturing includes a range of activities in addition to production. Service-like activities such as R&D, product design and business planning have become a larger share of manufacturing company?s total business activities.It is well known that Industry is on the threshold of its next revolution driven by the use of Internet of Things and Big data. Therefore, advanced manufacturing countries have been introducing a new national competitive plan, including the Industry 4.0 of Germany and the NNMI(National Network for Manufacturing Innovation) of the U.S., to promote and restore their own manufacturing industry by utilizing cyber-physical linking technologies like the CPS(Cyber Physical System) of Industry 4.0. The proposed modeling & simulation 4.0 plan is a South Korean manufacturing industry innovation plan which is to promote the manufacturing service industry of South Korea by proliferating a supercomputing based product modeling and simulation in the product development activities of manufacturing companies. Supercomputing based product modeling and simulation in a cyber space will play a key role in linking the virtual and physical world. By increasing the high performance computing(HPC) usages of manufacturing companies and expanding the business areas of modeling and simulation service companies, modeling & simulation 4.0 will be not only a great help to reduce the time and cost associated with developing and manufacturing a product but also will help in creating a large number of high value added jobs in South Korea.
A19|The impact of ageing on health care expenditures: a study of steepening|Some researchers claim that health care expenditures for older people are growing faster than for the rest of the population. This process is referred to as steepening. The aim of this paper is to test steepening, applying new data and revised methods. Furthermore, we explain the connection between the terms red herring hypothesis, i.e., that time to death and not age per se drives the health care expenditures, and steepening. We also present the mechanisms that may induce steepening, as presented in the literature. When testing steepening, we apply data from all inpatient stays in somatic hospitals in Norway in the period 1998–2009, i.e., the data has no self-selection and covers the entire population of Norway (5 million). Our analysis does not reject steepening, with the exception of the 0-year-olds. The results also hold when controlling for mortality-related expenditures. Furthermore, we observe an increase in expenditures for the 0-year-olds. Finally, we find increasing mortality-related expenditures over time. We find the link between steepening and the red herring hypothesis to be vague, and we find steepening and the red herring hypothesis to be independent. Copyright The Author(s) 2014
A19|The Relevance of the “h-” and “g-” Index to Economics in the Context of A Nation-Wide Research Evaluation Scheme: The New Zealand Case|The purpose of this paper is to explore the relevance of the citation-based ‘h’ and ‘g’ indexes as a means for measuring research output in economics. This study is unique in that it is the first to utilize the ‘h’ and ‘g’ indexes in the context of a time limited evaluation period and to provide comprehensive coverage of all academic economists in all university-based economics departments within a nation state. For illustration purposes we have selected New Zealand’s Performance Based Research Fund (PBRF) as our evaluation scheme. In order to provide a frame of reference for ‘h’ and ‘g’ index output measures, we have also estimated research output using a number of journal-based weighting schemes. In general, our findings suggest that ‘h’ and ‘g’ index scores are strongly associated with low-powered journal ranking schemes and weakly associated with high powered journal weighting schemes. More specifically, we found the ‘h’ and ‘g’ indexes to suffer from a lack of differentiation: for example, 52 percent of all participants received a score of zero under both measures, and 92 and 89 percent received scores of two or less under ‘h’ and ‘g’, respectively. Overall, our findings suggest that ‘h’ and ‘g’ indexes should not be incorporated into a PBRF-like framework.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
A19|Mercantilismo Español y Derecho Indiano. Títulos sobre tierras en la Gobernación de Popayán|Resumen: La reflexión que a continuación se presenta gira alrededor de las implicaciones que la competencia política tuvo en la organización de la propiedad de la tierra en la Gobernación de Popayán. Desde el punto de vista del uso monopólico de la ley que tuvo la Corona, como fuente de legitimación, se muestra la desarticulación de la economía racional con los requerimientos de orden social en los territorios conquistados. La sobredimensión institucional a través de la presencia de títulos sobre la tierra se interpuso al funcionamiento de la competencia económica.
A19|Bias in Economic News: The Reporting of Nominal Exchange Rate Behavior in Colombia|Since 1991, Colombia has had a market-determined Peso–US Dollar Nominal Exchange Rate (NER), after more than 20 years of controlled and multiple exchange rates. The behaviour (revaluation / devaluation) of the NER is constantly reported in the news, editorials, and op-eds of the major newspapers of the nation, with exceptional attention to revaluation. The uneven reporting of revaluation episodes can be explained by the existence of an interest group particularly affected by revaluation, looking to increase awareness and sympathy for help from public institutions. Using the number of news items and op-eds from a major Colombian newspaper, the over-reporting of revaluation episodes (in contrast to devaluation ones) is shown. Secondly, using statistical analysis of text upon the content of the news items, it is also shown that the words “devaluation” and “revaluation” are far apart in the distribution of words within the news; and the word “revaluation” is highly correlated with words related to: public institutions, exporters, and the need for assistance. Finally, the potential policy response to the media bias is explored.
A19|Scientometric Parameters of Russian Economic Science: General State and the Evaluation of Thesis Boards|The paper analyses the publications of Russian authors in various fields of economics indexed in Web of Science and Russian Science Citation Index.

A19|Pakistan Measures, In Controlling Narcotics Trade|Pakistan is one of the worldâ€(tm)s top producers of narcotics. Pakistan neighbors Afghanistan, the worldâ€(tm)s top producer of opium. Pakistan faces a task of controlling, cultivating, producing and trafficking narcotics within its territory (World Drug Report, 2005). Riddled with corruption, poverty, high unemployment rate amongst its population, the government of Pakistan has invested much resource in the fight to the social vice inflicting its population (Niazi et al, 2009). This paper seeks to identify and analyze the measures the Pakistan government has been implementing in curbing the problem. Strategies implemented by the government of Pakistan such as supply reduction by eradicating cultivation of opium poppy, reducing the demand through mass awareness campaigns, and cooperation with the international community in the fight against drugs. The effectiveness and challenges faced in the process have also been well analyzed, revealing whether any advancement is being made or not. Various agencies and departments put in place by the Pakistanâ€(tm)sâ€(tm) government have also been reviewed, together with their responsibilities. The causes of such extensive abuse of narcotics in a society are reviewed, revealing in a way the susceptibility of Pakistan as a country to narcotics (Drug Abuse Control Master Plan, 2008). The usefulness of the information contained in this paper cannot be overemphasized. Governments facing a similar problem, or willing to install preventive mechanisms can benefit a lot from the information herein. The various agencies involved in narcotics control within Pakistan can also benefit from the information by getting an outsiders viewpoint of the conditions influencing Pakistanâ€(tm)s case. The paper information is based on empirical data collected by various agencies in relation to abuse of narcotics in the world and specifically in Pakistan, and its neighbor Afghanistan. In conclusion, a review of the whole Pakistan case in regard to narcotics production, abuse, and trafficking has been done. Recommendations and improvements, and corrective measures to identified weaknesses have been presented for consideration.

A19|Foundations of the economic and social history of the United States: Theoretical|In sum, in these essays I explore the self-similarity between levels, the fractal structure of reality, through an investigation of an inherent and unavoidable uncertainty which is unique to each level. These essays will demonstrate that as each level struggles to resolve its own inherent uncertainty, a new and higher structure is forced to emerge. This new level largely resolves the problems generated by the inherent uncertainty of the lower level, but evolves its own inherent uncertainty, one which is unique to itself as a new and higher level. By identifying and describing clearly these inherent uncertainties we trace the chain of being mentioned above. We may also outline the basic structure of each new level for in the effort to confront inherent uncertainty the new level must and will mimic the structure of lower level which gave it birth. Considering the levels above, we discover therein numerous and random sorts of change. Our question then becomes, “How might evolution be structured throughout all reality? How might the development of each of the ten levels of order be coordinated in a common law, a universal set of principles? And how might this organization be demonstrated as useful?”
A19|Foundations of the economic and social history of the United States: Metaphysical|"""Oppositional Analysis"" - the name I give to the metaphysics presented in this volume - proposes a number of dichotomies through which one may analyze and understand systematically the structure of every level of reality. Macroeconomic theory, as well as social research, are two excellent stages upon which we may search for clues and insights to the interaction of oppositions. This is so particularly in connection with an analysis of the precepts of the ""Austrian School"" of macroeconomics as presented by Ludwig von Mises in his well-known and highly influential book Human Action. Based upon the circuit given for a musical note (see the Apologia and the Introduction to Volume 2, as well as the more extensive treatment herein) and the ""Circuit of Being"" which will be introduced in this final volume, I propose a model of economics which may correlate with a view of the physical universe of five dimensions as suggested by Theodor Kaluza. I suggest that these dichotomies may underlie the unity created by Kaluza’s work between General Relativity and Maxwell’s equations for electro-magnetism. If this is so, Oppositional Analysis and the economic and social history of the United States may provide a starting point from which we may learn important insights as to the inner workings of these economic and social oppositions as well oppositions of a more physical nature."
A19|Evaluating research -- peer review team assessment and journal based bibliographic measures: New Zealand PBRF research output scores in 2006| This paper concerns the relationship between the assessment of the research of individual academics by peer or expert review teams with a variety of bibliometric schemes based on journal quality weights. Specifically, for a common group of economists from New Zealand departments of economics the relationship between Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) Research Output measures for those submitting new research portfolios in 2006 are compared with evaluations of journal-based research over the 2000--2005 assessment period. This comparison identifies the journal weighting schemes that appear most similar to PBRF peer evaluations. The paper provides an indication of the 'power or aggressiveness' of PBRF evaluations in terms of the weighting given to quality. The implied views of PBRF peer review teams are also useful in assessing common assumptions made in evaluating journal based research.

I Stortinget ble det fremmet forslag om opprettelse av et professorat i statsøkonomi og statistikk. Forslaget fikk tilslutning av et stort flertall og etter Kongens godkjenning ble det umiddelbart satt ut i livet. Dette var det første ""rene"" professorat i økonomi ved Det kongelige Frederiks Universitet. Stortingsdebatten om forslaget og det etterfølgende tilsettingsprosess er behandlet utførlig.

A19|Økonomi og økonomer i UiOs historie: Fra Knut Wicksells dissens i 1910 til framstøtet mot Thorstein Veblen I 1920|Artikkelen redegjør innledningsvis for opprettelsen av statsøkonomisk eksamen i 1905 – den viktigste begivenhet i økonomifagets utvikling ved universitetet i de første 100 år av dets historie – og behandler deretter begivenheter som utspilte seg i 1910-20. I 1910 ble det for annen gang i universitetets historie utlyst konkurranse om et professorat i økonomi. Knut Wicksell, som var med i bedømmelseskomiteen, fant ingen av de tre søkerne kvalifisert, spesielt ikke den av flertallet i komiteen foretrukne kandidat, Nicolai Rygg. Misnøye ved universitetet omkring tilstanden i økonomifaget var trolig medvirkende til at Halvdan Koht noen år senere ledet et framstøt for å få Thorstein Veblen som professor til universitetet. Hendelsesforløpet er dokumentert gjennom brev og andre arkivkilder, herunder brev av Thorstein Veblen som hittil ikke har vært kjent. Framstøtet førte ikke fram, hovedsakelig på grunn av usikre økonomiske utsikter. Artikkelen kan betrakte som en litt lang randmerknad til andre og tredje bind av UiOs historie 1811-2011, utgitt i ni bind i 2011.
A19|Adana kentsel kesiminde yoksulluk ve yoksulluğun belirleyicileri|Bu araştırmayla, Adana kentsel kesiminde hanelerin sosyo-ekonomik durumlarına göre yoksulluğun boyutunu ve yoksulluğun hangi sosyo-ekonomik yapıdaki hanelerde daha yoğun olduğunu belirleyerek yoksulluğu azaltacak politikaların neler olabileceği konusunda öneriler geliştirmek amaçlanmıştır. Çalışmanın verileri, TÜBİTAK destekli “Adana İli Seyhan ve Yüreğir İlçe Merkezlerinde Hanehalkı Gelir, Tasarruf Eğilimleri ve Yoksulluğun Ölçülmesi” başlıklı projeden sağlanmıştır. Bu veriler her biri 1250 haneden; Kasım 2007, Nisan 2008, Kasım 2008 ve Mayıs 2009 dönemlerinde toplandığından, veriler birleştirilmiş veri setidir (pooled data). Yoksulluk sınırı gıda harcamalarına ve temel gereksinmeler maliyetine göre hesaplanmıştır. Hesaplanan yoksulluk sınırları OECD, Engel ve Rothbarth eşdeğerlik ölçekleri uygulanarak dönüştürülmüştür. Adana kentsel alanında hanelerin yoksulluğuna neden olan etkenleri ve bu etkenlerin göreli önemleri Sıralı Probit modeli ile tahmin edilmiştir.
A19|Globalization Versus Regionalization|The current trend of the world development economy entails the thorough analysis of the relation between globalization and regionalization. Although some economic analysts consider regionalization as a reaction to globalization of the certain countries, we notice that on microeconomic level this has a significant contribution to the development and scope of the globalization process. The modern society development largely supported the globalization phenomenon. As globalization is characterized by the up-going tendency to reduce and eliminate the gaps between the national economies as well as by the enhanced connections among these economies, it actually represents the fundamental trade of the current world economy. However, the world economy has a complex evolution being even contradictory in certain situations as the sometimes eventual fragmentations may come up although the interdependency of national economies increases. This work aims at approaching both the globalization and regionalization concepts and their influences over the international economic relations.
A19|Academic Rankings - Are Romanian Universities Competitive?|The nowadays globalization process leads to increasing competitive pressures on higher education institutions, in particular related to their position on global university league tables, for which their research performance currently is almost exclusively the measure. There is no doubt that the arrival on the scene of global classifications and rankings of universities has changed the world of higher education. Since the emergence of global rankings, universities have been unable to avoid national and international comparisons, and this has caused changes in the way universities function. In many strategies of the universities one may find the goal of obtaining a better position in some international rankings. Thus, this paper aims to emphasize some features of the relation existing between rankings and the competitiveness of universities, taking into account the fact that Romanian universities are not to be found in the top 500 of the best universities of the world.
A19|Do immigrant-owned businesses grow financially? An empirical study of African immigrant-owned businesses in the South Africa|Given the fact that numerous challenges prohibit African immigrants from availing financial capital for the purpose of starting a business in South Africa, this paper sets out to investigate whether those that succeeded experienced a significant increment in their financial capital three or more years after start-up. This paper was designed within the quantitative and qualitative research paradigms. A triangulation of three methods was utilised to collect and analyze the data. From a quantitative perspective, the survey questionnaire was used. To complement the quantitative approach, personal interviews and focus groups were utilised as the methods within the qualitative approach paradigm. The primary data collection instrument used was the survey questionnaire which was complemented by personal interviews and focus group debates. The results revealed that the majority (71,1%) African immigrants had an estimated start-up financial in the range of R 1 000 and R 5 000, which tended to vary across the different ethnic groups studied. After three of more years, the estimated financial capital of the majority (39,3%) of the respondents moved to a new range of R 50 001 to R 100 000. Noting a disparity in capital growth exhibited by the different ethnic groups, it was found that all the Ethiopians who started with a capital within the range of R1 000-R5 000 moved into a new capital range (R50 001- R100 000) three or more years after business start-up. Although the absolute migration in terms of capital demonstrated by the Ethiopians is not into the highest capital range, they were nonetheless the only country that experienced this phenomenal growth. In terms of occupying the highest capital range (R250 001- R500 000), 11,1% of Cameroonians moved into that range followed by 7,4% of Somalians. Using an increase in financial capital (generated by ploughing back profits) as a proxy for growth, we were able to prove that these African immigrants owned business grow and the rate of growth varied across the different ethnic groups studied.
A19|Business Intelligence Solutions - a Way of General Improvement of Efficiency and Effectiveness|Business Intelligence (BI) solutions provide organizations the opportunity to make the best decisions in order to have a better image of business environment. Today, the organizations can not focus on solving problems just at the departmental or functional level in an isolated way. An integrated knowledgebase enables at organizational level to improve access to everyday decisions. In this respect, these organizations must select BI tools, easy to use, flexible and allow the user to see different parts of the business.
A19|Time-lag and Business. On Non-Economic Determinants of Economic Parameters (Time-lag i biznes. O pozaekonomicznych wyznacznikach parametrów ekonomicznych)|The system of law enactment in Poland is flawed. It should be based on consultations between the government and non-governmental communities and institutions. One of the tools of such consultations, i.e. social dialogue, is the Tri-partite Commission for Socio-Economic Issues. It was supposed to constitute a plane for communication between the government, trade unions and employers. Its existence at the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy proved to be ineffective. Also lack of ability to conduct conversations and negotiations, which would serve to develop arrangements — agreements which, in turn, would become the basis for formulating statutes — does not contribute to successful transfer of information between the three parties. As a result, the law which should anticipate the existing economic phenomena (positive and negative) is created by a legislator with a time-lag. This situation entails negative consequences for companies and the entire economy as well as causes crisis social phenomena, e.g. unemployment increase.
A19|Ranking Economics Departments In Terms Of Residual Productivity: New Zealand Economics Departments, 2000–2006|This paper utilizes a human-capital approach for ranking the research productivity of academic departments. Our approach provides rankings in terms of residual research output after controlling for the key characteristics of each department’s academic staff. More specifically, we estimate residual research output rankings for all of New Zealand’s economics departments based on their publication performance over the 2000 to 2006 period. We do so after taking into account the following characteristics of each department’s academic staff: gender, experience, seniority, academic credentials, and academic rank. The paper demonstrates that the rankings generated by the residual research approach and those generated by traditional approaches to research rankings may be significantly different for some departments. These differences are important in determining the likely efficiency impact of research assessment exercises.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
A19|Media bias and central bank response. Evidence from the nominal exchange rate behavior in Colombia|"Colombia introduced a market-determined Nominal Exchange Rate (NER) with the US Dollar in 1991, after more than 20 years of controlled and multiple exchange rates. The first nine years the NER was set by an exchange rate band system, since 1999 the exchange rate is determined in a dirty float"" market. The behavior (revaluation / devaluation) of the NER is constantly reported in news, editorials and op-eds of major newspapers of the nation. This paper shows that there is media bias in favor of reporting a revaluation episode in contrast to a devaluation one. At the same time Colombia´s central bank allegedly intervenes in the exchange rate market to reduce volatility. However, it is also shown that the central bank buys US dollars to lessen a revaluation event as a response to the media bias and not volatility. It is also found that the media bias was higher during the exchange rate band system in contrast to the free market period. """
A19|A firm-level analysis of ICT adoption in an emerging economy: evidence from the Colombian manufacturing industries|This study examines information and communication technologies (ICT) adoption among 3759 Colombian manufacturing firms to identify factors that are pertinent to the adoption and usage of ICT at the firm level. This article also attempts to ascertain if the determinants of a firm's ICT adoption vary across the firm size. Our major findings show that three main factors are complementary to a firm's ICT adoption: human capital, organizational changes, and innovation results. Also, firms facing competition in markets abroad are more likely to adopt ICT. Information spillover within the industry is also identified as a determinant of ICT adoptions by firms.

A19|Challenges of formal social security systems in Sudan|The present paper discusses issues of challenges of social security systems in Sudan. Following parameters advanced by ILO and UNCOSOC, those systems are analyzed. The conclusions focus on their applicability that faces axial difficulties mainly presented in the state of institutional interregnum facing the country. Moreover, it is important to revisit aspects of social cohesion that serves greater role in traditional social security in the Sudan.
A19|Introduction to the Macroeconomic Structure of Yemen|In countries where tools of economic control are immature and disabled due to totalitarian systems, macroeconomic analyses for aggregate quantities and relationships, such as total consumption, investment, and government expenditures represents a difficult task. The practice of aggregation distinguishes this field of microeconomics and has advantages but also creates problems, a brief survey of these problems is required now, although a deeper appreciation of these must await the critical attitudes that can only develop with more exposure to entire subject. One difficulty is the complex area known as the aggregation problem, the classifying of widely varying goods or activities into one general category, which is treated as a homogeneous variable. The political, social and military fate of nations depends greatly upon economic success, and no area of economics is today more vital to nation’s success than its macroeconomic performance. Countries like Japan which has grown rapidly by wining export markets for its products, enjoy enhanced political power and higher living standards. A country’s living standards depend crucially upon its macroeconomic policies.
A19|Adoption of technology in teaching of language: A critical assessment of Punjabi(mother tongue)|Mother-tongue plays a paramount role in child’s development. It is the heart and soul of child's education. It is the foundation on which the personality of the child is built. The study of mother- tongue is of dire necessity on psychological, intellectual, emotional and cultural grounds. It is our duty to adopt and adapt mother-tongue as medium of all non-linguistic subjects, thereby making it easy and interesting for the child to learn these subjects. Teachers rarely use teaching technology like multimedia, instructional technology etc. They adopt lecture cum text book method-a boring procedure. Students are made to mug up even stories and poems. Students are passive partners in the learning process. No attempt is made to arouse their creativeness or encourage their self-expression so what they learn is poor learning. This calls for drastic changes. Language learning is a part of education in the wider sense. One of the important causes for the deterioration of the standard of mother-tongue (Punjabi) in Punjab is inadequate provision of teaching aids. In the present study, an attempt has been made to arrive at some precise conclusions.
A19|The Merits of Using Citations to Measure Research Output in Economics Departments: The New Zealand Case|In this paper we explore the merits of utilizing citation counts to measure research output in economics in the context of a nation-wide research evaluation scheme. We selected one such system for study: the New Zealand government’s Programme-Based Research Fund (PBRF). Citations were collected for all refereed papers produced by New Zealand’s academic economists over the period 2000 to 2008 using the databases of the ISI/Web of Science and, to a limited extent, Google Scholar. These data allowed us to estimate the time lags in economics between publication of an article and the flow of citations; to demonstrate the impact of alternative definitions of ‘economics-relevant’ journals on citation counts; and to assess the impact of direct citation measures and alternative schemes on departmental and individual performance. Our findings suggest that the time-lags between publication and citing are such that it would be difficult to rely on citations counts to produce a meaningful measure of output in a PBRF-like research evaluation framework, especially one based explicitly on individual assessment.
A19|Tourism And Services From The Point Of Viewof The Sustainable Development|In the market economy, maintaining the competitiveness1 requires continuous creativity and innovation in order to develop more sophisticated, more refined, more individually nuanced new products and services. The creativity imposes the tourist company managers to regularly reassess the dimensions of the market segments on which they are positioned, to carefully analyse the products and services, in order to eliminate from their offers those products and services or procedures whose profitability is quickly decreasing. Unlike the product quality, service quality is more difficult to define, to judge or express in quantitative terms, as the service has few physical dimensions such as performance, operational characteristics and maintenance costs, which could be used to compare or measure. Due to the non-separable feature of the production and the consumption of services, quality should be defined both based on the process of service provision and the actual results expressed by consumer satisfaction. To obtain a differential advantage, providers should improve the quality tracking the overcoming of the consumer’s expectations in the perception of quality.
A19|The Linguistic Representation of financial crisis. 'The New York Times Online,' 2008-2009|"Este artículo examina la descripción de crisis económica en ""The New York Times"" con ejemplos de artículos que aparecieron en los años 2008 y 2009. Hay tres dimensiones en que es descrita la crisis como evento; una de ellas es como un movimiento o desarrollo de extensión internacional o global (dimensión espacial). La segunda es la metafórica, que describe realmente la crisis como una fuerza natural. La tercera es la descripción de la crisis como ""global"". Nuestra cuestión es ""Cómo es descrita la crisis como evento mediático, si no hay un objeto concreto de referencia, sino sólo un concepto, sistemáticamente expresado, que denota una entidad no-material e imperceptible, a la que nos referimos como crisis?"" Tomando los ejemplos del NYT, demostraremos que tal falta de objeto concreto no altera el lenguaje del periodismo, excepto en que (para los términos más inusuales en el lenguaje periodístico) entra en juego una producción metafórica. La actividad del objeto representado por el nombre es el agente de las actividades, incluso aunque el proceso sea altamente abstracto. En un meta-nivel, el lenguaje en las noticias se convierte en una red alegórica con el objeto crisis, metaforizado, como agente de movimiento en un conjunto de textos inter-textuales que usan esa expresión."
A19|Performance and its Evaluation in the Public System|Evaluation and organizational development relate to one another in matters such as the following: as a consequence of obtaining an unsatisfactory result after having issued a staff evaluation, an organization may decide to take action within the meaning of its training and development of its management capabilities. On the other hand, the results the staff obtains in such trainings can be evaluated in turn.

More and more attracted to the Internet, the students will combine what is necessary with what is pleasant in learning rapidly a language for special purposes. In this paper I have presented the objectives of teaching French language for the Economics starting from an authentic material on the Internet: Lafarge Group which is a multinational enterprise and a world leader in building materials, with a branch in Romania, Constanta County, Medgidia town.
A19|Brains that make revolutions: the neural theory in the French Revolutions (1789-99, 1848-51, 1870-71), Iran (1977-81) and Bolshevik (1917-1924)|This paper work assesses the key aspects of a framework for research on revolutions. Our approach includes a heuristic based on an idea suggested by Marx in the 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte: “The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living”. From this maxim of Marx advance on conventional interpretations by postulating that the language and metaphors are a challenge in several respects: (1) The brain is a physical basis for understanding key political revolutions, (2) advances in neuroscience and language (Lakoff/Johnson/Narayanan) have allowed the reconstruction of conceptual frameworks in various fields, including philosophy, mathematics and politics (3) The language expressed in songs, text, flags, emblems, illustrations, slogans, speeches and rumors is key to represent and demonstrate loyalty to the idea of revolution and, more crucially, to “make” the revolution, (4) Metaphors are a powerful rational action in revolutionary processes. One interpretation of these can contribute to decipher, for example, how the brain are activated in neural systems that link past and present, how to operate the symbolic frameworks of language to influence political opinion, how metaphors interact with processes artificial simulation or how metaphors evolve in a revolution from simple metaphors.
A19|The economic and environmental factors of water in arid regions: Study of the rural water use in Northern Darfur Region, Sudan|We develop hypothetical policy scenarios in this part of the paper which are simulated using a product-by-industry economic-ecological model to investigate their impacts on water and other ecological commodities. Results are expected to contribute to the establishment of alternative policy options for water resources management and sustainable economic development in the area. The impact of economic development on the environment is now a global issue and cannot be ignored. However, the extent of these impacts at local and regional levels in less developed countries (LDCs) is not fully understood. Unlike the rich industrialized countries where development is large-scale and the impacts associated with immense consumption of fossil fuels are basically in the form of environmental pollution, development in the LDCs is rather at a small-scale and the nature of impacts is often in the form of severe resource depletion (World Bank, 1992; Lesser, et al., 1997). Therefore, the challenge of sustainable development in these poor countries is an urgent matter of concern (WRI, 1992). This concern can be investigated from two perspectives, economic development and environmental degradation.
A19|Impacts of Tribal and Economic Factors on Civil Conflict between North and South Sudan|The crisis of Greater Darfur Region of Sudan extends to other regions as the South Sudan prepares for secession next July 2011. In the past eight years Sudan's crisis in Darfur was amplified by global news media all over the world. Civil conflict erupted, developed into armed rebellions and open uncontrolled war that enveloped the whole region. The current inflamed undecided and unmarked future borders between the south and north are also facing growing tensions. In this current paper we present some information on what we see as the seeds of conflicts with complicated tribal structures in both sides and expected disputes on land, borders and resources.
A19|Economics and Hegemony; Globalization and International Trade Agreements|This paper examines the concept of hegemony and its historical impacts on the Arabic and Islamic countries. It is foreseen that has long path applied by the Western countries as disclosed by trade applications and history of economic thought. Impacts on Arabic and Islamic countries were visible in terms of trade, balances and persistent debts. A strong tool is evident with the called for integration, interdependence and the generated dependency syndrome. The establishment of that mechanism depends on a theory which we present as the Hegemonic Stability. The Arabic and Islamic countries did not succeed to form their effective economic blocks in order to counter such hegemonic effects because of their internal political structure which affect the structure of their international trade and economic benefits.

A19|The Merits of Using Citation-Based Journal Weighting Schemes to Measure Research Performance in Economics: The Case of New Zealand|In this study we test various citation-based journal weighting schemes, especially those based on the Liebowitz and Palmer methodology, as to their suitability for use in a nation- wide research funding model. Using data generated by New Zealand’s academic economists, we compare the performance of departments, and individuals, under each of our selected schemes; and we then proceed to contrast these results with those generated by direct citation counts. Our findings suggest that if all citations are deemed to be of equal value, then schemes based on the Liebowitz and Palmer methodology yield problematic outcomes. We also demonstrate that even between weighting schemes based on a common methodology, major differences are found to exist in departmental and individual outcomes.
A19|Institutional aspects of economic integration – economic integration and political integration|Economic integration is defined as the elimination of economic borders between two or more savings. In turn, an economic border demarcation over which any actual or potential mobility of goods, services and factors of production and communication flows, is relatively low. On both sides of a frontier economy, pricing and quality of goods, services and factors are only marginally influenced by flows across borders.
A19|GMM estimation of spatial panels|We consider Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation of a regression model with spatially correlated errors.

A19|An Analysis of Remuneration, Employment & VRS at Executive level in CPSEs|This project attempts to discuss the remuneration,employment and VRS in the CPSEs especially at the executive level. This has been discussed in details in different chapters. In the first chapter, the theoretical aspect of the CPSE & their employment, remuneration and VRS policy have been discussed. In the second chapter, the remuneration policies for executives of the CPSEs have been discussed.For this, the recommendations of the first and second Pay Revision Committee (basis of determining remuneration for executives of the CPSEs) have been discussed along with some suggestions for a better implementation. In the third chapter, the employment trend including recruitment and retirement trend of the executive have been analyzed both aggregate and sector wise. During the analysis, some observations were made which have been discussed. In the fourth chapter, an analysis has been done regarding VRS in the CPSEs at the executive level. By using regression line, a relationship between the surplus manpower and VRS have been found which have been also discussed in detail. In the fifth chapter, the relationship between the remuneration policy of the CPSEs & the employment and VRS trend have been analyzed by dividing the CPSEs into Navratnas and Miniratnas & Non-Navratnas and Non-Miniratnas. In the sixth chapter, the future impact of the implementation of 2007 pay revision on the employment of the executives has been discussed especially in the context of the recent slowdown. Finally the conclusion of the whole analysis has been summarized upon in the last chapter.
A19|Understanding the Cyprus problem: a small chess piece on a huge board|The island of Cyprus, the third largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, has witnessed an intermittently-bloody conflict since the latter part of the twentieth century. This island has over the past fifty years turned into a battle ground between the Greek and Turkish ethnic groups. Consequently, hundreds have died and thousands have become refugees and despite various efforts by third-parties, no solution has been achieved to date. This paper examines both the external and internal history of Cyprus and argues that Cyprus has a history of being utilized as a pawn on a larger European chess board and that the present stalemate of Turkey-EU relations has more to do with internal EU politics than with the Cyprus per se.
A19|Unravelling Downsizing – What do we know about the Phenomenon?|This downsizing article represents a succinct review of the scholarly work of researchers studying the multifaceted downsizing phenomenon over the past 30 years. Since Cascio’s (1993) article “Downsizing: What do we know? What have we learned?”, the research has burgeoned across several countries. This paper examines what we have learned during the many years of scholarly enquiry. As such, the article is based upon an analysis of the downsizing literature and represents a summation of secondary sources. The research also provides an update on the latest downsizing developments.
A19|The Excellence in Research for Australia Scheme: An Evaluation of the Draft Journal Weights for Economics|In February 2008, the Australian Government announced its intention to develop a new quality and evaluation system for research conducted at the nation’s universities. Although the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) scheme will utilize several measures to evaluate institutional performance, we have chosen to focus on one element only: the assessment of refereed journal article output based on ERA’s own journal weighting scheme. The ERA weighting scheme will undoubtedly shape the reward structure facing university administrators and individual academics. Our objective is to explore the nature of the ERA weighting scheme for economics, and to demonstrate how it impacts on departmental and individual researcher rankings relative to rankings generated by alternative schemes employed in the economics literature. In order to do so, we utilise data from New Zealand’s economics departments and the draft set of journal weights (DERA) released in August 2008 by ERA officials. Given the similarities between Australia and New Zealand, our findings should have relevance to the Australian scene. As a result, we hope to provide the reader with a better understanding of the type of research activity that influences DERA rankings at both the departmental and individual level.

A19|A Note on the High Stability of Happiness: The Minimal Effects of a Nuclear Catastrophe on Life Satisfaction|Using life satisfaction as a direct measure of individual utility has become popular in the empirical economic literature. In this context, it is crucial to know what circumstances or changes the measure is sensitive to. Is life satisfaction a volatile concept that is affected by minor changes in life circumstances? Or is it a reliable measure of personal happiness? This paper will analyze the impact of a catastrophe, namely the nuclear catastrophe of Chernobyl, on life satisfaction. I use longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study and especially information collected on a monthly basis which allows the researcher to study calendar effects. The following clear-cut results are found. While concern about the environment rose immediately after the nuclear incident, life satisfaction changed little. This suggests that although people were aware of the severity of the catastrophe, they did not feel that their individual well-being had been affected. This finding is highly relevant to the life satisfaction literature as it shows that the life satisfaction measure is very stable and robust against societal and global events. It is shown to predominantly reflect personal life circumstances like health, employment, income, and the family situation and this relationship is apparently not disturbed by global events. Thus, my results reinforce previous findings on the relationship between life satisfaction and individual life characteristics as the stability of their outcome measure is approved.

A19|From practice-based knowledge to the practice of research : Revisiting constructivist research works on Knowledge|Research studies within organizational knowledge are good examples for both analyzing and illustrating the debate regarding a paradigm shift in management. Most articles in the field focus on knowledge complexity and its socially constructed side. Researchers have noted a great deal of similarity between this socially constructed nature and the shaping elements of constructivism. They argue for a paradigm shift, rejecting positivism. To more fully understand this paradigm shift, and to address the number of methodological questions it raises, we carried out a content analysis on a sample of the main articles dealing with organizational knowledge. Our research points out that the principles of constructivism are difficult to adhere to within research design. It underlines the lack of specific methodological devices and lack of adaptation with the epistemological system of reference. This study highlights the methodological perspectives that underpin constructivist research in organizational knowledge.
A19|Common Agricultural Policy Reform. Perceptions and Opinions – A Case Study|After one decade of structural, legislative and institutional reforms, of economic and social restructuring for accession preparation, the Romanian agricultural sector has to face again a significantly changed situation in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy future Health Check. This paper catches the perceptions and opinions of the Romanian specialists regarding this subject. A survey was implemented in the period 12–18 November 2007. Most of the specialists’ opinions and perceptions who answered the survey questionnaire converge to the idea that Romania does not have its own agricultural policy and the undertaken actions are circumscribed to and almost fully dependent on CAP. The suggestions made are in the direction of adopting an agrarian and rural development policy where the CAP–related objectives are only a part of it. The difficulty resides in the fact that the problems of the Romanian agriculture and rural area are so many and deep.
A19|E-business Development Key Areas|At present e-business is standard alternative and its development is very fast. E-commerce is subset of e-business. E-commerce is implementation of the business transactions on the internet (internet stores, booking system, and so on). E-business and e-commerce have directly dependence on information and communication technology (ICT). Many conditions have to be satisfied to e-business systems operate all right and bring contribution. The fundamental element is e-business strategy. Aims, procedures, methods, inputs, outputs and the like have to be analyzed in e-business strategy. Individual parts may be under consideration and analyzed in singles steps or in parallel with regards to contexture. Once of the e-commerce key area is internet stores development. Internet stores are realized as a web sites published on internet. Web sites make possible communication between custom and operators information system. Internet store web sites have to fulfil the quite of number of conditions. Principal aim of the internet store web sites is effort to internet store web sites be displayed in one of the forefront in internet browser after request of user. To this goal for example Search Engine Optimization (SEO) or method of paid references can be used. Both methods are very important for internet marketing and they also can be used together. Data from internet store web sites are computing in firm information system. On this account we have to directly defined dataflow between internet store websites and information system. We can buy software for e-business support from provider or new software can be developed. In both cases we have to pay attention to risk areas. Conditions of successful implementation of e-business in firm are in the end of the article.
A19|The myth of Bryson and economic thought in Islam|The inspiration for the present note comes primarily from a statement in the old edition of the Encyclopaedia of Islam. In its volume four on page number 595, Heffening (1934) states that to Helmut Ritter ‘the whole economic literature of Islam can be traced to economics of Neo-pythagorean Bryson’ (emphasis added). In 1917 the German writer Ritter edited and translated Abu Ja`far al-Dimashqi’s treatise Kitab al-Isharah ila Mahasin al-Tijarah. In his introduction of the book he noted the said remark. It is this unqualified statement that we dispute here.

A19|Identifying the Most Research Intensive Faculties of Business in Australia: A Multidimensional Approach|There is a growing policy focus in Australian higher education on quantitative research performance assessment. However, most of the analysis has addressed aggregate performance at the institutional level, an approach inconsistent with recent policy emphasis on diversity among universities, and one that ignores performance variations across disciplines. Using averaged and all available data for 2000-2004, cluster analysis is used to classify Australian Commerce Faculties into groups that exhibit similar research performance, measured by publication, PhD completion and secured competitive research grant funding. We also use factor analysis to generate full-multidimensional rankings within the resulting two or three clusters. It is found that in terms of total research output, with the exception of Adelaide all the Go8 members plus UTS and Griffith always belong to “Clusters A”. However, when research performance is expressed in per academic staff terms, an additional eleven universities join this same cluster. Our results additionally show that eight Australian faculties of Commerce not only possess low total research output but their per capita performance is also poor.

În aceşti ultimi ani s-au făcut progrese odată cu reglementarea riscurilor pentru care acest capitol propune un inventar. În afară de aceasta, riscurile şi performanţele sunt indisolubil legate. Pentru performanţe, măsurile contabile clasice constituie o referinţă de bază. Dar ele nu sunt totdeauna adaptate. Măsurile de performanţe, ca valori de piaţă, sunt complementare şi adaptarea, conform riscurilor, este o grijă constantă. Definirea riscurilor şi performanţelor este un demers clasic, dar important, căci ea constituie punctul de plecare al gestionării riscurilor. Acestă lucrare evidenţiază, într-o manieră critică, definiţiile obişnuite în materie de riscuri şi prezintă definiţiile pe care le considerăm de bază. El este organizat în patru părţi. Prima reaminteşte marile etape ale evoluţiei riscurilor în lumea bancară şi financiară, pentru a ajunge la situaţia de astăzi unde necesitatea de a măsura diferitele riscuri şi de a le controla a devenit o evidenţă. A doua parte propune un inventar comentat al diferitelor noţiuni de risc. A treia parte descrie cadrul măsurării riscurilor şi performanţelor. O ultimă parte este consacrată măsurării performanţelor ca valori de piaţă.
A19|Research Output in New Zealand Economics Department 2000-2006|This paper considers the research productivity of New Zealand based economics departments over the period 2000 to 2006. It examines journal based research output across departments and individuals using six output measures. We show that Otago and Canterbury performed consistently well over the period, with Otago generally the highest ranked department. The measures used place different emphasis on ‘quality’ versus ‘quantity’. Which measure is used has a significant influence on the rankings of Auckland, Victoria and Waikato. The controversy surrounding the inclusion of ‘visitors’ and the influence of research stars is considered. Rankings of the leading individual researchers are provided.
A19|The Slowdown In First‐Response Times Of Economics Journals: Can It Be Beneficial?|The first‐response time (henceforth FRT) of economics journals has increased over the last four decades from 2 months to 3–6 months. The optimal FRT, however, is not zero because a longer FRT deters submissions of mediocre papers to good journals and consequently saves valuable time of referees and editors. Interestingly, the change in the actual FRT is in the same direction as the change in the optimal FRT. The latter has increased because of the availability of research on the Internet prior to publication and because papers became longer and more mathematical, increasing the costs of refereeing a paper. (JEL L82, A10, A14, I23, A19)
A19|Rationalizing the Irrational. The Principle of Relative Maximization from Sociobiology to Economics and Its Implications for Ethics|Starting with the concept of “rational maximizing individual”, a meta-construct with foundational value in economics and, in general, in human sciences, the paper delineates the territory of an ethics of rationality. It does this by taking fulcrum in findings from evolutionary theory, in particular those regarding spiteful behavior. The paper formulates the principle of “differential fitness maximization”, as expression of relative maximization of fitness and derives its consequences, among which, a core set of normative propositions grounding the said ethics. Thus, the paper strengthens the backbone of the Western philosophical tradition which, in essence, always associated ethical conduct with reason and individualism.
A19|Overview of Potential Problematic Fields and Experience With Respect to Implementation of E-Learning in a Company and School Environment in the Czech Republic|E-learning has become a significant supportive cornerstone of the educational process at universities and in companies, where it is applied as supplementary education of the staff. At the Silesian University in Opava, School of Business Administration in Karvina, under completion of grant projects e-learning study of number of bachelor study programs received an accreditation. E-learning is applied for training in the business sector in the Czech Republic as well as in different countries. Both at universities and in companies there exist specific solutions of effective implementation of the individual e-learning systems depending on a myriad of factors derived from differences in the individual environments. The articles provides an overview of potential problematic areas, which may occur in implementation of e-learning and it is in the Czech Republic where these problematic situations have been tackled. The purpose of the article is to list basic problematic areas, each of which deserves a separate article and a detailed analysis.
A19|Economic Revolution Of This Century|I have developed a new financial instrument which will be much more valuable than the bonds or the treasury bills government sells in the open market to raise much needed funds to run the country. These are all interest based instruments and can only be used by institutions. The instrument I am proposing is without interest and will be used by everybody to purchased goods and services in the government and private sector resulting in up to 60% discounts .This is why these will be massively bought up front in large amounts in the shortest period of time of one month to run the country for at least a year and much more by the end of the year. INTRODUCTION: The world is facing many challenges with no solution in sight. The main cause of all these ills is the POVERTY. Float bonds which can be used by everybody rich or poor and are not debt to the state so there is no question of interest. How: Take the example of USA which is going through a great recession. USA borrows money by selling treasury bills and the interest based bonds. The suggestion is to sell these bonds on non interest basis EXAMPLE: ONE dollar buys 5 bonds on the condition that the amount should be $100000 or multiple of it. Fewer amounts will get the rate of four and three. This discount massive period is only for first month at the start of the implementation of this system. In the second month the rate will be 4 but the rate of 3 will apply to subsequent months for the same amount WHERE THESE BONDS WILL BE USED? 1. All state controlled services and commodities. EXAMPLE: A bill of (any service or Commodity) $100 can be paid with 200 bonds and there will be no exception to this rule .A NET DISCOUNT OF 60 %. A simple formula will apply: Total bill in dollars x2 is the number of bonds surrendered. Price in bonds will not be less than the cost price but without the direct indirect taxes and the duties which are added to the present to make it very expensive. It will attract at least 50 million people to take this opportunity as early as possible. And if one is sure of making 100% profit within 30 days there will be many more that will help themselves. RESULT - Government gets at least $15 trillion within a very short period of time of few days and much more in the rest of the year .THIS IS NOT A DEBT AS STATE HAS SOLD BONDS( Commodity) WHICH IS AN ALTERNATE CURRENCY AND DO NOT CARRY ANY INTEREST. One immediately thinks who will join this club bear the loss and this loss to the state will not be more than total year budget of $2.5 trillion which it collects in one year with all the taxes and the duties but the bond price is simply a cost price without any kind of tax or duty. So there is a net gain of approximately 2.5 trillion within a short period of time. WHO WILL SELL THESE BONDS? State will float tenders to will select a private agency (USMF) UNITED STATES MONITORY FUND JUST A NAME GIVEN TO THIS ORGANIZATION with the lowest bid WHERE AS second third and forth bidders will be auditors of USMF. This agency will employ at least 20 million unemployed on 10% commission basis and without any salary. These agents will have to pay $500 as an annual fee to USMF in order to build the infrastructure for the sale of bonds. Agents quota Will be $300000 per month or they will be allowed to sell their whole year quota in one day or in a month, This will only materialize if the agent shares his commission with the would be buyer. Greater the share of commission quicker the sale. This investor or a buyer will sell these bonds at the same rate of 5 per dollar and his bonds will sell like hot cakes every day as there is no condition of the amount of money to purchase of bonds. In this way even the poorest person will get the same rate or near the same rate as the investor except for the commission which he takes from the agent who makes almost 100% profit by only investing $100000 .He will sell these bonds repeatedly and will keep at least 6% profit every day till the demand lasts. NOW THINK HOW MUCH STATE HAS ACCUMULATED Much more than few years budget in matter of only one month.
A19|Rechtliche und tatsächliche Bekämpfungsansätze gegen Geldwäsche<BR>[Legal and factual approaches to solving money laundering]|The present work deals with the basic idea of investigation against unfairly acquired wealth. It represents the view of the police in financial investigation and money laundering. The view of dark financial investment is enormous. The potential for capital recovery is immense. The observation and control of capital flow in part and full organized crime requires qualified resources, but is regularly self-financing. In addition to the previous introduction, especially legal process routes, become the first managerial approaches were examined. By simple probability economic models, but also basic considerations of economics indicators, to the calculation of a successful division, the reader can learn by examples, the possibilities and potential of the business under the Financial Intelligence.
A19|Disciplinary Analysis of the Contribution of Academic Staff to PhD Completions in Australian Universities|This paper identifies the major areas of research strengths and concentration across all Australian universities, as demonstrated by the number of PhDs and academic staff members (S) in ten broad fields of education using the average audited data (2001-2003). The ratio of PhD completions to S is then presented to provide a tentative basis for benchmarking and productivity analysis. Inter alia, we found a very interesting relationship between the number of PhD graduates (as the dependent variable) and S using a fixed-effect model with both discipline-specific slope and intercept coefficients. The results provide policy implications for individual universities and government.

A19|Генезис Цивитальной Организации: Идеология Нового Мира<BR>[Genesis of the social organisation: ideology of the new world]|The monography considers laws and mechanisms of social development from positions of positivism, dialectic materialism and the theory of systems. The methodology of the author is based on causality in relations of a society and social institutes. Social development is considered as result of opposition of a society and the social systems. The author offers new methodology of the analysis of social processes in the conditions of crisis of traditional social philosophy.
A19|Assessing the Research Performance of Australian Universities|This paper identifies new classifications of Australian universities based on their total and per-academic staff research outputs using the data for the period 1998-2002. We define research performance in terms of audited numbers of PhD completions, publications and grants (in accordance with rules established by the Department of Education, Science and Training). Our analysis indicates that (a) the highest achievers consists of the seven Group of Eight (Go8) universities; (b) the top-three research performers are the Universities of Melbourne, Sydney and Queensland in terms of total research performance and the Universities of Melbourne, Adelaide and Western Australia in per academic staff terms.
A19|Tribal Economies in Assam: A Study of Northeastern India|The tribes and tribal economies have variously been represented in the northeastern region as remote, paddy producing, and land scarce settlements where the populations use the community land and collective labour in order to practice the shifting cultivation. These economies do occasionally utilize the trans-Himalayan trade and commercial network to siphon off and mobilize the agricultural surplus. The reciprocity and redistribution institutions otherwise do function to fulfill the needs of the tribal settlement and population. The state is treated among the tribes as exploitative agency and virtually an outsider entity. These tribal economic arrangements are however, recently posited to be transforming into the peasant economies to budding agrarian capitalist frameworks. The emergence of tribal elites, de-peasantized population, sedentary agriculture and wage labor market are identified as indictors of changes and transition. The predicament is however the cavalier approaches towards the theoretical and conceptual schema in analyzing the transitions and transformations on the part of the regional social science scholars and academics. There is an added problem of the shortage of empirical data to support the thesis of mode of production transition in the region.
A19|Gender disparities in education - needs community participation|Education is the most important instrument for human resource development. Education of girls therefore, occupies top priority amongst various measures taken to improve the status of the girl child. The government has resolved to make the right to free and compulsory elementary education a Fundamental Right and to enforce it through suitable statutory measures. Universalisation of Elementary Education (UEE) has been accepted as a national goal since 1950. In order to achieve the goal, concerted efforts have been made and as a result, the elementary education system in India has become one of the largest in the world. The primary education enrolment rates of girls have a positive impact on economic well-being of women, their families and society in the long run. Since the mother carries the main burden of looking after the health of her child, how well she does this task depends on the knowledge and confidence that she gains from education.
A19|L'impact du Printemps arabe sur les transferts de fonds des migrants tunisiens|Le phÃ©nomÃ¨ne migratoire suscite un dÃ©bat passionnÃ© au sein de la classe politique, comme dans la communautÃ© scientifique, aussi bien dans les pays d'accueil, que dans les pays d'origine. Sans doute ceci est-il dÃ» au fait qu'il touche Ã plusieurs aspects : humains, Ã©conomiques, sociaux ou financiers (Makhlouf, 2013). La question de la contribution des populations immigrÃ©es Ã l'Ã©conomie des pays d'accueil gagne en audience dans le dÃ©bat public des pays concernÃ©s. Dans la littÃ©rature Ã©galement, les Ã©tudes sont nombreuses sur les dÃ©terminants des transferts de fonds et leur impact sur l'Ã©conomie des pays d'origine. L'infl uence des facteurs internes au pays d'origine sur les transferts de fonds des migrants continue de susciter la curiositÃ©. En effet, dÃ©terminer l'effet d'Ã©vÃ©nements politiques ou sociaux majeurs dans leur pays d'origine sur les migrants n'est pas chose aisÃ©e. Si l'on peut postuler que les migrants sont sensibles Ã un choc survenu dans leur pays d'origine, par exemple le Printemps arabe, il est plus difficile d'en conclure que cette empathie les conduit inÃ©luctablement Ã modifier leur comportement en matiÃ¨re de transfert de fond.
A19|Attendance and Exam Performance at University|Marburger (2006) explored the link between absenteeism and exam performance by assessing the impact on absenteeism of removing a university wide policy of mandatory attendance for a single class. His results indicate that while an attendance policy has a strong impact on reducing absenteeism the link between absenteeism and exam performance is weak.This paper presents an alternative exploration into the link between absenteeism and exam performance by assessing the impact of implementing a module-specific attendance policy. Our results suggest the link between absenteeism and exam performance is strong, and that student-specific factors are important, including revision strategies and peer group effects. These results question the uniformity of the relationship between attendance and exam performance.
A19|Biology & Political Science. Foundational Issues of Political Biology|"In their classic formulations, valid to this day, the issue of self-preservation is foundational for both political science and economics. In order to fixate this concept, the Modern theorists relied upon various assumptions about human nature. Due to the advances of biology and evolutionary theory, we are today in the position of explicating these assumptions in the form of stable scientific certainties. A foundational concept in biological theory is that of ""fitness"". The paper indicates the relationship between the less determined concept of self-preservation and the more rigorous one of fitness. By that, it accomplishes two things: it gives more solidity to the foundation of political theory and political economy, by anchoring them in biology; it opens the path towards a unification between two social sciences and their immediate juxtaposed science, biology. The emphasis of the paper is on political science, aiming to define, on the basis of the above argument, its proper object of study. The notion of fitness extraction is thus defined. A lateral exposition differentiates between political action, thus understood, and economic action, defined more generally as fitness transfer. The distinction is to be eventually furthered in a separate study."
A19|German Social Democratic Economic Politics in the Light of Agenda Theory|German Social Democracy is facing tremendous challenges of societal and economic changes: party dealignment, a bourgeoisification of society, the rise of media democracy, and economic and cultural globalisation. The party's reaction - a third order change in its ideological objectives and a respective adjustment in its short term policy programme as the leading governing party in the redgreen coalition (AGENDA 2010) - is being investigated under the conditions of bounded rationality of voters and against the background of an unprecedented loss in acceptance by the electorate as well as the ordinary party member.
A19|Hacia la Seguridad Alimentaria y Nutricional en Mesoamérica. Estado de la Inseguridad Alimentaria y Nutricional y notas sobre políticas para su superación<BR>[To Food and Nutritional Security in Mesoamerica. Situation of the Food and Nutritional Insecurity and some notes about Policies to their Elimination]|In this document we may find the main characteristics about the food security situation in the Mesoamerican countries. The insufficient nourishment and nutrition, as well the poverty condition that involve an important proportion of the Central American and Mexican population, produce and human and social hardship frame, with and special emphasis in the rural areas of these countries. In addition to the risks that this situation represents to the persons, families and communities living in these conditions, the general circumstances increase the vulnerability in relation with the social, political and economical stability of these nations. This is a clear obstacle to their growth economic processes and to the more prompt integration in the international economy development. Primarily, when the inclusion of the population in the development process, the distributive policies and the social cohesion are crucial components of the socioeconomic and political model adopted by the countries where these situation prevail.
A19|The three dimensions of a communitarian institution. The Open Source Software Community Case|The analysis of the empirical studies relative to the Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) case highlights the necessity to enlarge the set of categories used to describe developers incentives. In particular, the evidences stress the important role played by another category of incentives, broadly and roughly defined as psychological and social motivations. However, the theories elaborated to cope with this dimension, such as ift economy,epistemic community or community of practice, are not combined into a unique structured framework. Each one of them, in fact, is focused on particular features of the FLOSS model, so that the FLOSS community itself is often described as ahybrid institution, obtained combining different perspectives. However, it is possible construct a mechanism here called reflexive identity able to bridge the analyzed theories and to explain the empirical evidences left aside by self-supply, reputation and signaling. The reflexive identity mechanism develops through the nexus of ties connecting the community members. In order to cooperate, members have to negotiate the system of meanings they use to interface with the world and with the communitarian environment. But this means reshaping also their own vision of the world, redefining their values and thus their identity. The space opened by the negotiation, then, is the space where community aims, principles and ethos act directly on membersidentity, making them internalize the communitarian structure of rules. The reflexive identity principle, then, merges the psychological and social dimension of the FLOSS phenomenon with the structure of rules adopted by the FLOSS community, and thus it constitutes together with self-supply, signaling, reputation and peer regard the basis upon which the FLOSS community is built.
A19|The Review Process in Economics: Is It Too Fast?|Rewards for publications in good economics journals are very high, and submission fees and other monetary costs associated with submitting an existing manuscript are low. Consequently, the editorial delay (especially the first-response time—the time until the first editorial decision), by postponing monetary rewards to publication, constitutes the major submission cost (from the author's perspective). Reducing the delay will induce many additional submissions of low-quality papers to good journals, increasing significantly the workload of editors and referees. Moreover, the rejection rate will increase and cause papers to be rejected more times before publication, offsetting at least some of the shorter first-response times. As a result, the efforts of many editors to reduce the editorial delay, although attracting more submissions to their journals, may have adverse effects from a social perspective, and the optimal delay might be longer than the current average of four months.
A19|Ranking of Australian Economics Departments Based on Their Total and Per Academic Staff Research Output|"This study uses cluster analysis to classify twenty-seven Australian economics teaching departments into groups that have similar quantities of research output, measured by two different publication counts, and similar quality of research output, measured by a citation count. Three distinct groups of departments are identified and factor analysis is used to rank the groups. Whether research output is measured in total or on a per staff basis, Melbourne is in the group that ranks first, the remaining members of the ""group of eight"" are in one or other of the top two groups, and at least fifteen other departments are always in the third-ranked group."
A19|Ranking and Clustering Australian University Research Performance, 1998-2002|"This paper clusters and ranks the research performance of thirty-seven Australian universities over the period 1998-2002. Research performance is measured according to audited numbers of PhD completions, publications and grants (in accordance with rules established by the Department of Education, Science and Training) and analysed in both total and per academic staff terms. Hierarchical cluster analysis supports a binary division between fifteen higher and twenty-two lower-performing universities, with the specification in per academic staff terms identifying the self-designated research intensive ""Group of Eight"" (Go8) universities, plus several others in the better-performing group. Factor analysis indicates that the top-three research performers are the Universities of Melbourne, Sydney and Queensland in terms of total research performance and the Universities of Melbourne, Adelaide and Western Australia in per academic staff terms."
A19|The Distribution of Research Performance Across Australian Universities, 1992-2003, and Its Implications for Higher Education Funding Models|"We contribute to the debate on research performance by comparing the distribution of research inputs and outputs across Australian universities during 1992-2003. We have calculated annual Gini coefficients for various performance measures and Lorenz curves for the final year of the study. Various findings are evident. Research-input measures have remained relatively unevenly distributed across universities. Output measures were more evenly distributed and this exhibited a gradual and rather consistent decline through time, supporting the view that the research output is being generated gradually more equally across Australia’s universities. Excluding the ""Group of Eight"" (Go8) universities, results in a more even distribution of performance. However, in 2003 this group took the lion’s share of research inputs but produced a smaller share of outputs. Our findings are relevant to current funding policy discussion."
A19|E.U. and “Made Eastern Europe Reform”: from old perestroika (restructuring) to new European (construction)|For European Union and Eastern Europe, the immediate legacy of the Cold War was the decisive torn-parts of the world history, because the dangerous „ myth of the red cell” and the Soviet collapse in 1989 announced the new foreign policy of East. This analysis searches to be a key instrument for E.U. - Central and Eastern European countries political approach and economic adjustment. For the West, the communist system’s failure was evident and emphasis a new aspect for the East relations. In particular, this new Central and East reality concerns three concentric circles: The first circle: Initially skeptical because of past experience, Eastern European transition announced a rethinking of national interests. After 1990, this „made Eastern Europe reform” potentially more dangerous that other predecessor, saves the East from the dangers of its own traditionally thinking. E.U policy- makers call it „the bad side of freedom”: perestroika (restructuring) turned into katarastroika, a neologism that was heard more and more on Moscow’s streets as reform program faltered and then failed. The second circle: From the national economic reality … For E.U., the freedom’s advantage, its flexibility and tolerance for change, does not ensure that the recovery will be long and satisfying. It may-or not…Jobs might be lost to cheap imports from China or from West, because the reform cycle creates some anomalies-jobs, for instance. In this period, the severity pressures coming from communitarian programs, the new economy, the rising living standards and class distinction become rigid. The nearly ten years of market reforms have failed to transform agriculture and industry, and the devaluation of the national currency has made imports of food and goods much more expensive, further straining budgets. The third circle: ... to E.U. technical and financial assistance: For E.U. that was the moment to promote and develop a private sector in each Eastern country: this plan was designed as a framework for a communitarian action: the operation PHARE, the support for transition to open market reforms coming from Bank for Reconstruction and Development, because, after 1990, this „made Eastern Europe reform” potentially more dangerous that other predecessor, is the major opportunity to save the East from the dangers of its own traditionally socialist thinking. The E.U. needs to ensure that the costs of economic change to the new economy posture do not overwhelm the benefits, to carrefully think and calculate the reform programs, in all their dimensions, because, each strategic period shares a political responsability from E.U. communitarian major assistance has to adapt to each economy and has to emphasis new previsions for european integration. „European agreements” create a new dimension for communitarian commercial and economic support, because East faced major challenges preventing hyperinflation, productivity, the severity of competitive pressures causing companies to keep reducing employment even after modest economic growth resumed in late 2000, the privatization and, for Russia, obtaining a better price for oil exports. This analysis agrees the significance of Eastern economic transition, predicting that it was about to become a „system change” and that their crisis completes the image of the „regional crisis of Eastern”. The combination of politics, external influences, inefficiencies and system’s corruption could force the self-destruction of reform programs. While emphasising the importance of reform, this analysis also examines E.U. political strategies to push the reform process forward in different countries. E.U has to face East challenges: one of the most important factors missing from the Eastern reform program is a widespread knowledge of capitalism, new social classes, etc. For East, its new transition goal was to reach a consensus on E.U. policy reform goal.
A19|Komparace tematické struktury časopiseckých publikací českých a evropských ekonomů (1999 - 2002)<BR>[Comparison of the thematic structure of journal articles by czech and european economists]|The paper deals with the thematic structure of journal articles according to the Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) classification system. For this purpose, three representative periodicals from 1999 to 2002 are analysed by examining the publications by Czech and European economists. The research methodology is as follows. First, the institutional affiliation of the journals´ contributors is identified by examining the information provided by the authors in their articles. Second, the JEL classification stated in the journals is investigated with respect to co-authorship issues and the relative significance of the multiple JEL codes. The results indicate that when compared to the rest of Europe, Czech economists prefer macroeconomic problems to the microeconomic ones and have a strong bias for the methodology and history of economic thought, as well as for the mathematical and quantitative methods. On the other hand, Czech researchers exhibit a markedly lower interest in labour and demographic economics.
A19|Growth and Poverty Reduction Does Political Regime Matter?|This essay explores the relationship between political regime and critical economic outcomes such as economic growth and poverty reduction. The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 makes a brief review of the economic performance of developing Asian economies over the last four decades. As these economies have varied significantly in terms of economic outcomes as well as their political complexions, a simple juxtaposition of the two would suggest a link between political regimes and economic outcomes. Given this apparent association between political regimes and economic outcomes, this section argues that the superior economic performance (in terms of economic growth and poverty reduction) of the authoritarian or semi-authoritarian East Asian economies, compared to their democratic counterparts, can be attributed to their underlying differences in the process of policy making, in the nature of the bureaucracy, and in the type of economic governance. Sections 3 through 5 provide further elaboration on this. The paper ends in Section 6, which offers some concluding remarks.
A19|Foundations of Economic Science|The book presents a new paradigm of economic science as a science of exchange. It introduces a new analytical tool called consistency analysis to unify the entire body of economic theory, covering micro, macro, trade, money, development and demography. It uses a new wider and deeper concept of consistent choice to overcome the limits of rational choice. It incorporates entrepreneurship and transaction costs in a theory of intermediation, and stands on institutional rules to provide predictable regularity of social action of exchange. It shows transfer of value as the necessary function of money under indirect trade, and explains the equilibrium relation between output and money.
A19|The Evaluation Of The Economic Research Works. A Relevance Indicator|Many works dealing with the transition to the market economy in both the world and national literature has formed the area of concern of many Romanian researchers over the period 1990 – 2003. This working paper is dealing with scientometrics and the scientific evaluation of the theoretical works in the economic research field. The paper reviews the national economic academic publications, specialized publications and newspapers including important economic pages, describes the citation analysis method and makes an attempt to set a relevance indicator of the national works in our research field. The indicator (in absolute and relative form) is based on the method of giving marks to the publications in which the study appears and includes a multiplier (internationality coefficient) for calculating compound scores.
A19|Rejections and the Importance of First Response Times (Or: How Many Rejections Do Others Receive?)|Previous studies about the academic publishing process consider the publication delay as starting from the submission to the publishing journal. This ignores the potential delay caused by rejections received from previous journals. Knowing how many times papers are submitted prior to publication is essential for evaluating the importance of different publication delays and the refereeing process cost, and can improve our decisions about if and how the review process should be altered, decisions that affect the productivity of economists and other scholars. Using numerical analysis and evidence on acceptance rates of various journals, I estimate that most manuscripts are submitted between three and six times prior to publication. This implies that the first response time (the time between submission and first editorial decision) is much more important than other parts of the publication delay, suggesting important policy implications for editors and referees.
A19|ROUND TABLE DISCUSSION “CHALLENGES TO ECONOMIC THOUGH IN THE NEW CENTURY”: Outlook on the Development of Economic Science in Bulgaria|The development of economic science before 1989 has been analysed. The spectrum of research works between 1948 and 1989 has been outlined, including the influence of Western theories. The change of paradigms after 1990 has been underlined; as well as new institutional structures; overcoming the international isolation of the Bulgarian economic thought. The main thematic and theoretic and methodological issues of the economic thought have been pointed out, as well as opinions and academic debates on its further development.
A19|Economics – Bulgaria|This paper outlines the overall picture of the state of economic science in Bulgaria in the early 21st century, achieved as a result of changes in it since 1989. The analysis is carried out in five main areas - redefining the discipline, basic theoretical and methodological orientations, thematic orientation and funding, public space and academic debates and views on further development. The situation before 1989 is briefly presented, in order to understand more clearly the problems and processes of development. The main conclusion is that the economics of Bulgaria made sufficiently serious and profound changes in the subject matter and methodology of research and training in connection with the world, including especially European economic science, which is a good prerequisite for the successful integration of Bulgarian economists in the single European Research Area.
A19|The State of Economics in Bulgaria|The paper outlines the contemporary state of the economic science in Bulgaria, acquired as a result of the changes over the last 12 years. The analysis is carried out in five major directions – predefining of the subject, main theoretical and methodological orientations, thematic orientation and financing, social space and academic debates and views for further development. The situation before 1989 is briefly presented in order to position and understand clearer the issues and processes of development. The different directions have been chosen in a way that they ensure comparativeness between the different countries. The main conclusions are that the economic science in Bulgaria has undergone through sufficiently serious and deep changes in the topics and methodology of research and education, in its connection with the world, incl. Especially the European economic science, which is a good prerequisite for successful inclusion of the Bulgarian economists in the unified European research space.
A19|The condition of the economic science in Bulgaria|An overall picture of the contemporary condition of the economic science in Bulgaria is outlined, resulting from its internal changes during the last twelve years. The analysis is carried out in five main directions - redefinition of the subject, principal theoretic and methodological orientations, topical orientation and financing, social area and academic debate, and views on further development. The situation before 1989 is presented in brief in order to position and understand more clearly the problems and processes of development. Each separate direction is singled out in a way to ensure comparability between the different countries. The principal conclusion is that the economic science in Bulgaria has undergone sufficiently serious and profound changes in its subject matter and methodology of research and instruction in its connection with the world economic science, and in this number with the European economic science. This is a good prerequisite for a successful inclusion of the Bulgarian economists in the integrated space of the European research effort.

A19|Hemispheric dominance and language proficiency levels in the four macro skills of Western Mindanao State university college students|This study was conducted to determine the relationship between the hemispheric dominance (HD) and the English proficiency (EP) scores in the four macro skills of the Western Mindanao State University college students. It hypothesized that students’ HD would have a significant correlation a) with their EP scores in listening, speaking, reading and writing, b) with their global EP score, c) with both the macro and global scores when respondents would be grouped according to age, gender and area of specialization. In this study, there were 240 respondents selected through purposive, stratified, and random sampling techniques from the 5,096 students of the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Education. Using the standardized HD Test, the standardized Listening and Reading Comprehension Tests, the researcher-made Speaking and Writing Skill Tests and Cloze Test and employing mainly the Pearson r for the statistical analysis, the study concluded: 1) that most of the students of the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Education of Western Mindanao State University were left-brained (74.6%); 2) that the students were “good” in speaking, “fair” in listening and writing skills but “ poor” in reading and in global English; 3) that there was no significant relationship between the students’ hemisphericity and their EP scores in listening, speaking, reading, writing and global proficiency tests; and 4) that a significant relationship was shown between HD and EP scores when respondents were grouped according to age and area of specialization only.
A19|The Game Academics Play: Editors Versus Authors|This paper studies a differential game between authors and editors. Authors maximize the number of publications seeking to increase the impact of their work in the literature. Editors maximize the quality of papers they publish in order to increase the reputation of their journals. The game is suitable to analyze two different scenarios. When journals have different reputations, the editors of the leading journals play as leaders while authors are the followers. When journals have the same reputation, both agents play as followers. A numerical example shows that the outcome of the first case is Pareto-superior to the second whenever editor's put more emphasis on quality vis-a-vis reputation.
A19|Az exkluzivitás ára<BR>[The price of exclusivity]|A 20. század emberének fontos érdeke fűződik ahhoz, hogy valamilyen előnyösen kiválasztott társadalmi identitást hordozzon. Minél jobban kitüntet valakit a többiekkel szemben a társadalmi identitása, annál nagyobb esélye lesz, hogy azok között legyen, akik adott ár megfizetése mellett hozzájutnak valamilyen szűkös erőforráshoz, illetve alanyává lehetnek valamilyen előnyös tranzakciónak. Az ár megfizetése és az előnyösen kiválasztott társadalmi identitás együtt biztosítja az esélyt gazdasági célok elérésére. A tanulmány egy olyan számítási eljárást mutat be - az exkluzivitási mértéket -, amely lehetővé teszi e két közvetítő tényező átszámítását egymásra.
A19|A felelős gazdasági döntéshozatal modellje<BR>[A model of responsible economic decision making]|Komplex döntési helyzetekben a döntési alternatívák többdimenziós értékelésére van szükség. A döntéshozó meghatározza az egyes alternatívák értékét a kitűzött célok megvalósítása szempontjából, emellett azonban tekintettel kell lennie az etikai normáknak való megfelelésre, valamint döntésének az érintettekre gyakorolt hatásaira. Az így felfogott többdimenziós értéktérben a „legkevésbé rossz” lehetőség választása jelenheti a felelős döntést.
