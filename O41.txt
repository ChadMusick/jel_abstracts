O41|Publish and Perish: Creative Destruction and Macroeconomic Theory|A number of macroeconomic theories, very popular in the 1980s, seem to have completely disappeared and been replaced by the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) approach. We will argue that this replacement is due to a tacit agreement on a number of assumptions, previously seen as mutually exclusive, and not due to a settlement by ‘nature’. As opposed to econometrics and microeconomics and despite massive progress in the access to data and the use of statistical software, macroeconomic theory appears not to be a cumulative science so far. Observational equivalence of different models and the problem of identification of parameters of the models persist as will be highlighted by examining two examples: one in growth theory and a second in testing inflation persistence.
O41|The Productivity Slowdown in Canada: an ICT Phenomenon?|We ask whether a weaker contribution of information and communication technologies (ICT) to productivity growth could account for the productivity slowdown observed in Canada since the early 2000s. To answer this question, we consider several models which capture channels by which ICT could affect productivity growth. Our results indicate that ICT continues to contribute to productivity growth, but that this contribution has declined and consequently accounts for part of the productivity growth slowdown. However, the productivity slowdown and the change in the contribution of ICT do not seem to have the same timing. While productivity growth slowed in the early 2000s, the ICT contribution does not appear to have fallen until around the Great Recession. This prompts the conclusion that while ICT had little to no role in the initial productivity slowdown, it has been a major determinant of the subdued productivity growth since 2007-2009.
O41|Advertising, innovation and economic growth|This paper analyzes the implications of advertising for firm dynamics and economic growth through its interaction with R&D investment at the firm level. We develop a model of endogenous growth with firm heterogeneity that incorporates advertising decisions. We calibrate the model to match several empirical regularities across firm size using U.S. data. Through a novel interaction between R&D and advertising, our model provides microfoundations for the empirically observed negative relationship between both firm R&D intensity and growth, and firm size. Our model predicts substitutability between R&D and advertising at the firm level. Lower advertising costs are associated with lower R&D investment and slower economic growth. We provide empirical evidence supporting substitution between R&D and advertising using exogenous changes in the tax treatment of R&D expenditures across U.S. states. Finally, we find that R&D subsidies are more effective under an economy that includes advertising relative to one with no advertising.
O41|Investment Demand and Structural Change|In this paper we study the joint evolution of the investment rate and the sectoral composition of developing economies. Using panel data for several countries in different stages of development we document three novel facts: (a) both the investment rate and the industrial weight in the economy are strongly correlated and follow a hump-shaped profile with development, (b) investment goods contain more domestic value added from industry and less from services than consumption goods do, and (c) the evolution of the sectoral composition of investment and consumption goods differs from the one of GDP. We build and estimate a multi-sector growth model to fit these patterns. Our results highlight a novel mechanism of structural change: the evolution of the investment rate driven by the standard income and substitution effect of transitional dynamics explains half of the hump in industry with development, while the standard income and relative price effects explain the rest. We also find that the evolution of investment demand is quantitatively important to understand the industrialization of several countries since 1950 and the deindustrialization of many Western economies since 1970.
O41|Do Unit Labor Costs Matter? A Decomposition Exercise on European Data|From the introduction of the Euro up to the 2008 global financial crisis, macroeconomic imbalances widened among Member States. This divergence took the form of strong differences in the dynamics of unit labour costs. This paper asks why this happened. Is it the result of distortionary public spending, or the consequence of economic integration? To answer this question, this paper builds a theoretical framework that is able to provide a decomposition of unit labour costs growth into various effects of economic integration and policy intervention. Using a novel dataset, it then measures the contribution of each effect to the dynamics of unit labour costs in 12 countries of the Euro area from 1995 to 2014. Results show that trade and financial integration are significant drivers of unit labour costs divergence. Before the global financial crisis, in Greece and Portugal for example, trade and financial integration explain up to 30% of the increase in unit labour costs relative to core countries. On the contrary, distortionary public spending plays a minor role. These results suggest that, in peripheral economies, increasing unit labour costs reflect more the process of real convergence than fiscal profligacy.
O41|Stagnant wages, sectoral misallocation and slowing productivity growth|I propose a two-sector endogenous growth model with heterogeneous sectoral productivity and sector-specific, nonlinear hiring costs to analyse the link between sectoral resource allocation, low productivity growth and stagnant real wages. My results suggest that an upward shift in the labor supply, triggered for instance by a labor market reform, as among others implemented in Germany in 2003-2005, is beneficial in the long-run as it raises growth of technology, labor productivity and real wages. I show, however, that in the immediate phase following the labor supply shock, labor productivity and real wages stagnate as employment gains are initially disproportionally allocated to low-productivity sectors, limiting the capacity for technology growth and depressing real wages and productivity. I demonstrate that due to the learning-by-doing growth externality in the high-productivity sector the competitive equilibrium is ineffcient as firms fail to internalize the effect of their labor allocation on aggregate growth. Subsidies to high-productivity sector production can alleviate welfare losses along the transition path.
O41|Economic growth and convergence during the transition to production using automation capital|This paper examines the implications of automation capital in a Solow growth model withtwo types of labour. We study the transition from standard production to production usingautomation capital which substitutes low-skilled workers. We assume that despite advancesin technology, AI and machine learning, certain tasks can be performed only by high-skilledlabour and are not automatable. We show that under these assumptions, automation capitaldoes not generate endogenous growth without technological progress. However, assumingpresence of technological progress augmenting both effective number of workers and effectivenumber of industrial robots, automation increases rate of long-run growth. We analyse asituation in which some countries do not use robots at all and other group of countries startsthe transition to the economy where industrial robots replace low-skilled labour. We showthat this has potential non-linear effects on?-convergence and that the model is consistentwith temporary divergence of incomes per capita. We derive a set of estimable equationsthat allows us to test the hypotheses in a Mankiw-Romer-Weil framework.
O41|Technology Gaps, Trade and Income|This paper studies the origins and consequences of international technology gaps. I develop an endogenous growth model where R&D efficiency varies across countries and productivity differences emerge from firm-level technology investments. The theory characterizes how innovation and learning determine technology gaps, trade and global income inequality. Countries with higher R&D efficiency are richer and have comparative advantage in more innovation-dependent industries where the advantage of backwardness is lower and knowledge spillovers are more localized. I estimate R&D efficiency by country and innovation-dependence by industry from R&D and bilateral trade data. Calibrating the model implies technology gaps, due to cross-country differences in R&D efficiency, account for around one-quarter to one-third of nominal wage variation within the OECD.
O41|Innovation Union: Costs and Benefits of Innovation Policy Coordination|In this paper, we document large heterogeneity in innovation policy and performance between old and new EU member states, and present firm-level evidence on the close link between foreign direct investment (FDI) spillovers and eastern European _firms' innovation. Guided by these facts and motivated by the pressing debate on further EU integration, we build a two-region endogenous growth model to analyse the gains from innovation policy cooperation in an economic union. The two regions, the West (the old members) and the East (the new post-2004 members), feature firms competing in innovation for market leadership, are integrated via free trade and costly technology transfer via FDI and have different innovation performance and policy. Calibrating the model to reproduce key features of the EU economy, we compare the outcomes of an East-West R&D subsidy war with a cooperation scenario with unified subsidy across regions, and obtain three main results. First, we find that the dynamic gains spurring from the impact of cooperation on the economy's growth rate are sizable and substantially larger than the static gains obtained internalising the strategic motive for subsidies. Second, our model suggests that the presence of FDI and multinational production alleviates the strategic motive and increases the gains from cooperation. Third, separating FDI and innovation policy generates larger gains from cooperation, a policy complementarity driven by the knowledge spillovers carried by FDI.
O41|Distributive justice and social conflict in an AK model|We introduce distributive justice into a simple model of growth and distribution. Two groups (‘classes’) of otherwise identical, capital-rich and capital-poor individuals (‘capitalists’) and (‘workers’) are in conflict over factor (labour-capital) shares. Capitalists’ (workers’) ideal labour share is low (high) – but always tempered by the recognition that everyone supplies one unit of labour inelastically and desires a wage; and that the labour share impacts growth negatively in our ‘AK’ production economy. Social conflict is defined as the difference between the ideal labour shares of the two classes. This conflict is resolved by the two positive and three normative criteria we consider. Thus, the macroeconomy (growth, factor shares, distribution), social conflict and the methods of its resolution are jointly determined in a complete socio-economic equilibrium. We believe both this approach and our rich set of results are novel. We consider two positive (probabilistic voting and Nash bargaining, encapsulating electoral politics and socio-political bargaining) and two normative (justice) criteria (utilitarian and Rawlsian) of conflict resolution. Greater impatience, intensified status comparisons and negative consumption externalities, greater wealth inequality and a decline in productivity exacerbate social conflict. Status comparisons and wealth inequality tend to raise the labour share under all positive and normative criteria. Finally, we propose and analyse a criterion of ‘justice as minimal social friction’. Under the plausible assumption that the capitalists’ overall socio-political influence (numerical strength aside) is at least as high as that of workers, all positive methods imply a smaller labour share and more inequality than all our three criteria of distributive justice. We offer a numerical illustration of the key points.
O41|Demographic change and climate change|The paper uses a continuous-time overlapping-generations model with endogenous growth and pollution accumulation over time to study the link between longevity and global warming. It is seen that increasing longevity accelerates climate change in a business-as-usual scenario without climate policy. If a binding emission target is set exogenously and implemented via a cap-and-trade system, the price of emission permits is increasing in longevity. Longevity has no effect on the optimal solution of the climate problem if perfect intergenerational transfers are feasible. If these transfers are absent, the impact of longevity is ambiguous.
O41|Technology Gaps, Trade and Income|This paper studies the origins and consequences of international technology gaps. I develop an endogenous growth model where R&D efficiency varies across countries and productivity differences emerge from firm-level technology investments.

Countries with higher R&D efficiency are richer and have comparative advantage in more innovation-dependent industries where the advantage of backwardness is lower and knowledge spillovers are more localized. I estimate R&D efficiency by country and innovation-dependence by industry from R&D and bilateral trade data. Calibrating the model implies technology gaps, due to cross-country differences in R&D efficiency, account for around one-quarter to one-third of nominal wage variation within the OECD.
O41|Automation, Economic Growth, and the Labor Share - A Comment on Prettner (2019) -|Prettner (2019) studies the implications of automation for economic growth and the labor share in a variant of the Solow-Swan model. The aggregate production function allows for two types of capital, traditional and automation capital. Traditional capital and labor are imperfect substitutes whereas automation capital and labor are perfect substitutes. In this paper, we point to a flaw in Prettner’s analysis that invalidates his main analytical and computational findings. In contrast to Prettner, we argue that both kinds of capital are perfect substitutes as stores of value, and, therefore, must earn the same rate of return in equilibrium. Our computational analysis shows that the model dramatically overestimates the actual decline in the US labor share over the last 50 years.
O41|Innovation and the Patterns of Trade: A Firm-Level Analysis|What are the effects of trade liberalizations on firms' innovation incentives? What types of a firm's innovations are more affected by these liberalizations: product or process innovation, basic or fundamental innovation? How do changes in a firm's innovation activities after trade liberalizations affect a country's patterns of trade? We examine these questions both empirically and theoretically, through the lenses of a quantifiable model of trade and innovation. Recent empirical studies have found that trade liberalizations substantially affect firms' innovation activities (see Bloom, Draca, and Van Reenen (2015), Autor et al (2016), Coelli, Moxnes and Ulltveit-Moe (2016)). However, there is no consensus on the direction of the effect on innovation. Bloom, Draca, and Van Reenen (2015) and Coelli, Moxnes and Ulltveit-Moe (2016) find that declines in trade frictions increase innovation, whereas Autor el al. (2016) find that trade liberalization reduces firms' patens and R&D expenses. The ambiguity of these results shows the need of structural models to understand the channels through which trade affects firms' incentives to innovate. These models can quantify the importance of the market size and foreign competition channels embedded in trade liberalizations, and rationalize the ambiguity of the empirical findings. Moreover, these models can shed light on the effect that changes in firms' innovation incentives has on a country's patterns of trade. Our first contribution is empirical. We provide empirical evidence on the effect that the accession of China to the WTO in the early 2000s had on the innovation activities of French firms. In particular, we break down innovation activities by categories and study what activities were more affected by changes in trade frictions. We merge three datasets reporting information on firms' R&D and innovation activities, trade and balance sheets over the period 1993-2016. Our R&D data comes from the national survey on firms' R&D and innovation activities and reports information on R&D expenditures, patents, product and process innovation, basic and fundamental innovation, area of research, among others. The custom and balance sheet data provide information on all firms' exports and imports by country destination and origin, sales, capital, and employment. These extensive datasets allow us to build detailed measures of the different activities involved in the innovation process over a long panel, and to measure firms' exposure to the Chinese trade shock. Our second contribution is theoretical. We develop and quantify a model of trade, innovation and firms' dynamics to explain our empirical findings. From a theoretical perspective, the effect of a decline in trade frictions depends on two forces: (i) a market size effect, and ii) a foreign competition effect. The first effect increases investment in innovation, as firms benefit from serving a larger market. The second effect decreases the incentives to innovate, as firms face larger competition from abroad. In this case, the direction of the evolution of comparative advantage determines whether a firm finds it or nor profitable to invest in innovation. Which force dominates determines whether the net effect on innovation after a trade liberalization is positive, negative or neutral. One sector-sector models of Ricardian trade without knowledge spillovers predict that decreases in trade frictions have negligible effects on innovation since the market effect cancels out the foreign competition effect (see Atkeson and Bustein (2010) and Buera and Oberfield (2017)). A recent attempt to model these channels has been done by Sampson (2016), Somale (2016), and Cai, Li and Santacreu (2017), among others, by introducing sectoral linkages in production and knowledge spillovers to previous models of trade and innovation. These papers do not model explicitly the role of the firm in taking innovation, export, entry and exit decisions. Our model builds on Atkeson and Burstein (2010) and Atkeson and Burstein (2017). Atkeson and Burstein (2010) develop a model of trade and innovation without knowledge spillovers, in which innovation is modeled as the introduction of new products in the economy. We augment their model by adding knowledge spillovers and process and product innovations of incumbent firms as in Atkeson and Burstein (2017), who study the effect of innovation policies in a closed economy. In the model, the dynamics of productivity are driven endogenously by innovation of entering forms and product and process innovation of incumbent firms. Changes in trade costs have a direct effect on both product and process innovation in the economy. Our model allows us to disentangle the role of the market size effect and the foreign competition effect on these results. Furthermore, changes in innovation translate into changes in productivity, which in turn has an effect on the patterns of trade of the economy. We calibrate the model to data on innovation and trade for French firms during the period 1996-2016. We then perform a counterfactual exercise that consists of a reduction in trade frictions between China and France, and analyze quantitatively the effect that such trade reform has on innovation and the patterns of trade. Our paper provides a unified framework of trade and innovation at the firm level that allows us to obtain aggregate implications of trade liberalizations.

O41|Trade, Technology and the Great Divergence|"This paper develops a model that captures the key features of the Industrial Revolution and the Great Divergence between the industrializing \North"" and the lagging \South."" In particular, a convincing story is needed for why North-South divergence occurred so dramatically during the late 19th Century, a good hundred years after the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution. To this end we construct a trade/growth model that includes both endogenous biased technologies and intercontinental trade. The Industrial Revolution began as a sequence of unskilled-labor intensive innovations which initially incited fertil- ity increases and limited human capital formation in both the North and the South. The subsequent co-evolution of trade and technological growth however fostered an inevitable di- vergence in living standards - the South increasingly specialized in production that worsened their terms of trade and spurred even greater fertility increases and educational declines. Biased technological changes in both regions only reinforced this pattern. The model high- lights how pronounced divergence ultimately arose from interactions between specialization from trade and technological forces."

O41|Business Cycle during Structural Change: Arthur Lewis' Theory from a Neoclassical Perspective|We document that the nature of business cycles evolves over the process of development and structural change. In countries with large declining agricultural sectors, aggregate employment is uncorrelated with GDP. During booms, employment in agriculture declines while labor productivity increases in agriculture more than in other sectors. We construct a unified theory of business cycles and structural change consistent with the stylized facts. The focal point of the theory is the simultaneous decline and modernization of agriculture. As capital accumulates, agriculture becomes increasingly capital intensive as modern agriculture crowds out traditional agriculture. Structural change accelerates in booms and slows down in recessions. We estimate the model and show that it accounts well for both the structural transformation and the business cycle fluctuations of China.
O41|A Pedagogical Note on Risk Sharing Versus Instability in International Financial Integration: When Obstfeld Meets Stiglitz|Abstract The pure risk sharing mechanism implies that financial liberalization is growth enhancing for all countries as the world portfolio shifts from safe low-yield capital to riskier high-yield capital. This result is typically obtained under the assumption that the volatilities for risky assets prevailing under autarky are not altered after liberalization. We relax this assumption within a simple two-country model of intertemporal portfolio choices. By doing so, we put together the risk sharing effect and a well-defined instability effect. We identify the conditions under which liberalization may cause a drop in growth. These conditions combine the typical threshold conditions outlined in the literature, which concern the deep characteristics of the economies, and size conditions on the instability effect induced by liberalization.
O41|The love for children hypothesis and the multiplicity of fertility rates|As illustrated by some French departments, how can we explain the existence of equilibria with different fertility and growth rates in economies with the same fundamentals, preferences, technologies and initial conditions? To answer this question we develop an endogenous growth model with altruism and love for children. We show that independently from the type of altruism, a multiplicity of equilibria might emerge if the degree of love for children is high enough. We refer to this condition as the love for children hypothesis. Then, the fertility rate is determined by expectations on the future growth rate and the dynamics are not path-dependent. Our model is able to reproduce different fertility behaviours in a context of completed demographic transition independently from fundamentals, preferences, technologies and initial conditions.
O41|Structural changes and growth regimes|Abstract We study the relation between income distribution and growth, mediated by structural changes on the demand and supply sides. Using the results from a multi-sector growth model, we compare two growth regimes that differ in three aspects: labour relations, competition and consumption patterns. Regime one, similar to Fordism, is assumed to be relatively less unequal, more competitive and to have more homogeneous consumers than regime two, which is similar to post-Fordism. We analyse the parameters that define the two regimes to study the role of the economy’s exogenous institutional features and endogenous structural features on output growth, income distribution, and their relation. We find that regime one exhibits significantly lower inequality, higher output and productivity and lower unemployment compared to regime two, and that both institutional and structural features explain these differences. Most prominent amongst the first group are wage differences, accompanied by capital income and the distribution of bonuses to top managers. The concentration of production magnifies the effect of wage differences on income distribution and output growth, suggesting the relevance of competition norms. Amongst structural determinants, firm organisation and the structure of demand are particularly relevant. The way that final demand is distributed across sectors influences competition and overall market concentration; demand from the least wealthy classes is especially important. We show also the tight linking between institutional and structural determinants. Based on this linking, we conclude by discussing a number of policy implications that emerge from our model.
O41|Unequal vulnerability to climate change and the transmission of adverse effects through international trade|In this paper, we consider the unequal distribution of climate change damages in the world and we examine how the underlying costs can spread from a vulnerable to a non-vulnerable country through international trade. To focus on such indirect effects, we treat this topic in a North-South trade overlapping generations model in which the South is vulnerable to the damages entailed by global pollution while the North is not. We show that the impact of climate change in the South can be a source of welfare loss for northern consumers, in both the short and the long run. In the long run, an increase in the South’s vulnerability can reduce the welfare in the North economy even in the case in which it improves its terms of trade. In the short run, the South’s vulnerability can also represent a source of intergenerational inequity in the North. Therefore, we emphasize the strong economic incentives for non-vulnerable -and a fortiori less-vulnerable – economies to reduce the climate change damages on – more – vulnerable countries.
O41|Increasing Returns, Balanced-Budget Rules, and Aggregate Fluctuations|In a seminal contribution, Guo and Harrison (2004, JET) showed that, under a balanced-budget rule, the neoclassical growth model exhibits saddle-path stability when the adjustment is based on wasteful public spending. The present paper challenges this result in an endogenous growth framework with non-trivial dynamics of the debt-to-GDP ratio. We show that the emergence of aggregate instability dramatically depends on the strength of social labor externalities. If the labor demand is positively sloped and steeper than the labor supply, two reachable balanced-growth paths appear-a no growth trap, and a positive growth solution-that gives birth to both local and global indeterminacy, hence aggregate instability driven by self-fulfilling beliefs (sunspots). In addition, we show that a fiscal rule such that the tax rate strongly responds to public-debt increases can remove the no-growth trap, and secure positive long-run growth.

O41|Income, Education and Democracy|This paper puts forth a unified theory of growth and polity in which economic development affects a country's polity and polity affects its development. Education crucially impacts both trajectories, first by moving resources out of the traditional sector and decreasing incomes of the landed class and second, by increasing the de facto power of the masses. An autocrat aligned with the landed class will try to retard education of its citizens but eventually will relinquish power when the transfers needed to prevent the masses from revolting become too large. At this point society democratizes and the economy's growth path is determined by the median voter. The model is calibrated to the economic and political histories of Britain from 1200-2000 and used to quantify the role of education, land inequality, constraints on the executive, and school curricula for the timing of modernization and democratization. The effects of these factors are found to be large, on the order of centuries. The paper also contributes to the empirical literature by showing that support for the modernization hypothesis based on System General Method of Moments estimation is more robust than previous research suggests and by showing that only primary education predicts democracy in this estimation method.
O41|The rural exodus and the rise of Europe|To assess the importance of the rural exodus in fostering the transition from stagnation to growth, we propose a unified model of growth and internal migrations. Using an original set of Swedish data, we identify the deep parameters of our model. We show that internal migration conditions had to be favorable enough to authorize an exodus out of the countryside in order to fuel the industrial development of cities and the demographic transition of the country. We then compare the respective contribution of shocks on internal migration costs, infant mortality and inequalities in agricultural productivity to the economic take-off and the demographic transition that occurred in Sweden. Negative shocks on labor mobility generate larger delays in the take-off to growth compared to mortality shocks equivalent to the Black Death. Deepening inequalities of productivity in the agricultural sector, like it has been done by enclosure movements, contributes to accelerate urbanization at the cost of depressed economic growth.
O41|Harrodian instability in Kaleckian models and Steindlian solutions|The notion of dynamic instability of demand driven growth put forward by Harrod (1939) has triggered several responses in the history of economic thought. The modern Kaleckian solution, including Bhaduri/Marglin (1990) among several others, considers the rate of capacity utilisation to be endogenous beyond the short run, thus assuming, explicitly or implicitly, that Harrod's warranted rate of growth is either irrelevant or endogenous in the long run, eliminating the problem of Harrodian instability. In the modern debate several authors have criticised this Kaleckian approach, as reviewed in Hein/Lavoie/van Treeck (2011, 2012). In this debate, however, two arguments proposed by Steindl (1979, 1985) in favour of at least partial endogeneity of the warranted rate of growth have received little attention. The first is related to the endogeneity of the capital output ratio through endogenous capital scrapping (Steindl 1979); the second refers to government budget balances and the related effects on the aggregate propensity to save (Steindl 1979, 1985). In this paper we will therefore discuss in particular the two Steindlian arguments. For this purpose the model framework proposed by Hein/Lavoie/van Treeck (2011, 2012) will be extended in order to allow for endogenous capital scrapping and endogenous overall propensities to save through variations in the government financial balance.
O41|Up(and down)-skilling and directed technical change|In this paper we develop a dynamic general equilibrium analog to the Roy model. Specifically, the economy is populated by heterogeneous agents who differ in ability and sort into skilled and unskilled jobs. Because skilled jobs use ability with greater intensity, high (low) ability workers sort into skilled (unskilled) jobs. As in other frameworks, this endogenous cutoff ability depends on the economy's technology and distribution of workers. In contrast to existing' assignment' models, we incorporate endogenous skill- or, more aptly, ability - biased technical change. We use our framework to engage in a number of comparative statics. Our model fs tractability allows us to contrast the short and long-run effects of changes to the economy's fundamentals. We show that, for commonly used distributions, a first order stochastic dominance (FOSD) increase in the ability distribution raises the ability requirement to work in skilled jobs in the short run. In contrast, the long-run cutoff ability may actually decline. More generally, the technological response always dampens the increase in ability requirements.
O41|Inequality and Institutional Quality in a Growth Model|A macroeconomic growth model of an occupational choice between being a diligent worker and being a criminal is developed. Imperfect protection of property rights renders agents heterogeneous in their holding wealth over time even though they are homogeneous in the initial period. The model is so tractable that one can explicitly derive the distribution of individual wealth and compute the Gini coefficient analytically in the stationary state. Using the Gini coefficient, we investigate how institutional quality affects inequality across agents in the economy. Our ndings are as follows. In the case of a relatively higher capital share, as institutional quality improves, inequality widens in the early stage of development of institutional quality; in contrast, inequality shrinks once institutions have sufficiently matured. In the case of a lower capital share, inequality monotonically shrinks as institutional quality improves. Furthermore, we present government policies that reduce inequality and achieve the first-best outcome.
O41|Public Spending in an OLG Economy with Endogenous Technological Change - Financing Matters -|This paper introduces a government in an overlapping generations economy where long-run growth is the result of purposeful investments in a research sector that creates new technological knowledge. The government provides a subsidy to the re- search sector and pays for its spending by raising taxes and/or issuing debt. A debt- financed research subsidy cannot lead to a higher long-run growth rate than the one obtained in a competitive equilibrium of an otherwise equivalent economy without government. Instead, we show that paying for the subsidy entirely by raising taxes is advantageous from a long-run growth perspective. However, our analysis indicates that neither financing scenario is Pareto-improving as the initially old generation always suffers a welfare loss.
O41|On the Optimal Labor Income Share|Labor's share of income has attracted interest in recent years reflecting its apparent decline. These falls, witnessed across many countries, are usually deemed undesirable. Any such assertion, however, begs the question of what is the socially optimal labor share. We address this question using a micro-founded endogenous growth model calibrated on US data. We find that in our central calibration the socially optimal labor share is 17% (11 pp) above the decentralized equilibrium, calibrated to match the average observed in history. We also study the dependence of both long-run growth equilibria on model parameters and relate our results to Piketty's ''laws of Capitalism''. Finally, we demonstrate that cyclical movements in factor income shares are socially optimal and that the decentralized equilibrium typically does not generate excess volatility.
O41|Long-Run Tax Incidence in a Human Capital-based Endogenous Growth Model with Labor-Market Frictions|In a second-best optimal growth setup with only factor taxes, it is in general optimal to fully replace capital by labor income taxation in the long run. We revisit this important issue by developing a human capital-based endogenous growth model with frictional labor search, allowing each firm to create multiple vacancies and each worker to determine market participation. We find that the conventional efficient bargaining condition is necessary but not sufficient for achieving constrained social optimality. We then conduct tax incidence exercises in balanced growth by calibrating to the U.S. economy with a pre-existing 20% flat tax on capital and labor income. Our quantitative results suggest that, due to a dominant channel via the interactions between vacancy creation and market participation, it is optimal to switch only partially from capital to labor taxation in a benchmark economy where human capital formation depends on both physical and human capital stocks. This main finding is robust even along the transition with time-varying factor tax rates. Moreover, our quantitative analysis under alternative setups suggest that while endogenous human capital and labor market frictions are essential for obtaining a positive optimal capital tax, endogenous leisure, nonlinear human capital accumulation and endogenous growth are not crucial.
O41|Business Cycle during Structural Change: Arthur Lewis' Theory from a Neoclassical Perspective|We document that the nature of business cycles evolves over the process of development and structural change. In countries with large declining agricultural sectors, aggregate employment is uncorrelated with GDP. During booms, employment in agriculture declines while labor productivity increases in agriculture more than in other sectors. We construct a unified theory of business cycles and structural change consistent with the stylized facts. The focal point of the theory is the simultaneous decline and modernization of agriculture. As capital accumulates, agriculture becomes increasingly capital intensive as modern agriculture crowds out traditional agriculture. Structural change accelerates in booms and slows down in recessions. We estimate the model and show that it accounts well for both the structural transformation and the business cycle fluctuations of China.
O41|Modeling the drugs and guns trade in a two-country model with endogenous growth|This paper develops a two-country, dynamic general equilibrium model of endogenous growth with illicit drugs and guns trade. With a trade framework that unies both drug-control policies in consuming- and producing-country, as well as explicit modeling of firearm trade, the model is solved and parameterized to study the dynamic trade-off and growth effects of various drug-control policies. A production-consumption growth trade-off not previously documented in the literature is found. Further, under different conditions, and depending on the resulting gain in formal trade expansion, there are economic rationale to either a prohibitive or liberalization drug-control policy.
O41|Investment, autonomous demand and long run capacity utilization: An empirical test for the Euro Area|In recent years, the role attached to the autonomous components of aggregate demand has attracted rising attention, as testified by the development of the Sraffian Supermulti plier model (SSM) and the attempts to include autonomous demand in the Neo-Kaleckian model. This paper reviews and empirically tests the validity and the policy conclusions of the two models in the Euro Area. First, we theoretically assess whether the SSM may con stitute a complex variant of the Neo-Kaleckian model. In this sense, it is shown that results compatible with the SSM can be obtained by implementing a set of mechanisms in a modified Neo-Kaleckian model, leading to the convergence towards a desired rate of utilization. Furthermore, the chief diffierence between the models is recognized to be the role attached to the rate of capacity utilization in the long run. Second, the paper empirically tests the main implications of the models in the Euro Area, based on Eurostat data. In particular, the discussion outlines the short and long-run relation between autonomous demand and output, by testing both the cointegration and the direction of causality between the two with a VECM model. Moreover, the role accounted by both theories to the actual rate of capacity utilization and its discrepancies from the normal rate is empirically assessed, through a time-series estimation of the Sraffian and Neo-Kaleckian investment functions. While confirming the theoretical relation between autonomous demand and output in the long run, the results show that the dynamics of the rate of capacity utilization still plays a key role in the short-run adjustment mechanism - despite its stationary behaviour in the long term. Therefore, admitting that Keynesian results may hold even after the traverse, our work suggests to be Kaleckian in the short run and Sraffian in the long run.
O41|Tolerable ranges of variation in the rate of capacity utilization and corridor instability: a reply to Florian Botte|This reply to Botte (2019) responds to criticisms of the methods used to estimate the normal rate of capacity utilization and a tolerable interval of variation in the actual rate of capacity utilization around the normal rate in Setterfield (2019a). It concludes with some further reflections on the concept of corridor instability.
O41|Hysteresis in the normal rate of capacity utilization: a behavioural explanation|Kaleckians describe a normal rate of capacity utilization that is subject to hysteresis effects. This means that the normal rate varies directly with the actual rate of capacity utilization, ensuring that steady-state equilibrium conditions in the Kaleckian model are fully adjusted (the actual and normal rates of capacity utilization are equalized) but without this last condition implying that the rate of capacity utilization is constant in the long run. The relationship between distribution and growth unique to the Kaleckian model is thus preserved. The hysteresis mechanism has been criticized from various quarters, however, these criticisms focusing on its alleged lack of behavioural foundations. This paper shows that consistent with the stylized facts, variation in the normal rate of capacity utilization in response to variation in the actual capacity utilization rate can be derived from the links between both variables and the volatility of the macroeconomic environment - volatility, in the presence of fundamental uncertainty, being an important reason why firms deliberately under-utilize capacity (even in the long run) in the first place. The result is an empirically-grounded behavioural foundation for hysteresis in the normal rate of capacity utilization.
O41|Corruption, mortality rates, and development:Policies for escaping from the poverty trap|We construct a three-period overlapping generations model in which corrup- tion, mortality and fertility rates, and economic development are determined endogenously. We consider a less developed economy suffering from a high degree of corruption and high mortality and fertility rates in a poverty trap. We focus on two policies: raising public sector wages as a means of reducing corruption and increasing public health spending as a means of improving the mortality rate. Our theoretical analysis shows that implementing both policies simultaneously is essential for less developed economies to escape from the poverty trap and achieve economic development.
O41|The decades-long dispute over scale effects in the theory of economic growth|The so-called ‘new growth theory’ is characterized by the now Nobel Prize winning insight that ideas are a non-rival input to and output from endogenous investment in innovation. Non-rivalry implies increasing returns to scale, but this also unintentionally creates an empirically-disputed scale effect that a growing population implies an ever-increasing growth rate. Empirical evidence supports fully-endogenous growth without scale effects, but theoretical issues sustain the decades-long dispute over exactly how to negate the scale effect. This article surveys theoretical approaches to resolving the scale effect and shows how four generations of endogenous growth theory are defined by the maturing of modeling techniques for constraining increasing returns. The synthesis suggests that the dispute over scale effects is really a narrative about how the powerful application of increasing returns has followed a standard theoretical development pattern. This implies that a fourth generation is now emerging that negates the scale effect while retaining fully-endogenous growth without relying on assumptions of linearity. Instead, the market response to excessive increasing returns to innovation constrains explosive growth by expanding the market, rather than by a linear assumption. This latest class of endogenous growth models may be the final chapter to resolving the long running dispute.
O41|The dynamics of health care and growth: A model with physician in dual practice|We present a growth model with micro-foundations of a mixed health care system and physician dual-practice, to analyze for welfare-optimal government financing strategy for a mixed health system in developing countries. Calibrating the model for Indonesia, we find that a government subsidy to private health care is both growth- and welfare-enhancing, whereas it is more effective for the government to invest in health infrastructure instead of a public-sector “rewarding” policy in raising government physicians’ wage if its goal is to improve physician effort in public practice. Indeed, for the “rewarding” policy, a dynamic trade-off in growth is found, which is not previously documented in the literature. We also find the model to produce two regimes with different welfare-optimal health financing (a “normal” regime and a low public-sector congestion regime). In the former, welfare-optimal health financing strategy appears to be promoting private health subsidy at the expense of public-sector physician wages. In the latter, the opposite is welfare-optimal.
O41|Malthus in the Light of Climate Change|To reconsider the Malthusian predictions of natural limits to economic development, the paper develops a multi-sector growth model with exhaustible resource extraction, investments in physical and knowledge capital, climate change, and endogenous fertility. Economic growth is driven by endogenous innovations which increase in the availability and productivity of research labour. Poor substitution of natural resources triggers sectoral change. Climate change is the result of polluting resource use which is, like consumption and investments, based on the intertemporal optimization of the households. Highlighting the importance of bounded resource supply and of rational extraction decisions I show that climate change is independent of population growth in steady state and there is no causal relationship between climate and population during transition to steady state. The consumption per capita growth rate rises in the innovation rate and the output elasticities of labour and capital in the different sectors. Unlike climate policy, population policy is not warranted; it may be counterproductive because labour is crucial for the research sector.
O41|A Model-Based Assessment of the Distributional Impact of Structural Reforms|This paper studies the effects of structural reforms on the functional distribution of income in EU Member States. To study this mechanism we use a DSGE model (Roeger et al. 2008) with households supplying three types of labour, low-, medium- and high-skilled. We assume that households receive income from labour, tangible capital, intangible capital, financial wealth and transfers and we trace how structural reforms affect these types of incomes. The quantification of structural reforms is based on changes in structural indicators that can significantly close the gap of a country’s average income towards the best performing countries in the EU. We find a general trade-off between an increase in employment of a particular group and the income of the average group member relative to income per capita. In general, reforms which aim at increasing employment of low skilled workers are associated with a fall in wages relative to income per capita. Capital owners generally benefit from labour market reforms, with an increasing share in total income, due to limited entry into the final goods production sector. This suggests that labour market re-forms may lead to suboptimal distributional effects if there are rigidities in goods markets present, a finding which confirms the importance of ensuring that such reforms are accompanied or preceded by product market reforms.
O41|Aggregate Implications of Changing Sectoral Trends|We find disparate trend variation in TFP and labor growth across major U.S. production sectors over the post-WWII period. When aggregated, these sector-specific trends imply secular declines in the growth rate of aggregate labor and TFP. We embed this sectoral trend variation into a dynamic multi-sector framework in which materials and capital used in each sector are produced by other sectors. The presence of capital induces important network effects from production linkages that amplify the consequences of changing sectoral trends on GDP growth. Thus, in some sectors, changes in TFP and labor growth lead to changes in GDP growth that may be as large as three times these sectors' share in the economy. We find that trend GDP growth has declined by more than 2 percentage points since 1950, and that this decline has been primarily shaped by sector-specific rather than aggregate factors. Sustained contractions in growth specific to Construction, Nondurable Goods, and Professional and Business and Services make up close to sixty percent of the estimated trend decrease in GDP growth. In addition, the slow process of capital accumulation means that structural changes have endogenously persistent effects. We estimate that trend GDP growth will continue to decline for the next 10 years absent persistent increases in TFP and labor growth.
O41|Sectoral and Aggregate Structural Change|We estimate that trends in TFP and employment growth have steadily declined across a majority of U.S. sectors over the post-war period. Most of the secular decline in aggregate TFP and employment growth results from the combination of sector-specific rather than aggregate disturbances. We embed these observations into a dynamic multi-sector framework in which materials and capital used in each sector are produced by other sectors. The presence of capital, in particular, induces quantitatively important sectoral multiplier effects from production linkages on GDP growth. Thus, in some sectors, the effects of changes in TFP or employment growth on GDP growth may be as large as 3 times their share in the economy. Taken together, structural changes across sectors have lowered trend GDP growth by around 2 percentage points since the early 1950s. Sustained contractions in growth specific to Durable and Non-Durable Goods, and most importantly Construction, account for close to 2=3 of this decline. Because of capital accumulation, structural changes have endogenously persistent effects. Consequently, we estimate that trend GDP growth will continue to decline for the next 10 years even if trend TFP and employment growth stabilize.
O41|North-South Uneven Development and Income Distribution under the Balance of Payments Constraint|This study builds a North-South trade and uneven development model, and investigates the effects of changes in income distribution (the profit share) on economic growth rates of both countries. How a change in the profit share affects both countries' growth rates differs for the short-run equilibirum and the long-run equilibrium. For example, in the short-run equilibirum, an increase in the profit share of the North deteriorates the terms of trade of the South, and then, decreases the growth rate of the South. On the other hand, in the long-run equilibrium, an increase in the profit share of the North either increases or decreases the growth rate of the South through Thirlwall's law.
O41|What stunts economic growth and causes the poverty trap?|In spite of an identical initial condition, why are some parts of the world so rich and others so poor? To address this question, this paper constructs a simple theoretical model that incorporates human infrastructure and child labor The first part of the paper shows that the condition of bifurcation from an identical initial condition depends on the technology level. We also show that current dynamic trends highly depend on initial endowments and productivity. The second part of the paper examines the effect of development assistance in recipient countries. By analyzing two types of programs; the elimination of child labor and support to strengthen human infrastructure, we show that the former (latter) program is effective for middle- (low-) income countries.
O41|Optimal Capital Taxation in an Economy with Innovation-Driven Growth|"This paper examines whether the Chamley-Judd result of a zero optimal capital tax rate is valid in an innovation-driven growth model. We examine how the optimal capital tax rate varies with externalities associated with R&D and innovation. Our results show that the optimal capital tax rate is higher when (i) the ""stepping on toes effect"" is smaller, (ii) the ""standing on shoulders effect"" is stronger, or (iii) the extent of creative destruction is greater. By calibrating our model to the US economy, we find that the optimal capital tax rate is positive, at a rate of around 11.9 percent. We also find that a positive optimal capital tax rate is more likely to be the case when there is underinvestment in R&D."
O41|Effective Demand and Quantity Constrained Growth: A Simple Two-Sector Disequilibrium Approach|In this study, we construct a simple disequilibrium growth model to explore the dynamic property of effective demand. This study's main concern is the effect of the quantity constraint: How do the quantities of consumption and investment goods demand and the productive capacity affect capital accumulation? To answer this, we build a two-sector growth model with quantity constraints. One interesting result is that consumption goods demand enhances capital accumulation when the capital is sufficiently accumulated but impedes it when the capital is insufficient. The latter case is shown as a shrinking path by graphical analysis and a numerical experiment.
O41|A simple characterization for sustained growth|This article considers an inter-temporal optimization problem in a fairly general form and give sufficient conditions ensuring the convergence to infinity of the economy. These conditions are easy to verify and can be applied for a large class of problems in literature. As examples, some applications for different economies are also given.

O41|Does Decomposition of GDP Growth Matter for the Poor? Empirical Evidence from Pakistan|This paper examines how the economic growth of different sectors affects poverty in Pakistan uses the time series data over the period 1973-2010. The ARDL co-integration approach has been applied to investigate the impact of sectoral growth on aggregate as well as disaggregated poverty in the long run and short run. The results indicate that industrial growth reduces total, rural and urban poverty significantly while the performance of services sector affects the composition of poverty insignificantly. The agricultural sector growth has a negative impact on aggregate poverty while it has an insignificant impact on disaggregated poverty.
O41|On the transitional dynamics and policy analysis of the Romer (1990) model|In this paper we prove the existence, uniqueness and saddle-point stability of the steady state (or balanced growth path) of the Romer (1990) model by utilizing the reduction of dimensionality. Furthermore, we found out a set of policy instruments to improve the monopolistic competitive equilibrium allocation up to social optimum.
O41|Stochastic Structural Change|We propose a tractable algorithm to solve stochastic growth models of structural change. Under general conditions, structural change implies an unbalanced growth path. This property prevents the use of local solution techniques when uncertainty is introduced, and requires the adoption of global methods. Our algorithm relies on the Parameterized Expectations Approximation and we apply it to a stochastic version of a three-sector structural transformation growth model with Stone-Geary preferences. We use the calibrated solution to show that in this class of models there exists a tension between the long- and the short-run properties of the economy. This tension is due to the non-homothetic components of the various types of consumption, which are needed to fit long-run structural change, but imply a counterfactually high volatility of services, and counterfactually low volatilities of manufacturing and agriculture in the short-run.
O41|Stock-flow ratios and the paradox of debt in canonical neo-kaleckian and supermultiplier models|The paper addresses the features of stock-flow consistent (SFC) canonical versions of neo-kaleckian and supermultiplier models that introduce the accumulation of debt of households and firms. The aim of this comparison is twofold: (i) to analyze under which conditions the paradox of debt emerges in the household and firms sector in each model; (ii) to evaluate the extent in which these conditions differ due to each models' specific closure. Preliminary results suggest that the paradox of debt in firms' sector is not a necessary result of supermultiplier models. As for households sector, the paradox of debt is a feature of the canonical supermultiplier model, yet there may be episodes of rising debt-to-income ratios and financial crisis as precipitated by policy decisions.
O41|Growth Dynamics, Multiple Equilibria, and Local Indeterminacy in an Endogenous Growth Model of Money, Banking and Inflation Targeting|We develop an overlapping generations monetary endogenous growth (generated by productive public expenditures) model with inflation targeting, characterized by relocation shocks for young agents, which in turn generates a role for money (even in the presence of the return-dominating physical capital) and financial intermediaries. Based on this model, we show that two distinct growth paths emerge conditional on a threshold value of the share of physical capital in the production function. Along one path, we find convergence to a single stable equilibrium, and on the other path, we find multiple equilibria: a stable low-growth and an unstable high-growth, with the stable low-growth equilibrium found to be locally indeterminate. Since, government expenditure is productive in our model, a higher inflation-target would translate into higher growth, but under multiple equilibria, this is not necessarily always the case.
O41|Rural-Urban Migration, Structural Transformation, and Housing Markets in China|This paper explores the contribution of the structural transformation and urbanization process in the housing market in China. City migration flows combined with an inelastic land supply, due to entry restrictions, has raised house prices. This issue is examined using a multi-sector dynamic general-equilibrium model with migration and housing market. Our quantitative findings suggest that this process accounts for about 80 percent of urban housing prices. This mechanism remains valid in an extension calibrated to the two largest cities where housing booms have been particularly noticeable. Overall, supply factors and productivity account for most of the housing price growth.
O41|Engines of Sectoral Labor Productivity Growth|We study the origins of labor productivity growth and its differences across sectors. In our model, sectors employ workers of different occupations and various forms of capital, none of which are perfect substitutes, and technology evolves at the sector-factor cell level. Using the model we infer technologies from US data over 1960-2017. We find sector-specific routine labor augmenting technological change to be crucial. It is the most important driver of sectoral differences, and has a large and increasing contribution to aggregate labor productivity growth. Neither capital accumulation nor the occupational employment structure within sectors explains much of the sectoral differences.
O41|Skill Biased Technical Change and Misallocation. A Unified Framework and a country-sector exercize|Due to strict reliance on perfectly competitive labor markets, standard approaches estimating skill biased technical change (SBTC) conflate ‘true’ SBTC and labor market distortions preventing firms from choosing the efficient skilled to unskilled labor ratio. To overcome this limit, we present a unified framework to estimate SBTC, net of factor accumulation (FA) effects, and quantify the discrepancy between skilled to unskilled marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS) and wage ratio (i.e., relative misallocation). The methodology takes advantage of recent developments in nonparametric estimation methods (i.e., generalized kernel regression) that allow us to estimate the marginal productivity of inputs at the country-sector level directly from country-sector data. Using 1995-2005 data, we find a 3% yearly growth rate for the MRTS between skilled and unskilled labor and show such change to be mostly driven by SBTC, rather than FA. We then show that MRTS changes does not match the evolution of the wage ratios (quite stable over time), thus yielding substantial heterogeneity in terms of relative misallocation patterns, for which we report a 6% increase, overall (1.5% in manufacturing, against a rough 12% in Non-Manufacturing sectors). Finally, we show evidence that relative misallocation increased less in country-sectors in which it was larger at the beginning of the period and grew more in country-sectors characterized by: higher skill-intensity; lower bargaining power of skilled over unskilled workers; lower FA effects.
O41|R&D Financing And Growth|R&D investment are an important engine of growth and development.Yet economists have often claimed underinvestment, based on the consideration thatthese projects are more costly to finance, especially, due to the asymmetric informa-tion between inside and outside investors. Coherently, a recent empirical evidence hasshown that firms intensively active in R&D are less leveraged and rely more heavilyon internal finance. Motivated by this evidence, we study the e↵ects of asymmetricinformation and financial frictions within a GE economy of Schumpeterian tradition.The model and equilibrium concept are rich enough to represent investment and in-novation decisions, technology adoption/di↵usion through patent licensing and, mostimportantly, firms’ financial decisions. In this representation, R&D-intensive firmsmight e↵ectively rely more on internal sources and equity than on debt financing, rel-ative to what would happen in frictionless markets. Further, financial decisions a↵ectaggregate investment and income dynamics.
O41|Health and Development|In this paper we examine whether the Solow growth model is consistent with across-countries variations in standard of living once investments in education and health are explicitly and simultaneously taken into account. Using a sample of low- and middle-income economies, we provide evidence that per capita GDP is positively affected by population's health, here proxied by the life expectancy at birth. Public expenditure on health affects indirectly the level of per capita income through its positive effectect on life expectancy. Using a Finite Mixture approach, we also show that richer economies are those where the impact of unobserved factors on the level of per capita income is stronger.
O41|New Structuralism and the Balance-of-Payments Constraint|Structuralists and Post-Keynesians share the perspective that in the long run economic growth is shaped by the income elasticity of exports and imports, and that such elasticities are a positive function of the degree of diversification and technological intensity of the pattern of specialization. Since the mid-seventies, New Structuralists began to stress the role of two set of variables in driving the pattern of specialization: a stable and competitive real exchange rate, and the relative intensity of innovation / diffusion of technology in center and periphery. In this paper we modify the Balance-of-Payments constrained growth model to include these two set of variables. The model provides a mechanism that ensures the validity of the original Thirlwall’s perspective, namely that adjustment to the Balance-of-Payments-constrained equilibrium takes place through changes in the rate of growth of aggregate demand rather than through changes in relative prices. In addition, it shows that a macroeconomic policy aimed at sustaining a competitive real exchange rate is a necessary complement to an active industrial policy for fostering international convergence.
O41|The Hardware-Software Model: A New Conceptual Framework of Production, R&D, and Growth with AI|The article proposes a new conceptual framework for capturing production, R&D, and economic growth in aggregative models which extend their horizon into the digital era. Two key factors of production are considered: hardware, including physical labor, traditional physical capital and programmable hardware, and software, encompassing human cognitive work, pre-programmed software, and artificial intelligence (AI). Hardware and software are complementary in production whereas their constituent components are mutually substitutable. The framework generalizes, among others, the standard model of production with capital and labor, models with capitalâ€“skill complementarity and skill-biased technical change, and unified growth theories embracing also the pre-industrial period. It offers a clear conceptual distinction between mechanization and automation as well as between robotization and the development of AI. It delivers sharp, economically intuitive predictions for long-run growth, the evolution of factor shares, and the direction of technical change
O41|Policy Distortions and Aggregate Productivity with Endogenous Establishment-Level Productivity|The large differences in income per capita across countries are mostly accounted for by differences in total factor productivity (TFP). What explains these differences in TFP across countries? Evidence suggests that the (mis)allocation of factors of production across heterogenous production units is an important factor. We study factor misallocation in a model with an endogenously determined distribution of establishment-level productivity. In this framework, policy distortions not only misallocate resources across a given set of productive units, but they also worsen the distribution of establishment-level productivity. We show that in our model, compared to the model with an exogenous distribution, the quantitative effect of policy distortions is substantially amplified. Whereas empirically-plausible policy distortions in our model generate TFP that is 14 percent that of a benchmark economy with no distortions, with an exogenous distribution the same policy distortions generate TFP that is 86 percent of the benchmark, a 6-fold amplification factor.

O41|Engines of Sectoral Labor Productivity Growth|We study the origins of labor productivity growth and its differences across sectors. In our model, sectors employ workers of different occupations and various forms of capital, none of which are perfect substitutes, and technology evolves at the sector-factor cell level. Using the model we infer technologies from US data over 1960-2017. We find sector-specific routine labor augmenting technological change to be crucial. It is the most important driver of sectoral differences, and has a large and increasing contribution to aggregate labor productivity growth. Neither capital accumulation nor the occupational employment structure within sectors explains much of the sectoral differences.
O41|Structural Transformations and Cumulative Causation: Towards an Evolutionary Micro-foundation of the Kaldorian Growth Model|We build upon the evolutionary model developed in prior works (Ciarli, Lorentz, Savona and Valente 2010b), which formalises the links between production, organisation and functional composition of the employment on the supply side and the endogenous evolution of consumption patterns on the demand side. The main contribution resulting from the exercise proposed here is to derive the Kaldorian cumulative causation mechanism as an emergent property of the dynamics generated by the micro-founded model. More precisely, we discuss the main transition dynamics to a self-sustained growth regime in a two-stage growth patterns generated through the numerical simulation of the model. We then show that these mechanisms lead to the emergence of a Kaldor-Verdoorn law. Finally we show that the structure of demand (among others the heterogeneity in consumption behaviour) itself shapes the type of growth regime emerging from the endogenous structural changes, fostering or hampering the emergence of the Kaldor Verdoorn law.
O41|Semi-endogenous growth models with domestic and foreign private and public R&D linked to VECMs|We present semi-endogenous growth models with total-factor productivity as functions of domestic and foreign private and public R&D. In a small country case with a Cobb-Douglas TFP production function, foreign R&D drives steady-state growth and the production function can be a long-term relation in a vector-error-correction model. Marginal productivity conditions can be long-term relations for a vector-error-correction model if the functional form is of a Cobb-Douglas type or a CES function generalised to a VES function. In case of a VES function, steady states exist only for special cases of parameter restrictions.
O41|Investment demand and structural change|In this paper we study the joint evolution of the investment rate and the sectoral composition of developing economies. Using panel data for several countries in different stages of development we document three novel facts: (a) both the investment rate and the industrial weight in the economy are strongly correlated and follow a hump-shaped profile with development, (b) investment goods contain more domestic value added from industry and less from services than consumption goods do, and (c) the evolution of the sectoral composition of investment and consumption goods differs from the one of GDP. We build and estimate a multi-sector growth model to fit these patterns. Our results highlight a novel mechanism of structural change: the evolution of the investment rate driven by the standard income and substitution effect of transitional dynamics explains half of the hump in industry with development, while the standard income and relative price effects explain the rest. We also find that the evolution of investment demand is quantitatively important to understand the industrialization of several countries since 1950 and the deindustrialization of many Western economies since 1970.
O41|Investment, Autonomous Demand and Long Run Capacity Utilization: An Empirical Test for the Euro Area|This paper reviews and empirically tests the validity and policy conclusions of the Sraffian Supermultiplier model (SSM) and the modified Neo-Kaleckian model after the inclusion of autonomous components of aggregate demand. First, we theoretically assess whether the SSM may constitute a complex variant of the Neo-Kaleckian model. In this sense, it is shown that results compatible with the SSM can be obtained by implementing a set of mechanisms in a modified Neo-Kaleckian model. Second, the paper empirically tests the main implications of the models in the Euro Area, based on Eurostat data. In particular, the discussion outlines the short and long-run relation between autonomous demand and output, by testing cointegration and causality with a VECM model. Moreover, the role accounted by both theories to the rate of capacity utilization is empirically assessed, through a time-series estimation of the Sraffian and Neo-Kaleckian investment functions. While confirming the theoretical relation between autonomous demand and output in the long run, the results show that capacity utilization still plays a key role in the short-run adjustment mechanism. Therefore, admitting that Keynesian results may hold even after the traverse, our work suggests to be Kaleckian in the short run and Sraffian in the long run.
O41|Skill-biased technological change, endogenous labor supply, and the skill premium|The evolution of the U.S. skill premium over the past century has been characterized by a U-shaped pattern. The previous literature has attributed this observation mainly to the existence of exogenous, unexpected technological shocks or changes in institutional factors. In contrast, this paper demonstrates that a U-shaped evolution of the skill premium can also be obtained using a simple two-sector growth model that comprises both variants of skill-biased technological change (SBTC): technological change (TC) that is favorable to high-skilled labor and capital-skill complementarity (CSC). Within this framework, we derive the conditions necessary to achieve a non-monotonic evolution of relative wages and analyze the dynamics of such a case. We show that in the short run for various parameter constellations an educational, a relative substitutability, and a factor intensity effect can induce a decrease in the skill premium despite moderate growth in the relative productivity of high-skilled labor. In the long run, as the difference in labor productivity increases, the skill premium also rises. To underpin our theoretical results, we conduct a comprehensive simulation study.
O41|Real Exchange Rate Misalignment and Economic Growth : An Update|This paper empirically examines the relationship between real exchange rate misalignment and economic growth by using an updated data set over the sample period 1990-2014 for a large number of countries. Our findings indicate that the measure of real exchange rate misalignment is positively associated with economic growth for the low and middle-income countries whereas no significant relationship between these two for richer countries, implying the more overvalued the currency is over the long run, the lower the long-run growth rate of per capita income in developing countries. A plausible interpretation of this finding is that following the financial liberalization, large capital inflows and lending boom lead to appreciation of real exchange rates in the majority of developing countries. Prolonged real appreciation may result in lower long-run growth because of two channels: first, by changing resource allocation in favour of nontraded-goods sector it may reduce the long-term growth prospects; and second, by promoting private debt denominated in foreign currency it makes economy more vulnerable to external shocks, that is due to contractionary balance-sheet effects, a sudden and sharp real depreciation, which often happens in the boost cycle, may have a negative effect on output and growth.
O41|Structural Change and Aggregate Employment Fluctuations in China and the US|One salient feature of business cycles in developed countries is that the aggregate employment is highly procyclical. In China, however, the correlation of the cyclical components of aggregate employment and output is close to zero. In this paper, we document three new stylized facts: (1) the business cycle properties of employment at sector level (agriculture and non-agriculture) in China are very similar to those in the US; (2) employments in the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors are negatively correlated in both China and the US; and (3) for both economies, the agriculture’s share of employment is negatively correlated with the real GDP per work in both sectors. These facts suggest that difference in sector composition could be an important reason for the difference in aggregate employment fluctuations between the two economies. We then construct a simple two-sector growth model with productivity shocks and non-homothetic preferences and show that the model can simultaneously account for the secular trend in labor reallocation away from agriculture and employment fluctuations at sector level and in the aggregate for both China and the US.
O41|Computerizing industries and routinizing jobs: Explaining trends in aggregate productivity|Complementarity across occupations and industries implies that the relative size of those with high productivity growth shrinks, reducing their contributions toward aggregate productivity growth and thereby resulting in its slowdown. This force, especially the shrinkage of occupations with above-average productivity growth through “routinization,” was present since the 1980s. Through the end of the 1990s, it was countervailed by the extraordinary productivity growth in the computer industry, of which output became an increasingly more important input in all industries (“computerization”). It was only when the computer industry’s productivity growth slowed that the negative effect of routinization on aggregate productivity became apparent.
O41|Biased Technological Change and Employment Reallocation|To study the drivers of the employment reallocation across sectors and occupations between 1960 and 2010 in the US we propose a model where technology evolves at the sector-occupation cell level. This framework allows us to quantify the bias of technology across sectors and across occupations. We implement a novel method to extract changes in sector-occupation cell productivities from the data. Using a factor model we find that occupation and sector factors jointly explain 74-87 percent of cell productivity changes, with the occupation component being by far the most important. While in our general equilibrium model both factors imply similar reallocations of labor across sectors and occupations, quantitatively the bias in technological change across occupations is much more important than the bias across sectors.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O41|Keeping up with or running away from the Joneses: the Barro model revisited|Abstract This paper reexamines the Barro growth model in a context of interdependent preferences with consumption externality. Agents care about both consumption and social status, which is determined by their relative consumption in society. The results underline the individuals’ preferences for status as a key role in explaining long term growth and welfare. In particular, a higher growth rate may correspond to a lower social welfare if increment in growth is explained by status-seeking accompanied by the keeping up with the Joneses. Furthermore, we discuss two public financing systems from the viewpoint of growth and welfare. If lump-sum tax always implies a higher growth rate, income tax may perform better in terms of welfare when government size becomes sufficiently large.
O41|Autonomous Demand and the Investment Share|This paper looks at the effect of demand shocks on the investment share of the economy. Using panel data on 20 OECD countries, we show that the rate of growth of autonomous demand (exports, public spending and housing investment) is positively correlated with subsequent values of the share of business investment in GDP. By means of an instrumental-variables strategy, we confirm a positive effect of demand dynamics on the business investment share. We instrument autonomous demand with US demand for imports interacted with exposure to trade with the US, openness to trade of a country’s main export destinations, and military spending. A permanent 1% increase in autonomous demand growth raises the investment share by 1.5 to 1.9 percentage points of GDP in our preferred panel IV specification. Our results provide empirical support for the view that the influence of aggregate demand on capital accumulation can be a major source of hysteresis. Our results are inconsistent with the canonical New Keynesian 3-equations model, the Neo-Kaleckian model with flexible equilibrium utilization and Classical-Marxian growth models. A positive influence of autonomous demand on the investment share is instead compatible with demand-led models in which capacity adjusts to demand in the long-run.
O41|The serendipity theorem for an endogenous open economy growth model|A Samuelsonian serendipity theorem for an endogenous growth model is derived. The formula for optimal population growth rate deviates from those of the model with exogenous population growth rates in a third best endogenous growth model of the Lucas type with imperfect international capital movements and human capital externalities. Calibration shows that the effect of variation of the exogenous population growth rates on other variables and the deviation of population growth rates from its optimal value are small. The reason is that labour supply, interest rates and technical change are endogenous. There is not much of an incentive for population growth policy unless Frisch parameters change with ageing.
O41|Perpetual growth, distribution, and robots|"The current literature on the economic effects of machine learning, robotisation and artificial intelligence suggests that there may be an upcoming wave of substitution of human labour by machines (including software). We take this as a reason to rethink the traditional ways in which technological change has been represented in economic models. In doing so, we contribute to the recent literature on so-called perpetual growth, i.e., growth of per capita income without technological progress. When technology embodied in capital goods are sufficiently advanced, per capita growth becomes possible with a non-progressing state of technology. We present a simple Solow-like growth model that incorporates these ideas. The model predicts a rising wage rate but declining share of wage income in the steady state growth path. We present simulation experiments on several policy options to combat the inequality that results from this, including a universal basic income as well as an option in which workers become owners of ""robots""."
O41|Structural change, productivity growth and labour market turbulence in Africa|This paper combines a standard decomposition of labour productivity with a decomposition of labour market turbulence to study the role of structural change and job reallocation in the economic growth performance of African countries over the past fifty years using an updated and expanded version of the Africa Sector Database (ASD) developed by the Groningen Growth and Development Centre (GGDC). The results show that productivity growth has been generally low since the 1960s with moderate contributions from structural change across the entire period. Although productivity growth from structural change is generally low, a regional comparison shows that structural change is more rapid in East Africa than in the other regions of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). While structural change accounts for more than half of the labour productivity growth in East Africa, within-sector productivity growth accounts for more than half of the labour productivity growth in West Africa and Southern Africa. Structural change is characterised by a net reallocation of workers across different sectors. As such, we compute the labour market turbulence effect of structural change. The turbulence effect of structural change has been mostly felt in the Service Sector due to volatile demand and the high level of informality. The paper further makes the first attempt to estimate the effect of labour market flexibility on job reallocation in Africa. The results show that more rigid labour markets reduce job reallocation across sectors impeding structural change and productivity growth in Africa.
O41|Growing through chaos in the Matsuyama map via subcritical flip and bistability|"Recent publications reconsider the growth model proposed by Matsuyama (""Growing through cycles""), also called M-map, presenting new interpretation of the model as well as new results on its dynamic behaviors. The goal of the present paper is to give the rigorous proof of some results which were remaining open, related to the dynamics of this model. We prove that in the whole parameter range of interest an attracting 2-cycle appears via border collision bifurcation, we give the explicit flip bifurcation value of the 2-cycle proving that it is always of subcritical type. This leads to bistability related to coexistence of an attracting 2-cycle with attracting 4-cyclic chaotic intervals. We give the conditions related to the sharp transition to chaos, proving that the cascade of stable cycles of even periods cannot occur. The parameter range in which repelling cycles of odd period exist is further investigated, giving an explicit boundary, as well as its relation to the non existence of cycles of period three."
O41|Are long-run output growth rates falling?|This paper studies the evolution of long-run output and labour productivity growth rates in the G-7 countries during the post-war period. We estimate the growth rates consistent with a constant unemployment rate using time-varying parameter models that incorporate both stochastic volatility and a Heckman-type two-step estimation procedure that deals with the possible endogeneity problem in the econometric models. The results show a significant decline in long-run growth rates that is not associated with the detrimental effects of the Great Recession, and that the rate of growth of labour productivity appears to be behind the slowdown in long-run GDP growth.
O41|Optimal Capital Taxation with Incomplete Markets and Schumpeterian Growth|This paper characterizes quantitatively the optimal capital income tax rate in an OLG economy with uninsurable income risk, incomplete markets and endogenous Schumpeterian growth. Contrary to the most recent literature, it is found that it is virtually never optimal to tax capital: under the optimal scheme, in a series of cases, the highest proportional tax rate on capital is found to be less than 0.2%. The reason for this result lies in the reduced GDP (and wage) growth rate stemming from a higher capital tax rate. In General Equilibrium, the interest rate rises, and the increased cost of capital reduces the endogenous rate of innovation, leading to a negative response of the growth rate. Although the equilibrium effect on the growth rate is found to be quantitatively modest (approximately half a percentage point), it still has a first order consequence on welfare. The results show that moving to the optimal income tax schedule entails large welfare gains, approximately 5% in consumption equivalent. The results are robust along a number of dimensions, including the specification of preferences. An alternative formulation of the utility function,taken from a class consistent with a Balanced Growth Path, is calibrated to obtain an empirically plausible value for the Frisch elasticity of 0.5, and confirms all the results, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

O41|Capital price bubbles and dynamic inefficiency|We demonstrate that the price of physical capital in standard neoclassical one-sector growth models can exceed its fundamental value, that is, a capital price bubble can exist. It is furthermore shown that the existence of a capital price bubble is in general unrelated to the dynamic ine?ciency of equilibrium. We illustrate these results in the contexts of the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model with ?nitely many in?nitely-lived dynasties of households, the Blanchard-Yaari model with in?nitely many overlapping generations of ?nitely-lived households, and the Solow-Swan model without microfoundation. Our ?ndings are in contrast to those derived by Tirole [17] and they are complementary to those from Kocherlakota [8] and Tirole [18].
O41|"Progressive taxation and (in)stability in an exogenous growth model with non-market (""home"") production"|"We show that in a exogenous growth model with non-market (""home"") sector calibrated to Bulgarian data under the progressive taxation regime (1993-2007), the economy exhibits equilibrium indeterminacy due to the presence of non-market production. These results are in line with the findings in Benhabib and Farmer (1994, 1996) and Farmer (1999). Also, the findings in this paper are in contrast to Guo and Lansing (1988) who argue that progressive taxation works as an automatic stabilizer. Under the flat tax regime (2008-16), the economy calibrated to Bulgarian data displays saddle-path stability. The decrease in the average effective tax rate addresses the indeterminacy issue and eliminates the ""stable focus"" dynamics."
O41|A contribution to the theory of fertility and economic development|The aim of this research is to build on a theory for explaining economic development in a (neoclassical) growth model with endogenous fertility. The economy is comprised of overlapping generations of rational and identical individuals and identical competitive firms producing with a constant-returns-to-scale technology with no externalities. From a theoretical perspective, the distinguishing feature of this work is that endogenous fertility per se is able to explain the existence of low and high development regimes. It provides alternative reasons (history driven or expectations driven) why some countries enter development trajectories with high GDP and low fertility and others experience under-performances with low GDP and high fertility. The model is also able to reproduce fertility fluctuations and explain the baby busts and baby booms observed in the last century in some developed countries.
O41|A parsimonious model of longevity, fertility, HIV transmission and development|A central policy issue in the battle against HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is whether and when high-prevalence countries might become fully autonomous in designing and implementing their own intervention policies aimed to control the disease. The aim of this research is twofold. First, it develops a framework for explaining economic development in a general equilibrium growth model with endogenous fertility and endogenous longevity under the threat of a deadly enduring infectious disease, as is the case of HIV/AIDS in SSA. Second, it aims to shed light on the interplay between foreign aid and endogenous domestic public policies in those SSA countries severely afflicted by HIV. In particular, it investigates the macro-economic dynamic feasibility and related effects of an intervention policy where the overall amount of resources devoted to HIV/AIDS is the sum of an exogenous component representing foreign aid and an endogenous public expenditure. Both these policies allow to bring HIV under control, but show quite different responses in terms demo-economic variables, mainly passing through the fertility response to the evolving epidemic conditions.
O41|Three pillars of urbanization: Migration, aging, and growth|Economic development in industrialized countries is characterized by rising per capita GDP, increasing life expectancy, and an ever larger share of the population living in cities. We explain this pattern within a regional innovation-driven economic growth model with labor mobility and a demographic structure of overlapping generations. The model shows that there is a natural tendency for core-periphery structures to emerge in modern knowledge-based economies.
O41|Overhead labour costs in a neo-Kaleckian growth model with autonomous expenditures|"One of the most notable features of income distribution is the widening wage differential among workers: there is a redistribution in favor of top management at the detriment of ordinary workers. The paper incorporates this distinction between overhead managerial labour and direct labour into a neo-Kaleckian growth model with target-return pricing, where an autonomously growing demand component ultimately determines the long-run path of an economy. Our aim is to explore the role of overhead labour costs in the coevolution of income distribution and economic growth. When overhead labour is taken into account, the share of profits becomes an increasing function of the rate of utilization of capacity. This implies that empirical research based on the post-Kaleckian specification of the investment function may fail to isolate the pure profitability effects and is likely to be biased in finding a profit-led regime. Our model features convergence to a fully-adjusted position in the long run. This is achieved by simultaneous path-dependent adjustments, both in the normal rate of utilization of capacity and in the growth rate of sales expected by firms. We examine the parametric conditions under which the model achieves a wage-led growth regime, in the restricted sense that both the average rates of accumulation and utilization decrease during the transitional dynamics arising from an upward adjustment of the normal rate of profit. Moreover, it is shown that a more equitable wage distribution between the ""working rich"" and the ""working poor"" will strengthen the wage-led nature of the economy."
O41|Dilution effects, population growth and economic growth under human capital accumulation and endogenous technological change|This paper answers the following two questions: 1) In the data, can we find a dilution effect of population growth also on per-capita human capital investment? If yes, 2) how can we use this fact to explain theoretically the existence of a differential impact of population change on economic growth across countries? In the first part of the article we document empirically the considerable across-countries heterogeneity of a dilution effect of population growth also in regard to the process of per-capita human capital formation and observe that, at a country's level, population growth may be relevant (either positively or negatively) for economic growth depending on the specific way it affects the process of schooling-acquisition by agents. In the second part of the paper we use these results in order to build a multi-sector growth model which is capable of accounting (depending on the strength of the found dilution effect of population growth on per-capita human capital formation) for the non-monotonous correlation between demographic and economic growth rates in the long-run.
O41|Health insurance, endogenous medical progress, and health expenditure growth|We study the impact of health insurance expansion in the US on health expenditure, longevity growth and welfare in an overlapping generations economy in which individuals purchase health care to lower mortality. We consider three sectors: final goods production; a health care sector, selling medical services to individuals; and an R&D sector, selling increasingly effective medical technology to the health care sector. We calibrate the model to match the development of the US economy/health care system from 1965 to 2005 and study numerically the impact of the insurance expansion on health expenditures, medical progress and longevity. We find that more extensive health insurance accounts for a large share of the rise in US health spending but also boosts the rate of medical progress. A welfare analysis shows that while the moral hazard associated with subsidized health care creates excessive health care expenditure, the gains in life expectancy brought about by induced medical progress more than compensate for this. By mitigating an intergenerational externality associated with the longevity benefits from current medical innovation the expansion of health insurance constitutes a Pareto improvement.
O41|Technological progress, the supply of hours worked, and the consumption-leisure complementarity|At least since 1870 hours worked per worker declined and real wages increased in many of today's industrialized countries. The dual nature of technological progress in conjunction with a consumption-leisure complementarity explains these stylized facts. Technological progress drives real wages up and expands the amount of available consumption goods. Enjoying consumption goods increases the value of leisure. Therefore, individuals demand more leisure and supply less labor. This mechanism appears in an OLG-model with two-period lived individuals equipped with per-period utility functions of the generalized log-log type proposed by Boppart-Krusell (2016). The optimal plan is piecewise defined and hinges on the wage level. Technological progress moves a poor economy out of a regime with low wages and an inelastic supply of hours worked into a regime where wages increase further and hours worked continuously decline.
O41|Sharing Economy: Dynamic General Equilibrium Effects|Developments in digital technologies enabled the emergence and rapid growth of the sharing economy predicted to account for up to 5% of EU GDP in coming years. This paper contextualises these developments within a dynamic two sector model of the economy and analyses the effects of efficiency gains in the sharing sector on growth, income distribution and employment. We identify three sources of technological progress in the sharing sector and find that an expansion of this sector, in line with recent predictions, will lead to modest GDP growth and declines in both wage share and employment, if sharing is organised by profit maximising firms. We compare this solution to a case where households organise sharing directly and find that the sharing sector will be larger under the same technological conditions in the latter case.
O41|Gender Inequality as a Barrier to Economic Growth: a Review of the Theoretical Literature|In this article, we survey the theoretical literature investigating the role of gender inequality in economic development. The vast majority of theories reviewed suggest that gender inequality is a barrier to development, particularly over the long run. Among the many plausible mechanisms through which inequality between men and women aﬀects the aggregate economy, the role of women for fertility decisions and human capital investments is particularly important. Yet, we believe the body of theories could be expanded in several directions.
O41|We Are What We Eat: Obesity, Income, and Social Comparisons| The empirical evidence of a non-monotone relation between income and obesity is not well explained. We build a theoretical model combining income inequality and social comparisons to explain the link between income and obesity and study tax policy implications for fighting obesity. We assume that differences in food consumption patterns between poor and wealthy households partly reflect positionality, which is the concern for social status. Our key assumption is that positionality for low-calorie food consumption is positively related to a country’s wealth. In this framework, body weight outcomes reflect competing income and positionality effects, yielding the following results. We explain the link between average obesity rates, and standards of living and suggest the existence of a Kuznets curve for obesity. For cross sections of the population, we explain the observed correlation between income and obesity, which is positive in poor countries, and negative rich countries. We find that increasing the relative cost of high-calorie food is less effective at decreasing the relative weight of poor individuals in rich countries than in poor countries.
O41|Modelling Economic Development: The Lewis Model Updated|This analysis updates the dual-economy model of economic development suggested by W. Arthur Lewis in 1954. The updated aggregate model incorporates advances since then in modern labor economics and the findings of empirical studies of LDC economies and it removes Lewisâ€™ implicit assumption that capital-formation is costless to the host LDC country. Specifying investment in human capital for both sectors refocuses attention on workersâ€™ well-being as the ultimate measure of development. Specifying the cost of capital formation permits the distinction between earnings that recover investment costs and the â€œsurplusâ€ available to workers for consumption. Policy implications include resolution of tradeoffs between â€œtrickle-downâ€ vs. â€œgrass rootsâ€ development policies.
O41|On sunspot fluctuations in variable capacity utilization models|We investigate the extent to which standard one sector RBC models with positive externalities and variable capacity utilization can account for the large hump-shaped response of output when the model is submitted to a pure sunspot shock. We refine the Benhabib and Wen (2004) model considering a general type of additive separable preferences and a general production function. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of local stabilities and local bifurcations as a function of various structural parameters. We show that, when labor is infinitely elastic, local indeterminacy occurs through Flip and Hopf bifurcations for a large set of values for the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption, the degree of increasing returns to scale and the elasticity of capital–labor substitution. Finally, we provide a detailed quantitative assessment of the model and conclude with mixed results. We show that although the model is able theoretically to generate a hump-shaped dynamics of output following an i.i.d. sunspot shock under realistic parameter values, the hump is too persistent for the model to be considered fully satisfactory from an empirical point of view.
O41|Optimal Population Growth as an Endogenous Discounting Problem: The Ramsey Case|This paper revisits the optimal population size problem in a continuous time Ramsey setting with costly child rearing and both intergenerational and intertemporal altruism. The social welfare functions considered range from the Millian to the Benthamite. When population growth is endogenized, the associated optimal control problem involves an endogenous effective discount rate depending on past and current population growth rates, which makes preferences intertemporally dependent. We tackle this problem by using an appropriate maximum principle. Then we study the stationary solutions (balanced growth paths) and show the existence of two admissible solutions except in the Millian case. We prove that only one is optimal. Comparative statics and transitional dynamics are numerically derived in the general case.
O41|How crucial are preferences for non-tradable goods and cross-country sectoral TFP gap for integration?|This paper deals with the effects of economic integration in a 2x 2x 2 model of overlapping generations. We distinguish between a non-tradable and a tradable sector which use human and physical capital. We show that the preference for non-tradable consumption in total consumption expenditure and sectoral productivities are crucial factors to determine which country does benefit from integration in terms of economic growth. Short-run and long-run effects of integration may differ, especially when countries are heterogeneous and when there exist high cross border externalities in education. Moreover, an impatient country may lose to integration when it has a comparative advantage in the tradable sector and/or when the preference for non-tradable goods is high.
O41|A Note on Balanced-Budget Income Taxes and Aggregate (In)Stability in Multi-Sector Economies|We examine the impact of balanced-budget labor income taxes on the existence of expectation- driven business cycles in a two-sector version of the Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (SGU) [18] model with constant government expenditures and counter-cyclical taxes. Our results show that the destabilizing impact of labor income taxes strongly depends on the capital intensity difference across sectors. Local indeterminacy is indeed more likely when the consumption good sector is capital intensive, as the minimal tax rate decreases, and less likely when the investment good sector is capital intensive, as the minimal tax rate increases. The implication of this result can be quantitatively significant. Indeed, when compared to SGU, local indeterminacy can be either completely ruled out for all OECD countries when the investment good is sufficiently capital intensive, or drastically improved, delivering indeterminacy for a larger set of OECD countries, if the consumption good is sufficiently capital intensive. Focusing however on recent estimates of the sectoral capital shares corresponding to the empirically plausible case of a capital intensive consumption good, we find that there is a significant increase of the range of economically relevant labor tax rates (from a minimum tax rate of 30% to 24.7%) for which local indeterminacy arises with respect to the aggregate formulation of SGU.
O41|Time-varying Consumption Tax, Productive Government Spending, and Aggregate Instability|In this paper we study the dynamics of an economy with productive government spending under the assumption that the government balances its budget by levying endogenous non-linear consumption taxes. For standard specifcation of the utility function and production function, we prove that under counter-cyclical consumption taxes, while there exists a unique balanced growth path, sunspot equilibria based on self-fulfilling expectations occur through a form of global indeterminacy.
O41|Competitive Equilibrium Cycles for Small Discounting in Discrete-Time Two-Sector Optimal Growth Models|We study the existence of endogenous competitive equilibrium cycles under small discounting in a two-sector discrete-time optimal growth model. We provide precise concavity conditions on the indirect utility function leading to the existence of period-two cycles with a critical value for the discount factor that can be arbitrarily close to one. Contrary to the continuous-time case where the existence of periodic-cycles is obtained if the degree of concavity is close to zero, we show that in a discrete-time setting the driving condition does not require a close to zero degree of concavity but a symmetry of the indirect utility function’s concavity properties with respect to its two arguments.
O41|Non-Balanced Endogenous Growth and Structural Change: When Romer Meets Kaldor and Kuznets|We propose a model of non-balanced endogenous growth in which the final good, which can be either consumed or used as capital, is produced using two intermediate inputs, one being “knowledge-intensive”. Agents working in the knowledge-intensive sector need to accumulate technological knowledge and thus have to decide how to split their individual unit of time between accumulation of technological knowledge (research) and work. Agents working in the second sector do not need to accumulate knowledge and thus devote all their individual unit of time to work. Individual knowledge therefore becomes a labor-augmenting factor, and knowledge accumulation leads to an unbounded increase in TFP in the knowledge-intensive sector, and thus to endogenous capital deepening. The asymmetry in the growth rates of TFP leads to non-balanced growth. Labor (number of workers) reallocations across sectors occur, leading to a greater increase in output for the knowledge-intensive sector. We show that non-balanced growth is consistent with Kaldor facts, as the asymptotic equilibrium is above all characterized by a constant interest rate and capital share in national income. However, the economy follows a growth path converging to a particular level of wealth that depends on the initial price of capital and knowledge. As a consequence, countries with the same fundamentals but lower initial wealth will be characterized by lower asymptotic wealth. We therefore extend the Lucas [19] finding and prove the existence of non-convergence across countries in a framework with structural change.
O41|Technology, Market Structure and the Gains from Trade|We study the gains from trade in an economy with oligopolistic competition, firm heterogeneity, and innovation. Oligopolistic competition together with free entry make markups responsive to firm productivity and trade costs. Lowering trade costs reduces markups on domestic sales but increases markups on export sales, as firms do not pass the entire reduction in trade costs onto foreign consumers. Nevertheless, the downward pressure dominates and the average markup declines, deterring firms from entering the market and leading to higher market concentration. Neither the increased concentration nor the incomplete pass-through of trade costs to export markups are strong enough to compensate for the increase in competition on domestic sales. Thus the overall effect of trade on markups is pro-competitive and a key source of the associated welfare gains. In addition to markups, selection and innovation provide additional channels through which the trade-induced effect on competition impacts welfare. In a quantitative exercise, we decompose the total gains from trade into these three contributing channels; we find that innovation plays a small but non-negligible role, while the main component is equally split between the pro-competitive and the selection channel.
O41|Is the output growth rate in NIPA a welfare measure?|National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) measure real output growth by means of a Fisher ideal chain index. Bridging modern macroeconomics and the economic theory of index numbers, this paper shows that output growth as measured by NIPA is welfare based. In a dynamic general equilibrium model with genreral recursive preferences and technology, welfare depends on present and future consumption. Indeed, the associated Bellman equation provides a representation of preferences in the domain of current consumption and current investment. Applying standard index number theory to this representation of preferences shows that the Fisher-Shell true quantity index is equal to the Divisia index, in turn well approximated by the Fisher ideal index used in NIPA.
O41|Unemployment and Development|This paper draws on household survey data from countries of all income levels to measure how average unemployment rates vary with income per capita. We document that unemployment is increasing with GDP per capita. Furthermore, we show that this fact is accounted for almost entirely by low-educated workers, whose unemployment rates are strongly increasing in GDP per capita, rather than by high-educated workers, whose unemployment rates are not correlated with income. To interpret these facts, we build a model with workers of heterogeneous ability and two sectors: a traditional sector, in which self-employed workers produce output without reward for ability; and a modern sector, in which firms hire in frictional labor markets, and output increases with ability. Countries differ exogenously in the productivity level of the modern sector. The model predicts that as productivity rises, the traditional sector shrinks, as progressively less-able workers enter the modern sector, leading to a rise in overall unemployment and in the ratio of low-educated to high-educated unemployment rates. Quantitatively, the model accounts for around one third of the cross-country patterns we document.
O41|Green Innovation And Economic Growth In A North-South Model|If one region of the world switches its research effort from dirty to clean technologies, will other regions follow? To investigate this question we built a North-South model that combines insights from directed technological change and quality ladder endogenous growth models. We allow researchers in the South to create business-stealing innovations. We found that (i) after the North switches from dirty to clean technologies, the growing value of clean markets will motivate technology firms in the South to follow the switch; however this result is conditional on the North being sufficiently large. (ii) If the two regions invest research effort to different sectors and the outputs of the two sectors are gross substitutes, then the long run growth rates in both regions are smaller than if the global research effort were to be invested in one sector. (iii) If the North switches to R&D in clean technologies, the benevolent central planner in the South would ensure that all South R&D switches too, unless the planner’s discount rate is high.
O41|Agricultural Productivity and Structural Change: Is Relative Sectoral Price the Mirror Image of Relative Sectoral Productivity?|We have examined the role of sectoral productivity in explaining the process of structural change and relative sectoral prices. Our simple two- sector general equilibrium model demonstrates that an improvement in agricultural productivity can relocate labour away from this sector. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that relative sectoral prices are a mirror image of relative sectoral productivities, we showed a U-shaped relation- ship between them. We estimated our model parameters using the simu- lated method of moments. Our model could largely replicate the farm versus non-farm relative price movement and the agricultural labour share of US economic history. JEL Classification: F43, O11, O41.

O41|Unemployment and growth|Post Keynesian (PK) growth models typically fail to model unemployment. That shows up in the absence of any equilibrium condition requiring the growth of employment equal effective labor supply growth. Consequently, the models can have an imploding or exploding unemployment rate. The underlying analytical problem is failure to resolve the Harrod (1939) knife edge problem. This paper shows how the knife-edge problem can be resolved via a Kaldor - Hicks technological progress function. The paper applies the concept to several different PK growth models. In the Harrod, super-multiplier, Cambridge, and neo-Kaleckian models the warranted rate rules the roost and natural rate forces have no impact on the equilibrium growth rate. However, in a modified neo-Kaleckian model with labor market distribution conflict both warranted rate and natural rate forces impact steady state growth.
O41|The role of autonomous demand growth in a neo-Kaleckian conflicting-claims framework|This paper incorporates the role of an independently growing autonomous demand component into a neo-Kaleckian model of growth and distribution where the distribution of income reacts to changes in the employment rate. A peculiar feature of these autonomous expenditures is that in contrast to investment they are non-capacity creating. The model combines the Sraffian multiplier, a conflicting-claims theory of inflation, a Harrodian instability mechanism and effects tied to the size of the reserve army of labor. The long-run version of the model converges conditionally to stable rates of employment and inflation, at the normal rate of capacity utilization. The model vindicates some of the main Keynesian or Kaleckian tenets, in the sense that an increase in the marginal propensity to save out of profits or in the bargaining power of firms generate lower average rates of capital accumulation and capacity utilization during the traverse.
O41|The economics of the super-multiplier|This paper links the super-multiplier to Keynesian macroeconomics, showing it to be the most Keynesian of growth perspectives. Next, the paper shows that the super-multiplier is a micro-economically coherent theory of investment and capital accumulation. Firms' decisions regarding capital accumulation coordinate demand and supply growth in goods markets. The paper then explores the implications of incorporating the super-multiplier in the Neo-Kaleckian and Cambridge growth models. Lastly, it shows how labor markets and unemployment can be added into super-multiplier models to provide a comprehensive growth model that addresses Solow's (1956) labor market knife-edge problem. Incorporating labor markets does not change the fundamental super-multiplier result that growth is determined by the growth of autonomous demand.
O41|An Horizontal Innovation Growth Model with Endogenous Time Allocation and Non-Stable Demography|We propose a decentralized endogenous growth model in order to study the transitional dynamics associated with the process of population aging in a small open economy, that has endogenous time allocation and two growth engines: R&D and human capital accumulation. Growth of per capita output is affected negatively by the difference in the rates of growth of labor force and of the total population in the period where the weight of the labor force decreases to a new and lower level. The biggest impact on per capita output growth should be during the period where labor force grows at a lower rate than the popu- lation unless it is compensated by some other effect. Under some assumptions, a decrease in the corporate tax improves growth.
O41|Population Aging, Labor Market Frictions, and PAYG Pension|Employing a two-period OLG model with labor market frictions and PAYG pension, this paper examines the effects of population aging on the unemployment rate and the per capita output of the economy. We show that in economies in which the population growth rate is already low and the size of PAYG pension is relatively large, a further decline in the population growth rate reduces the unemployment rate and increases the per capita output of the economy in the short run, but it increases the unemployment rate and reduces the per capita output of the economy in the long run.
O41|International R&D Spillovers, Innovation by Learning from Abroad and Medium-Run Fluctuations|Many developed economies experienced large and correlated fluctuations in the medium run during the postwar period. A good number of industrialized countries experienced high productivity growth during the 1960s and low growth between the early 1970s and the early 1980s. This paper develops a model of medium-run fluctuations incorporating research and development (R&D)-based endogenous growth and international R&D spillovers from a technologically leading country to a technologically lagging country. An important feature of the model is that a key role of the lagging country's R&D is innovation by leaning (IBL) from abroad. After calibration using U.S. and Japanese data, the model shows that changes in U.S.R&D expenditure alone can substantially explain Japan's medium-run fluctuations.The paper argues that the diffusion of U.S. innovations (generated by U.S. R&D) to Japan plays an important role in determining Japan's medium-run fluctuations
O41|Periodic solutions of the one-sector growth model: The role of income effects|The discrete-time version of the neoclassical one-sector growth model with elastic labour supply is considered. It is shown that this model can have periodic solutions only if leisure is not a normal good.

O41|A Note on Balanced-Budget Income Taxes and Aggregate (In)Stability in Multi-Sector Economies|We examine the impact of balanced-budget labor income taxes on the existence of expectation- driven business cycles in a two-sector version of the Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (SGU) [18] model with constant government expenditures and counter-cyclical taxes. Our results show that the destabilizing impact of labor income taxes strongly depends on the capital intensity difference across sectors. Local indeterminacy is indeed more likely when the consumption good sector is capital intensive, as the minimal tax rate decreases, and less likely when the investment good sector is capital intensive, as the minimal tax rate increases. The implication of this result can be quantitatively significant. Indeed, when compared to SGU, local indeterminacy can be either completely ruled out for all OECD countries when the investment good is sufficiently capital intensive, or drastically improved, delivering indeterminacy for a larger set of OECD countries, if the consumption good is sufficiently capital intensive. Focusing however on recent estimates of the sectoral capital shares corresponding to the empirically plausible case of a capital intensive consumption good, we find that there is a significant increase of the range of economically relevant labor tax rates (from a minimum tax rate of 30% to 24.7%) for which local indeterminacy arises with respect to the aggregate formulation of SGU.
O41|Competitive Equilibrium Cycles for Small Discounting in Discrete-Time Two-Sector Optimal Growth Models|We study the existence of endogenous competitive equilibrium cycles under small discounting in a two-sector discrete-time optimal growth model. We provide precise concavity conditions on the indirect utility function leading to the existence of period-two cycles with a critical value for the discount factor that can be arbitrarily close to one. Contrary to the continuous-time case where the existence of periodic-cycles is obtained if the degree of concavity is close to zero, we show that in a discrete-time setting the driving condition does not require a close to zero degree of concavity but a symmetry of the indirect utility function's concavity properties with respect to its two arguments.
O41|Non-Balanced Endogenous Growth and Structural Change: When Romer Meets Kaldor and Kuznets|"We propose a model of non-balanced endogenous growth in which the final good, which can be either consumed or used as capital, is produced using two intermediate inputs, one being ""knowledge-intensive"". Agents working in the knowledge-intensive sector need to accumulate technological knowledge and thus have to decide how to split their individual unit of time between accumulation of technological knowledge (research) and work. Agents working in the second sector do not need to accumulate knowledge and thus devote all their individual unit of time to work. Individual knowledge therefore becomes a labor-augmenting factor, and knowledge accumulation leads to an unbounded increase in TFP in the knowledge-intensive sector, and thus to endogenous capital deepening. The asymmetry in the growth rates of TFP leads to non-balanced growth. Labor (number of workers) reallocations across sectors occur, leading to a greater increase in output for the knowledge-intensive sector. We show that non-balanced growth is consistent with Kaldor facts, as the asymptotic equilibrium is above all characterized by a constant interest rate and capital share in national income. However, the economy follows a growth path converging to a particular level of wealth that depends on the initial price of capital and knowledge. As a consequence, countries with the same fundamentals but lower initial wealth will be characterized by lower asymptotic wealth. We therefore extend the Lucas [19] finding and prove the existence of non-convergence across countries in a framework with structural change."
O41|Employee Profit-sharing and Labor Extraction in a Classical Model of Distribution and Growth| This article sets out a classical model of economic growth in which the distribution of income features the possibility of profit-sharing with workers, as firms choose periodically between two labor-extraction compensation strategies. Workers are homogeneous with regard to labor power, and firms choose to compensate them with either only a conventional wage or a share of profits on top of this conventional wage. Empirical evidence shows that labor productivity (i.e. labor extraction) in profit-sharing firms is higher than labor productivity in non-sharing firms. The frequency distribution of labor-extraction employee compensation strategies and labor productivity across firms is time-variant, being driven by satisficing imitation dynamics from which we derive two significant results. First, heterogeneity in labor-extraction compensation strategies across firms, and hence earnings inequality across workers can be a stable long-run equilibrium outcome. Second, although convergence to a long-run equilibrium may occur with either a falling or increasing proportion of profit-sharing firms, the share of net profits in income and the rates of net profit, capital accumulation and economic growth nevertheless all converge to the highest possible long-run equilibrium values.
O41|Does financial sector development affect the growth gains from trade opennes?|A sizeable literature suggests that financial sector development could be an important enabler of the growth benefits of trade openness. We provide a comprehensive analysis of how financial development can affect the relationship between trade openness and growth using a dynamic panel threshold model and an extensive dataset for a large sample of countries for the 1970-2015 period. We find that there is a financial development threshold in which trade openness has a positive and significant effect on economic growth. We also find that when splitting the sample into industrialized and non-industrialized countries, the financial development threshold that enables the growth benefits of trade is higher in the former group of countries than in the latter. This finding is consistent with the fact that the export composition of industrialized countries is tilted towards more capital-intensive finance-constrained goods.
O41|Housing and the business cycle revisited|I present a multisectoral DSGE model with housing, real frictions, and variable capital utilization that generates aggregate and sectoral co-movements due to uncorrelated sector-specific shocks. Major advances are the robust positive correlations of residential investment with house prices and business investment. In addition, business investment is lagging other economic activities. The key improvements are adjustment costs to business investment. I identify the parameters of the exogenous shock processes, business adjustment costs, and variable capital utilization with Bayesian estimation; the results confirm those obtained from earlier work in this field.
O41|The changing structure of goverment consumption spending|We document a secular increase in the share of purchases from the private sector in government consumption spending: over time the government purchases relatively more private-sector goods, and relies less on its own production of value added. We build a general equilibrium model in which investment-specifi c technological change accounts for the changing structure of government spending. The model predicts that this secular process alters the transmission of government spending shocks by raising the response of private value added, while dampening the response of hours. We validate these results with novel empirical evidence on the effects of government spending across countries.
O41|Fiscal policy in the US: a new measure of uncertainty and its recent development|We use the dispersion of the Federal Budget Balance forecasts from Consensus Economics to produce a new measure of fiscal uncertainty; constant horizon forecasts are obtained through mixture distributions. The scheme we propose has several advantages over previous uncertainty measures. First (as opposed to recent proposals) it results in a forward-looking measure, which implies that any sudden development in (un)expected fiscal stance is immediately incorporated in the series. Second, the measure is by construction a real-time one. Third, being completely model-free it is not contaminated (inflated) by model uncertainty. Fourth, it is comprehensive in accounting both for the critical welfare component of public expenditures and for taxes, i.e. it does not simply track uncertainty stemming from public consumption and investment. Fifth, as opposed to uncertainty indexes which can be interpreted only dynamically, our measure has an obvious intuitive point-wise interpretation. Interestingly, the inception of the Trump administration has led to unprecedented uncertainty shocks which are shown to have put a non-negligible brake on the US slow recovery. On a more general level, we show that fiscal uncertainty shocks have clear recessionary effects. Furthermore, constraints on monetary policies during the ZLB have likely caused the recessionary effects of fiscal uncertainty shocks to be stronger.
O41|On the Global Misallocation of Human Capital|Is human capital allocated efficiently across countries? To answer this question, we need to differentiate misallocation from factor intensity differences. We use newly available estimates on natural resources shares from Monge-Naranjo et al. (2017) to correctly measure the factor shares of physical and human capital for a large number of countries and periods. We find that the global efficiency losses of the misallocation of human capital are around 60% of the world's output. Moreover, the misallocation of human capital seems to have worsened in the more recent years. Interestingly, we show that when physical and human capital can both be reallocated, physical capital would often ow from poor to rich countries, contrary to Lucas (1990)'s paradox.
O41|The effects of prudential regulation, financial development and financial openness on economic growth|This paper studies the effects of prudential regulation, financial development, and financial openness on economic growth. Using both existing models and a new OLG framework with banking and prudential regulation in the form of capital requirements, the first part presents an analytical review of the various channels through which prudential regulation can affect growth. The second part provides a reduced-form empirical analysis, based on panel regressions for a sample of 64 advanced and developing economies. The results show that growth may be promoted by prudential policies whose goal is to mitigate financial risks to the economy. At the same time, financial openness tends to reduce the growth benefits of these policies, possibly because of either greater opportunities to borrow abroad or increased scope for cross-border leakages in regulation.
O41|Heterogeneous R&D spillovers and sustainable growth: Limits to efficient regulation|This paper introduces heterogeneity of cross-technologies interactions into the double-differentiated R&D-based endogenous growth model. In this model new technologies appear continuously and older are outdated generating structural change. All technologies may interact with each other through knowledge spillovers which are technology-specific and this results in innovations' heterogeneity. The conditions on the shape of these interactions for the existence of the (sustained) growth path in the decentralized economy as well as for the social planner's problem are estab- lished. Next the necessity for government interventions depending on the complexity of these interactions is studied. At last the scale and duration of interventions are demonstrated to be functions of spectral properties of the interactions operator.
O41|"A Comment on Oulton, ""The UK Productivity Puzzle: Does Arthur Lewis Hold the Key?"""|"In Version One of his new paper, Oulton merges supply-side and demand-side theoretical models as a means better to understand why, since the financial crisis that broke in 2007, the UK’s productivity growth has not only been negligible but also a very poor outlier judged by international experience. Drawing on Arthur Lewis’s famous model of development, Oulton concludes, ""rapid rates of immigration in conjunction with low rates of growth of export demand in the aftermath of the Great Recession can explain the UK productivity puzzle"". According to Oulton, the UK's relatively poor productivity performance is attributable to a combination of the export demand constraint and of the continued growth of labour supply, which led to capital shallowing - a reduction in the rate of growth of capital services per hour worked. Bill Martin concludes, alas, that Arthur Lewis does not hold the key. The dominant, proximate ""explanation"" of the UK's relatively poor performance is relatively weak Total Factor Productivity (TFP), not relatively weak capital intensity. Moreover, the UK was not relatively more exposed to export demand shocks but delivered relatively worse output growth outcomes. Oulton nevertheless articulates the profound idea that full-employment capacity has adjusted to weak effective demand arising from adverse global developments. If this deep insight is correct, TFP would be a ""measure of our ignorance"" of the mechanisms that drove productive capacity to align with low aggregate demand."
O41|ICT, Leisure Externality and Wellbeing|ICTs that offers various goods and services to be used specially during the leisure time create two types of favourable ‘leisure externality’ - on direct utility and income through the formation of knowledge and social capital required productivity improvement. The paper builds a two-sector static model with consumption and leisure goods to capture such leisure externalities endogenously. Raising marginal benefits of leisure, one externality increases the demand for labour to meet additional production for ICT goods and consumption goods. This apart, the other externality raises productivity through knowledge formation, which could bind the labour demand. In effect, both income and utility tend to rise in presence both externalities, but it does not necessarily reduce the gap between them (known as Eastelin paradox) and depends upon their relative strengths .
O41|A post-kaleckian model with productivity growth and the real exchange rate applied to selected latin american countries|This paper aims to discuss the theory of productivity growth and its empirical applications, several authors emphasize the impact of real exchange rate devaluation on productivity. The main research question is: does the real exchange rate have a positive or negative impact on productivity growth? The first step in answering this question is to discuss productivity growth in the context of demand regimes. The second step consists of an empirical experiment that estimates the productivity growth equation for a sample of Latin American countries. The overall outcome is that the Kaldor–Verdoorn coefficient is significant for all the analysed countries, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay and Venezuela. The wage-push variable is significant for only two countries, Bolivia and Chile, indicating that in Bolivia the regime is profit-led whereas in Chile it is wage-led. Regarding the real exchange rate and this variable squared, the parameters are negative for all the countries, indicating that real exchange rate devaluation does not increase productivity growth.
O41|Productivity, real exchange rate, and aggregate demand: An empirical exercise applied to Brazil from 1960 to 2011| This research analyzes, from a post Kaleckian perspective, the interactions among the aggregate demand, the real exchange rate, productivity, and real wages in the Brazilian economy from 1960 to 2011. It adopts the longstanding perspective that demand is the driver of capital accumulation and economic growth. The research comprises the following steps: (a) a critical assessment of the growth regime literature, with a particular emphasis on issues related to productivity and the real exchange rate; (b) understanding the relationship between the real exchange rate and the productivity and growth regimes; (c) proposing a theoretical model that relates the real exchange rate, productivity, and the growth regime; and (d) an empirical test of the interaction between the real exchange rate, productivity, and the growth regime. Theoretically the study develops a model showing the interactions between the aggregate demand, the real exchange rate, productivity, and real wages. Furthermore, this research attempts to address the lack of theoretical and empirical studies about the relationship between the aggregate demand, the real exchange rate, productivity and real wages.
O41|Growth and the geography of knowledge|We analyse how spatial disparities in innovation activities, coupled with migration costs, affect economic geography, growth and regional inequality. We provide conditions for existence and uniqueness of a spatial equilibrium, and for the endogenous emergence of industry clusters. Spatial variations in knowledge spillovers lead to spatial concentration of more innovative firms. Migration costs, however, limit the concentration of economic activities in the most productive region. Narrowing the gap in knowledge spillovers across regions raises growth, and reduces regional inequality by making firms more sensitive to wage differentials. The associated change in the spatial concentration of industries has positive welfare effects.
O41|Characterizing Sustainability in Discrete Time|We examine the investment rule that must be satisfied by an efficient and egalitarian path in a discrete-time version of the Dasgupta-Heal-Solow model of capital accumulation and resource depletion. In the discrete-time model, competitive valuation of net investments in terms of early and late pricing differs. We redefine Hartwick's rule to require zero value of net investments at a valuation rule intermediate between these two. Using this definition, we show that along an efficient and egalitarian path, Hartwick's rule is followed in all time periods. We thereby establish the converse of Hartwick's result in discrete time, and we do so under weaker assumptions than those in the existing literature on how output varies as a function of capital and resource use. Our redefinition of Hartwick's rule follows naturally if discrete time is viewed as providing information at discrete points in time of an underlying continuous-time process.
O41|The UK (and Western) productivity puzzle: does Arthur Lewis hold the key?|I propose a new explanation for the UK productivity puzzle. I graft the Lewis (1954) model onto a standard Solow growth model. What I call the neo-Lewis model is identical to the Solow model in good times. But in bad times foreign demand for a country’s exports is constrained below potential supply. This makes labour productivity growth depend negatively on the growth of labour input. I also argue that the neo-Lewis model can explain the fall in TFP growth, in the UK and elsewhere, after 2007. The predictions of the neoLewis model are tested on data for 23 advanced countries and also on a larger sample of 52 countries and find support.
O41|Social Interactions and Modern Economic Growth|This paper offers a theoretical framework to understand the coevolution of social interactions and long-term economic growth. It begins by considering that most traditional societies did not have educational markets. Thus, access to the required knowledge for transiting to a modern economy had to be transmitted through social interactions, in particular, through the interaction between heterogeneous groups of people–i.e. distant interactions. Once immersed in a modern economy, the productive system should have increased the demand for knowledge, promoting more distant interactions. Simultaneously, the emergence of distant interactions should have affected the connectivity of society, reducing its heterogeneity, making cheaper posterior interactions but reducing their profitability. Moreover, social interactions competed and benefited from other non-market activities, child rearing specifically. The model arrives at four basic predictions. First, modern economic growth brings a more cohesive society. Second, modern economic growth brings long-term reductions in fertility with potential short-term increases. Third, initial barriers to social interactions could explain the timing of modern economic growth arrival. Fourth, the timing of modern economic growth arrival could explain current output levels. I exploit different data sources to offer evidence in support of these predictions.
O41|Neutral or factor saving innovations?|We present a theoretical argument to identify the conditions under which a firm prefers to invest in factor saving innovations rather than neutral innovations. We prove that incentives to invest in factor saving innovations positively depend on i) total factor productivity and ii) the scarcity of the factor.
O41|Disentangling Occupation- and Sector-specific Technological Change|Occupational and sectoral labor market patterns display a significant overlap. This implies that economic models can explain these patterns to a large degree through either sector- or occupation-specific technological change, but stay silent about the level of specificity. We propose a model where technologies evolve at the sector-occupation level, allowing us to extract sector-only and occupation-only components and to quantify their importance. We find that most of productivity changes are occupation-specific, but that there is also a sizable sector component. We contrast the data and our baseline model against implications of models where technological change is restricted to be either at the sector or at the occupation level, or both. All three restricted models can replicate both sectoral and occupational outcomes very well, but occupation-specific changes are crucial for within-sector changes of occupational employment and income shares.
O41|Long Run Growth in Haiti|In this paper, we first assess the historical evolution of total factor productivity in Haiti and then consider alternative scenarios related to accelerating growth. Specifically, we focus on issues of intertemporal coordination between population growth, TFP (Total Factor Productivity), capital accumulation, foreign debt, output, and consumption. To that end, we developed a model of the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans type. This class of models are the workhorse of most contemporary work in modeling the long and very long term growth of countries (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 2004 and Acemoglu 2009). In doing so, we make two contributions to the empirical economic analysis of developing countries such as Haiti: (a) we estimate Haiti’s capital stock and perform a growth accounting exercises using data that goes back to the 1950s; and (b) we built a 2016 macro consistent dataset and use it to calibrate a long-run growth model for a small open economy such as Haiti.
O41|Heterogeneous Human Capital, Inequality and Growth: The Role of Patience and Skills|We extend the Lucas' 1988 model introducing two classes of agents with heterogeneous skills, discount factors and initial human capital endowments. We consider two regimes according to the planner's political constraints. In the meritocratic regime, the planner faces individual constraints. In the redistributive regime, the planner faces an aggregate constraint. We find that heterogeneity matters, particularly with redistribution. In the meritocratic regime, the optimal solution coincides with the BGP found by Lucas (1988) for the representative agent's case. In contrast, in the redistribution case, the solution for time devoted to capital accumulation is never interior for both agents. Either the less talented agents do not accumulate human capital or the more skilled agents do not work. Moreover, social welfare under the redistribution regime is always higher than under meritocracy and it is optimal to exploit existing differences. Finally, we find that inequality in human capital distribution increases in time and that, in the long run, inequality always promotes growth.
O41|Models of Continuous Dynamics on the 2-Simplex and Applications in Economics|In this paper, we discuss the models of continuous dynamics on the 2-simplex that arise when different qualitative restrictions are imposed on the (continuous) functions that generate the dynamics on the 2-simplex. We consider three types of qualitative restrictions: inequality (or set-theoretical) conditions, monotonicity/curvature (or differential-geometrical) conditions, and topological conditions (referring to (transversal) non-(self-)intersection of trajectories). We discuss the implications of these restrictions for transitional and limit dynamics on the 2-simplex and the wide range of potential and existing applications of the resulting system-theoretical models in economics and, in particular, in economic growth and development theory.
O41|The Changing Structure of Government Spending|We document that advanced economies experience a secular increase in the share of purchases from the private sector in total government spending, implying that over time governments purchase relatively more private-sector goods, and rely less on own production of value added. We build a calibrated general equilibrium model to show that this secular process can be accounted for by investment-specific technological change. We then use the model to measure the effect of this secular process on the transmission of fiscal policy, and find that (i) it shifts the stimulative effects of government spending towards private economic activity and (ii) it dampens the response of hours - but not of output - to fiscal shocks.
O41|A Dynamic Analysis of Demand and Productivity Growth in a Two-sector Kaleckian Model|This study extends a two-sector Kaleckian model of growth and income distribution by incorporating the dynamics of labour productivity growth. The economy is composed of investment goods and consumption goods producing sectors, with the sectoral demand and productivity growth interaction dynamically formalized. The study analyses the conditions for the cyclical demand and productivity growth phenomena in a two-sector economy. The model reveals that each sector may present a different response in capacity utilization rate to a change in sectoral income distribution. These phenomena are specific to two-sector models, and cannot be observed with a conventional aggregate growth model.
O41|An AB-SFC Model of Induced Technical Change along Classical and Keynesian Lines|This paper introduces the classical idea about the so-called directed and induced technical change (ITC) within a Keynesian demand-side and evolutionary endogenous growth model in order to analyze the interplay among technical change, long-run economic growth and functional income distribution. An ITC process is analyzed within an Agent-Based Stock-Flow Consistent (AB-SFC) model, wherein credit-constrained heterogeneous firms choose both the intensity and the direction of the innovation towards a labor- or capital-saving choice of technique. In the long-run, the model reproduces the so-called Kaldor stylized facts (i.e. with a purely labor-saving technical change), however during the transitional phase the model shows a labor-saving/capital-using innovation pattern, as the aggregate output-capital ratio decreases until it stabilizes in the long-run, as well as declining labor share for long time periods and we can ascribe these evidences mainly to the directed technical change process. In order to stress the effective role of the innovation bias on the model dynamics, we compare the baseline scenario with a counterfactual scenario wherein a neutral technical progress is at work.
O41|Romer meets Kongsamut–Rebelo–Xie in a nonbalanced growth model|To explain the newly found empirical relationship between human capital accumulation and structural change, the paper introduces Romer (1990)’s endogenous technological change into the multi-sector growth model pioneered by KRX (1997, 2001), and shows that an increase in the level of human capital accelerates the structural transformation of the economy, while the incremental effect of human capital on structural change is smaller at higher levels of human capital. The theoretical results of the combined model matches the empirical findings very well.
O41|Solow-Swan growth model with global capital markets and congestible public goods|The traditional Solow-Swan growth framework has only one kind privately owned capital. Output saved in a period is transformed into privately owned capital through the saving channel. We add a fiscal channel that taxes output and transforms it into public goods subject to congestion. We show that under the standard conditions the steady state of the economy is determined by the interaction of these two channels and prosperity for a country is only attained if both channels work properly.
O41|Kuznets meets Lucas: Structural Change and Human Capital|This paper develops a multi-sector growth model with human capital accumulation. In this model, human capital induces structural change through two channels: changes in relative prices and changes in the investment rate of physical and human capital. We show that the specifications of the model give rise to a generalized balanced growth path. Furthermore, we show that the model is consistent with (i) the decline in agriculture, (ii) the hump-shaped of manufacturing, (iii) the rise of the services sector and (iv) the path of human capital accumulation in the U.S economy during the twenty century. Given our findings, we outline that imbalances between physical and human capital contribute to explain cross-country differences in the pace of structural change.
O41|How Internal Violence Lowers Economic Growth: A Theoretical and Empirical Study|In this paper, we introduce a new variable called Internal Violence Index (IVI) and study its effects on economic growth both theoretically and empirically. The first part builds a stochastic endogenous growth model which demonstrates that Internal Violence harms economic growth. On the theoretical side, this paper is the first to introduce a fully-micro-founded endogenous economic growth model that illustrates the explicit effect of Internal Violence on long-run growth in a stochastic dynamic optimization in continuous time framework. On the empirical side, this paper is also the first to employ Linear Regressions and Instrumental Variables Estimations techniques to empirically study the impact of Internal Violence on economic growth. The empirical results corroborate the theoretical predictions that Internal Violence acts negatively on economic growth. The negative impact of Internal Violence on growth are maintained when we use alternative measurements of Internal Violence and subsamples of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Non Least Developed Countries.
O41|North-South Trade and Uneven Development in a Classical Conventional Wage Share Growth Model|This study presents a model of North-South trade and uneven development, and investigates the growth rates of both countries under the trade pattern such that the North specializes in investment goods while the South specializes in consumption goods. In contrast to existing studies, we close the model by fixing each countries' income distribution, specifically, the ratio of labor share to capital share. Using the model, we conduct the following two analyses. First, assuming that both countries already engage in international trade and that the North specializes in investment goods while the South specializes in consumption goods, we investigate the dynamics of both countries' growth rates and the terms of trade. Second, we investigate the condition under which such a trade pattern holds, and compare equilibrium variables under autarky and equilibrium values under free trade. From the first analysis, it follows that both countries grow at the same rate in the long run. From the second analysis, however, it follows that in the first place, the terms of trade must lie within the interval between the relative prices of both countries and that both countries' growth rates may not equalize as long as both countries engage in trade.
O41|タイトル：カレツキアン・モデルの基本骨格――短期モデルと長期モデル――<BR>[The Basic Framework of the Kaleckian Model of Growth and Distribution: Short-run Model and Long-run Model]|This study explains the basic framework of the short-run Kaleckian model and the long-run Kaleckian model. The short-run Kaleckian model is a model in which the rate of capacity utilization is adjusted in response to excess demand and excess supply of the goods market with given capital stock. The long-run Kaleckian model is a model in which capital stock is adjusted in response to the difference between the desired rate of capital accumulation and the actual rate of capital accumulation. Moreover, we endogenize the profit share by introducing the reserve-army effect. By adding different elements to these basic Kaleckian models, one can build an extended Kaleckian model according to his/her purpose.
O41|Development of a two-sector model with an extended energy sector and application to Portugal (1960-2014)|In basic economic growth models, energy is neglected as a production factor, and output is generated from capital and labor in a single-sector process, with most of growth attributed to an exogenous residual. However, alternative approaches argue for a multi-sector system in which the major contribution to growth comes from increased efficiency in the conversion of energy to more productive forms. In this work we develop a two-sector model for the economy, featuring an extended energy sector, including all primary-to-final (energy industries) and final-to-useful (end-use devices) exergy conversion processes. Exergy is a thermodynamics concept, accounting for the potential of energy to perform work. Empirical application of the model for a single country (Portugal) requires decomposition and reclassification of national accounts and energy balances, to match empirical data with the model’s variables. Obtained estimates for the price of useful exergy (an intermediate product) facilitate the construction of gross output measures for more accurate growth accounting. Evidence suggests that declining useful exergy prices act as an engine of growth, as previously suggested in the literature. Additionally, useful exergy and capital inputs to non-energy related production act as complements while capital productivity in useful exergy generation declines slightly in the past decade.
O41|Financialization and Endogenous Technological Change: a Post-Kaleckian Perspective|In post-Keynesian literature, Hein (2012a) was the first to incorporate financialization as an influential positive determinant of the rate of technological change. However, financialization is more like a two-edged sword which can affect technological progress negatively as well. We capture both the positive as well as the negative effect of financialization on technological progress which encapsulates the possibility of multiple equilibria. In analyzing the long run of the model we endogenize the financialization parameter as well. We then show how two subsystems (technological progress and financialization dynamics) when interact with each other, can produce instability and cycles for the whole system. We show that under certain circumstances, higher speed of diffusion of technological innovation, more regulated financial markets, and higher intra-class competition among firms are desirable for stabilizing the economy. Finally, we provide some policy prescriptions for the same.
O41|Endogenous constraints, coefficients of economic distance, and economic performance of African countries – An exploratory essay|Existing literature has overstressed the importance of exogenous constraints in the economic performance of African countries at the expense of endogenous constraints, although the latter are longer-lasting and more self-propagating than the former. In this exploratory essay I put endogenous factors upfront, and introduce and define the concept of economic distance. I argue that the coefficient of economic distance is a better measure of what is going on than things like the Africa dummy, for example. The evidence I consider suggests that policy and future research will benefit from focused studies of endogenous constraints on economic performance. The essay is incomplete without its empirical complement, but it succeeds in holding up a mirror in front of these countries. The implication is that continued emphasis on exogenous constraints is a misallocation of scarce policy and research resources.
O41|Does financial sector development affect the growth gains from trade openness?|A sizeable literature suggests that financial sector development could be an important enabler of the growth benefits of trade openness. We provide a comprehensive analysis of how financial development can affect the relationship between trade openness and growth using a dynamic panel threshold model and an extensive dataset for a large sample of countries for the 1970-2015 period. We find that there is a financial development threshold in which trade openness has a positive and significant effect on economic growth. We also find that when splitting the sample into industrialized and non-industrialized countries, the financial development threshold that enables the growth benefits of trade is higher in the former group of countries than in the latter. This finding is consistent with the fact that the export composition of industrialized countries is tilted towards more capital-intensive finance-constrained goods.
O41|The Rise of Services and Balanced Growth in Theory and Data|When measured using NIPA conventions, a two-sector model of balanced growth and structural transformation can account for the mildly declining GDP growth rate, increasing share of services, and increasing real investment/GDP ratio observed in the post-war U.S. economy. These changes induce a decline of 36% in the marginal product of capital and of 5.4% in the real interest rate. By retaining the U.S. calibration, the process of structural transformation can also account, per-se, for cross-country differences in real investment/GDP ratios, which are comparable to those displayed by the U.S. along its growth path.
O41|Structural Change and Aggregate Employment Fluctuations in China and the US|The correlation between the cyclical components of aggregate employment and GDP is highly positive in the US, but close to zero in China. We argue that the difference in the size of the agricultural sector is the reason for the difference in employment-output correlation. We construct a simple two-sector growth model with productivity shocks and non-homothetic preferences and show that the model can simultaneously account for the long-run structural change and short-run employment fluctuations at sector level and in the aggregate for both economies.
O41|Skewed Credit and Growth Dynamics after the Global Financial Crisis|A large empirical literature finds that financial development is beneficial for economic growth, although some recent evidence suggests otherwise. The paper contributes to the financeâ€“growth literature by examining the role of credit growth skewness and long-run growth. Earlier literature found that credit growth skewness is negatively associated with economic growth. It revisits this relationship using a large and recent panel dataset that encompasses Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development economies and the impact of the global financial crisis. While the results reconfirm an association between credit skewness and growth, the relationship is more nuanced than previously thought. It finds that the beneficial effects from lower skewnessâ€”systemic financial risksâ€”were evident only prior to 2000. The findings help explain why boomâ€“bust dynamics were positively associated with economic growth in emerging markets in the past and why the growth of advanced economies has been sluggish since the global financial crisis.
O41|On the optimal labor income share|Labor’s share of income has attracted interest in recent years reflecting its apparent decline. These falls, witnessed across many countries, are usually deemed undesirable. Any such assertion, however, begs the question of what is the socially optimal labor share. We address this question using a micro-founded endogenous growth model calibrated on US data. We find that in our central calibration the socially optimal labor share is 17% (11 pp) above the decentralized equilibrium, calibrated to match the average observed in history. We also study the dependence of both long-run growth equilibria on model parameters and relate our results to Piketty’s “laws of Capitalism”. Finally, we demonstrate that cyclical movements in factor income shares are socially optimal and that the decentralized equilibrium typically does not generate excess volatility.

O41|Non‐separable Utilities and Aggregate Instability|This paper studies an infinite‐horizon two‐sector growth model with sector‐specific externalities and preferences that are non‐separable between consumption and leisure. We find two main results. First, a larger income effect on the labor supply increases the possibility of macroeconomic instability. Second, a larger elasticity of the labor supply may increase or decrease the possibility of aggregate instability, depending on the intensity of the income effect.
O41|Averaging Estimators for Kernel Regressions|This paper considers model averaging for kernel regressions. We construct a weighted average of the local constant and local linear estimators at each point of estimation. We propose a two-step cross-validation method for bandwidths and weights selection, and derive the rate of convergence of the cross-validation weights to their optimal benchmark values.
O41|Structural Change and Global Trade|"Services, which are less traded than goods, rose from 50 percent of world expenditure in 1970 to 80 percent in 2015. Such structural change restrained ""openness""—the ratio of world trade to world GDP—over this period. We quantify this with a general equilibrium trade model featuring non-homothetic preferences and input-output linkages. Openness would have been 70 percent in 2015, 23 percentage points higher than the data, if expenditure patterns were unchanged from 1970. Structural change is critical for estimating the dynamics of trade barriers and welfare gains from trade. Ongoing structural change implies declining openness, even absent rising protectionism."
O41|Loss Aversion at the Aggregate Level Across Countries and its Relation to Economic Fundamentals|Preferences are important when thinking about macroeconomic problems and questions. Differences in preferences might, for example, explain cross-country variations in economic fundamentals. In recent years, differences in preferences across countries and cultures have been studied more frequently, usually concentrating on micro evidence. However, it is an open question as to how differences in average preferences affect the aggregate economy. Coming from a macroeconomic perspective, we test whether preferences stated in Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory, namely, reference point dependence and loss aversion, prevail on the aggregate and whether the average degree of loss aversion differs across countries. We find evidence of loss aversion for a broad set of OECD countries, while the average loss aversion clearly differs across these countries. We find little evidence that these differences could be explained by micro evidence. Furthermore, we analyse whether the different degrees of loss aversion correlate with economic fundamentals such as the level of GDP and consumption per capita. We find that indeed loss aversion is negatively correlated with GDP and consumption per capita and positively correlated with consumption smoothing.
O41|Macrodynamic Implications of Employee Profit Sharing as Effort Elicitation Device|We devise a growth model where the distribution of factor income is affected by the possibility of profit sharing with workers. Firms choose periodically to compensate workers with only a real base wage or a share of profits in addition to this real base wage as alternative effort-elicitation strategies. As validated by empirical evidence, labor productivity is higher in profit-sharing firms than in non-sharing firms. The frequency distribution of effort-elicitation strategies and labor productivity across firms are co-evolutionarily time-varying, which then affects the dynamics of the distribution of income between profits and wages and therefore the savings-determined growth rate. Heterogeneity in effort-elicitation strategies across firms (and hence earnings inequality across workers) can be a stable long-run equilibrium. In such a polymorphic equilibrium, the frequency of profit-sharing firms varies positively (negatively) with the real base wage (profit-sharing coefficient). As shown analytically and with numerical simulations, the micro- and macrodynamics of the economy are crucially affected by the profit-sharing coefficient and the real base wage as bifurcation parameters.
O41|Human Capital Accumulation, Income Distribution and Economic Growth: A Neo-Kaleckian Analytical Framework|This paper incorporates human capital accumulation through provision of universal public education by a balanced-budget government to a Neo-Kaleckian analytical framework of distribution and growth. Human capital accumulation positively impacts on workersâ€™ productivity in output production and their bargaining power in wage negotiations. Differences in tax rates on wage and profit income have distributive implications for consumption and investment and so shape how effective demand varies with income distribution. In the long-run equilibrium, a rise in workersâ€™ (capitalistsâ€™) bargaining power raises (lowers) the pre- and after-tax wage share, which raises (reduces) the rates of physical capital utilization, employment (which also measures the rate of human capital utilization) and output growth. Meanwhile, a rise in a uniform tax rate (which also denotes the share of tax spending in public education in output) lowers the long-run equilibrium values of the pre- and after-tax wage share and the rates of physical capital utilization, employment and output growth. Paradoxically, in the long-run equilibrium, a higher share of investment in human capital in output lowers the rate of human capital accumulation, with which output growth varies positively. A strengthening in the bargaining power of workers is output growth-enhancing in the long-run equilibrium, and it does so by raising the rates of accumulation of both physical and human capital.
O41|Biased Technological Change and Employment Reallocation|To study the drivers of the employment reallocation across sectors and occupations between 1960 and 2010 in the US we propose a model where technology evolves at the sector-occupation cell level. This framework allows us to quantify the bias of technology across sectors and across occupations. We implement a novel method to extract changes in sector-occupation cell productivities from the data. Using a factor model we find that occupation and sector factors jointly explain 74-87 percent of cell productivity changes, with the occupation component being by far the most important. While in our general equilibrium model both factors imply similar reallocations of labor across sectors and occupations, quantitatively the bias in technological change across occupations is much more important than the bias across sectors.
O41|Endogenous Business Cycles With Bubbles|This study examines the existence of bubbles in an economy with a low growth rate. By using an overlapping-generations model with Matsuyama's (1999) production sector, it is shown a bubble exists in an economy with a low growth rate. If consumers can borrow assets when they are young, then there is a unique cycle with a bubble moving back and forth between two phases. In one phase, the output growth rate is low and innovation occurs. In the other phase, the output growth rate is high and there is no innovation. Therefore, a bubble also exists in an economy with a high growth rate. On the contrary, cycles cannot emerge if consumers save assets when they are young.
O41|Does Nonlinear Taxation Stabilize Small Open Economies?|This paper examines the stabilization effect of income taxation rules in small open economies. We show that if endogenous growth is not allowed, belief-driven fl?uctuation will not emerge, but the economy displays total instability under certain conditions and nonlinear income tax may recover saddle point stability. If endogenous growth is possible and if the taxation rule specifi?es the rate of income tax held in the balanced growth equi- librium, then equilibrium indeterminacy will not arise either. However, if the long run tax rate is not predetermined, then, equilibrium path of the economy may be indeterminate, and an appropriate taxation rule can establish determinacy.
O41|Crime, Human Capital, and the Impact of Different Taxation|This paper presents a macroeconomic model with crime, human capital, and three taxation policies (consumption, labour, and capital income taxes). In an extension, we endogenize the probability of escaping punishment to depend on government expenditure on public security/police. The model is solved analytically and numerically to derive propositions, which are then verified empirically using cross-country data. Compared to the literature, we find a much higher threshold probability. Above the threshold, the equilibrium crime rate is positively related to the escape probability. In addition, above this threshold level, a rise in capital income tax or a decline in labour income tax would lead to a higher equilibrium crime rate, if the taxes are modelled using marginal tax rates. There also appears to be empirical supports where the equilibrium human capital level depends positively on consumption tax. Lastly, when the probability is endogenized, there also exists a threshold level for the spending on public security/police, above which consumption tax and capital income tax have positive eÂ¤ects on the equilibrium level of human capital.
O41|Tasks, Technology, and Factor Prices in the Neoclassical Production Sector|This paper introduces tasks into the neoclassical production sector. Competitive firms choose the profit-maximizing amounts of factor-specific tasks that determine their factor demands and output supplies. We show that the effect of factor-augmenting technical change on relative and absolute factor prices can be decomposed into a productivity effect and a market size effect of opposite sign. These effects appear since the novel task-based approach distinguishes between the demands for tasks and the demands for factors. This perspective provides a new intuition for the emergence of relative and absolute factor biases and the role of the elasticity of substitution.
O41|Varieties of Capitalism, Increasing Income Inequality, and the Sustainability of Long-Run Growth|"We model US household debt accumulation during the neoliberal boom as a response to emulation e ects and the decline of the social wage, which has ""privatized"" an increasing share of the costs of providing for services such as health and education. The debt dynamics of the US economy are then studied under alternative assumptions about the con guration of distributional variables, which is shown to differ across varieties of capitalism that have ""neoliberalized"" to di erent degrees. A key result is that distributional change alone will not make US neoliberal capitalism financially sustainable due, in part, to the paradoxical nature of inequality as a spur to household borrowing, and hence a source of both demand-formation and financial fragility. Achieving sustainability requires, instead, more wide-ranging reform."
O41|Social Interactions and Modern Economic Growth|This paper offers a theoretical framework to understand the coevolution of social interactions and long-term economic growth. It begins by considering that most traditional societies did not have educational markets. Thus, access to the required knowledge for transiting to a modern economy had to be transmitted through social interactions, in particular, through the interaction between heterogeneous groups of people–i.e. distant interactions. Once immersed in a modern economy, the productive system should have increased the demand for knowledge, promoting more distant interactions. Simultaneously, the emergence of distant interactions should have affected the connectivity of society, reducing its heterogeneity, making cheaper posterior interactions but reducing their profitability. Moreover, social interactions competed and benefited from other nonmarket activities, child rearing specifically. The model arrives at four basic predictions. First, modern economic growth brings a more cohesive society. Second, modern economic growth brings long-term reductions in fertility with potential short-term increases. Third, initial barriers to social interactions could explain the timing of modern economic growth arrival. Fourth, the timing of modern economic growth arrival could explain current output levels. I exploit different data sources to offer evidence in support of these predictions.
O41|Dancing with the Stars: Innovation Through Interactions|An inventor's own knowledge is a key input in the innovation process. This knowledge can be built by interacting with and learning from others. This paper uses a new large-scale panel dataset on European inventors matched to their employers and patents. We document key empirical facts on inventors' productivity over the life cycle, inventors' research teams, and interactions with other inventors. Among others, most patents are the result of collaborative work. Interactions with better inventors are very strongly correlated with higher subsequent productivity. These facts motivate the main ingredients of our new innovation-led endogenous growth model, in which innovations are produced by heterogeneous research teams of inventors using inventor knowledge. The evolution of an inventor's knowledge is explained through the lens of a diffusion model in which inventors can learn in two ways: By interacting with others at an endogenously chosen rate; and from an external, age-dependent source that captures alternative learning channels, such as learning-by-doing. Thus, our knowledge diffusion model nests inside the innovation-based endogenous growth model. We estimate the model, which fits the data very closely, and use it to perform several policy exercises, such as quantifying the large importance of interactions for growth, studying the effects of reducing interaction costs (e.g., through IT or infrastructure), and comparing the learning and innovation processes of different countries.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O41|Unemployment and Development|This paper draws on household survey data from countries of all income levels to measure how average unemployment rates vary with income per capita. We document that unemployment is increasing with GDP per capita. Furthermore, we show that this fact is accounted for almost entirely by low-educated workers, whose unemployment rates are strongly increasing in GDP per capita, rather than by high-educated workers, whose unemployment rates are not correlated with income. To interpret these facts, we build a model with workers of heterogeneous ability and two sectors: a traditional sector, in which self-employed workers produce output without reward for ability; and a modern sector, in which firms hire in frictional labor markets, and output increases with ability. Countries differ exogenously in the productivity level of the modern sector. The model predicts that as productivity rises, the traditional sector shrinks, as progressively less-able workers enter the modern sector, leading to a rise in overall unemployment and in the ratio of low-educated to high-educated unemployment rates. Quantitatively, the model accounts for around one third of the cross-country patterns we document.
O41|Equilibrium Analysis in the Behavioral Neoclassical Growth Model|Rich behavioral biases, mistakes and limits on rational decision-making are often thought to make equilibrium analysis much more intractable. We show that this is not the case in the context of the neoclassical growth model (potentially incorporating incomplete markets and distortions). We break down the response of the economy to a change in the environment or policy into two parts: a direct response at a given vector of prices, and an equilibrium response that plays out as prices change. We refer to a change as a “local positive shock” if the direct response, when averaged across households, increases aggregate savings. Our main result shows that under weak regularity conditions, regardless of the details of behavioral preferences, mistakes and constraints on decision-making, the long-run equilibrium will involve a greater capital-labor ratio if and only if we start with a local positive shock. One implication of this result is that, from a qualitative point of view, behavioral biases matter for long-run equilibrium if and only if they change the direction of the direct response. We show that these aggregate predictions are coupled with individual-level “indeterminacy”: nothing much can be said about individual behavior.
O41|Varieties of Capitalism, Increasing Income Inequality, and the Sustainability of Long-Run Growth|"We model US household debt accumulation during the neoliberal boom as a response to emulation effects and the decline of the social wage, which has â€œprivatized"" an increasing share of the costs of providing for services such as health and education.

O41|Growth and the Geography of Knowledge|We analyse how spatial disparities in innovation activities, coupled with migration costs, affect economic geography, growth and regional inequality. We provide conditions for existence and uniqueness of a spatial equilibrium, and for the endogenous emergence of industry clusters. Spatial variations in knowledge spillovers lead to spatial concentration of more innovative firms. Migration costs, however, limit the concentration of economic activities in the most productive region. Narrowing the gap in knowledge spillovers across regions raises growth, and reduces regional inequality by making firms more sensitive to wage differentials. The associated change in the spatial concentration of industries has positive welfare effects.
O41|Discretely Innovating: The Effect of Barriers to Entry on Innovation and Growth|This article considers the effect of a discrete entry barrier (i.e. an integer number of firms) in an endogenous growth model to draw conclusions about the relationship between contestability, innovation and growth. Sector-specific workers provide a tool for calibrating numerical examples. Sectors with lower entrepreneurial contestability have lower innovation and sectors characterized by Cournot oligopoly have lower innovation than sectors characterized by Bertrand. Wage inequality varies depending on the extent that the entry barrier is binding upon a marginal entrant. The model offers policy implications to support entrepreneurial entry, particularly in relatively small or isolated regional economies.
O41|Endogenous Growth and Real Effects of Monetary Policy: R&D and Physical Capital Complementarities in a Cash-in-Advance Economy|We study the real long-run effects of inflation and of the structural stance of monetary policy in the context of a monetary model of R&D-driven endogenous growth complemented with physical capital accumulation. We look into the effects on a set of real macroeconomic variables that have been of interest to policymakers – the economic growth rate, the real interest rate, the physical investment rate, R&D intensity, and the velocity of money –, and which have been analysed from the perspective of different, separated, strands of the theoretical and empirical literature. Additionally, we analyse the theoretical predictions of our model as regards the effects of inflation on the effectiveness of real industrial policy shocks and on the market structure, assessed namely by the average firm size, and present novel cross-country evidence on the empirical relationship between the latter and the long-run inflation rate.
O41|Energy intensity, growth and technical change|World and U.S. energy intensities have declined over the past century, falling at an average rate of approximately 1.2–1.5 percent a year. The decline has persisted through periods of stagnating or even falling energy prices, suggesting the decline is driven in large part by autonomous factors, independent of price changes. In this paper, we use directed technical change theory to understand the autonomous decline in energy intensity and investigate whether the decline will continue. We show in an economy with no state-dependence, where existing knowledge does not make R&D more profitable, energy intensity continues to decline, albeit at a slower rate than output growth, due to energy-augmenting innovation. However, in an economy with extreme state-dependence, energy intensity eventually stops declining because labor-augmenting innovation crowds out energy-augmenting innovation. Our empirical analysis of energy intensity in 100 countries between 1970 and 2010 suggests a scenario without extreme state dependence where energy intensity continues to decline; in either case, energy intensity never declines faster than output grows, and so energy use always increases, as long as the extraction cost of energy stays constant.
O41|Achieving China's energy and climate policy targets in 2030 under multiple uncertainties|The stringency of China's energy and climate targets in 2030 and the policy needed to realize these targets are full of controversy, mainly as a result of multiple future uncertainties. This study has developed a stochastic energy-economy-environment integrated model, to assess China's energy and climate targets in 2030, with a particular focus on the carbon intensity reduction, carbon emission peaking, and non-fossil energy development. The probabilities of realizing the targets are obtained, and the nexus among different targets is explored. It's argued that carbon emission management and policy-making should be implemented from the perspective of risk management, and policy makers can take corresponding policy measures based on the degree of confidence required under multiple future uncertainties. It is found that the probabilities of realizing carbon emission-peaking target and non-fossil energy target are low, with the business-as-usual efforts, and additional policies may still be needed. More specific, carbon pricing plays a major role in curbing and peaking carbon emissions, while the policy mix of carbon pricing and non-fossil energy subsidies can peak the carbon emission with relatively low cost compared to the single carbon pricing policy. It is also found that the carbon intensity reduction target is most likely to be attained, followed by the carbon-peaking target, and then the non-fossil energy target, given the same policy efforts. This indicates that, China may not deliberately increase carbon emissions rapidly over the next decade to make the carbon emission peak as high as possible; otherwise, it may be difficult to achieve the non-fossil energy target.
O41|The UK (and Western) Productivity Puzzle: Does Arthur Lewis Hold the Key?|I propose a new explanation for the UK productivity puzzle. I graft the Lewis (1954) model onto a standard Solow growth model. What I call the neo-Lewis model is identical to the Solow model in good times. But in bad times foreign demand for a country’s exports is constrained below potential supply. This makes labour productivity growth depend negatively on the growth of labour input. I also argue that the neo-Lewis model can explain the fall in TFP growth, in the UK and elsewhere, after 2007. The predictions of the neo-Lewis model are tested on data for 23 advanced countries and also on a larger sample of 52 countries and find support.
O41|Skewed Credit and Growth Dynamics after the Global Financial Crisis|A large empirical literature finds that financial development is beneficial for economic growth, although some recent evidence suggests otherwise. We contribute to the finance–growth literature by examining the role of credit growth skewness and long-run growth. Earlier literature found that credit growth skewness is negatively associated with economic growth. We revisit this relationship using a large and recent panel dataset that encompasses Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development economies and the impact of the global financial crisis. While our results reconfirm an association between credit skewness and growth, the relationship is more nuanced than previously thought. We find that the beneficial effects from lower skewness—systemic financial risks—were evident only prior to 2000. Our findings help explain why boom–bust dynamics were positively associated with economic growth in emerging markets in the past and why the growth of advanced economies has been sluggish since the global financial crisis.
O41|Economics of Climate Change: Introducing the Basic Climate Economic (BCE) Model|The paper develops the Basic Climate Economic (BCE) model featuring the core elements of climate economics and climate policy. The BCE model incorpo- rates fossil stock depletion, pollution stock accumulation, endogenous growth, and climate-induced capital depreciation. We first use graphical analysis to show the effects of climate change and climate policy on economic growth. In- tuition for the different model mechanisms, the functional forms, and the effects of different climate policies is provided. We then show the model equations in mathematical terms to derive closed-form solutions and to run model simula- tions relating to the graphical part. Finally, we compare our setup to other models of climate economics.
O41|Does Higher Energy Efficiency Lower Economy-Wide Energy Use?|We develop a general equilibrium growth model with capital and energy use to examine the hypothesis that economy-wide energy use increases with energy efficiency. To obtain energy use that would have occurred in the absence of energy efficiency changes, chosen energy efficiency is induced by technological change. Viewing technological change in form of changes in the cost of capital and energy producing energy services enables us to control for the sources of energy efficiency improvements in a counterfactual setting. Calibrating the model to the post-WWII U.S. economy, we find that higher energy efficiency increased rather than reduced energy use, because lower capital cost enhanced energy use by more than the increase in energy cost reduced it. This casts strong doubts on the view that energy-saving technological change has lowered fossil energy use.
O41|Carbon Pricing, Technology Transition, and Skill-Based Development|We derive the optimal contributions to global climate policy when countries differ with respect to income level and pollution intensity. Countries's growth rates are determined endogenously, and abatement effciency is improved by technical progress. We show that country heterogeneity has a crucial impact on optimal policy contributions: more developed countries have to make a larger effort while less developed countries are allowed to graduate under a less stringent environmental regime. The optimal allocation of pollution per- mits depends on international trade. In the absence of international permit trade, more developed countries should receive more permits than the less developed countries but permit prices are higher in the rich countries. With international permit trade, more developed countries receive less permits than the less developed. When global distribution of physical capital is uneven and the aggregate pollution ceiling is low, poor countries receive all the permits and incomes do not converge, even with free trade.
O41|Carbon Pricing, Technology Transition, and Skill-Based Development|We analyze the impact of carbon prices on human capital accumulation, sectoral change, and economic growth. In our framework output is produced with dirty and/or clean technologies using skilled and unskilled labor as inputs. Carbon policy affects technology selection which transmits incentives for human capital formation. We show that a temporary policy may be sufficient for a transition to a clean economy and that such a policy also stimulates economic growth. Moreover, in the presence of inter-country knowledge spillovers, a carbon policy in the North helps human capital formation in the South and induces South’s transition to the clean steady state.
O41|Leisure Time and the Sectoral Composition of Employment|We observe the following patterns in the US economy during the period 1965-2015: (i) the rise of the service sector, (ii) the increase in leisure time, and (iii) the increase in recreational services. To display the last pattern, we measure the fraction of the value added of the service sector explained by the consumption of recreational services, and we show that it increases during this period. We explain these three patterns of structural change in a multisector growth model, where leisure time and the consumption of recreational services are complements. We show that this complementarity introduces a mechanism of structural change that contributes to explain the rise of the service sector and that also affects the labor supply. We measure the reduction in employment due to a tax increase to illustrate the effect on the labor supply of this mechanism.
O41|Inequality and Structural Change under Non-Linear Engels' Curve|We analyze the relationship between income inequality and structural change in the sectoral composition of the tradable and the non-tradable sectors. We construct a small open economy two sector model where preferences imply non-linear Engel curves and we show that the relationship between income inequality and structural change crucially depends on the non-linearity of the Engel curves. We calibrate this model to the US economy in the period 1960-2010 and we show that it explains the observed patterns of structural change in terms of the sectoral composition of consumption and employment, it also explains the increase in inequality measured by the Gini index and, finally, it is consistent with the large reduction in the trade balance. From the analysis of several counterfactual exercises, we obtain the following insights: (i) income inequality contributes to explain structural change and reduces GDP when Engel curves are non-linear; (ii) asset accumulation and the time path of GNP do not depend on the level of inequality, but on the evolution of income inequality; and (iii) a rising inequality implies a faster accumulation of assets, a larger growth of GNP and a faster deterioration of the trade balance.
O41|Unequal vulnerability to climate change and the transmission of adverse effects through international trade|In this paper, we consider the unequal distribution of climate change damages in the world and we examine how the underlying costs can spread from a vulnerable to a non-vulnerable country through international trade. To focus on such indirect effects, we treat this topic in a North-South trade overlapping generations model in which the South is vulnerable to the damages entailed by global pollution while the North is not. We show that the impact of climate change in the South can be a source of welfare loss for northern consumers, in both the short and the long run. In the long run, an increase in the South's vulnerability can reduce the welfare in the North economy even in the case in which it improves its terms of trade. In the short run, the South's vulnerability can also represent a source of intergenerational inequity in the North. Therefore, we emphasize the strong economic incentives for non-vulnerable - and a fortiori less-vulnerable - economies to reduce the climate change damages on - more - vulnerable countries.
O41|Real business cycles, animal spirits, and stock market valuation|This paper develops a real business cycle model with five types of fundamental shocks and one “equity sentiment shock” that captures fluctuations driven by animal spirits. The representative agent's perception that movements in equity value are partly driven by sentiment turns out to be close to self‐fulfilling. I solve for the sequences of shock realizations that allow the model to exactly replicate the observed time paths of US consumption, investment, hours worked, the stock of physical capital, capital's share of income, and the S&P 500 market value from 1960.Q1 onwards. The model‐identified sentiment shock is strongly correlated with survey‐based measures of US consumer sentiment. Counterfactual scenarios with the model suggest that the equity sentiment shock has an important influence on the paths of most US macroeconomic variables.
O41|Optimal Capital Account Liberalization in China|China maintains tight controls over its capital account. Its prevailing regime also features financial repression, under which banks are often required to extend a fraction of funds to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) at below-market interest rates. We incorporate these features into a general equilibrium model. We find that capital account liberalization under financial repression incurs a tradeoff between aggregate productivity and intertemporal allocative efficiency. Along a transition path with a declining SOE share, the second-best policy calls for a rapid removal of financial repression, but gradual liberalization of the capital account.
O41|Structural Change and Global Trade|Services, which are less traded than goods, rose from 58 percent of world expenditure in 1970 to 79 percent in 2015. In a trade model featuring nonhomothetic preferences and input-output linkages, we find that such structural change has restrained the growth in world trade to GDP by 16 percentage points over this period. This magnitude is similar to how much declining trade costs have boosted openness. Moreover, structural change dampens the measured gains from trade by incorporating endogenous responses of expenditure shares to the trade regime. Ongoing structural change implies declining openness, even absent rising protectionism.
O41|A Tale of Two Sectors; Why is Misallocation Higher in Services than in Manufacturing?|Recent empirical studies document that the level of resource misallocation in the service sector is significantly higher than in the manufacturing sector. We quantify the importance of this difference and study its sources. Conservative estimates for Portugal (2008) show that closing this gap, by reducing misallocation in the service sector to manufacturing levels, would boost aggregate gross output by around 12 percent and aggregate value added by around 31 percent. Differences in the effect and size of productivity shocks explain most of the gap in misallocation between manufacturing and services, while the remainder is explained by differences in firm productivity and age distribution. We interpret these results as stemming mainly from higher output price rigidity, greater labor adjustment costs and more informality in the service sector.
O41|Optimal tax policy in the presence of productive, consumption, and leisure externalities|This paper presents the optimal tax policy in an economy featuring consumption, production, and leisure externalities. This extends prior models that only consider consumption and production externalities. The immediate consequence is labor income should be taxed (subsidized) if the leisure externality is positive (negative). In addition, numerical simulations show that in the presence of positive production externalities, and irrespective of the sign of consumption externalities, an increase in the importance of the leisure externality reduces the distortion generated by consumption and production externalities. This effect is reversed if production externalities are negative.
O41|Endogenous information revelation in a competitive credit market and credit crunch|In this paper, we propose a new mechanism able to explain the occurrence of credit crunches. Considering a credit market with an asymmetry of information between borrowers and lenders, we assume that borrowers have to pay a cost to reveal information on the quality of their project. They decide to be transparent if it is necessary for getting a loan or for paying a lower interest rate. Two types of competitive equilibria may exist: an opaque equilibrium in which all projects receive funding without revealing information; a transparent one in which only the best projects reveal information and receive funding. It is also possible to get multiple equilibria. Incorporating this microeconomic mechanism in an OLG model, the economy may experience fluctuations due to the change of regime, and indeterminacy may occur.
O41|Carbon policy in a high-growth economy: The case of China|There is widespread concern that a stringent international climate agreement will not be reached because it would imply too high costs for fast growing economies. To test this hypothesis we develop a general equilibrium model with fully endogenous growth and estimate the policy cost for China. The framework includes disaggregated industrial and energy sectors, endogenous innovation, and sector-specific investments. We find that the governmental target of a 65 percent carbon intensity reduction until 2030 causes a welfare reduction of 0.5 percent for China, compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Costs of carbon policy for China under an internationally coordinated emission reduction amount to 4 percent of total welfare. We highlight that lower economic growth, faster energy technology development, and stronger induced innovation reduce welfare losses significantly. Increased urbanization raises the policy costs because urban households consume more energy and energy intensive goods.
O41|Innovation diffusion, general purpose technologies and economic growth|This paper investigates the mechanics through which novel technological principles are developed and diffused throughout an economy consisting of a technologically heterogeneous ensemble of firms. In this model entrepreneurs invest in the discovery and in the diffusion of a technological principle. We argue that if the technological distance between goods is sufficiently large, then the economy is trapped in a no-growth equilibrium where innovations remain isolated events, while if it is sufficiently short, then innovations eventually percolate throughout the whole economy, leading to the emergence of general purpose technologies and sustained long run growth.
