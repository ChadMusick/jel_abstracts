A14|Promise, Trust and Betrayal: Costs of Breaching an Implicit Contract|We study the cost of breaching an implicit contract in a goods market, building on a recent study that documented the presence of such a contract in the Coca-Cola market, in the US, during 1886‒1959. The implicit contract promised a serving of Coca-Cola of a constant quality (the “real thing”), and of a constant quantity (6.5oz in a bottle or from the fountain), at a constant nominal price of 5¢. We offer two types of evidence. First, we document a case that occurred in 1930, where the Coca-Cola Company chose to incur a permanently higher marginal cost of production, instead of a one-time increase in the fixed cost, to prevent a quality adjustment of Coca-Cola, which would be considered a breach of the implicit contract. Second, we explore the consequences of the Company’s 1985 decision to replace the original Coke with the “New Coke.” Using the model of Exit, Voice, and Loyalty (Hirschman 1970), we argue that the unprecedented public outcry that followed the New Coke’s introduction, was a response to the Company’s breaching of the implicit contract. We document the direct and quantifiable costs of this implicit contract breach, and demonstrate that the indirect, although unquantifiable, costs in terms of lost customer goodwill were substantial.
A14|Exploiting the ?Communist Threat?, for the Privatized Internet|Levine?s Surveillance Valley reports how the Internet was privatized without public debate or resistance but overlooks decades of neoliberal economic and anti-communist purging history that had chilling effects on public resistance to Internet privatization - that history gap is explored here. How did military-industrial-complex contractors, using neoliberal and Communist threat rational, incentivize Internet development, while lessening the possibility of public interference to Internet privatization? Weber?s special-skilled-occupational-status-group-theory is overlaid onto neoliberal economic and military-industrial-complex history to argue occupational-contractor-status-groups, with their monopoly access to early computer technology, fulfilled neoliberal doctrine by creating and protecting private markets for the Internet and exploited Communist threat rational to help clear the privatization path of people who might impede market plans.
A14|Children and consumer temptations - Financial personality test for children|Goals: Our research aimed to explore the financial attitudes of teenagers (10-14 years old). Its goal is to compare the answers given by the children surveyed with the results of the Financial Personality Test addressing adults. Methods: The survey consists of 20 questions and respondents (2067 upper secondary pupils) can assess on a scale from 1 to 5 how typical of them a certain finance-related quality, behaviour or attitude is. Results: Results show that the upper secondary age-group possess higher level skills in handling money than previously presumed, they have well-established financial habits, they are willing to work for money while they know exactly how much money they have and how much things cost. They are much more exposed to temptations encouraging consumption than adults, therefore they are more likely to face financial difficulties, they do not always know what their money is spent on. At the same time, children are less likely to expect their parents to give them everything than the parents themselves. The study classifies respondent children into three clusters: 1. conscious savers, 2. spenders, 3. the passive, incompetent in their finances. Recommendations: Spenders should learn about controlling shopping impulses, planning and economizing, while the financially fragile passive group should learn about financial strategy, coping skills and motivation as well.
A14|Methods used in economic research. An empirical study of trends and levels|The methodological approaches used in economic research are analyzed on a sample of all 3,415 regular research papers published in 10 general interest journals every 5th year from 1997 to 2017. The number of papers published increases by 3.3% p.a. The papers are classified into three main groups with eight sub-groups: The main groups of theory and empirics are almost equally large. Most empiric papers use the classic method, which derives an operational model from theory and run regressions. Two main trends are highly significant: The fraction of theoretical papers has fallen by 26 pp (percentage points), while the fraction of papers using the classic method has increased by 15 pp. Almost 10% papers using the classic method have been analyzed using meta-analysis, which show that the results reported in the typical paper are exaggerated. There is little reason to believe that other methods have smaller problems.
A14|Far from random? : The role of homophily in student supervision|This paper studies racial and gender homophily in student supervision relationships in a context of social transformations, South Africa academia. We develop a technique to separate choice homophily from that induced by the system. Comprising two permutation tests repeated at two levels of aggregation, system and departments. We find clear evidence of homophily in student supervision, along racial lines in particular. Roughly half of the observed homophily is induced by the departments composition and stays constant over time. Overall, choice homophily has similar magnitude along racial and gender dimensions. Further, we ask where choice homophily originates in the demographic groups of students and professors. We find that white (male) students have high tendency to form same-type relations, while among professors it is black (female) who display the higher frequency. Group differences show that choice homophily is likely to originate from students in the former majority.
A14|Macroeconomic Research, Present and Past|What is the state of macroeconomics? We answer this question by hand collecting information about the epistemological approaches, theoretical and empirical methods, and data sources used by macroeconomists in their research. During the past 40 years there has been an increasing reliance on mathematical theory, particularly DSGE models, with theory-based papers now occupying the majority of space in macro journals. This shift is mirrored by a decline in the use of empirical falsification methods testing theoretical predictions. Microeconometric techniques have displaced time series methods, and empirical papers increasingly rely on micro and proprietary data sources. We document a decline and subsequent resurgence of financial frictions appearing in macro theory. Finally, we find that topics outside of macroeconomics are studied in more than three fourths of macro field journal publications.
A14|Die Illusion der Identität und die Krise der Wissenschaften|Das Eingangszitat von George Forster aus dem Jahre 1793 gibt einen ersten Hinweis auf das, was nachfolgend zu entfalten ist. Als These formuliert: Die Begriffe der modernen Wissenschaften sind auf innere Weise mit dem Rechnen in einer Geldökonomie verbunden. Die vielfältig zu beobachtenden Krisenphänomene in zahlreichen Wissenschaften lassen sich auf einen gemeinsamen Grund zurückführen. Ich werde zunächst von einer spezifischen Blickweise ausgehen, die charakteristisch ist für die modernen Wissenschaften, um in dieser Perspektive die stillschweigenden kategorialen Voraussetzungen näher zu beschreiben. Daraus lassen sich dann Krisenphänomene, die in Mathematik, Physik und Ökonomie zu beobachten sind, verständlich machen.
A14|The anti-democratic logic of right-wing populism and neoliberal market-fundamentalism|The paper compares neoliberal market-fundamentalism and right-wing populism on the basis of its core patterns of thinking and reasoning. Based on an analysis of the work of important founders of market fundamental economic thinking (particularly Mises, and Hayek) and the arguments brought forward by leading right-wing populist we find highlight conceptual resemblances of these two approaches: Both show a world that is split into only two countervailing parts. Right-wing populism shows a society split into two groups, fighting against each other. In a similar vein, neoliberal market-fundamentalism shows only two possible countervailing economic and societal orders. Thus, we develop a scheme of the similar dual social worlds of right-wing-populism and market-fundamentalism and offer some examples in the history of the Republican Party, where these concepts mutually reinforced each other or served as a gateway for each other. The main conclusion of the paper is that neoliberal market-fundamentalism and right-wing populism can be perceived as two mutually reinforcing and radicalizing threats to democracy in the 21st century.
A14|The power of economic textbooks: A discourse analysis|"By conducting a discourse analysis (SKAD) in the field of academic economics textbooks, this paper aims at reconstructing frames and identity options offered to undergraduate students relating to the questions ""Why study economics?""and ""Who do I become by studying economics?"". The analysis showed three major frames and respective identity offerings, all of which are contextualized theoretically, with prominent reference to the Foucauldian reflection of the science of Political Economy. Surprisingly, none of them encourages the student to think critically, as could have been expected in a pedagogical context. Taken together, economics textbooks appear as a ""total structure of actions brought to bear upon possible action"" (Foucault), therefore, as a genuine example of Foucauldian power structures."
A14|Eine Netzwerkanalyse von Ökonomen und Wissenschaftlern anderer Disziplinen auf Basis eines Surveys unter Abgeordneten und Ministerialbeamten|"In Germany, public debates between economists are rather rare. However, in media cover-age on economists there is an implicit assignment to ideological camps, such as employer/employee-friendly or left/market liberal. Since for most of the economists this assignment is rarely explicitly pronounced, an empirical investigation based on the media coverage is difficult. Our contribution examines the assigned orientation of economists by proximity in networks of peers and scientists from other disciplines. For this purpose, we use data collected in a survey among ministry officials and parliamentarians about policy-advising scientists in the years 2014 to 2018. The respondents could name up to five economists and five scientists from other disciplines. It is assumed that respondents are more likely to name those together where they see a certain proximity to each other, and probably to them-selves as well. Over the years, the network analysis of the survey data shows two stable central clusters around the presidents of two Leibniz institutes: Clemens Fuest and Hans-Werner Sinn from the Ifo - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research in Munich and Marcel Fratzscher from the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin). The most important scientists of non-economic disciplines associated with the clusters are also revealing: with reference to the cluster ""Fuest"", these are primarily legal and political scientists. The cluster ""Fratzscher"" is primarily associated with political scientists and sociologists."
A14|Toward global paradigm change: Beyond the crisis of the liberal world order|This vision brief may be summarized by the following points. First, the crisis of the liberal world order arises from a misalignment of our social, economic and political domains of activity, along with a resulting destabilization of our physical environment. The integration of the global economy has generated problems that extend beyond our current bounds of social and political cooperation. Second, extending our social cooperation - on which basis our political cooperation can be extended as well - requires the creation of the appropriate moral narratives. These narratives must guide business strategies, public policies and civic activities. Third, these narratives must be supplemented by multilevel governance structures that address challenges at the scale - micro, meso and macro - at which these chal-lenges arise. Finally, past human experience in developing moral narratives, supported by multilevel governance structures, suggests guidelines for a future form of multilateralism that enables us to meet this challenge.
A14|Risky Working Conditions: An Immigrant Trap or an Income Effect?|Immigrants’ income has been proved to converge to the average native income level with years of residence in the host country. This income assimilation eﬀect is surprisingly not associated with a health improvement. Some emerging studies point towards the role of working conditions as a driver of the counterfactual relation between immigrants’ health and income. Using French data, we first show that, consistently with Viscusi (1978), working conditions are a normal good. An increase in 10% in non-earned income is associated with a decrease by 0.85% in professional injuries and by more than 3.2% in disabilities induced by professional illnesses. Second, we find that while immigrants bear in average worse working conditions than natives, this divergence results from an income divergence eﬀect since for an equivalent non-earned income level there are no significant diﬀerences in working conditions between natives and immigrants. Income assimilation of immigrants is associated with an assimilation in working conditions. We conclude then that bad working conditions cannot be blamed for the degradation of immigrants’ health with years of residence in the host country.

A14|Crime and Networks: 10 Policy Lessons|Social network analysis can help us understand more about the root causes of delinquent behavior and crime and provide practical guidance for the design of crime prevention policies. To illustrate these points, we first present a selective review of several key studies and findings from the criminology and police studies literature. We then turn to a presentation of recent contributions made by network economists. We highlight 10 policy lessons and provide a discussion of recent developments in the use of big data and computer technology.
A14|New Trends in the Social and Solidarity Economy Regarding Agriculture and Food: A Comparison between France and India|On the question of food and livelihood, international institutions and States call for efforts towards food security under the form of help in subsidies or better access to the market for farmers. Such efforts rely on large scale solutions and make food security depend on tall vertical institutions aiming at bringing change in a very large area at a time. On the other hand, small initiatives are born everywhere and take up on the question of access to healthy sustainable food. Farmers’ self-help groups, shared gardens, community supported agriculture, cooperative supermarket and other organisations make up this landscape and are being born everywhere. Such initiatives are often missed by observers as case studies of single organisations can not bring into light the global effort of such initiatives. Nevertheless, they can be put together and showed as being part of the same global movement. If their juridic forms, organisations, and goals are somewhat different, some trends can be established in the justification they offer to their action (Boltanski, Thévenot, 1991). In order to discover these justifications and establish trends, a study of the discourse and practices of such initiatives is offered in the following article. Namely, our study takes 20 initiatives dealing with agriculture and food. In order to find out trends, this article elaborates on the fieldwork of about 500 hours spent within said initiatives, and 50 interviews with project planners, coordinators, and motnitors. In order to show global trends, these initiatives have been chosen in two vastly different social and economic contexts: one takes place in Nancy, a medium French town, the other takes place in Ahmedabad, a very large Indian city. The results of the study show three major common trends between France and India, and between initiatives pertaining with small farmers, shared gardens, cooperatives and other social and solidarity initiatives. Firstly, there is a general call for localized, short food circuits, namely producers and consumers ask for a direct connection to each other, and even to grow the food they eat and eat the food they grow. Secondly, participants in said initiatives do not claim to be part of a recent innovative wave, but rather fall back on traditional ways to grow, sell, and cook food. Thirdly, despite the small size of such initiatives – with 200 participants at most and sometimes as small as 2 members – the ambition of these organisations is to change things on a global scale, make people from every path of life ask themselves questions and change their behaviour, and even, struggle against global climate change through small localized actions.
A14|Lies, damned lies, and RCT : une expérience de J-PAL sur le microcrédit rural au Maroc|"Comment expliquer le succès académique d’une étude randomisée dont la validité, tant interne qu’externe, est pourtant très problématique ? Prenant l’exemple d’une étude menée par le laboratoire J-PAL sur le microcrédit rural marocain, cet article mobilise les outils analytiques de la statistique, de l’économie politique et de la sociologie des sciences pour répondre à cette question. Il décrit l’ensemble de la chaîne de production de l’étude, depuis l’échantillonnage jusqu’à la publication et la dissémination des résultats, en passant par la collecte de données, la saisie et le recodage, les estimations et les interprétations. Il met en évidence une stratégie particulièrement offensive qui permet aux chercheurs de J-PAL de faire table rase du passé, y compris en s’affranchissant d’une « culture de la donnée », de refuser la critique et de contourner les règles de base de l’exercice scientifique tout au long du processus de recherche. Bien au-delà de J-PAL, nos analyses questionnent la supposée supériorité des méthodes randomisées tout en reflétant un malaise grandissant au sein du champ académique, qui parvient de moins en moins à faire respecter les règles de base de l’éthique et de la déontologie scientifique._______english_______How can we explain the academic success of a randomized study whose validity, both internal and external, is very problematic? Drawing on a study conducted on Moroccan rural microcredit by J-PAL, this article uses analytical tools from statistics, political economy and sociology of science to answer this question. It describes the entire study production chain, from sampling, data collection, data entry and recoding, estimates and interpretations to publication and dissemination of results. It highlights a particularly aggressive strategy carried out throughout the study process and in the field of research. This allows J-PAL researchers to put the past behind them, including by freeing themselves from a ""data culture"", rejecting criticism and bypassing the basic rules of scientific exercise throughout the research process. Well beyond J-PAL, our analyses question the supposed superiority of randomized methods while reflecting a growing unease within the academic field, which is less and less successful in enforcing the basic rules of ethics and scientific deontology."
A14|Characterization of efficient networks in a generalized connections model with endogenous link strength| We consider a natural generalization of Jackson and Wolinsky s (1996) connections model where the quality or strength of a link depends on the amount invested in it and is determined by a non-decreasing function of that amount. The information that the nodes receive through the network is the revenue from investments in links. We prove that in this most general version of the connections model, the only possibly nonempty efficient networks, in the sense of maximizing the aggregate proffit, are still the all-encompassing star and the complete network, with the sole and rare exception of a highly particular case where there is a draw between the all-encompassing star, the complete network and a whole range of a particular type of nested split graph structures intermediate between them.
A14|The Past’s Long Shadow. A Systematic Review and Network Analysis of Cliometrics or the New Economic History|During the interwar years, Japanese industrialisation accelerated alongside the expansion of industrial exports to regional markets. Trade blocs in the interwar years were used as an instrument of imperial power to foster exports and as a substitute for productivity to encourage industrial production. The historiography on Japanese industrialisation in the interwar years describes heavy industries’ interests in obtaining access to wider markets to increase economies of scale and reduce unit costs. However, this literature provides no quantitative evidence that proves the success of those mechanisms in expanding exports. In this paper we scrutinise how Japan—a relatively poor country—used colonial as well as informal power interventions to expand regional markets for its exports, especially for the most intensive human capital sector of the industrializing economy.

A14|No change in sight - Togo’s Political and Socio-Economic Development (2017 – 2019)|Backed by peaceful but undemocratic presidential (2010, 2015) and legislative (2013) elections the Gnassingbé regime consolidated its power. In view of the absolute majority of the ruling party, its inclination for meaningful constitutional and electoral reforms, as demanded by the opposition and international donors, was further reduced. Overriding concerns for stability in West Africa in view of growing Islamist threats in neighbouring countries made that the delayed democratic reforms, including the time and again reported local elections, were condoned by the donor community. However, simmering discontent of the hardliners among the security forces and the barons of the ruling party was still visible. The opposition tried in vain to overcome its divide between its moderate and radical wing. An alliance of opposition parties and civic groups opposed the regime peacefully by frequent, often violently suppressed demonstrations with little effect. Arson attacks on the markets of Lomè and Kara in January 2013 served as pretense to harass opposition leaders. Human rights records of the government remained tarnished. The tense political climate persisted in view of the upcoming presidential elections in April 2015 and the apparent determination of the President to stay in power a third and eventually even a fourth term whatever the cost. Despite undeniable improvements of the framework and outside appearance of major institutions of the regime during the survey period it remained a façade democracy. However, the international community, notably African peers, the AU and ECOWAS, but also the Bretton-Woods Institutions, China and the EU, followed a ‘laissez faire’ approach in the interest of stability and their proper national interest in dealings with the country. Economic growth perspectives remained promising, expected to increase to 6.0% in 2014 and 6.3% in 2015, last but not least because of heavy assistance by the international donor community. However, growth is neither sustainable nor inclusive. It is overshadowed by increasing inter-personal and regional inequality as well as an upturn in extreme poverty.
A14|Togo - 2018: Domestic politics, foreign affairs, socio-economic development|Throughout the year the controversial legislative elections dominated the political landscape. Huge anti-government demonstrations that called in vain for political alternance. The legislative elections of 20 December 2018, boycotted by the major opposition parties, resulted in an easy victory of the ruling party, however without the expected constitutional amendment majority. Therefore, the prime minister and his cabinet were replaced. The local elections, crucial for democratization at the grass-roots, but postponed time and again since 1987, were again postponed in December 2018 sine die. Economic growth remained stable at about 5% per annum. Public investment in infrastructure (e. g. roads, harbour) and increases in agricultural productivity, notably of export crops, had been the key drivers of economic growth. Moreover, money-laundering, illegal money transfers and trafficking grew alarmingly. Unemployment and lacking political change caused increasing migration.
A14|No change in sight - Togo’s Political and Socio-Economic Development (2017 – 2019)|The Gnassingbé clan has ruled the country since 1967. The demand for political alternance, initiated by institutional and electoral reforms, constituted the major contentious issue between the government and the challengers of the Gnassingbé regime throughout the survey period. An alliance of opposition parties and civil society groups organized peaceful demonstrations in opposition to the regime, which were often violently suppressed. Civil society organizations and representatives of the Christian church supported the demands of the opposition. The legislative elections of 20 December 2018, boycotted by the major opposition parties, resulted in an easy victory of the ruling party. The local elections, crucial for democratization at the grass-roots, but postponed time and again since 1987, were again postponed in December 2018 sine die. The human rights record of the government has improved but remains poor. Despite undeniable improvements to the framework and appearance of the regime's key institutions during the review period, democracy remains far from complete. However, the international community, notably Togo’s African peers, the AU and ECOWAS, followed a ‘laissez-faire’ approach in the interests of regional stability and their national interests in dealing with Togo. Economic growth remained stable at about 5% per annum. Public investment in infrastructure (e.g. roads, harbour) and increases in agricultural productivity, notably of export crops, had been the key drivers of economic growth. However, growth remains vulnerable to external shocks and the climate and has not been inclusive. Positive growth was overshadowed by increasing inter-personal and regional inequality as well as an increase in extreme poverty. Moreover, money-laundering, illegal money transfers and trafficking grew alarmingly. The business climate improved considerably nevertheless.
A14|Who Said or What Said? Estimating Ideological Bias in Views Among Economists|There exists a long-standing debate about the influence of ideology in economics. Surprisingly, however, there is no concrete empirical evidence to examine this critical issue. Using an online randomized controlled experiment involving economists in 19 countries, we examine the effect of ideological bias on views among economists. Participants were asked to evaluate statements from prominent economists on different topics, while source attribution for each statement was randomized without participants’ knowledge. For each statement, participants either received a mainstream source, an ideologically different less-/non-mainstream source, or no source. We find that changing source attributions from mainstream to less-/non-mainstream, or removing them, significantly reduces economists’ reported agreement with statements. Using a model of Bayesian updating we examine two competing hypotheses as potential explanations for these results: unbiased Bayesian updating versus ideologically-biased Bayesian updating. While we find no evidence in support of unbiased updating, our results are consistent with biased Bayesian updating. More specifically, we find that changing/removing sources (1) has no impact on economists’ reported confidence with their evaluations; (2) similarly affects experts/non-experts in relevant areas; and (3) affects those at the far right of the political spectrum much more significantly than those at the far left. Finally, we find significant heterogeneity in our results by gender, country, PhD completion country, research area, and undergraduate major, with patterns consistent with the existence of ideological bias.

A14|Постинституционализм: Программа Исследований За Пределами Институционального Мейнстрима<BR>[Post-institutionalism: research program beyond the institutional mainstream]|The paper examines the internal dualism of modern institutional economics manifested in division of orthodox or mainstream institutionalism (its axiomatics and dogmatics is represented by the Standard Model) and its opposition – post-institutionalism. It discusses the post-institutional agenda, covering a wide range of discussion issues beyond Standard Model – from the analysis of institutional complexity to introduction of the Evo-Devo paradigm into evolutionary research of institutions. It demonstrates that in the focus of post-institutionalism there are super-complicated institutional systems (assemblages) and related phenomena and processes (bricolage, kludges, anomalies, configurations), which can only be comprehended by overcoming unilateral and dichotomous approaches of the institutional mainstream.
A14|Publication Performance and Number of Authors – Evidence for World Top Economists|In social sciences the measurement of performance is usually done giving the full credit of each paper to all its authors. Aiming to analyze the impact of the number of authors on the performance results, we propose an adjustment to the h-index that is flexible enough to allow the consideration of distinct co-authorship weighting schemes. We then evaluate the publication performance of the members of the departments of economics of the top 10 world universities (472 authors; 15,243 papers). Our results show that the number of authors per paper is rapidly increasing and that this dimension measurably affects the final ranking of authors even in a scientific area in which the average number of authors is lower than in physical and life sciences.
A14|An attitude of complexity: thirteen essays on the nature and construction of reality under the challenge of Zeno's Paradox|This book is about the construction of reality. The central aim of this study is to understand how gravity works and how it may be focused and manipulated. While I do not have an answer to this question, the discoveries along the way have been worth collecting into a single volume for future reference.
A14|Alphabetized co-authorship in economics reconsidered|In this article, we revisit the analysis of Laband and Tollison (2006) who documented that articles with two authors in alphabetical order are cited much more often than non-alphabetized papers with two authors in the American Economic Review and the American Journal of Agricultural Economics. Using more than 120,000 multi-authored articles from the Web of Science economics subject category, we demonstrate first that the alphabetization rate in economics has declined somewhat over the last decade. Second, we find no statistically significant relationship between alphabetized co-authorship and citations in economics (the coefficients are very small). Third, we show that the likelihood of non-alphabetized co-authorship increases the more authors an article has.
A14|Promise, Trust and Betrayal: Costs of Breaching an Implicit Contract|We study the cost of breaching an implicit contract in a goods market, building on a recent study that documented the presence of such a contract in the Coca-Cola market, in the US, during 1886?1959. The implicit contract promised a serving of Coca-Cola of a constant quality (the “real thing”), and of a constant quantity (6.5oz in a bottle or from the fountain), at a constant nominal price of 5¢. We offer two types of evidence. First, we document a case that occurred in 1930, where the Coca-Cola Company chose to incur a permanently higher marginal cost of production, instead of a one-time increase in the fixed cost, to prevent a quality adjustment of Coca-Cola, which would be considered a breach of the implicit contract. Second, we explore the consequences of the Company’s 1985 decision to replace the original Coke with the “New Coke.” Using the model of Exit, Voice, and Loyalty (Hirschman 1970), we argue that the unprecedented public outcry that followed the New Coke’s introduction, was a response to the Company’s breaching of the implicit contract. We document the direct and quantifiable costs of this implicit contract breach, and demonstrate that the indirect, although unquantifiable, costs in terms of lost customer goodwill were substantial.
A14|The Impact of Xenophobic Violence on the Integration of Immigrants|Integration of immigrants is a two-way process involving immigrants and the host country society. An underexplored question is how events of xenophobic violence in the host country affect the integration of immigrants. For this purpose, I exploit a unique series of anti-immigrant attacks in the early 1990s in West Germany. Using a difference-in-differences matching strategy, I find that macro exposure to xenophobic violence has an impact on several dimensions of socio-economic integration of immigrants. In particular, it reduces subjective well-being and increases return intentions, while it reduces investment in German language skills among those staying in Germany. From a policy perspective, this paper shows that anti-immigrant violence can have indirect costs by impairing the integration of those immigrants who belong to the target group of xenophobic attacks.
A14|Publishing and Promotion in Economics: The Tyranny of the Top Five|This paper examines the relationship between placement of publications in Top Five (T5) journals and receipt of tenure in academic economics departments. Analyzing the job histories of tenure-track economists hired by the top 35 U.S. economics departments, we find that T5 publications have a powerful influence on tenure decisions and rates of transition to tenure. A survey of the perceptions of young economists supports the formal statistical analysis. Pursuit of T5 publications has become the obsession of the next generation of economists. However, the T5 screen is far from reliable. A substantial share of influential publications appear in non-T5 outlets. Reliance on the T5 to screen talent incentivizes careerism over creativity.
A14|Standing on the shoulder of giants: the aspect of free-riding in RePEc rankings| Research papers in economics (RePEc) rankings have become a well-established source of information about actual and perceived academic performance of institutions, academic fields and their authors. One essential ingredient is the impact factors calculated in RePEc which differ from the standard ones. RePEc reports the ratio of the cumulative citations of all articles of a journal and the number of listed items. The continuously updated RePEc impact factors account for the whole journal and citation history. This approach gives rise to a potential free-riding of authors who profit from journal ranking established in the past. In this article, we demonstrate how the rankings of economists change if one calculates yearly impact factors. The distribution of gains and losses is most pronounced among middle-field ranked authors while the top group shows relative persistence.
A14|Sniff Tests in Economics: Aggregate Distribution of Their Probability Values and Implications for Publication Bias|"The increasing demand for rigor in empirical economics has led to the growing use of auxiliary tests (balance, specification, over-identification, placebo, etc.) supporting the credibility of a paper's main results. We dub these ""sniff tests"" because standards for passing are subjective and rejection is bad news for the author. Sniff tests offer a new window into publication bias since authors prefer them to be insignificant, the reverse of standard statistical tests. Collecting a sample of nearly 30,000 sniff tests across 60 economics journals, we provide the first estimate of their aggregate probability-value (p-value) distribution. For the subsample of balance tests in randomized controlled trials (for which the distribution of p-values is known to be uniform absent publication bias, allowing reduced-form methods to be employed) estimates suggest that 45% of failed tests remain in the ""file drawer"" rather than being published. For the remaining sample with an unknown distribution of p-values, structural estimates suggest an even larger file-drawer problem, as high as 91%. Fewer significant sniff tests show up in top-tier journals, smaller tables, and more recent articles. We find no evidence of author manipulation other than a tendency to overly attribute significant sniff tests to bad luck."

A14|A Multi-dimensional Measure of Environmental Behavior: Exploring the Predictive Power of Connectedness to Nature, Ecological Worldview and Environmental Concern|Abstract In this study we examine the multi-dimensional structure of environmental behavior and its potential domains. Factor analysis reveals six behavioral domains: civic actions, policy support, recycling, transportation choices, behaviors in a household setting and consumerism. We use the Connectedness to Nature and Inclusion of Nature in Self scales to measure connection with nature, the New Environmental Paradigm to measure ecological worldviews, and Environmental Motives Scale to assess people’s environmental concern. We further explore the predictive power of connectedness to nature, ecological worldview, and environmental concern for explaining the diverse behavioral domains. Connectedness to nature and ecological worldview were more predictive of civic actions, recycling, household behaviors, and consumerism than were environmental concerns. In the case of policy support and transportation choices, environmental concerns explained more variance than the other constructs.
A14|A ‘Desi’ Multinational –A Case Study of Hindustan Unilever Limited|India has become a second home to many multinationals’ over the years. The fact that India has second largest population in the world is alluring because it translates itself into a huge opportunity to encash for marketers across the globe. Hindustan Lever Limited which set foot as the subsidiary of Unilever has been one such multinational which has almost become a home grown brand. The strategies adopted by this corporate leaves no stone unturned in cashing in on the tiniest niche markets available. Reaching the four billion populations in the base of the pyramid markets has been a topic of research in recent times. Lot of exploratory and case studies have been made in this field. This paper is a study on the strategies developed by Hindustan Lever Limited which has been one of the most successful companies to foray into the emerging markets in South East Asia and successfully tapped the base of the pyramid in India. A case study using archival material and secondary information sources suggest that having a global lookout and one world one market strategy is not successful when attempting to cut into base of the pyramid segments in emerging markets. The critical aspect here is developing grassroots’ connection and social empathy which should translate to a cooperative spirit which will leverage the strengths and overcome the weaknesses.
A14|Some Notes on the Concept of Social Capital: A Review of Perspectives, Definitions and Measurement|This paper delves into various perspectives – philosophical, sociological, economic and financial / business or oganisational - in literature on the concept of social capital. It presents a review of the definitions in broad literature categorised under various perspectives. While doing so, the focus ultimately narrowed down to definitions of social capital in business or organisational studies.
A14|Does social capital explain the Solow residual? A DSGE approach|Abstract Social capital has been credited with playing a role in many desirable economic outcomes. We analyze how these potentially beneficial effects translate into the macro-performance of economies by developing a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model featuring the role of social capital in the explanation of the Solow residual. We then simulate and estimate the model with Bayesian techniques using Italian data. Our framework fits actual data better than a standard DSGE model, suggesting that social capital may improve the economic performance via its impact on total factor productivity.
A14|Socio-Economic Well-Being and Women Status in Pakistan: An Empirical Analysis|This study has analyzed the effect of socioeconomic well-being on womenâ€™s status in case of Pakistan. To overview the womenâ€™s status in case of Pakistan, a comprehensive index is constructed by using social, economic and political status of women. This study follows the methodology of United Nations Development Program (UNDP) gender inequality index. Globalization, financial development, economic deprivation, secondary school enrollment and human development index have some selected explanatory variables, whereas gender inequality index (womenâ€™s status) is dependent variable. The data has been used from the period of 1980 to 2014. Following the properties, differentiation of the data, Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), Philips-Perron (PP) and Dickey-Fuller Generalized Least Squares (DF-GLS) unit root tests have been applied to check the stationarity of the variables. All variables have different order of integration, which support for Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) for observing the co-integration between the variables of the model. VECM model is used for short-run relationship of the variables. The findings of this study approve the presence of co-integration among the selected variables of the model. The results of the study illustrate that globalization has significant and negative long run relationship with womenâ€™s status. This explains that by increasing the globalization the level of womenâ€™s status is falling in Pakistan. The long run results reveal that economic deprivation is negatively related to gender inequality index which shows that by rising economic deprivation womenâ€™s status also rise in Pakistan. The secondary school enrollment and human development index have a positive relation to the womenâ€™s status, it explains by educating society and by increasing the human development the womenâ€™s status can be improved. Economic deprivation has a significant and negative relationship with gender inequality index in Pakistan. This reveals that when level of economic deprivation decreases, more women join the labor force and this increase the overall womenâ€™s status in case of Pakistan. The financial development has negative and insignificant relation to the gender inequality index. The study suggests that for attaining the desired level of womenâ€™s status, Pakistan should improve its socioeconomic structure.
A14|Social Norms and Competitiveness: My Willingness to Compete Depends on Who I am (supposed to be)|Women often respond less favorably to competition than men. In this paper, we test for the effects of social norms on willingness to compete. Subjects compete in two-person teams. In the treatment, one team member is randomly assigned the role of “breadwinner”, and the other person is randomly assigned as the “supporter”. There are no real differences between the roles in our experiment, except for the framing. These two roles have opposite social norms for competitiveness, reminiscent of gender roles in western society. In the baseline, subjects compete in two-person teams without role assignment. We find women’s willingness to compete significantly increases when they are assigned as breadwinners compared to women in the base- line or female supporters. We also find that there is no gender gap in willingness to compete between female breadwinners and males in the baseline. The increase in willingness to compete is mainly contributed by high-ability women. Males are also affected by the role assignment; male supporters are less likely to enter the tournament than male breadwinners. We argue that the changes in willingness to compete are mainly driven by the social norms implied by the two roles.
A14|Study on The Impact of Socio-Economic Crisis on Greek Wellness Tourists’ Spending Behavior|As most of the sectors of the world economy, tourism has also been affected by the global economic crisis and the resulting social redeployment. This global socio-economic situation, since 2010, has exerted additional pressure on the mental health and physical condition of people who are increasingly looking for new ways of relaxation and rejuvenation. The present study aims to investigate the impact of the current socio-economic crisis on the behavior and attitude of Greek wellness tourists. Quantitative research was conducted using a structured questionnaire on a sample size of 452 wellness tourists in totally 10 spas at Crete, Kos, Lefkada and Thessaloniki. The survey compared the spending behavior of respondents before 2010 and today. The findings of the survey show that although the behavior of Greeks as consumers is being negatively affected by the economic downturn, there is positive intention to continue using and spending on wellness services. In addition, results indicate the existence of positive attitude towards wellness tourism as a means of health promotion and enhancement. Proposals for further research are suggested.
A14|Retrato de la pobreza económica en España diez años después del inicio de la crisis: Un análisis descriptivo, bivariante y logístico de la insuficiencia de ingresos en 2018<BR>[Economic poverty in Spain after a decade of crisis: A descriptive, bivariate and logistic analysis of the income insufficiency in 2018]|"Given the social and academic relevance recently aroused by the social stratification, this paper aims to carry out a synchronic analysis that will serve as a ""picture"" of the factors associated with economic poverty in Spain, after ten years have elapsed since beginning of the Great Depression. With this purpose, we start from a relative conception of poverty, which allows us to treat the relative income insufficiency in terms of “poor” and “non-poor”. Therefore, a profile of individuals with low income in Spain is obtained, to later expose the socioeconomic and demographic factors related to this phenomenon through a bivariate analysis and several logistic regression models. Ultimately, our results show that there is no direct relationship between poverty and residence in the north or in the south of Spain, although the data show an association between it and other individual factors such as age, educational level, professional and employment situation or productive sector."
A14|Tres teorías demográficas, las evidencias disponibles y el paso de la descripción del cómo al entendimiento del porqué: Una aplicación y una crítica de tres hipótesis poblacionales en base a los casos de España y de la India (1950-2020)<BR>[Three demographic theories, the disposable evidence and the step between description and comprehension: An application and a critique of three population hypotheses based on the cases of Spain and India (1950-2020)]|This work aims to expose three of the main demographic theories, Demographic, Epidemiologic and Sanitary Transition theories, and explore its explanatory capacity. The content is structured in four sections. In the first we briefly review these theories. Secondly, we elaborate a diagnosis of the demographic structure of India and Spain, through its contextualization in the Asian and European context, respectively, and the use of several indicators. Next, we value the relationship between the evidence on these case studies and the hypotheses exposed. Finally, we outline possible theoretical critics based on these two cases

A14|The strategies of economic research - An empirical study|The paper analyzes the structure of strategies of economic research on a sample of all regular research papers in 10 general interest journals every 5th year from 1997 to 2017. It is 3,415 papers, with an annual upward trend of 3.3%. I have classified the papers into eight categories: The fraction in theory and empirics are almost equal large. Most empiric papers use the classic strategy, which derives an operational model from theory and run regressions. Several trends are highly significant - notably two main ones: The fraction of theoretical papers has fallen by 26 pp (percentage points), while the fraction of papers using the classic strategy has increased by 15 pp. Many papers using the classic strategy have been analyzed using meta-analysis, which show that the typical paper exaggerate the results reported substantially. There is no reason to believe that other strategies have smaller problems.
A14|Network Matching Efficiency along the Economic Cycle: Direct and Indirect Ties|There is a large consensus in the literature on the major role of social networks as a helpful instrument to find a job. In this paper, we study the social network matching rate along the economic cycle both from a theoretical and empirical perspective. Using the French Labor Force Survey for the period 2003-2012, we find that the relationship between the network matching rate based on direct ties and the job finding rate is decreasing and convex as predicted by our theoretical setup. Results are completely modified when we consider a measure of the network matching rate based on indirect ties related to the share of peers in a job. In this case, we find a linearly increasing relation between the network matching rate and the job finding rate. This underlines not only the heterogeneous ways through which network membership may influence the individuals' performance on the labor market, but also the different behaviors of these driving factors along the economic cycle.
A14|Manufacturing pluralism in brazilian economics: the role of ANPEC as institutional mediator and stabilizer|Brazilian academic economics has been traditionally characterized by its openness to different strands of economic theory. In contrast to the standards prevailing in most of Europe and North America, economics in Brazil can be justly described as pluralistic, with competing schools of thought enjoying relatively secure institutional positions. One of the reasons frequently ascribed for this outcome is the role played by ANPEC, the Brazilian economics association, in mediating conflicts among graduate programs affiliated to different research traditions. A crucial episode in this respect took place in the early 1970s, when the recently born association chose to adopt an inclusive stance towards its membership, welcoming the filiation of the strongly heterodox program at the University of Campinas (Unicamp) even against threats of withdrawal from one of its most prestigious members, the Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV). Using a host of primary sources related to the early years of Brazilian academic economics, the paper uncovers the processthat led ANPEC, with strong support from the Ford Foundation, to adopt an inclusive and ‘pluralistic’ attitude, and how it related to the political context prevailing in Brazil during the 1970s.
A14|Produção Científica e Redes de Colaboração dos Docentes Vinculados aos Programas de Pós-graduação em Economia no Brasil|Este artigo apresenta os resultados de um estudo sobre as potencialidades da utilização dos dados curriculares derivados das informações da Plataforma Lattes como ferramentas para avaliação do desempenho científico de pesquisadores. Um novo indicador, denominado “índice multidimensional de desempenho científico” (IMDC), é proposto considerando um amplo conjunto de indicadores bibliométricos que buscam captar diferentes formas da produção acadêmica dos atuais pesquisadores vinculados à pós-graduação em Economia no Brasil. Os resultados preliminares permitem evidenciar uma tipologia de pesquisadores considerando suas diferentes estratégias de atuação. Economistas com maior impacto na profissão adotam uma estratégia caracterizada por um equilíbrio entre qualidade, quantidade e colaboração científica.
A14|Leadership in Scholarship: Editors' Influence on the Profession's Narrative|Academic journals disseminate new knowledge, and therefore can influence the direction and composition of ongoing research by choosing what to publish. We study the influence of editors and coeditors of the American Economic Review (AER) on the topic structure of papers published in the AER between 1976 and 2013 using a textual analysis of manuscripts. We compare AER's topic structure to that of the other top general interest journals. The appointment of new AER editors, while accompanied by a minor comovement of AER topics towards topics of editor's post-appointment publications, serves more to premediate trends in the other Top 5 journals.
A14|Differences in Citation Patterns across Journal Tiers in Economics|We analyze citations patterns of more than 6,000 economics research articles published in top five, second tier, and top field journals. In line with previous literature, we find that although top five journals’ articles generally receive more citations and the life cycles of those citations are longer, their influence (in term of citations) is overestimated: a (non-)successful top five article receives only 3.5 (4) times as many cites as an equivalently (non-)successful second tier of top field article. Our contribution is to show that this ratio is strongly associated with the field of economics research, e.g. this ratio is lowest for econometric methods papers, and with the success of articles (as measured by citation counts), e.g. in all fields of economics research, except for theory, this ratio decreases sharply as we move toward more successful articles.
A14|Network formation with myopic and farsighted players|We study the formation of networks where myopic and farsighted individuals decide with whom they want to form a link, according to a distance-based utility function that weighs the costs and benefits of each connection. We propose the notion of myopic-farsighted stable set to determine the networks that emerge when some individuals are myopic while others are farsighted. A myopic-farsighted stable set is the set of networks satisfying internal and external stability with respect to the notion of myopic-farsighted improving path. In the case of a homogeneous population (either all myopic or all farsighted), a conflict between stability and efficiency is likely to arise. But, once the population becomes mixed, the conflict vanishes if there are enough farsighted individuals. In addition, we characterize the myopic-farsighted stable set for any utility function when all individuals are myopic.
A14|Shadow links|We propose a framework of network formation where players can form two types of links: public links are observed by everyone and shadow links are only observed by neighbors. We introduce a novel solution concept called rationalizable peer-confirming pairwise stability, which generalizes Jackson and Wolinsky (1996)’s pairwise stability notion to accommodate shadow links. We then study the case when public links and shadowlinks are perfect substitutes and relate our concept to pairwise stability. Finally, we consider two specific models and show how false beliefs about others’ behavior may lead to segregation in friendship networks with homophily, reducing social welfare.
A14|Ctrl+C Ctrl+pay: Do people mirror payment behaviour of their peers?|For stakeholders in the payment system seeking to influence the usage of specific payment instruments, it is important to know what drives consumers' choice of payment instrument. However, little is known about how the social environment influences payment behaviour. This study fills this gap by researching the relevance of peer effects for payment behaviour. We used the detailed payment diary data of Dutch consumers. Our findings show that payment behaviour is strongly influenced by the environment that people live in, especially when the environment is characterised by strong social cohesion. Hence, our study offers new insights into the diffusion of payment behaviour.

A14|Promoting Industrial Success through Managerial Organizational Culture: An Israeli Case Study|"Purpose -To describe the managerial attitude that resulted in outstanding economic success for one kibbutz industry. To analyze and understand the ""secret codes"" of economic success in this particular factory.Method - The research was conducted by qualitative investigation using ethnographical interviews and document analysis procedure.Finding - The findings described how the managers merged socialist traditions of the pre-privatized kibbutz and the capitalism of the global market in order to create a dynamic strategic model. The components of the model interacted with each other, creating an unusual organizational culture and a porous boundary between the factory and the kibbutz community that owned it. This case study demonstrates that innovative managerial strategies can emerge from a combination of conflicting economic systems and can produce stunning success in domestic and global markets.Original/ Value - The main contribution of this case study is the presentation of an alternative method for examining kibbutz industries in future research. This alternative method describes a managerial culture that facilitates the combination of two seemingly contradictory paradigms. The first is the kibbutz's socialist, cooperative, and communal principles. The second paradigm is the external capitalist realities of the domestic and global market. Beyond the research implications, this case study offers managers of kibbutz, and non-kibbutz, factories a practical example of a successful culture of combining opposite trends in management style."
A14|Conflict Management Competence by University Students|Conflict situations are an integral part of the work and the inability to resolve conflict is the biggest source of stress and dissatisfaction in the workplace. The aim of paper is to analyse conflict management strategies by university students. Reseach question is what choices of strategies for resolving conflict is prefered by university students.The paper is based on the analysis of available scientific literature about coflict resolution strategies and on the analysis of the results questionnaire survey among students of the Masaryk Institute of Advanced Studies of the Czech Technical University in Prague. Our study shows that students choose the easiest strategy for resolving conflict ? compromise or prefer to avoid conflict. The results show the need to learn and practice appropriate strategies for conflict management among students.
A14|Framing effect and the relationship between feelings, economic expectations and risk perceptions|This study examines the impact of the framing effect on the relationships between natural feelings and economic expectations and between natural feelings and risk perceptions. Respondents estimated their levels of negative and positive feelings, their expectations for improvement in their economic status in the future and their personal risk perceptions with respect to various events. Two versions of the questionnaire (positive and negative) were administered to two groups of participants. The results suggest that risk perceptions were more optimistic on the negative version than on the positive version of the questionnaire. Yet, items regarding economic expectations were more optimistic on the positive version. The results also show that higher levels of negative feelings correlate with pessimistic economic expectations and pessimistic risk perceptions on the negative version of the questionnaire but not on the positive version. We conclude that the relationships between natural feelings and economic expectations and between natural feelings and risk perceptions depend on how the risky items and the economic expectations items are framed.
A14|Migrants and refugees - perceptions, attitude and social distance. Data from Bulgaria|Part of a larger research focused on deviance in the context of intensified migration, the study explores changes in the perceptions of Bulgarians towards migrants and refugees coming to the country or passing by in large numbers in their way to West Europe. Although Bulgaria continues to be predominantly a country of origin of migration, we are currently observing a change of attitudes and reduced solidarity towards migrants and refugees in the country. Drawing on data from a set of representative surveys, we are able to reconstruct a detailed picture of the perceptions and social distance towards migrants. What is more, the design of the survey and samples, enables us to make a comparison and distinction between attitudes of respondents living near centers for temporary accommodation of refugees and the general population, i.e. to study the role and importance of proximity and involvement for social distance, solidarity and perception of migrants and refuges as threat.
A14|Travel Constraints of Taking a Volunteer Vacation Abroad|This study examines travel constraints and risks faced by Thai people in taking a volunteer vacation oversea. The primary objective of this study was to gain rich, in-depth, and holistic understanding of how Thai people perceive and interpret travel constraints and risks in taking a volunteer trip oversea. An interpretive paradigm utilising qualitative research approach was employed in this study. The data were gathered from 28 respondents who had experience in volunteering in Thailand, but had no experience in taking a volunteer vacation oversea. The number of the informants was determined by data saturation point, which is when new theme stopped emerging from the data during the data collection and analysis process. These informants were selected via purposive sampling and snowball sampling. A combination of semi-structured interviews and participant observation was used to collect the data. The data were then analysed by thematic analysis technique. The research findings showed that all informants in this study had perceived of travel constraints and risks which influenced their decision to take a volunteer trip oversea. In terms of travel constraints, three categories of travel barriers were identified: intrapersonal barriers; interpersonal barriers; and structural barriers. As for the travel risks, seven categories of risks were found including: risks concerning transportation; risks concerning laws and orders; health risks; risks concerning accommodations; risks concerning climate; risks concerning tourist attractions; and risks concerning medical support system.
A14|How are different means of happiness related? Life, job and income satisfaction in Turkey|This study investigates life (happiness), job and income satisfaction of women and men in paid work according to different demographic and value-based (in terms of the values associated with paid work and income) components, and to the extent they are correlated (findings are derived using the Life Satisfaction Survey (2016) provided by Turkish Statistical Institute). Preliminary descriptive statistics refer to relatively lower income satisfaction levels of women and men in Turkey (46.0 per cent of women and 48.6 per cent of men report that they are ?satisfied? or ?very satisfied? with their income), moderate levels of overall happiness levels (59.1 per cent of women and 59.6 per cent of men report that they are ?happy? or ?very happy? with their lives) and relatively higher levels of job satisfaction (81.0 per cent of women and 80.9 per cent of men report that they are ?satisfied? or ?very satisfied? with their jobs). Spearman's rank correlation coefficients demonstrate that happiness (life satisfaction) levels of women and men in paid work are positively correlated with their job and income satisfaction levels, and there is also a positive correlation between their job satisfaction and income satisfaction levels, all of which are on a weak to moderate level yet statistically significant. For men, the correlation between happiness and job satisfaction has the lowest (yet positive) value, whereas for women the lowest (though positive) value is observed for the relationship between happiness and income satisfaction. For both women and men, the correlation between job satisfaction and income satisfaction has the highest value, which is slightly stronger for women. The findings of this study support the spillover hypothesis, which claims that life and job satisfaction are positively correlated (income satisfaction also being involved in this context) as these components affect each other (Strauser, 2014).Strauser, D. R. (2014). Career development, employment, and disability in rehabilitation: From theory to practice. Springer Publishing Company.Turkish Statistical Institute. (2016). Life satisfaction survey.
A14|Determinants of Poverty among Mexican Migrants in Chicago|This paper examines the connection between immigration status, English language proficiency, educational achievement, time in the U.S., and economic sector of employment as determinants of poverty among Mexico-born migrants in Chicago, U.S. The theoretical framework of the study uses Human Capital Theory and the analysis is based on a multi-stage cluster probabilistic sample (2005-2006) of Mexican migrants obtained in Cook County which includes the City of Chicago. Analyses of logistic regression models show that the most relevant connections occur between poverty (dependent variable) and immigration status, time in the U.S., economic sector of employment, and English language proficiency. Thus, Mexican immigrants with citizenship status or residency permits (?green cards?) and Mexican immigrants with English language proficiency have a lower probability to be below the poverty threshold than their counterparts. Furthermore, female migrants, older migrants, and the unemployed or out of the labor force have a higher probability to be poor than their counterparts. The analysis of the sample?s educational achievement in Mexico shows that these migrants tend to have low levels of education. Similarly, the educational achievement obtained in the U.S. is significantly low among the individuals in the sample. These results point to the plight of the large levels of undocumented workers with low English proficiency and suggest the existence of structural problems that impede significant returns to human capital investments on Mexican education in the U.S. labor market.
A14|Beyond Budgeting - a fair alternative for management control? Examining the relationships between Beyond Budgeting, organizational justice and unethical behaviors|The influence of Management Control Systems (MCS) on the social framework of organizations has been discussed in research and practice since the seminal work of Chris Argyris (1953). In this context, the impact of MCS design on unethical behaviors has been of particular interest. To remedy MCS related unethical behaviors some researchers developed Beyond Budgeting (BB) as an alternative MCS approach that is rooted in McGregor?s Theory Y. BB builds on specific MCS characteristics and its proponents claim that these characteristics are capable to reduce MCS related unethical behaviors. However, there has been quite little research on the underlying effect mechanisms of the relationship between the design of MCS characteristics and unethical behaviors. Recent research suggests that the design of MCS characteristics has a significant impact on organizational justice perceptions. Furthermore, organizational justice has been found to be positively correlated with various positive organizational outcomes, particularly trust and behavior. This study tries to contribute to deepen the understanding of the interplay between MCS design, organizational justice and unethical behaviors by applying structural equation modelling to examine these relationships. The results suggest that some MCS characteristics that are part of a BB design have a significant impact on organizational justice perceptions. Moreover, the results also suggest that the enhancement of organizational justice perceptions might finally lead to a reduction of MCS related unethical behaviors.
A14|An assessment of social and economic factors for broadband penetration in Southern Africa Development Community (SADC)|The transformative benefits of broadband on economic and social variables have led governments to set ambitious targets for its deployment. In making a case for public policy on broadband, many studies have sought to identify and measure broadband economic benefits. Such benefits have not been fully realized in Third World economiesIn an increasingly integrated global economy, broadband is central in providing economic growth and competitiveness to any organisation, country or region. In spite of this competitive advantage of broadband, in the last four years Africa had mobile cellular penetration of 63% and penetration rate flattened at 5.2%. Social and economic factors have been cited as major contributors to this undesirable phenomenon. This papers assays to identify these factors, rank them and suggest possible remedies in the context of Southern Africa Development Community (SADC). The main research question this paper attempts to answer therefore is: how can broadband penetration within SADC region be improved?A confirmatory factors Analysis (CFA) was used to ascertain the conformity of these factors as obtained from raw data to what is given by literature. The weighting of these factors and policy interventions were then discussed as possible solutions for decision makers within the region.
A14|On the Information Contents of Indirect Citations|Suppose there are more researchers in the mainstream than in the fringe. If researchers have only partial appreciation of the research conducted by the other group, then a citation index that is increasing in both direct and indirect citations will bias in favor of mainstream researchers. To correct for such a bias, a citation index should be increasing in direct citations but decreasing in indirect citations. More indirect citations suggests that a researcher’s direct citations should be discounted more, because he is more likely to come from the mainstream, and many of those who cite him are also mainstream researchers with many direct citations.
A14|The Gift and Open Science|This short note illustrates how social structures and behavior of scientists in the societal sub-system of open science resemble patterns analyzed in the Gift, an essay written by Marcel Mauss nearly 100 years ago. The presented analysis goes beyond existing interpretations of gift giving in science. The latter has mainly focused on the exchange of knowledge and citations. I argue that the Gift explains also identity, competition, co-opetition, rituals, and punishment. Mauss’s Gift is seen as a complementary model to existing economic and sociological approaches regularly used to analyze structures and behavior in open science. By accentuating such an anthropological approach, I conclude that the Gift provides explanations of the stability and the expansion of the open science community.
A14|How to Count Citations If You Must: Comment|"Perry and Reny (2016) show that the Euclidean length of a citation list satisfies five axioms including ""depth relevance"". We explore ""breadth relevance"", which favors consistent achievers over one-hit wonders. A convex combination of depth and breadth relevant citation metrics does not satisfy the independence axiom, but violations are rare. We estimate the parameters of this metric using two datasets and three rankings, controlling for cohort effects. We find that simply counting citations--neither breadth nor depth--maximizes the correlation between citation index and department rank. However, depth may explain the allocation of researchers across lower ranked departments."
A14|Rise of the Kniesians: The professor-student network of Nobel laureates in economics|The paper presents the professor-student network of Nobel laureates in economics. 72 of the 77 Nobelists belong to one family tree. The remaining 5 belong to 3 separate trees. There are 350 men in the graph, and 4 women. Karl Knies is the central-most professor, followed by Wassily Leontief. Harvard is the central-most university, followed by Chicago and Berlin. Most candidates for the Nobel prize belong to the main family tree, but new trees may arise for the students of Terence Gorman and Denis Sargan.
A14|Social Diversity and Bridging Identity|We investigate within a model of cultural transmission the conditions under which increased social diversity within a population - e.g. due to the inflow of immigrants - raise the potential for conflict as opposed to harmonious social diversity. Drawing on evidence from psychological studies, we develop the concept of 'bridging identity', an individual trait that (i) directly affects utility in culturally diverse social groups but is immaterial in culturally homogeneous social groups; (ii) is fostered (probabilistically) in those born in culturally diverse social groups but not in those born in culturally homogeneous social groups. We find first, increased cultural diversity within a population can lead to more mixed social groups or increased segregation depending on the paceof change. This is in contrast to Schelling's models of residential segregation which would always predict increased segregation. Furthermore, a temporary negative shock to bridging identity can trigger a dynamic process of segregation in the form of outmigration from culturally diverse social groups. But, paradoxically, if the shock is severe enough, its effects are mitigated.
A14|Should citations be weighted to assess the influence of an academic article?|Citations are by nature heterogeneous. A citation worth may dramatically vary according to the influence of the citing article or to the journal's reputation from which it is issued. Therefore, while assessing the influence of an academic article, how should we weight citations to take into account their real influence? In order to answer this question, this article suggests various methods of weighting citations in the building of articles quality indicators. These indexes are then used to measure the influence of the articles published in the top five economic journals over the 2000-2010 period and analyses the sensibility of these indicators to the choice of the weighting schemes. Our main result is that whatever the weighting scheme, information carried by the different indicators is not significantly different. From Occam's razor principle, the number of citations provides an efficient and sufficient tool to measure research quality.
A14|Reclaiming the University: transforming economics as a discipline|Economics as a discipline is currently in disarray. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, academic experts, students, commentators, practitioners and politicians all questioned the status of academic economics and many called for a ‘new economic thinking’. Nearly a decade later, however, there is little evidence of a transformation in research and teaching. The present study first clarifies what is meant by a transformation of economics as a discipline, since this remains an ill-defined term and may be interpreted in very different ways. It then establishes the conditions of a successful transformation of the discipline in terms of intra-disciplinary and extra-disciplinary factors. The paper argues that economics as a discipline cannot be expected to trigger this transformation by itself (i.e. via self-regulation), since the ‘market for economic ideas’ is prone to market failure. In addition, the influence of external factors and actors on the market may serve to distort the congruence between the individual researcher’s utility and societal welfare. External incentives are therefore required to establish constitutional guardrails that ensure fair competition between ideas.
A14|Der vergessene Lippmann: Politik, Propaganda und Markt|"Das Paper gibt einen Überblick über das Leben und die Bedeutung von Walter Lippmann, der in der ersten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts einer der bedeutendsten Journalisten der USA war. Lippmann hat sich auch an Propagandaaktivitäten im Ersten Weltkrieg beteiligt und aufgrund dieser Erfahrung u.a. 1922 das Buch Public Opinion publiziert. Dieses Buch wird hier zusammenfassend beschrieben und in seiner Bedeutung eingeschätzt. Dies wird dann einem weiteren Buch von Lippmann Buch, nämlich The Good Society aus dem Jahre 1937, gegenübergestellt - das letztere Buch gab Anlass zum so genannten Walter Lippmann Colloque 1938 in Paris, das als die erste internationale Veranstaltung des Neoliberalismus gilt. Lippmanns Manipulationsideen werden verglichen mit denen, die Friedrich August von Hayek aus Anlass der Gründung der Mont Pèlerin Society , die als Nachfolgeorganisation des Walter Lippmann Colloque gilt: Lippmann hat vor Manipulation gewarnt, die Demokratie sei damit gefährdet. Demgegenüber wollte sich Hayek der Manipulation ""der Massen"" bedienen, nur so könne ""die Zivilisation"" gerettet werden."
A14|A Note on Efficiency in a Unifying Model of Strategic Network Formation| The main point of this note is to provide a simpler and shorter proof of the result on efficiency in Olaizola and Valenciano (2017a) based on a result on efficiency of weighted networks in Olaizola and Valenciano (2017b). Additionally, this shorter proof allows to refine the result by establishing new conclusions for the zero-measure boundaries separating the different regions of values of the parameters where different structures were proved to be the only efficient ones.
A14|L'organe comme marchandise fictive: une mise en perspective|La problématique des limites de la sphère marchande est aujourd'hui centrale en science sociale. D'où proviennent ces limites ? Comment sont-elles justifiées d'un point de vue moral ? L'objectif de ce texte est de tenter de dégager le fondement moral du rejet de la marchandisation de certains objets. Pour ce faire, on partira de l'étude d'un type d'objet (au sens physique du terme) dont la marchandisation est aujourd'hui largement rejetée : le rein. On essaiera dans un premier temps de comprendre le fondement moral de ce rejet. On fera ensuite le parallèle entre cette « économie morale » et celle qui s'était dressée contre la montée en puissance de l'économie de marché au moment de la révolution industrielle. On observera alors une similarité certaine entre les deux cas.
A14|Dissecting the act of god: an exploration of the effect of religiosity on economic activity|This research explores whether religiosity has a persistent effect on economic outcomes. We follow a three-step analysis. First, we use a sample of migrants in the United States to establish that religiosity in the country of origin has a lasting effect on the religiosity of migrants. Second, by exploiting variation in the inherited component of religiosity of migrants and controlling only for a baseline set of controls, we uncover a causal link between several aspects of religiosity and income level. The empirical findings of the second step suggest that i) church attendance has a positive impact on income; and ii) stronger faith is associated with a higher income. Finally, we augment the set of controls included in the measure of inherited religiosity in order to capture the effects of social capital, education, and of traits conducive to income growth. When controlling for social capital, the effect of religious attendance on economic outcomes vanishes, and when controlling for the presence of traits conducive to growth, the effect of intensity of faith vanishes as well. We therefore conclude that when properly accounting for unobservables, religiosity does not affect per capita income.
A14|From Karl Menger to Charles Menger? How Austrian economics (hardly) spread in France|The father of the “Austrian” Marginalist revolution and founder of the so-called “Austrian School of economics”, Carl Menger, had a mixed reception during different periods of development of French economics. Somewhat welcomed in the early days, he was rather forgotten later on. Even his major works were not published in translation until recently. What is the reason for such a situation? Criticisms of classical political economy have to be understood in their French context. In comparison to other countries, this paper details the case of France, besides showing how later Austrians, such as Friedrich Hayek, found a limited audience. This comparative study of economic ideas in France must start with the reception of the views of the founder and the role and impact of adopting/adapting or rejecting his views by French scholars. What place did they find in French academia? From Carl Menger to a “Frenchified” Charles Menger, how was Austrian economic thought disseminated in France? This essay starts by recalling the Belle-Époque and an astonishing letter by Charles Rist for the Jubiläum of Menger, in which he deplored the lack of translation of the latter’s works. The Austrian School in France is then discussed as pure economics replaces political economy in the Interwar period, with the 1938 Paris Congress of “liberal thinkers,” as the Vienna Circle became known, also comparing issues in philosophy. The paper considers how Austrian theories of “pure science” were received in Paris from the Vienna of the 1900s, at a time of ”Crossroads,” to the present day, through the Postwar and Cold War, until a revival since the 1990s and a rethinking of economic ideas after 2008.
A14|Network Matching Efficiency along the Economic Cycle: Direct and Indirect Ties|There is a large consensus in the literature on the major role of social networks as a helpful instrument to find a job. In this paper, we study the social network matching rate along the economic cycle both from a theoretical and empirical perspective. Using the French Labor Force Survey for the period 2003-2012, we find that the relationship between the network matching rate based on direct ties and the job finding rate is decreasing and convex as predicted by our theoretical setup. Results are completely modified when we consider a measure of the network matching rate based on indirect ties related to the share of peers in a job. In this case, we find a linearly increasing relation between the network matching rate and the job finding rate. This underlines not only the heterogeneous ways through which network membership may influence the individuals’ performance on the labor market, but also the different behaviors of these driving factors along the economic cycle.
A14|The Geography and Concentration of Authorship in the Top Five: Implications For European Economics|We study to what degree authors who publish in the five most prestigious journals in economics have previously published there and in which world region they are based. Although still high, the concentration of United States‐based and previously published top‐five authors has decreased. This trend is driven by increased co‐authorship between USA and non‐USA scholars and between scholars with and without previous top‐five articles. Only around 5% of all articles each year are written solely by first‐time authors from outside the United States, and this share has not increased since the mid‐1990s. Against this background, we argue that European institutions should be wary of putting too much emphasis on publishing in these five journals. Both the advancement and diversity of the economics discipline may otherwise suffer.
A14|The Gender Gap in Citations: Lessons from Demographic Economics Journals|This paper investigates gender differentials in citations of articles published in two journals specialized in Demographic Economics, a field that has traditionally attracted relatively large numbers of women researchers. In contrast to findings based on citations of top economics journals, we find a gender gap in citations favoring women among articles published in the Journal of Population Economics (JPOP) or the Review of Economics of the Household (REHO) between 2003 and 2014 . If the corresponding author is male, having at least one female co-author boosts citations. Across subfields of demographic economics, citations of female authors increase as female representation in the subfield increases. The gender gap in citations favoring women is not found for authors with limited experience past graduate school, which supports an explanation for the gender gap based on authors’ prior experience with economics journals of higher rank.
A14|Analysts and sentiment: A causality study|We analyze the role that financial analysts play in the sentiment effect on stock prices. Causality analysis reveals that sentiment affects various aspects of analysts’ forecasts and recommendations. We show that experienced analysts are aware of sentiment, consciously incorporate it and have some control over its effect. As a result, the sentiment effect on analysts replicates the sentiment effect expected in stock prices and actual forecast errors are limited to certain cases. Analysts expedite the propagation of sentiment to stock prices and probably enhance the effect by influencing sophisticated investors, but they do not initiate or shape it. The new regulations, “Research Analysts and Research Reports” and “Communications with the Public”, imposed in 2002, have reduced over-optimism due to sentiment.
A14|What user-innovators do that others don't: A study of daily practices|This paper argues that innovation behavior roots in specific socio-psychological set-ups that crystallize in daily practices and routines. The latter are easy to observe and have great potential for the identification of user-innovation behavior. We study the practices and routines of Russian user-innovators around media consumption, internet and technology-usage, consumer preferences and civic engagement in comparison with a sample of mere users. The derived model correctly classified 73% of the original grouped cases of user-innovators. We conclude that a set of practices relative to the certain economic, social and cultural background explains user-innovation engagement and how support could be provided. Although some of our findings are probably specific to Russia, the results are encouraging for further research into the importance of practices and routines in identifying user-innovators in various environments.
A14|Efficiency of weighted networks| In this paper, we address the question of the efficiency of weighted networks in a setting where nodes derive utility from their direct and indirect connections. Under rather general conditions, based on a set of assumptions about the value that connections in a weighted network generate, and about link-formation technology, we prove that any network is dominated by a special type of nested split graph weighted network. These conditions include some of the models in the literature, which are seen as particular cases of this general model.
A14|The Contestable Marketplace of Ideas: Paul Samuelson’s Defense of Mainstream Economics through Textbook Making, 1967-1976| Historians of economics rarely consider textbooks as more than passive receptacles of previously validated knowledge. Therefore, their active role in shaping the discipline and its image is seldom addressed. In this paper, I study the making of Paul Samuelson’s successive editions of Economics from 1967 to 1976 as an instance of how textbooks stand at the crossroads between disciplinary knowledge, pedagogy and larger political and societal concerns. In the mid-1960s, Economics, now at its sixth edition, was at the height of its success. Considered one cornerstone of modern economics, it was also the center of a number of criticisms dealing with the current state of the economic discipline and its teaching in the universities. While the profession expressed its concern over the lack of relevance of economics to address the pressing issues of the day and pleaded for a new “problem-solving” approach to economic education, the late 1960s witnessed the emergence of a new generation of “radical” economists criticizing the economics orthodoxy. Their contention that mainstream theory had neglected the issues of class struggle and capitalist exploitation, found a favorable echo among an increasingly politicized population. Using archival materials, I show how Samuelson, helped by his editorial team at McGraw-Hill, attempted to take into account these changes in order to ensure the continuing success of subsequent editions of his text in an increasingly competitive market. While this study emphasizes Samuelson’s ambiguous attitude toward his contenders, revealing on the one hand his belief in a free marketplace of ideas and, on the other hand, his attachment to mildly liberal politics and aversion to Marxism, unchanged through revisions, it also shows that the textbook is a collective endeavor, embodying different stakeholders’ views and market forces. Therefore, those who are interested in studying textbooks as a way to retrace the development of economic knowledge should not necessarily postulate authorial intent.
A14|Potterian Economics|Recent studies in psychology and neuroscience find that fictional works exert strong influence on readers and shape their opinions and worldviews. We study the Potterian economy, which we compare to economic models, to assess how Harry Potter books affect economic literacy. We find that some principles of Potterian economics are consistent with economists’ models. Many others, however, are distorted and contain numerous inaccuracies, which contradict professional economists’ views and insights, and contribute to the general public’s biases, ignorance, and lack of understanding of economics.
A14|Gender representation in economics across topics and time: evidence from the NBER|We document the representation of female economists on the conference programs at the NBER Summer Institute from 2001 to 2016. Over the 2013-16 period, women made up 20.6 percent of all authors on scheduled papers. However, there was large dispersion across programs, with the share of female authors ranging from 7.3 percent to 47.7 percent. While the average share of women rose slightly—from 18.5 percent in 2001-04—a persistent gap between the finance, macroeconomics, and microeconomics subfields remains, with women representing 14.4 percent of authors in finance, 16.3 percent of authors in macroeconomics, and 25.9 percent of authors in microeconomics. We examine three channels potentially affecting female representation. First, using anonymized data on submissions, we show that the rate of paper acceptance for women is statistically indistinguishable from that of men. Second, we find that the share of female authors is comparable to the share of women among all tenure-track professors, but is 10 percentage points lower than the share of women among assistant professors. Finally, within conference programs, we find that when a woman organizes the program, the share of female authors and discussants is higher.

A14|The Role of Health Promotion in Disease Outbreaks and Health Emergencies|Health promotion has a key role to play in disease outbreaks and health emergencies because it can offer well-established bottom-up approaches that engage with people to be an active part of a response. International agencies did learn from their earlier mistakes in, for example, the recent Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa, even though an attempt to engage with communities was not initially widely implemented. Many agencies preferred to use pre-packaged approaches which had an emphasis on individual behavior changes and health care delivery. This had a questionable effect because disease outbreaks and health emergencies must actively communicate with and involve people to be successful. Health promotion practice recognizes the value of community capacity-building, participation and empowerment—aspects that are already intrinsic to many health promotion programs. An understanding of how this is achieved in practice will help agencies to find an appropriate way forward to involve and better communicate with communities when the next disease outbreak inevitably occurs.
A14|Social Capital Accumulation among Puerto Rican Mothers in Urban Neighborhoods|Social capital provides access to material and personal resources through participation in social networks and other social structures. Social capital may not function equally for all populations, especially those living in residentially segregated urban neighborhoods with increased levels of poverty. This is because inequalities exist in social capital accumulation and are found where disadvantaged socioeconomic groups cluster. Using probabilistic household survey data consisting of 205 Puerto Rican mothers in Springfield, Massachusetts in 2013, this research tests hypotheses regarding the association of social capital accumulation with Puerto Rican mothers’ individual, neighborhood, and social network characteristics. Logistic regression results suggested that Puerto Rican mothers who were employed and lived in neighborhoods with other Latinos were more likely to accumulate social capital. In addition, mothers who participated in activities of their children also had increased social capital accumulation. This neighborhood effect on social capital accumulation may promote bonding social capital but not bridging social capital among these Puerto Rican mothers.
A14|What Do We Learn from Market Design?|In this paper we try to show how the social and political acceptance of Roth's market design for kidney exchange provides some explanation of the rejection of market logic. We address three hypotheses generally cited as potential causes of the market rejection of certain goods: (I) the corrupting nature of money, (II) the idea that the market as such would be rejected, and (III) the assumption that the basis for market rejection would be the dominance it implied between seller and buyer. The example of the device developed by Roth, Ünver and Sönmez (2004, 2005) regarding the matching of organs from living donors suggests a fourth hypothesis: the market rejection of organs appears to be based not on the existence of potential domination but on the fact that this market presupposes such domination. In other words, economic domination appears to be a prerequisite for the organ trade: no domination, no market.
A14|Estimating Rationality in Economics: A History of Statistical Methods in Experimental Economics|"Experimental economists increasingly apply econometric techniques to interpret their data, as suggested the emergence of ""experimetrics"" in the 2000's (Camerer, 2003; Houser, 2008; Moffatt, 2015). Yet statistics remains a minor topic in experimental economics' (EE) methodology. This article aims to study the historical roots of this present paradox. To do so, we analyze the use of statistical tools in EE from early economics experiments of the 1940's-1950's to the present days. Our narrative is based on qualitative analysis of published papers for the earliest periods and on bibliometric and quantitative approaches for the more recent time period. Our results reveal a significant change in EE' statistical methods, from purely descriptive methods to more sophisticated and standardized techniques. Statistics now plays a decisive role in the way EE estimates rationality, particularly in structural modeling approaches, but it is still considered as a non-methodological, because purely technical, matter. Our historical analysis shows that this technical conception was the result of a long-run evolution of research tactics in EE, that notably allowed experimental economists to escape from psychologist's more re exive culture toward statistics."
A14|Replication in Experimental Economics: A Historical and Quantitative Approach Focused on Public Good Game Experiments|"We propose a historical perspective on replication in experimental economics focused on public good games. Our intended contribution is twofold: in terms of method and in terms of object. Methodologically, we blend traditional qualitative history of economics with a less traditional quantitative approach using basic econometric tools to detect unnoticed historical patterns of replication. In terms of our object, we highlight a type of replication that we call ""baseline replication"", which is not present in explicit methodological discussions, yet central in the specificity of experimental economics regarding replication in economics."
A14|The Most Cited Articles from the Top-5 Journals (1991-2015)|This report documents what are the most cited articles published in the top-5 economics journals during the period 1991-2015. EconLit is used to collect bibliographic information about these articles, and we gathered yearly citations for each paper through the Web of Science database. We present different sorts of citation lists. Our most basic one ranks articles on the basis of the cumulated number of citations received between year of publication and 2015. To facilitate the comparison of articles of different ages, we also consider rankings by subperiods, and on the basis of normalized citations per year. Finally we report lists by field of economic research, as defined by the JEL codes of the papers. The report contains Internet links to all articles, allowing an easy and direct access to arguably the most influential economics literature published in the last 25 years.
A14|How Network Characteristics of Researchers Relate to Their Citation Indicators – a Co-Authorship Network Analysis Based on Google Scholar|The most common quantitative estimates of scientific performance are based on citation indices, and it is meaningful to identify what affects these indicators. In this work, we analyze the correlations between the citation characteristics of researchers and their co-authorship network parameters, which indicate the position of scientists in an academic network. To surpass the shortcoming of previous works we use a large sample and separate researchers by the year of their first citation. For constructing a co-authorship network, we used data about researchers from different disciplines, who have profiles in Google Scholar. The results of a count data regression model indicate that citations positively correlate with the number of co-authors, with position of the researcher in the co-authorship network (closeness centrality), and with the average number of co-author' citation. Also we reveal that the h-index and the i10-index are significantly associated with the number of co-authors and the average number of co-author citations. Based on these results, we can conclude that researchers who maintain more contacts and are more active than others have better bibliometric indicators on the average
A14|Social-scienciation of Economics and its Consequences: On a Relative Convergence between Economics and Sociology|We are currently in times in which an increased discussion on interdisciplinarity is on the agenda. Economics tends to go into directions of sociology, history, and psychology, taking on topics of their domains. Questions of convergencies and divergencies between the academic subjects are a result. This observation goes parallel with sociological debate on the status of sociology. Major questions remaining are: (1.) Has the field of sociology changed since Emilé Durkheim or Max Weber? (2.) Which domain can sociology claim as being its exclusive ground? Answers to these questions have to identify a broader landscape of academic division: Economics is moving increasingly in the direction of social topics and sociological ground. The “imperialism of economics” (Granovetter) is increasingly approaching traditional academic fields of history, psychology, and sociology. However, at least two psychologists (H. Simon, D. Kahneman) and an economic historian (R. Fogel) have received Nobel prizes in economics. How can sociology map with this trend, how can this challenge be converted into an academic opportunity? The paper will explore observed trends in detail in order to conclude that the public image of sociology may have declined during recent decades, but the strategic use and importance of (economic) sociology has never been greater. Economic sociology seems to have become an upgraded discipline since social networks, communication processes, institutions and culture are increasingly considered as core dimensions. Of course, the conclusion follows exactly the script of earlier instructions provided by Max Weber or Joseph Schumpeter.
A14|Global Integration and World Migration|This paper explores a theory of migration based upon a number of conjectures about the role of digital media. It proposes that a number of factors including rising use of the internet providing widespread access to global information and an intensified communication between regions and countries brought about, for example, by intensified trade links bring about expansion of peopleâ€™s social space. This also expands the factors through which they compare their own living standards and social life with others. This expansion increases peopleâ€™s stress and strengthens their inclination to resort to migration as a means of reducing this heightened stress. Other things held constant, the expansion of peopleâ€™s social space intensifies their inclination to move across geographical space.
A14|Potterian Economics|Recent studies in psychology and neuroscience find that fictional works exert strong influence on readers and shape their opinions and worldviews.

Many others, however, are distorted and contain numerous inaccuracies, which contradict professional economistsâ€™ views and insights, and contribute to the general publicâ€™s biases, ignorance, and lack of understanding of economics.
A14|Immigrant networks and remittances: Cheaper together?|We estimate the causal effects of immigrant networks on individuals’ remittance sending behavior for migrants from many different countries residing in Spain. Our methodology addresses typical issues that arise when estimating network effects: reverse causality, common unobserved factors, and self-selection. In particular, we instrument the size of networks by predicting the number of migrants in each location using the location’s accessibility by distinct methods of transportation and information about how migrants from each country initially arrived in Spain. Our findings show that immigrants from above-average remitting countries remit more if they live in larger networks. For a subset of countries that receive large remittance flows from Spain, we show that migrants in larger networks are less likely to use most expensive remittance channels, and that cost spreads between the most expensive and cheapest remittance service provider are lower for countries characterized by stronger networks. Our results suggest that network effects could boost policy efforts to lower remittance prices.
A14|Academic rankings and pluralism : the case of Brazil and the new version of Qualis|The paper approaches the theme of the relatively higher level of pluralism in Brazilian economics, when compared to the other countries, from a different approach used in the literature. Considering the Qualis as an instrument of great impact in the research of the Brazilian graduate education centers, mainly because of its impact in the CAPES evaluation of the centers, we analyze the abrupt change in the journal ranking that occurred in 2016. Before presenting this data, we first focused in understanding the metrics that are part of the Qualis, and how relevant the biases from other indexes than the Impact Factor are. Afterwards, we present a review of the national literature concerning the academic production in economics, showing how some problems due to incentives and structure still persist. We, then, present our results: we found out that the increase of journals in the higher strata of the Qualis without a research agenda bias, and with a great inclusion of specialized sub-fields of the discipline. Besides, the impact that this change will cause in the 2017 CAPES’ evaluation cannot be seen as favoring centers by their division in mainstream and non-mainstream. Having this in mind, we argue that the modifications keep incentives to pluralism, besides correcting many problems in the ranking.
A14|Normalisation of citation impact in economics|Abstract This study is intended to facilitate fair research evaluations in economics. Field- and time-normalisation of citation impact is the standard method in bibliometrics. Since citation rates for journal papers differ substantially across publication years and Journal of Economic Literature classification codes, citation rates should be normalised for the comparison of papers across different time periods and economic subfields. Without normalisation, both factors that are independent of research quality might lead to misleading results of citation analyses. We apply two normalised indicators in economics, which are the most important indicators in bibliometrics: (1) the mean normalised citation score (MNCS) compares the citation impact of a focal paper with the mean impact of similar papers published in the same economic subfield and publication year. (2) PPtop 10 % is the share of papers that belong to the 10% most cited papers in a certain subfield and time period. Since the MNCS is based on arithmetic averages despite skewed citation distributions, we recommend using PPtop 10 % for fair comparisons of entities in economics. In this study, we apply the normalisation methods to 294 journals (including normalised scores for 192,524 papers). We used the PPtop 10 % results for assigning the journals to four citation impact classes. Seventeen journals have been identified as outstandingly cited. Two journals, Quarterly Journal of Economics and Journal of Economic Literature, perform statistically significantly better than all other journals. Thus, only two journals can be clearly separated from the rest in economics.
A14|Publication performance vs. influence: On the questionable value of quality weighted publication rankings|"In broad parts of the scientific community the position in publication performance rankings, based on journal quality ratings is seen as highly reputational for the scientist. This contribution provides evidence that, at least in economics, such publication performance measures can not always be reconciled with measures for academic influence such as citation-based measures. We analyze data from the Scopus database as well as from the prestigious German-based Handelsblatt ranking for 100 renowned economists (lifetime achievement). Scholarly influence is proxied by various bibliometric indicators such as the number of citations, the h-index, the citations of the most cited paper as well as the hardly honorable Pi-Beta-score (""Publications Ignored, By Even The Author(s)""). We argue that publication performance measures based on journal ratings, such as the Handelsblatt rankings, are not good proxies for an economist's impact within the scientific community. From this perspective the value of publication performance rankings based on journal quality ratings is questionable."

Se trata de tra-bajadores cuya inserción económica no está atada a la seguridad social. Ahora, el gobierno pretende poner a tributar a esos sectores con la creación del monotributo, pero es difícil exigirle impuestos a una población que carece de derechos sociales: la tributación es un contrato social. La inseguridad económica y social ha obligado a las familias a volverse unidades económicas y asumir la protección social, sin embargo, ello tiene efectos sobre la configuración del mundo social que están por estudiarse. ****** Informal work in Colombia is very high compared to the standards of the region. These are workers whose economic insertion is not tied to social security. Now the government intends to tax these sectors by creating the ""monotributo"" (single tax), though it is difficult to impose taxes on a population that lacks social rights: taxation is a social contract. Economic and social inse-curity has forced families to become economic units and to assume social protection. This off course has effects on the configuration of society, and thus should be studied."

Within this context, we examine the life of Denis Sargan, describe his major research accomplishments, recount the work of his many doctoral students, and track this remarkable period that constitutes the Sargan era of econometrics at the LSE.
A14|Does money affect children’s educational outcomes? Evidence from Japan|Regarding children’s academic achievement, previous studies have concluded that the home learning environment is the most important factor and that public educational investment has limited influence. However, recent studies have found that factors related to public educational investment can also contribute to improved academic achievement and these studies have resolved the statistical problems relating to endogeneity. Based on scores from the 2010 Japanese National Achievement Test, this study examines the data using the instrumental variables technique. Statistically significant results are obtained for the public school expenditure budgets per class, but not for the home learning environment.
A14|Significance of Social Capital in Socio-economic Development of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Social capital is used in interdisciplinary research as an analytical tool for explaining how culture, trust, and cooperation between people may be put into a function of general good, economic development and society in general. The objective of this paper consists of identification and analysis of status in the field of groups and networks, trust and solidarity, collective action and cooperation, information and communication, social cohesion and inclusion, and empowerment and political action, as key dimensions of social capital, and all in the context of overview of its significance in socio-economic development of Bosnia and Herzegovina. For the purpose of implementation of the named aim, a secondary and primary research has been conducted (by surveying 100 members of the top management teams in Bosnian and Herzegovinian SMEs). The research results show a relatively unsatisfactory status in the area of observed dimensions of social capital in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the decision makers and creators of socio-economic policies should put in a more significant effort in the area of development of social capital which has a significant potential in the context of incitement of socio-economic development.
A14|Right-wing populism and market-fundamentalism: Two mutually reinforcing threats to democracy in the 21st century|"The article compares market fundamentalism and right-wing populism on the basis of its core patterns of thinking and reasoning. Based on an analysis of important texts in both fields we find many similarities of these two concepts in their ""inner images"". Thus, we develop a scheme of the similar dual social worlds of right-wing-populism and market fundamentalism and offer some recent examples of market fundamentalism and right-wing populism mutually reinforcing each other or serving as a gateway for each other. We then apply our scheme for the analysis of the recent political developments and its ideological roots in the US under Donald Trump."
A14|Citation Patterns in Economics and Beyond: Assessing the Peculiarities of Economics from Two Scientometric Perspectives|In this paper we explore three claims concerning the disciplinary character of economics by means of citation analysis. The three claims under study are: (1) economics exhibits strong forms of intellectual stratification and, as a byproduct, a rather pronounced internal hierarchy, (2) economists strongly conform to institutional incentives and (3) modern mainstream economics is a highly self-referential intellectual project mostly inaccessible to disciplinary or paradigmatic outsiders. The validity of these claims is assessed by means of an interdisciplinary comparison of citation patterns aiming to identify the peculiar characteristics of economic discourse. In exposing and discussing these peculiarities of economics, we emphasize the availability of two competing scientometric perspectives for assessing and interpreting our findings.
A14|You get what you ‘pay’ for: academic attention, career incentives and changes in publication portfolios of business and economics researchers|Abstract Since the 1990s, research on publication outputs in business and economics has almost exclusively focused on journal articles. While earlier work has shown that journal articles and other publications were indeed complements in the 70s and 80s, we find that this is no longer the case when we include the most recent decades. Apparently, the notable shift in the scientific community’s attention in the 90s on journal articles and the corresponding incentives towards publications in internationally highly ranked journals on average led researchers to focus one-sidedly on journal publications at the expense of other publication forms. To see whether the aggregate result also holds for individual researchers, we perform a cluster analysis and find four different types of individual researchers: “Journal Specialists”, “Book-Based Publishers”, a small group of “Highly Productive All-round Publishers” and a large group of what we call “Inconspicuous” researchers, with a very modest publication productivity in all forms. In addition, we find that researchers’ age matters for their publication patterns: in our sample, more experienced researchers are less productive with respect to journal articles, but more productive with respect to other publication forms. This, however, is not the result of an individual career effect. Rather, it can be attributed to a cohort effect: among today’s active researchers, the younger cohorts are more productive in journal articles than the older ones. Our explanation is as follows: the younger cohorts were still in their socialization and hiring phase and were more strongly affected by the newly introduced incentives towards international journal publications—and have thus reacted more strongly to the “regime change” resulting from the scientific community’s one-sided attention to publications in internationally highly ranked journals.
A14|Impact of Lower Rated Journals on Economists' Judgments of Publication Lists: Evidence from a Survey Experiment|Publications in leading journals are widely known to have a positive impact on economists' judgments of the value of authors' contributions to the literature and on their professional reputations. Very little attention has been given, however, to the impacts of the addition of publications in lower rated journals on such judgments. In our main tests, we asked sub-samples of economist in 44 universities throughout the world to rate either a publication list with only higher rated journals or a list with all of these but with additional publications in nearly as many respected but lower rated journals. Our primary finding was that the inclusion of lower rated journals had a statistically significant negative impact on these economists' judgments of the value of the author's contribution. To the extent that such judgments may influence research and publication strategies our findings imply negative implications on social welfare.
A14|Male Gatekeepers Gender Bias in the Publishing Process?|Using data on articles published in the top-five economic journals in the period 1991 to 2010, we explore whether the gender composition of editorial boards is related to the publishing success of female authors and to the quality of articles that get published. Our results show that female editors reduce, rather than increase, the share of articles that are (co-)authored by females. We also find evidence that female editors benefit article quality at low levels of representation on editorial boards, but harm article quality at higher levels. Several robustness checks corroborate these findings. Our results are broadly consistent with existing evidence on the behavior of gender-mixed hiring committees and of relevance for gender equality policy.
A14|A plausible Decision Heuristics Model: Fallibility of human judgment as an endogenous problem|This study meditates about mental heuristic rules as a representation of bounded rationality in individual decision making. The heuristic process presented here represents simultaneously limited computational capacity, the capacity to determine relevant information in complex contexts around beliefs, and time as an endogenous part of decision. The mathematical model of this heuristic rule correlates to the fallibility of the agent depending on the relative outcome of the alternatives in exogenous terms; the availability of only part of the information regarding the alternatives concert by beliefs; and the amount of time the decision maker is willing to spend on a decision based on previous experience and knowing that there is a tradeoff between time and fallibility. The resulting mathematical model can be applied to many disciplines like such as opinion models, game theory, the comparison of systems of distribution of authority, and fields that utilize the technique of agent-based models (ABM) that use individual behavior to study the macroscopic results of interactions.
A14|Understanding Social Market Economy, Francesco Forte and His Interpretation|Abstract The social thought which emerges from Francesco Forte’s economic writings proves to be mainly inspired by methodological individualism, though interpreted through a peculiar “personalistic” key. We will analyze the peculiar traits of his thought and the specific contribution that Forte gave to the understanding of a specific economic theory based on the doctrine of “Ordoliberalism” or the “Freiburg School.” In our work, we will show how Forte proposes an interpretation of that doctrine, according to two of his main points of reference in economic and philosophical thought: Luigi Einaudi and Antonio Rosmini Serbati. Finally, we will present an important aspect of Forte’s work: his institutional analysis in the light of the particular civil philosophy expressed by Christian social teaching.
A14|A model of scholarly publishing with hybrid academic journals|Abstract In April 2013, all of the major academic publishing houses moved thousands of journal titles to an original hybrid model, under which authors of accepted papers can choose between an expensive open access (OA) track and the traditional track available only to subscribers. This paper argues that authors might now use a publication strategy as a quality signaling device. The imperfect information game between authors and readers presents several types of Perfect Bayesian Equilibria, including a separating equilibrium in which only authors of high-quality papers are driven toward the open access track. The publishing house should choose an open-access publication fee that supports the emergence of the highest return equilibrium. Journal structures will evolve over time according to the journals’ accessibility and quality profiles.
A14|Citations, journal ranking and multiple authorships reconsidered: evidence from almost one million articles| In this article, we reconsider the investigation by Moosa (2016) using a much larger data set of almost one million articles listed in Research Papers in Economics. This article provides new insights into the effects of co-authorship on citation counts and the correlation between quality of papers and quality of the publishing journal. Our evidence is partially in contrast to the results reported in Moosa (2016). We find a positive correlation between the h-index of a journal and the quality of papers measured in terms of citations. This correlation becomes almost perfect using a nonlinear model. Results from a regression of citation counts on the number of authors show evidence of a positive and significant effect of co-authorship on the quality of a paper when time effects and large sets of top-cited articles are taken into account. The inclusion of time effects and the large data set, that allows to differentiate between top-cited cohorts, adds further insights to the existing literature.
A14|Title characteristics and citations in economics|Abstract We investigate the relationship between article title characteristics and citations in economics using a large data set from Web of Science. Our results suggest that articles with a short title that also contains a non-alphanumeric character achieve a higher citation count.
A14|The integration of economic history into economics|Abstract In the USA today the academic field of economic history is much closer to economics than it is to history in terms of professional behavior, a stylized fact that I call the “integration of economic history into economics.” I document this using two types of evidence—use of econometric language in articles appearing in academic journals of economic history and economics; and publication histories of successive cohorts of Ph.D.s in the first decade since receiving the doctorate. Over time, economic history became more like economics in its use of econometrics and in the likelihood of scholars publishing in economics, as opposed to, say, economic history journals. But the pace of change was slower in economic history than in labor economics, another subfield of economics that underwent profound intellectual change in the 1950s and 1960s, and there was also a structural break evident for post-2000 Ph.D. cohorts. To account for these features of the data, I sketch a simple, overlapping generations model of the academic labor market in which junior scholars have to convince senior scholars of the merits of their work in order to gain tenure. I argue that the early cliometricians—most notably, Robert Fogel and Douglass North—conceived of a scholarly identity for economic history that kept the field distinct from economics proper in various ways, until after 2000 when their influence had waned.
A14|Inside Job or Deep Impact? Using Extramural Citations to Assess Economic Scholarship|Does academic economic research produce material of scientific value, or are academic economists writing only for clients and peers? Is economics scholarship uniquely insular? We address these questions by quantifying interactions between economics and other disciplines. Changes in the impact of economic scholarship are measured here by the way other disciplines cite us. We document a clear rise in the extramural influence of economic research, while also showing that economics is increasingly likely to reference other social sciences. A breakdown of extramural citations by economics fields shows broad field impact. Differentiating between theoretical and empirical papers classified using machine learning, we see that much of the rise in economics’ extramural influence reflects growth in citations to empirical work. This parallels a growing share of empirical cites within economics. At the same time, the disciplines of computer science and operations research are mostly influenced by economic theory.
A14|Fighting gender inequality in Sweden|Sweden ranks among the best OECD countries in terms of gender equality. Women have a high employment rate, outperform men in education and are well represented in government and parliament. Nevertheless, without further policy measures, achieving parity is still a distant prospect in several areas. Wage differences between genders persist; women are under-represented on private company boards, in senior management positions, in many well-paid and influential professions and among entrepreneurs. Hence, there is scope to make further progress on gender equality. The share of the parental leave reserved for each parent should be increased further, as inequality in leave-taking and long parental leaves harm women’s career prospects. Fighting stereotypes in education is necessary to improve women’s access to professions where they are under-represented. Government programmes need to promote women’s entrepreneurship further. Special attention should also be paid to the integration of foreign-born women, whose employment rate is much lower than for their male counterparts.
A14|Application of the PROperty FITting Method (PROFIT) to Classification of EU Countries Based on Their Innovation Level|As it is known, innovativeness can be measured by using many known indices, such as the Global Innovation Index, the Summary Innovation Index, etc. and often these indices are based on different methodologies and take into consideration different sets of diagnostic variables. As a consequence, the final evaluation of innovativeness may strongly depend on the innovation index used. Obviously, some groups of indices lead to similar ranks of the EU countries. Nevertheless, if there are at least two groups of indices which provide different ranks of these countries, a problem with the proper evaluation of their real innovativeness arises. One of the solutions is to select the most valuable indices by observing the impact of all indices on forming distances between innovativeness levels of the EU countries. Following this option, the main aim of this paper is classification of the EU countries with respect to their innovativeness and the evaluation of international index influences on the classification obtained. The aim of the paper is to conduct the research on differences in innovation intensity across the EU member countries. For the purpose of the article, the PROFIT (PROperty FITting) method, an extension of multidimensional scaling (MDS), was applied. The ultimate goal of MDS techniques is to produce a geometric map that illustrates the underlying structure of complex phenomena, for instance, innovativeness of the EU countries. It is a widely used method which collects attribute ratings for each object (country) and then finds the best correspondence of each attribute to the derived perceptual space. Applying the PROFIT method needs linear regression techniques and provides some additional information, i.e. the impact of the considered set of diagnostic variables on the shape of the perception map. The final result is a two-dimensional map of the EU countries which reflects distances among their innovativeness levels along with vectors presenting the influence of international indices of innovativeness on the structure of this map. The nature of the results and the ways in which they are interpreted are subsequently reviewed. The main conclusion drawn from the perception map created concerns the interpretation of the above-mentioned vectors, i.e. the information about the role of each international innovation index in clustering the EU countries with respect to their innovation intensity is obtained.
A14|The Importance Of Quality In Customer Service On The Example Of The Banking Sector|Competitive counts the provider that rendered by the customer service better than the other and through the quality strategy overcomes the competitors and reaches a commercial success. In view of the particular attention should be paid to the quality of the service which significantly affect the customer loyalty. The aim of this study was to investigate the importance of quality in customer service individual commercial banks. For this purpose a SERVQUAL using the questionnaire especially by which was calculated difference between expectations and insight from the consumers on the areas being audited quality customer service. Research background: Cooperative Bank in Kalisz Pomorski (Pomeranian province), Bank of Environmental Protection in Bydgoszcz (Kujawsko - Pomorskie), and a third bank, who reserved to publish their data in research. Purpose of the article: The aim of this study was to investigate the importance of quality in customer service individual commercial banks. Methodology/methods: The method used in the work to analyze the results of the survey method was SERVQL. Findings & Value added: Each subject area of service quality in the assessment of customers' needs some improvements, because in each of them there is a discrepancy between expectations and insights. Banks as service companies must be aware that the quality of service, appropriate communication with the client, contributes not only to improve their image, but primarily becomes a factor distinguishing them from competitors.
A14|Overeducation In The Labour Market|During the transition period in Poland, its labour market changed dynamically. Many new phenomena which the Polish economy had never seen before manifested themselves. The society showed greater interest in higher education and the market for education services expanded, increasing the number of colleges and universities, especially private ones. This helped the spread of higher education, which for years determined the level of human capital represented by the supply of labour. Today’s labour market in Poland is showing signs of imbalance. One of the reasons involves overeducation. The phenomenon has been known since the 1970s. It was then described for the first time in pertinent literature, with the US where overeducation occurred on a large scale and where it had a number of adverse effects across the entire economy having been used as an example. It seems important to understand and analyse the reasons for the emergence and perpetuation of this phenomenon on the Polish labour market and to indicate its implication. The paper aims to present and discuss overeducation in terms of selected economic theories, identify its causes in Poland and further to determine the economic and social implications of the persistence of the phenomenon in the long run. The paper consists of a theoretical part developed based on selected Polish and English-language literature. The empirical material used in the paper comes from latent data originating in domestic and EU statistical databases, and is further partly sourced out from the author’s own research, and data collected by other researchers. Based on the author’s analysis, it can be concluded that overeducation is a complex phenomenon. It is possible to identify several reasons for its occurrence and long-drawn persistence on the Polish labour market. Some of the reasons have to do with the dynamic growth of the labour market and the educational services sector, society’s desire to gain higher education, structural mismatches in the labour market and a common education policy at the EU level. Overedutaion has far-reaching consequences, both for the entire economy and the single participant of the labour market alike. The fact of its occurrence determines the processes taking place in the labour market, especially those related to employment.
A14|Influence of Group Purchasing Organizations On Financial Situation Of SMEs|Research background: SMEs often operate in markets where they compete with large companies. A fight for the customer, payment backlogs, problems with debt collection and new branches make management seek solutions that will influence positively on the situation of financial companies. Maintaining liquidity and generating income are the primary steps to build a competitive position and a progressive development of enterprises. One of the most popular methods that allows companies to do profitable business and increase their chances for safety is operation within group purchasing organizations. Currently in the market there are many different types of GPOs (Group Purchasing Organizations). The choice of the right one is a chance to improve their financial situation. Purpose of the article: This article presents functioning of enterprises within group purchasing organizations and their impact on financial situation of enterprises. In the article the classification of groups is done and there are shown the benefits that commercial enterprises operating in them gain. The article presents some obstacles to join specific group purchasing organizations and difficulties faced by companies operating in them. Methodology/methods: The studies will be carried out on the basis of 60 SMEs. These companies operate in five Polish GPOs. The groups were divided into branch and multi-branch ones. The study period covered the years 2013-2015. In order to analyze the impact of purchasing groups on the financial situation of enterprises there were used selected groups of financial ratios and a preliminary analysis of financial balance sheets and profit and loss account was conducted Findings: The analysis showed that the choice of an appropriate group purchasing organization has a large impact on financial situation of companies. Different opportunities can be offered by a sectoral purchasing group than the multi-sectoral one. Research has shown that better results relate to dynamics of revenues, costs, liquidity, profitability that gives the operation within the sectoral purchasing groups.
A14|The Research Excellence Framework 2014, journal ratings and the marginalization of heterodox economics|The Research Excellence Framework (REF) is the main research assessment for universities in the UK. It informs university league tables and the allocation of government research funding. This paper analyses the evaluations of the REF 2014 for Economics, Business, Politics and History. We analyse, first, from which journals, articles have been submitted; second, to what extent journal ratings and impact factors predict the REF´s evaluations; third, how many articles from heterodox economics journals have been submitted. We find that a small group of journals dominate the outputs submitted. Journal ratings and impact factors explain 86 to 89% of the variation in the output evaluations for Economics. These values are lower but still substantial for other disciplines. Few papers from heterodox economics journals were submitted to Economics. Overall, the REF in its present form marginalises heterodox economics, pushes it out of the discipline and endangers pluralism in economics research.
A14|Who is the ‘Journal Grand Master’? A new ranking based on the Elo rating system|In this paper we transfer the Elo rating system, which is widely accepted in chess, sports and other disciplines, to rank scientific journals. The advantage of the Elo system is the explicit consideration of the factor time and the history of a journal's ranking performance. Most other rankings that are commonly applied neglect this fact. The Elo ranking methodology can easily be applied to any metric, published on a regular basis, to rank journals. We illustrate the approach using the SNIP indicator based on citation data from Scopus. Our data set consists of more than 20000 journals from many scientific fields for the period from 1999 to 2015. We show that the Elo approach produces similar but by no means identical rankings compared to other rankings based on the SNIP alone or the Tournament Method. Especially the rank order for rather ‘middle-class’ journals can tremendously change.
A14|Utopian Left-Wing Expectations and the Social Consequences of the 3rd Memorandum in Greece|In January 2015 the radical left SYRIZA has won the Greek national elections and formed a coalition government with Independent Greeks (ANEL), a right-wing populist party. After a seven-month negotiation with Greece’s creditors and the agreement for the implementation of a third memorandum of fiscal adjustment, SYRIZA announced the conduction of a second round of national elections in September 2015. After a second electoral victory, SYRIZA formed again a coalition government with ANEL. The main characteristic of SYRIZA’s pre-electoral campaign was that it has primarily focused on the commitment for austerity measures termination and on the implementation of tax alleviation. Even during the second electoral campaign in September 2015, after the agreement for the implementation of the third memorandum of fiscal adjustment, SYRIZA was promising that its implementation will be socially endued in order to reduce negative social consequences, such as those created by the previous memoranda. Practically though, after the first months of the new memorandum implementation, it is obvious that the government has introduced an unprecedented tax policy. Interestingly, this policy is not different from a traditional left logic of tax enforcement but actually leads to the implementation of horizontal austerity policies which firstly affect the socially vulnerable groups. From this point of view, while SYRIZA emphatically declare that it aims at resolving the crisis, its policies seem to deepen the depression. For instance, its inability to find alternative options to finance the social security system, leads to the implementation of restrictive policies which dismantle the welfare state. This paper aims at analyzing the policies of the first left government in Greece by focusing on the tentative social consequences of the third memorandum and at the same time, studying some of the basic factors for its electoral victory, such as populism.
A14|What are the top five journals in economics? A new meta-ranking| We construct a meta-ranking of 277 economics journals based on 22 different rankings. The ranking incorporates bibliometric indicators from four different databases (Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and RePEc). We account for the different scaling of the bibliometric indicators by standardizing each ranking score. We run a principal component analysis to assign weights to each ranking. In our meta-ranking, the top five journals are given by: Quarterly Journal of Economics, Journal of Financial Economics, Journal of Economic Literature (JEL), Journal of Finance, and Econometrica. Additionally, leaving out the JEL as a survey journal and the finance journals in our top 10 list we confirm the perceived top five journals in the economics profession.
A14|The impact of “anti-political” parties after the restoration of democracy in Greece and the challenge of confronting the crisi|There have been almost 40 years after the restoration of democracy in Greece and a peculiar prosperity, which was consciously cultivated by the leaders of political and economic elites, was promoted before the onset of the financial crisis. However, from the beginning of the financial recession, the temporal illusions have been revealed and the need of a complete transformation of the financial policies has been expressed, while a significant transformation of the entire political culture has started. Parties such as SYRIZA, Independent Greeks(ANEL) and Golden Dawn took advantage of the growing social discontent by propagating themselves as exponents of ordinary people and of their concerns or their fears, as the expression of resistance against an avoidable sellout of public values. However, crisis has exposed a number of successive truths which were elaborately hiding in the underbelly of the detaining political and socioeconomic system. These truths were exteriorized once it became clear that the foundations on which the Greek society was based after the restoration of democracy, were weak and insufficient to lead country towards a modern future.
A14|Communism - A survival analysis|Human generation try to fit into a 4 dimensional survival concepts comprising the Environment, Geography, Economic and Social dimensions, over centuries and their pedigree too progressed under these guidelines. Because of the divergent level of survival targets in the economic and social strata by each human being, wealth accumulation flows unequally among the people. Industrial revolution mechanised the human work, with cost reduction and quality/volume optimization and planted Capitalism in the world, creating a wedge in the wealth accumulation process. This inducted a class war between the owners of wealth versus the workers, who are hired and fired by them. Competition made the capitalist to realise the importance of labour and diluted their concept as “Socialism”. The disproportionate wealth accumulation among people seeded the concept of communism in the world. Communism originated by Marx in Germany, spread to Russia and was promoted by Lenin. Both assumed that the large volume of people in the world belong to the low wealth possessing worker class, will revolt towards equal wealth share, and Communism shall dominate the whole world soon. But both Marx and Lenin were “Social revolutionists” and lacked “futuristic management thoughts” on how the shared wealth will be recycled to grow more, and result in prosperity among the equally shared population ? With this limited thought, the USSR (1922) and the East Germany (GDR-1961) and were created, with the entire wealth of the nation pooled on the apex “State”, representing the entire population. The state became a monopoly and all the people were simple labourers, without any self possessions. The state utilised the labour like a commodity, without any motivation to use their original ideas and any incentive to improve the productive contribution spirit. As a result, the GDR collapsed in 1989 and the USSR dwindled in 1991, bringing an end to the 69 year old Communist concept. Also both started promoting the diametrically opposite Capitalist approach and established cooperation with the (imperialist) USA. Communism could have survived and continued as a guide for wealth and prosperity for all the nations and their people in the world, if the domestic population was considered as “superior” to the “state”. The national wealth owned by the “State” should have been invested in sectorial projects and entrusted to optimum group of people to work, manage and encouraged to meet a targeted quality volume. State should have met all needs of these groups of people. A reasonable share of the net gains should have been distributed in equal proportion to all the people involved, as an incentive. Below targets and loss should have been questioned and corrective action should have been taken. In addition, the productivity and management decision should have been oriented towards ‘socio-economic Development units”. The domestic investment should be made from domestic savings and domestic technology should be manned by the domestic labour.
A14|Common dreams, different circumstances: Lessons from contemporary development economics|Freedoms, rights, and equality are common dreams among different human societies irrespective of their economic, social, political and cultural circumstances. This paper presents a brief discussion on the reasons for the divergence of circumstances different civilisations find themselves into by linking this dichotomy with arguments available in contemporary development economics.
A14|Society case study: Why formal education is the common goal of human progress|The case study discusses the importance of formal education not only as a means to economic empowerment but also its application in intra cultural harmony that may solve for many intra national and international conflicts. Education for women is emphasised as useful economic strategy whereby women participation in skilled labour force may improve the trading capacity of developing countries in international markets.
A14|Roles Of Communities Of Practice For The Development Of The Society|At present one of the most important concepts in social learning theory is the idea of communities of practice (CoP), which describes a learning theory with a strong relationship to the social construction of knowledge. A CoP is a collection of people who engage on performing a common activity for the welfare both of members of the community and the society. In modern society, it is used in some form of high levels of skills, knowledge and proficiency to perform the jobs properly. It plays an important role in the sharing of knowledge and creating value for both their members and organizations. A CoP is composed of three crucial characteristics: domain, community, and practice, which provide a guide to the development of community. The paper describes structural components, basic characteristics, and essential elements of a CoP. It also highlights benefits, importance, and the challenges and barriers of a CoP. In addition, it describes virtual CoP in brief. The main aim of this study is to explore the ins and out of a CoP in some details
A14|Is joy an emotional function of age and gender?|Historically, psychological researches on emotion were focused more on negative emotions. Recently, researchers have directed their attention towards positive emotion because of positive emotions is in crises throughout the globe (Fredrickson et al, 2003). So, it is an emerging field of study, many areas of which are under developed. The present research is aimed at exploring two of such areas: gender and age differences in positive emotions. Because of the suggested importance of studying discrete units of positive emotion, only one emotion i.e. joy was selected for the study. Dispositional Positive Emotion Scale-Joy sub scale was administered on 479 participants (331 men, 148 women), age ranging between 20 and 49. Following two hypotheses were generated: first, women feel lesser joy than men; and second, intensity of joy feeling varies with age. The results were consistent with the first hypothesis. For the second hypothesis, no significant differences are found in the feeling of joy among people belonging to different age groups.
A14|Youth Within Transition: Recent Developments in Education and Employment in Yogyakarta|Yogyakarta as a parameter for the development of national education offers potential young and educated human resources. It is hoped that this potential will trigger youth’s productivity to contribute in the demographic bonus and national development. From the perspective of economic growth, Yogyakarta tends to have an increasing trend when compared to that of national economy which tends to decline. However, the increasing trend can become a problem when the educated youth are unproductive and fails to transition from education field to working field. The data of Yogyakarta’s GDRP from 2003 to 2013 shows a dependency on the trading, tourism and services sectors. Optimism towards those three sectors do show a percentage increase, but it is not in sync with the education potential and employment for the youth. There is a transition from young labour who are self- or family-employed into low-rank employees and paid labor. There are at least two effects of this phenomenon. First, the data shows that the number of unemployed youth become stagnant with high school as the highest completed education. This indicates a hindrance for transition among youth from secondary education to higher education. Second, this obstacle prevents youth from moving into a higher income bracket and traps them in below-average wages. In reality, economic growth is still reliant on the services and consumption sectors, thus a transitory approach is needed that can involve the youth not as an object but as a main feature of Special Region of Yogyakarta is needed.
A14|Baloch Insurgency and its impact on CPEC|CPEC, a significant development project, aims to connect Pakistan and China through highways, oil and gas pipelines, railways and an optical fiber link all the way from Gwadar to Xinjiang. Being the biggest venture in the bilateral ties of China-Pakistan, the project faces certain undermining factors. The research explores the lingering security concerns that surfaced due to the destabilizing and separatist efforts of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and Baloch Liberation Front (BLF). It also elaborates the Chinese concerns and Pakistan efforts to address these concerns while assuming the hypothesis that a secure and stable environment is necessary to reap the fruits of this mega project. The work also answers some innovative questions thus helpful for the students of Economics, Pakistan history, politics, Internal Relations, Foreign Policy and for those who intend to read about China-Pakistan and their joint ventures as CPEC. The main objective of the study to empirically analyses the response of Baloch community. Graphical and empirical methods have been adopted to describe and analyze the facts and figures related to the topic. The results clearly indicate that CPEC will face resistance from people of Balochistan, which will negatively affect the prospects of CPEC. The results also indicate that social issues like migration should be tackle to increase the benefits. Furthermore, people think that such project is important for growth and development of the country.
A14|Hegemoni Pemerintah Terhadap Pedagang Pasar: (Analisis Dominasi Pemerintah Pasca Revitalisasi Pasar Kite Sungailiat Menurut Antonio Gramsci)<BR>[Government Hegemony Against Market Traders: (Analysis of Government Domination After Revitalization of Sungailiat Kite Market According to Antonio Gramsci)]|Hegemony is the dominance of one class against another class due to ideological and political reasons. Hegemony is done through a consensus mechanism not by suppression of other social classes. There is a government hegemony towards market traders at Sungailiat Kite Market. The intellectual power used by the government is able to influence traders' awareness to follow government policies. Traders who feel disadvantaged by policies are unable to fight. The resistance of traders can be overcome by the government by forming a consensus between the government and traders. Consensus was carried out to influence traders' thinking to follow the rules made by the government.
A14|Identifikasi Modal Sosial Masyarakat Terhadap Restorasi Lahan Pasca Tambang: (Studi Masyarakat Desa Bukit Kijang, Kecamatan Namang, Kabupaten Bangka Tengah)<BR>[Identification of Community Social Capital to Post-Mining Land Restoration: (Study of the Bukit Kijang Village, Namang District, Bangka Tengah Regency)]|Social capital is an important instrument that has an influence on people's lives socially and economically. This decade's economic development is an interesting concern for all people, especially the government, in realizing public welfare. This reality relates to the focus of this research study on post-mining land restoration programs that are taking place in the Bukit Kijang Village. This study uses qualitative research methods with a case study approach. Meanwhile this study uses the theory of the character James Coleman regarding the concept of social capital. The purpose of this study is to identify social capital in the lives of the people of Bukit Kijang Village towards the ongoing post-mining land restoration program in the village. The results showed that the low social capital in the Bukit Kijang Village community. Some indicators of social capital that can be elaborated such as the low level of community participation in post-mining land restoration programs, low information flows such as ineffective communication in the Bukit Kijang Village community. In addition, the low social relations that exist in the community, such as the lack of community participation in the implementation of programs pioneered by the Bangka Regency Government and the Ministry of Environment and the private sector involved in the program.
A14|Impact of Lower Rated Journals on Economists' Judgments of Publication Lists: Evidence from a Survey Experiment|Publications in leading journals are widely known to have a positive impact on economists' judgments of the value of authors' contributions to the literature and on their professional reputations. Very little attention has been given, however, to the impacts of the addition of publications in lower rated journals on such judgments. In our main tests, we asked subsamples of economists in 44 universities throughout the world to rate either a publication list with only higher rated journals or a list with all of these but with additional publications in nearly as many respected but lower rated journals. Our primary finding was that the inclusion of lower rated journals had a statistically significant negative impact on these economists' judgments of the value of the author's contribution. To the extent that such judgments may influence research and publication strategies our findings imply negative implications on social welfare.
A14|Coauthors and Collaborations|This personal reflective essay summarizes and explains why the frequency with which I have coauthored research has varied over my career and discusses the reasons that my coauthored publications and collaborations have arisen. The reasons include research that arises from casual conversations with colleagues, the sharing of data both as a donor and as a recipient, invitations to participate in large-scale projects, the division of labor and working with people with complementary skills and personalities, educating graduate and undergraduate students and the desire to give the former a leg up in the job market and to encourage the latter to pursue doctoral study, discussions with my wife about issues she faced as a teacher and administrator in public K12 education, and efforts to magnify my impact on an area of study by convening conferences, commissioning papers, and seeing conference volumes through to publication.
A14|Gendered careers: women economists in Italy|Recent reforms of the Italian university system introduced a centralized national qualification competition (called ASN), necessary for accessing all academic positions in the country. Following a well-known international trend, the new mechanism is founded on rigid standardized indexes of “scientific productivity” based on bibliometric indicators. In economics, women’s lower success rate (35%) compared to men’s (44%) is often connected to lower productivity. We provide evidence matching all candidates’ CVs with their record of publications on EconLit, showing that women’s typical career profiles, e.g. in terms of type of publications, topics and methods of inquiry, were penalized regardless of scientific productivity. Our work aims not only at documenting, through a large scale natural experiment, the causes of the underrepresentation of women in academia (especially in top positions) and within economics, but also at raising the issue of new incentives and constrains that increasingly push women to uniform their careers and their research interests to those of their men colleagues.
A14|Bibliometrics vs. Diversity in the Top Academic Career Positions in Economics in Italy|Following an international trend, Italy has reformed its university system, especially concerning methods and tools for research evaluation, which are increasingly focused on a number of bibliometric indexes. To study the impact of these changes, we analyse the changing profiles of economists who have won competitions for full professorship in the last few decades in Italy. We concentrate on individual characteristics and mainly on scientific production. We show that the identification of a univocal and standardized concept of “research quality” within the new research assessments has progressively imposed a strategy of “homologation”, especially for women. We find that women economists are at a higher risk of discrimination than their male colleagues and thus they are more likely to conform their research activities to the standardized profile imposed by the gender-blind application of biased bibliometric methods.
A14|Three decades of publishing research in population economics|Abstract The Journal of Population Economics is celebrating its 30th birthday. When the first issue was published, population economics was non-existent as a field. Hence, the aim has been to provide a high-quality outlet to publishing excellent theoretical and applied research in all areas of population economics. The article summarizes key developments in the Journal’s editorial process, thematic orientation, international reach, and successes. Furthermore, we discuss the benefits of working papers in economics and investigate the impacts of the current working paper culture on journal citations. Finally, we try to identify the citation impacts in the Journal itself. The Journal of Population Economics has established itself as the leader in its field. Publishing in working papers and in the Journal seem to be complementary activities.
A14|Are all researchers male? Gender misattributions in citations|Abstract I screen academic literature for cases of misattribution of cited author’s gender. While such mistakes are overall not common, their frequency depends dramatically on the gender of the cited author. Female scholar are cited as if they were male more than ten times more often than the opposite happens, probably revealing that citers are influenced by the gender-science stereotype. The gender of the citing author and the field of study appear to have only limited effect.
A14|Catching up or falling behind? Promising changes and persistent patterns across cohorts of economics PhDs in German-speaking countries from 1991 to 2008|Abstract We investigate economics PhDs minted at German, Austrian, and Swiss universities from 1991 to 2008. We find that cohort sizes increased overall, and the share of PhDs who publish in a peer-reviewed journal within 6 years after graduation increased from 18% in 1991 to 46% in 2008. Publishing rates are heterogeneous across departments. Younger cohorts publish slightly more compared to older cohorts, but these publications are not significantly better in terms of quality. Publication productivity is highly skewed within and between departments. A key difference between PhDs of the German-speaking area and North America lies in their patterns of collaboration.
A14|A local idea space: the value of personal and thematic proximity in academic research|While recent research has found no strong overall effects between colleagues in university departments, this paper shows a clear link between the success of individual research articles and local colleagues when their research is directly related. Using data from the CVs of around 1,000 academic economists, I study research links between department colleagues and their impact on citations. The novel focus on articles also addresses endogeneity concerns using differences in the scope of the effect for article quality and dissemination by publication type and peer group. The estimates show that articles in top 25 journals that draw on research of local colleagues receive significantly more citations than comparable work by the same authors. Conversely, the co-author network is primarily correlated with low-profile journals and arguably reflect widely the authors' field-specific standing.
A14|Social distance and network structures|"This paper analyzes how agents' perception of relationships with others determines the structures of networks. In our model, agents are endowed with their own multi-dimensional characteristics and form links depending on the social distance between them. We characterize average path length and clustering coefficient in stable networks, and analyze how they are related to the way social distances are measured by agents. One implication is that the introduction of new communication technology makes a network closely connected but not cliquish. We relate our model and results to Granovetter's ``strength of weak ties hypothesis,"" Tversky's ``similarity scale,"" and Mobius-Rosenblat's ``communication externality."""
A14|Positional goods and social welfare: a note on George Pendleton Watkins’ neglected contribution| Watkins's analysis of adventitious utility contains many aspects that are connected to the contemporary debate on positional goods. First, Watkins adventitious utility emerges from a process of social exclusion and can create negative externalities, in the sense that positive consumption of one individual implies negative consumption by another individual. Not only it creates negative externalities on other individuals, but it can initiate a race-to-the-bottom, where individuals waste an increasing amount of money on goods which do not possess any real utility.
A14|Financial education and financial literacy in Gen Y - Alternative forms of financing|This study was designed to assess knowledge and awareness of students of Polish economic universities in terms of forms of enterprise financing. Particular attention was focused on innovative forms of capital raising as crowdfunding due to its dynamic development in the world, but also crowdfunding seems to correspond to the needs of Generation Y as future entrepreneurs. The research hypothesis is that Polish Generation Y has only a theoretical knowledge of the sources of funding enterprises. Polish students, although they are proficient in new technologies, they do not know innovative capital raising on the Internet because they do not receive this knowledge at the university. The quantitative research was conducted and designed to test knowledge of the forms of financing and knowledge of the development of innovative funding methods. The qualitative research was used to indicate the needs of Millennials as to the possibility of obtaining financial knowledge as well as the skills to use it. The main findings demonstrated a gap in education for innovative methods of funding but also indicated recommendations for potential changes in the education of Generation Y
A14|Think Tank networks of German neoliberalism. Power structures in economics and economic policies in post-war Germany|"Even after the financial crisis, economists still exert influence on politics and society in general on several levels and thus can be still interpreted as a discipline of power. Particularly in Germany there is a long tradition of institutionalized economic policy advice, which offers economists a channel of direct and indirect impact on politics. During the European crisis policies many scholar stressed a ""comeback"", ""revival"" or ""return"" of ordoliberalism, the German variety of neoliberalism. In this paper I show how economists connected in the ""German neoliberal thought collective"" since the end of WW II have built up a strong institutional powerstructure, which had a continuous impact on German economic politics over many decades. It can be shown that in several turning points of German economic history, German neoliberalism and its core politico-economic concept of ""Social market economy"" served as guiding principle of economic policy. Furthermore I will show that up to now there is an uneven power balance among economists with high political and societal influence, i.e. economists connected in Keynesian or union-linked networks are in a minority position compared to the dense network of economists in the ""German neoliberale thought collective"". Hence, what was observed during the European crisis policies as a ""comeback of ordoliberalism"" should rather be interpreted as the consequence of a persistant influence of German neoliberal networks on German economic politics over many decades."
A14|Right-wing populism and market-fundamentalism: Two mutually reinforcing threats to democracy in the 21st century|"The article compares market fundamentalism and right-wing populism on the basis of its core patterns of thinking and reasoning. Based on an analysis of the work of important founders of market fundamental economic thinking and the arguments brought forward by leading right-wing populist we find many similarities of these two concepts in their ""inner images"". Thus, we develop a scheme of the similar dual social worlds of right-wing-populism and market fundamentalism and offer some recent examples of market fundamentalism and right-wing populism mutually reinforcing each other or serving as a gateway for each other. We then apply our scheme for the analysis of the recent political developments and its ideological roots in the US under Donald Trump. The main conclusion of this article is that market fundamentalism and right-wing populism together must be seen as two mutually reinforcing threats to democracy in the 21st century."
A14|Argumentationsstrategien einer neoliberalen Reformagenda: Zum Diskursprofil der Agenda Austria in medialen Debatten|Am Beispiel der Agenda Austria wird analysiert, wie wirtschaftsliberale Think Tanks Macht durch politische Reformdebatten ausüben können. Theoretisch fundieren wir dies in der Analyse von diskursiver Machtausübung bei Foucault: Think Tanks verfügen über Macht, wenn sie durch Medien bestimmte Denkstile, Denkmuster und Normvorstellungen vermitteln, welche mit der Übernahme in den Wissensbestand der Gesellschaftsmitglieder handlungsrelevant werden. Mithilfe einer Diskurs- und Metaphernanalyse untersuchen wir Zeitungsartikel in österreichischen Qualitätsmedien und erstellen ein Diskursprofil der Agenda Austria. Wir kommen zu dem Ergebnis, dass sie über alle untersuchten Themenbereiche hinweg für Reformen argumentiert, welche die marktförmige Organisation der Gesellschaft fördern sollen. Weiters zeigt sich eine dichotome metaphorische Gegenüberstellung eines positiv bewerteten Marktes und eines negativ bewerteten Staates.
A14|Die ökonomische Lehrbuchwissenschaft: Zum interdisziplinären Selbstverständnis der Volkswirtschaftslehre|Die moderne Volkswirtschaftslehre wirkt auf andere Wissenschaften, auf die Gesellschaft und die Politik ein. Im Kontext dazu wird in dem Paper das disziplinäre Selbstverständnis von Ökonominnen und Ökonomen herausgearbeitet, wie es den wichtigsten Lehrbüchern des Faches inhärent ist. Anhand von Thomas S. Kuhns Konzept der Lehrbuchwissenschaft wird die zentrale Bedeutung des Lehrbuches für die moderne Volkswirtschaftslehre aufgezeigt und dann im Rückgriff auf einschlägige Lehrbuchliteratur des Faches untersucht, welche wissenschaftshistorischen, methodologischen und didaktischen Grundpositionen darin festgehalten sind und im Rahmen akademischer ökonomischer Bildung vermittelt werden.
A14|Publication Performance vs. Influence: On the Questionable Value of Quality Weighted Publication Rankings|In broad parts of the scientific community the position in publication performance rankings, based on journal quality ratings is seen as highly reputational for the scientist. This contribution provides evidence that, at least in economics, such publication performance measures can not always be reconciled with measures for academic influence such as citation-based measures. We analyze data from the Scopus database as well as from the prestigious German-based Handelsblatt ranking for 100 renowned economists (lifetime achievement). Scholarly influence is proxied by various bibliometric indicators such as the number of citations, the h-index, the citations of the most cited paper as well as the hardly honorable Pi-Beta-score (“Publications Ignored, By Even The Author(s)”). We argue that publication performance measures based on journal ratings, such as the Handelsblatt rankings, are not good proxies for an economist’s impact within the scientific community. From this perspective the value of publication performance rankings based on journal quality ratings is questionable.

This is because estimating the incidence of published replication research and its outcomes must be continued."
A14|Informal intellectual collaboration with central colleagues|When preparing a research article, academics engage in informal intellectual collaboration by asking their colleagues for feedback. This collaboration gives rise to a social network between academics. We study whether informal intellectual collaboration with an academic who is more central in this social network results in a research article having higher scientific impact. To address the well-known reflection problem in estimating network effects, we use the assignment of discussants at NBER summer institutes as a quasi-natural experiment. We show that manuscripts discussed by a discussant with a 10% higher than average Bonacich centrality rank results in 1.4% more citations and a 5% higher probability that an article is published in a top journal. To illustrate our results, we develop a structural model in which a positive externality from intellectual collaboration implies that collaborating with a more central colleague results in larger scientific impact of the research article.

A14|Estimate And Analysis Of Vocational Training School (Iek) Students’ Satisfaction Regarding The Quality Of Studies Provided By These Schools|Measuring students’ satisfaction renders great service to the post-secondary educational institutions, since it offers the possibility to detect the strengths and weaknesses of these institutions and determine the areas that should be improved. Students’ satisfaction goes beyond teachers’ evaluation, which is a short sighted perspective, and includes wider concepts of students’ learning experience. In this context, knowing the degree of satisfaction is not enough. What is rather important is to comprehend the factors contributing to this satisfaction. The present survey aims at revealing the causes leading to IEK students’ satisfaction or obstructing it. The research was carried out at IEK of West Macedonia, Greece and the research tool used was SEVQUAL. Moreover, Analyse des Correspondences was used for data analysis. Results relating to students’ satisfaction and quality of studies were not encouraging. Finally, problems affecting the quality of studies came forward.
A14|Places and spaces in the weightless economy|Proposition of the 'end of geography' based on globalization and digitalization has been havily criticized by different geographers in the last decades. This paper mainly focus on the digitalization side of debate because of the more obvious and contradictory relationships between geography and digital production/consumption. Based on a systemic reflection on the literature in new media industry in general, and video game industry in particular, this paper bridges two different strings of research in the weightless economy. By referring to previous respondents' opinions as well as extracting new ideas from other empirical studies, this paper organizes its arguments in a comprehensive way and supports these arguments with abundant empirical evidence found in different case studies. It contributes to economic geographers' side of debate on the role of geography in today's weihgtless economy
A14|How to Tell the History of Business Ethics|The history of U.S. business ethics and CSR exhibits some key normative continuities and stability. I argue that these normative continuities and stability are underlain by moral background discontinuities and variation. The former I call “first-order” stability and the latter I call “second-order” variation. The second-order or moral background level is where the action is—at least, the action that sheds most light on our understanding of society, morality, and the moral foundations of capitalist societies. Next, I consider one facet of the moral background that might be of special interest to business ethics and CSR scholars: the demarcation of morality. How are boundaries between moral and non-moral things drawn? How are they institutionalized and policed? How do they vary across time and place? However, I also show why these empirical questions are conceptually trickier than they may appear at first sight.
A14|'Kapitalismus ist Gewinnsucht, die sich nicht schaemt' – Fruehe Schriften zur Wirtschaftsethik im deutschsprachigen Raum (Capitalism Means Profit Seeking without Feeling Shame: Early Writings on Business Ethics in German-Speaking Countries)|Gemeinhin wird die deutschsprachige Debatte um eine Wirtschafts- und Unternehmensethik als eine verspaetete Antwort auf die US-amerikanische Wirtschaftsethikdiskussion gesehen. Insbesondere sind es Autoren wie Karl Homann, Peter Ulrich oder Horst Steinmann und Albert Loehr, die das Thema Wirtschaftsethik ab den spaeten 1980er Jahren in Deutschland populaer zu machen suchten. Wie im Folgenden zu zeigen sein wird, reichen die Wurzeln der deutschsprachigen Wirtschaftsethik jedoch bis zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts zurueck. Ziel des vorliegenden Beitrages ist es, die Entwicklung und die Themenfelder dieser fruehen Wirtschaftsethik-Debatte in Deutschland darzustellen. (Commonly, the German debate about business ethics is seen as a late answer to the US-American discussion about business ethics. Since the late 1980s, in Germany notably authors like Karl Homann, Peter Ulrich or Horst Steinmann and Albert Loehr endeavoured to make the topic of business ethics more popular. However, as we will show in the following, the roots of German business ethics date back to the beginning of the 20th century. It is the aim of this contribution to present the development and the main-topics of this debate in the following.)
A14|Learning from History – The Relevance of the History of Business Ethics for the Practice of Business Ethics|Why should those currently engaged in business ethics seek a fuller understanding of how others engaged in these practices in the past? This essay addresses this question by reviewing in broad historical strokes three typical expressions of the practices of business ethics: namely, efforts to cultivate fitting virtues, efforts to enhance the ethical problem solving capabilities of businesses, and efforts to establish publically enforceable normative standards/laws. Using seven huge, troubling contemporary ethical crises as a point of reference, the essay concludes by examining ways businesses learn from a critical review of the history of business ethics in order more responsibly to address these issues.
A14|Why the Practice of Business Ethics Calls for a Due Regard for History|In this essay I will examine four reasons why a due regard for history is important for business ethics. These are as follows: (1) In order to learn and to appreciate local cultural norms and practices; (2) In order to understand both how current problems developed as they have and how to envision the current responsibilities for past legacies; (3) In order to gain a lively sense of what is now possible and what is not and when what kinds of actions are called for; and (4) in order to monitor existing practices as they evolve over time.
A14|Locating Responsibility – An Extended Transaction Cost Approach|Most debates in ethics, business ethics, and normative economics start with an (often implicit) exogenous premise that the level of normative responsibility is assigned to either individuals (theories of morality) or a certain “layer” of institutions like the state (theories of justice) or a corporation (theories of business ethics). We argue that this approach is too limited to allow for comprehensive view on the relationship between individual, organizational, and institutional responsibility and develop an approach that takes the assignment of normative responsibility as an integral part of an ethical theory. This approach is based on transaction-costs as the basic explanatory concept.
A14|CSR-Berichterstattung in Europa (CSR Reporting in Europe)|Europa hat in diesem noch jungen Jahrtausend bereits einige wirtschaftliche Rueckschlaege verkraften muessen. Es ist daher kaum verwunderlich, dass auch der europaeische Gesetzgeber dem Thema Corporate Social Responsibility mehr und mehr Aufmerksamkeit entgegenbringt. Der vorliegende Beitrag ergaenzt den Forschungsstand durch einen historisch-politischen Zugang zur CSR-Berichtspflicht durch den europaeischen Gesetzgeber. (Europe has had to cope with various economic kickbacks recently. Thus, it is not surprising that the European legislator has strengthened his awareness of Corporate Social Responsibility. This paper completes existing research through a historic political approach based on the European CSR reporting framework.)
A14|Solidarische Wirtschaftsethik – Grundzuege einer normativen Interaktionsoekonomik (Economic Ethics and Solidarity. A Normative Theory of Economic Interactions)|Der Beitrag thematisiert das Verhaeltnis von Ethik und oekonomik aus einer Perspektive solidarischen Handelns. Solidaritaet wird dabei verstanden als eine Integration von Individuen in die Gesellschaft unter Beruecksichtigung grundlegender moralischer Anforderungen. Damit weist dieser Ansatz deutlich ueber eine rein oekonomische Ethik hinaus. Abschliessend wird der ethische Stellenwert individueller Rechte in kooperativen Interaktionszusammenhaengen eroertert. (This paper analyzes the interrelation between ethics and economics using the principle of solidarity as a normative guideline. Solidarity is conceptualized as the comprehensive social inclusion of individuals in society which takes fundamental moral demands into account. Thus, the ethical content of this approach exceeds the normative limitations of a mere economic approach to ethics. In a first step, the principle of solidarity is being developed by applying it to different modes of social interaction. In a second step, the outcomes of competing models of cooperative bargaining are being outlined. Finally, the normative impact of individual rights in a framework of cooperative interactions is being analyzed.)
A14|Das Glasperlenspiel der intrinsischen Motivation – Fuehrungskraefte zwischen gemeinsamen Werten und eigener Verantwortung (Enhancing Intrinsic Motivation Through Shared Values and Self-responsibility)|Intrinsische Motivation stellt eine zunehmend wichtige, wenn nicht die Voraussetzung nachhaltig erfolgreicher Unternehmensfuehrung dar. Wir zeigen anhand einer Befragung von 347 deutschen Fuehrungskraeften, dass diese Form der Motivation insbesondere durch ein hoeheres Mass an Eigenverantwortung sowie durch im jeweiligen Unternehmen gemeinsame Werte entsteht. Dabei spielt die Eigenverantwortung eine Doppelrolle: einerseits als unabhaengige Variable neben den gemeinsamen Werten, die beide auf die intrinsische Motivation wirken, andererseits als Mediator des Einflusses von gemeinsamen Werten auf die intrinsische Motivation. Auf diese Weise wirft der vorliegende Beitrag ein neues Licht auf die Wirkweise von gemeinsamen Werten im Zusammenhang mit der Eigenverantwortung von Fuehrungskraeften und schreibt so der Selbststeuerung in Unternehmen eine wichtige Rolle zur Foerderung der intrinsischen Motivation zu. (Intrinsic motivation represents one of the most important antecedents for a firm’s sustainable success. Using a survey design of 347 responses from German managers, the results show that higher amounts of self-responsibility as well as shared values have a significant impact on managers’ intrinsic motivation. In addition to this direct effect, we are able to show that shared values also have an indirect effect on intrinsic motivation by building the foundation for self-responsibility and self-control (as a mediator).)
A14|Rationalitaet und Moralitaet – Zum systematischen Ort der Moral im Kontext von Praeferenzen und Restriktionen (Rationality and Morality – On the Systematic Place of Morality in the Context of Preferences and Beliefs)|Im Zentrum des Beitrags steht die Frage, wie individuelle Moralitaet im Kontext der Theorie rationalen Handelns und der Verhaltensoekonomik konzipiert und modelliert werden kann. Zentral ist dabei die systematische Differenzierung zwischen Praeferenzen und Restriktionen (im Sinne von Beliefs). Im ersten Teil wird gezeigt, dass dies im Rahmen bekundeter Praeferenzen (revealed preferences) nicht bzw. nur sehr eingeschraenkt moeglich ist. Im zweiten Teil wird auf Basis eines aktuellen Ansatzes, der „Reason-based Theory of Rational Choice“, und einer neo-Kohlberg’schen Moraltheorie herausgearbeitet, wie dem genannten Anspruch Rechnung getragen werden kann. (The contribution focuses on the question how individual morality can be conceptualised and modelled in the context of rational choice theory and behavioural economics. In this respect it is crucial to differentiate systematically between preferences, on the one hand, and restrictions (in terms of beliefs), on the other. The first part reveals that this is not – or only to some very limited extent – possible on the basis of so-called revealed preferences. In the second part, individual morality is reconstructed and analysed in the framework of a current approach called 'reason-based theory of rational choice' and a neo-Kohlbergian moral theory.)

(Approaches of Compliance and Integrity in Business Ethics: Norm-Orientation without Values or Value-Orientation without Norms?)|Compliance und Integrity in der Wirtschaftsethik gelten als zwei Ansaetze einer verantwortlichen Unternehmenssteuerung. Compliance wird dabei haeufig als eine regel- bzw. normenbasierte Strategie ausgewiesen, wohingegen Integrity als ein werteorientierter Ansatz verstanden wird. Gegenstand des Artikels ist die Frage, inwieweit aus einem Abgleich von Compliance- und Integrity-Strategien mit einer philosophischen Normen- und Werte-Unterscheidung Erkenntnisse fuer die Beziehung beider Unternehmensstrategien gewonnen werden koennen. Die konzeptionelle Analyse wird dabei Einsicht in ein sich ergaenzendes Verhaeltnis erlauben und zugleich Grenzen beider Ansaetze aufzeigen. (In business ethics Compliance and Integrity approaches are considered as two strategies of responsible organizational management. While Compliance has characteristics of a rule- or norm-based strategy, Integrity seems to resemble a value-based strategy. This paper discusses the questions to which extent the difference between Compliance and Integrity drawn along the lines of the philosophical distinction between norms and values can help to clarify the relation of the respective accounts of business ethics. The conceptual analysis will shed light on their complementary nature and at the same time reveal some limits of both approaches.)

Insbesondere Wirtschaftsorganisationen versuchen das Bewusstsein fuer ehrbares Wirtschaften wiederzubeleben. Fuer das Verstaendnis des Leitbilds Ehrbarer Kaufleute und fuer die Beurteilung der uebertragbarkeit auf modernes Unternehmertum ist die Beschaeftigung mit der historischen Entwicklung des Leitbilds von zentraler Bedeutung. Der vorliegende Beitrag zeichnet das jahrtausendalte Leitbild Ehrbarer Kaufleute nach, um es anschliessend in ein zeitgemaesses Verantwortungsmodell zu ueberfuehren. (The economic crises of recent years have called the Principal of the Honorable Merchant back into memory. In particular, business organizations are trying to raise awareness of honorable businesses. For an understanding of the Principle of the Honorable Merchant and for assessing the applicability to modern entrepreneurship employment with the historical development of the Principal are of core importance. This paper traces the millenary Principal of the Honorable Merchant, in order to subsequently transfer it into a contemporary model of responsibility.)
A14|Adam, sag, wie haeltst du’s mit der Religion? – Religion und Kirche im Werk Adam Smiths (Adam, tell me, where do you stand in terms of religion? – Religion and Church in the Writings of Adam Smith)|Die religioese Einstellung Adam Smiths bildet seit mehr als 200 Jahren den Gegenstand zahlreicher Diskussionen und Interpretationsversuche. Bis heute ist der Stellenwert, den Religion in Smiths Leben und Werk einnimmt, weitgehend ungeklaert. These des folgenden Beitrages ist, dass Smith eine deistische Weltsicht vertritt, die als verbindende Klammer zwischen seinen Hauptwerken, Theory of Moral Sentiments und Wealth of Nations, interpretiert werden kann. Wie gezeigt werden soll, beruht Smiths Vorstellung einer harmonischen Weltordnung dabei wesentlich auf den Ideen seines akademischen Lehrers Francis Hutcheson. (For more than 200 years, the religious beliefs of Adam Smith have been subject of academic discussions and interpretations. Till nowadays, the importance of religion in Smith’s life and in his work remains unclear. As I will argue in the following, Smith follows a deistic worldview which might be seen as the common bond linking his Theory of Moral Sentiments to his Wealth of Nations. As I will show, Smith’s concept of a harmonic world-order is based largely on the ideas of his academic teacher Francis Hutcheson.)

Um dieses Potential zu heben, wird die Heilige Schrift methodisch als historisches Produkt gesellschaftlicher Diskurse gefasst. Der daraus entwickelte Nachhaltigkeitsbegriff inspiriert und korrigiert moderne Anlagenethik. (The Jewish Scriptures offers impressive material for financial ethics, which is based on the concept of sustainability. To unlock this potential, the Jewish Scriptures are methodologically treated as a result of the intersubjective discussion of a historic society. The resulting concept of sustainability inspires and corrects modern investment ethics.)
A14|Oekonomik: Eine Moraltheorie mit religioesen Wurzeln (Economics: A Moral Inquiry with Religious Origins)|Dass die Oekonomik eine Moraltheorie ist, ist fuer Wirtschaftsethiker keine Ueberraschung. Dieser Beitrag zeigt aber auf, in welcher Weise religioese Wurzeln die Oekonomik bei Ihrer Entstehung praegten und inwiefern der Wandel religioeser Ideen auch den Wandel in Bezug auf die Akzeptanz einer bestimmten Form von oekonomik beeinflusst hat. Dabei wird auf vier entscheidende religioese Vorstellungen verwiesen, die sich einerseits im Zuge des Niedergangs des orthodoxen Calvinismus entwickelten und andererseits im Rahmen der Debatte um Prae- und Postmillenaristen thematisiert wurden. Auch ohne den einschlaegigen Autoren, wie Adam Smith, bestimmte religioese ueberzeugungen zuzusprechen, scheint das religioes gepraegte mentalitaets- und ideengeschichtliche Umfeld massgeblich die oekonomik als Moraltheorie beeinflusst zu haben. (It may not come as a surprise for Business Ethicists that economics is a moral theory. But this article shows in what way religious roots have shaped economics in its emergence and how changes of religious ideas have also influenced the change with regard to the acceptance of a certain form of economics. Hereby, it will be referred to four crucial religious concepts, which on the one hand have developed in the course of the decline of the orthodox Calvinism and on the other hand have been made subject of discussion in the course of the debate about Pre- and Postmillenarists. Without attributing the relevant authors, like Adam Smith, certain religious convictions, the highly religious influenced environment of ideas and attitudes seems to have influenced economics as moral theory in a significant way.)

Historische und systematische Bemerkungen zur Kompatibilitaet von Neoliberalismus und Katholischer Soziallehre (Neoliberalism in the Face of Christian Social Ethics)|Neoliberalismus und Katholische Soziallehre intendieren eine menschenwuerdige Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsordnung, die zugleich die Funktionsfaehigkeit der Wirtschaft garantiert. Die entsprechenden Mittel und Wege dorthin wurden in den entsprechenden Debatten allerdings unterschiedlich bewertet. Dennoch bleibt die ordo- bzw. neoliberale Konzeption fuer die christliche Sozialethik ein entscheidender Gespraechs- und Realisierungspartner. (Neoliberalism and Christian Social Ethics intend a human social and economic order, which also guarantees the functioning of the economy. The appropriate ways and means were being assessed differently, however. Nevertheless, ordo- or neoliberal conception is a crucial discussion and implementation partner for Christian Social Ethics.)
A14|Citation of scholars in co-authorship network: Analysis of Google Scholar data|In this study, we analyze correlations between the co-authorship network parameters and citation characteristics in Google Scholar. We estimate the count data regression model in a sample of more than 30 thousand authors with the first citation after 2007. There is a positive relationship between scholar’s citation counts and number of co-authors, between citations and the author’s centrality, and between scholar’s citations and the average citation of co-authors. The h-index and i10 index are significantly associated with the number of co-authors and average citation of co-authors.
A14|Las teorías del crecimiento económico: notas críticas para incursionar en un debate inconcluso|En el presente artículo se esboza, desde una óptica interdisciplinaria y con pretensiones didácticas, un estado del conocimiento sobre la evolución histórica de las distintas teorías del crecimiento económico, reconociendo el contexto sociohistórico en el cual se gestan, así como sus principales conceptos, contribuciones, alcances, limitaciones y sus implicaciones en términos de política pública e intervención del Estado; no sin abordar –si bien de manera sucinta– los orígenes de los debates en torno a la naturaleza y causa de la riqueza de las naciones en el pensamiento económico. Para cumplir con lo anterior, resulta importante desentrañar las facetas epistemológicas que subyacen a las teorías del crecimiento económico y las implicaciones que ello tiene para el estudio del proceso económico en el sur del mundo y en aquellas realidades donde no se gestaron las reflexiones teóricas en cuestión; de ahí que sea importante tener en mente los desafíos que enfrentan las ciencias sociales latinoamericanas para incorporar el crecimiento económico en la construcción de proyectos alternativos de nación y en las posibilidades de remontar la ortodoxia deflacionaria que aún prevalece en las políticas económicas de varios países.
A14|Empirical Study Regarding the Trust Relationships Established in a Community|The paper that we present aims to address the issue of relationships naturally established in a community through some items that we consider relevant to the proposed topic. In this purpose, we have initiated a quantitative research, developed through a survey, based on questionnaire, self-managed and on line. The recorded answers are statistically interpreted, using IBM SPSS application. The results suggests that the perception of the subjects participating in the study on the relationships established with their communities, on the date of the study, is not clearly contoured.
A14|Biens publics : construction économique et registres sociaux|Cet article envisage une approche non économique des biens publics pour les aborder à partir des modalités de leur construction sociale et de la diversité des dimensions qui la constituent. La première partie présente les définitions classiques des biens publics puis, s’inspirant de l’approche épistémologique kuhnienne, décrit le processus de labellisation et de réappropriation de ces biens publics déployé par la théorie néo-classique. La seconde partie montre les principales difficultés que rencontre cette labélisation : elle limite la lecture des biens publics à la seule rationalité individuelle, elle considère ces biens comme dé-moralisés et, d’un point de vue pratique, elle empêche toute dénomination pleinement légitime de ces biens. La troisième partie s’ouvre ainsi à la construction sociale de ces biens. D’une part nous mobilisons et élargissons le processus de publicisation des biens proposé par Kaul et Mendoza (2003) ; d’autre part, nous associons à la réalité conceptuelle et économique des biens publics une dimension normative et une autre ontologique. Ces distinctions, dont nous montrons qu’elles sont récurrentes dans les travaux d’analyse des biens publics, rendent compte de la diversité des cadres servant à définir ces biens. Ceux-ci doivent être en effet différenciés, comme nous y invitent des travaux sociologiques, selon qu’ils désignent une réalité par essence, par finalité ou par ontologie. C’est la prise en compte de ce cadre qui permet d’embrasser les processus de publicisation et de rappeler, encore une fois, la nécessaire prise en compte des dynamiques sociales dans la construction des biens publics.

This paper examines the history of The American Economist from its beginnings as a student-produced annual publication to a professionally produced academic journal with a global reach. During its more than 50-year run, the journal has published original works by many eminent economists, including 23 Nobel Prize winners. As one of the first journals that academic economists encounter, The American Economist continues to have a unique influence and impact on the economics profession.

Starting from the call for â€œbread, freedom, social justice,â€ this paper sheds light on the moral economy of the Egyptian people and finds the seeds of the revolution in a loss of entitlements which structural adjustment policies entailed for Egyptians as producers and consumers of bread, the symbol of life.
A14|Crime and Divorce. Can one Lead to the other? Using Multilevel Mixed Models|Cross-sectional and time-series studies of the influence of divorce on crime and the opposite are few in both developing and developed countries. Question is raised whether the divorce causes the crime, the opposite, or both effects are exist in Jordan.The objectives are: Investigating the causal direction of the relationship between the divorce and crime, determining whether the clustering in the divorce and crime within-governorates is exist, and whether the divorce and crime are increased or decreased over time? The study design was cross-sectional time-series analysis. The data of 12 governorates over 14 years (2000-2013) were obtained from several Jordanian Statistical Yearbooks and surveys issued by the Jordanian Statistics Department. The divorce rate (DR) and the crime rate (CR) were calculated. Multilevel mixed-effects linear regression was carried out. Three models for each of divorce and crime were estimated. Comparison between these models was explained in terms of the intra-class correlation (ICC), the proportional change in the variance of the response variable, and the deviance. The p
A14|Crisis to Opportunity to Change|"As diverse groups (from tenured professors to their unbenefited colleagues; Palestinian intifadists to Zionist real estate developers; native Europeans to crisis driven refugees; entrenched leaders in their ?Arab Winters? to fellow countrymen in their discordant ?Arab Springs?) struggle to gain possession of lost, stolen, or disputed pieces of soil or self, our world finds itself enmeshed in ever deepening levels of conflict. Diverse groups collide in a battle to attain the prizes of territory, identity, security, and respect. As battle lines are drawn, friction becomes evident and conflict becomes endemic.These are the conflicts that know no boundaries. They release their tremors into Everyman?s village and their traumas into Everyman?s soul. Like swollen streams, they flow down trash-laden streets and onto tree-lined boulevards. They move from sectors of third world tragedy through centers of new world trade; through the halls of fortified high schools and over the walls of sanctified universities; into pristine rural communities and through sectarian tribal villages; through distressed urban war zones and into sheltered enclaves of wealth.These are the conflicts that ignore the rules of scholarly discourse. They are filled with all the invective and passion that diverse groups, struggling for their social, intellectual, and/or physical lives tend to manifest. To some they are threatening. To others they are encouraging. To all they are stimulating.They capture attention; they capture imagination; and they capture resources?Triggers for these conflicts seem to exist most everywhere... a political slight; a perceived inequity; a change in the balance of power; a long-standing hurt; today?s exploitation; yesterday?s grudge.Along with a diversity of triggers comes a diversity of targets...Corporations with unimaginable wealth... Nations with unimaginable power... Well-established political bodies? Newly-established political movements? Universities? A religiously sectarian community? None are beyond scrutiny. None are beyond threat.The author/presenter explores how conflict can provide individuals, institutions and political states with precious opportunities to recognize and institute procedures that can lead toward creating personal, social and political change. A model designed to effectively process conflict and facilitate essential change, the seven stage ""Crisis to Opportunity to Change"" is presented."
A14|Factors influencing Pension Privatization in former communist countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia|From 1990 onwards, a significant number of former communist countries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia decided to reform their public pension system by creating a mandatory private pillar. Other ex-communist countries from the same two regions only made some parametric changes to their public pension system. There are concurrent theories trying to explain why certain countries implemented a paradigmatic reform on the pension systems while others did not. All these theories are focusing on what factors determine the decision makers to reform the public pension system: the coercion of international financial institution, demographic and economic pressures, political support, the relative strength of government and unions or the proportion of peer countries that have adopted similar measures. This study tests the influence of all the factors mentioned above on the decision to adopt the pension privatization in former communist countries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Using event history analysis with time-varying covariates of data from 24 states between 1990 and 2013 the study shows that the probability to reform the public pension system in one country increases as the proportion of neighbor countries who adopted the same measure rises. The conclusions of this research can be compared with those taken from the interviews with the decision makers from countries of interest. Also, the research can be used as a starting point for studying the steps backwards made on this path by Hungary, Poland and Argentina. These countries had reversed the pension privatization by transferring savings under management by private pension funds back to the public sector.
A14|The influence of gender and expressed emotions on evaluation of manager?s behavioral and professional competen|The gender issue in management is still vividly discussed (i.e. :Byron 2008; Chua; Murray, 2015; Lakshmi, Peter, 2015). Researchers are interested in both: relation between manager?s gender and real efficacy, and between manager?s gender and perceiving his/her efficacy. The aim of this work is to understand the role of manager?s gender and his/her emotions in the perception of his/her professional competencies and social or personal skills. Authors try to answer the question whether the evaluation of the manager?s professional and behavioral competencies depends on manager?s gender and emotions expressed at his/her face. It was expected that negative emotion, especially expressed by female manager would decrease the evaluation of her competencies. To test the hypotheses, 4 questionnaires were developed. Each questionnaire consist of picture, short description of manager and 25 characteristics given in the form of semantic differential scale. Each version differed with an attached picture according to independent variables included to the research: gender (man vs woman) and emotion (joy vs anger). 25 characteristics referred to professional and behavioral skills. 160 subjects (employees) participated in the study. Results show that expressed emotion more significantly determines female manager?s competencies than male. In addition, negative emotion expressed by woman conduces to low evaluation. The emotion expressed by man does not influence how he is perceived, sometimes his negative emotion leads to perceiving his competencies as higher (i.e.: in decision making, or being reliable). The results are discussed in the frame of social perception theories.
A14|The prevalence of Suicidality during the economic crisis in Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain|Stressful life experience are one of the causative factors in suicide among men between the ages of 35 and 55. The financial crisis in Portugal, Italy, Ireland Greece and Spain has shown a pattern of contraction in GDP followed by rising unemployment numbers. Financial crisis represents a crash of the financial system and a collapse of the prices of assets including bankruptcy of a bank or other financial institutions which enables people and companies to obtain credit in order to pay their obligations. A descriptive multiple-case study design in established a deeper understanding of the impact of the prevalence of suicide during the financial crisis shows a correlation between increased suicides recorded by the world Health Organization and rising unemployment in these countries. Suggestions to negate increased suicides include free and easily accessible financial support and advice lines, national mental health services should train and implement support services to assist families who have been impacted policy makers consider positive psychology and resilience campaigns with a progressive message during financial crises.
A14|The quality of teaching and its impact on university students' motivation|The goal of the paper is to discuss the impact of the quality of teaching on university students' motivation to learn and study at university. The paper is based on the analysis of available scientific literature and the results of the authors' questionnaire survey among students of the College of Regional Development in Prague, the Masaryk Institute of Advanced Studies of the Czech Technical University in Prague and the School Management Centre of the Faculty of Education of Charles University in Prague that was focused on students' motivation to study at university and their ideas about future career. The survey was conducted from February to May 2016. The relevant data were obtained from 416 students. The results show some interesting tendencies in students' attitudes to learning and studying at university. Students often complain of the quality of teaching, particularly of theoretical subjects without obvious connections and practical applications. This dissatisfaction significantly reduces students' motivation to learn and study at university. Many students go to work rather than to school to earn money and get experience.
A14|Some Reflections on Methodology of Critical Realism|The subject matter of this paper is the controversy about realism of assumptions from the perspective of critical realism. The authors apply the notional apparatus of philosophical logic to clarify the essence of this controversy. By means of translating the often ambivalent and sometimes mysterious terms of Jespersen (2009) into the straightforward language of classical philosophy, they authors make an effort to tear down some of the barriers of the inter-paradigmatic controversies about methodology. The conclusion is drawn that as long as the assumptions of a model affect but the accidentia logica of the model?s constituting notions, the formalist stand can be taken and Friedman?s instrumentalist approach will be justifiable; as soon as the assumptions of a model affect the differentiae specificae of the model?s constituting notions, the substantivist stand must be taken and Friedman?s instrumentalist approach fails. Finally, the authors assert that the Post-Keynesian notion of critical realism is much more compatible with the perception thereof as a genus that the perception thereof as a species.
A14|Towards a Synergetic and Probabilistic Approach to Cross-border Migration|The cross-border migration has multiple causes, variety of manifestations and potentials for diverging effects. Paradoxically, the mainstream theories on the phenomenon are one-dimensional and deterministic. The effort to resolve the contradiction proceeds in four steps. First, mainstream theories of international migration are scrutinized for potential contributions to a synergetic and probabilistic conceptual framework. Second, the strategy for building the framework is outlined by elaborating on the components of the migration chain. Third, the components are integrated in a conceptual whole reflecting the multidimensionality and the variability of the migration?s structures and processes. Fourth, the capacities of the integrated framework to guide synergetic and probabilistic descriptions, explanations and forecasting of cross-border migration are put under scrutiny. The conceptual developments are tested with a view to the needs for efficient management of the cross-border migration flows.
A14|The study of university students' motivation|The goal of the paper is to define and discuss the problem of increasing quantity of university students and graduates and the impact of the university students' motivation on their attitudes to learning and studying at university. The paper is based on the analysis of available scientific literature and the comparison of the results of the authors' survey conducted among students of the Czech Technical university in Prague in the first decade of the twenty-first century and the authors' survey conducted among students of the College of Regional Development in Prague, the Masaryk Institute of Advanced Studies of the Czech Technical University in Prague and the School Management Centre of the Faculty of Education of Charles University in Prague in 2016. The new data were obtained from 415 students. The results show some interesting tendencies in students' attitudes to learning and studying at university in the Czech Republic.
A14|Turizm Perspektifinden Yabancılaşmanın Sosyo-Psikolojik Analizi: Günlük Yaşamdan Turistik Yaşama Yabancılaşma Döngüsü|Alienation describes the mood of people who have become the tool rather than the goal in the functioning of the capitalist society. The man has alienated to product, business and most importantly himself because of depreciating against materials. The topic of the study is the man (tourist) who is looking for this spiritual poverty in leisure activities. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the socio-psychological relationship between alienation and tourism. Following the review of the literature demonstrating the relationship between alienation and tourism, the Alienation Cycle in Tourism was created. The cycle of alienation explains how a tourist, psychologically, participates in tourism activities and behaves in touristic life besides clarifying sociological environment of tourism.
A14|Role of tolerance in communication with diverse people|Abstract This paper investigates the role of tolerance in urban communication. In doing so, it presents a model with $$N+1$$ N + 1 individuals who communicate with each other. The model explains that individuals can be tolerant and obtain a valuable outcome if their communication partners are also tolerant enough to make their communication smooth. Consequently, when individuals are sufficiently differentiated and have frequent opportunities to communicate, there exist multiple equilibria in which all individuals could be either tolerant or intolerant. That is, individuals remain less tolerant as long as their communication partner’s tolerance remains at very low level. However, when their communication partners are initially tolerant enough, they can achieve a substantial outcome in communication. This phase can be interpreted as meaning that the individual has exercised intercultural competence.

A14|Islamic conscious capitalism: a ‘Third Way’ in light of classical scripture|"The economic paradigm and framework advocated for in Islam is one that entails a unique combination of various socio–economic philosophies. This article advances the notion that Islam promotes a capitalistic economic model wrapped in its own garment of understanding—fashioned with threads of equity and stitched in patterns of benevolence and justice. This article examines the Islamic theological framework relating to the profit incentive and its spiritually–conscious methodology of capital procurement. The Qur’an contains around 370 references in regard to commerce, from which much of Islamic law relating to lending, banking and trading originates (Heck in Muhammad and the Arab roots of capitalism (Studien zur Geschichte und Kultur des Islamichen Orients)—Band 18. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, p 5, 85, 2006 ). This article intends to explore the potential that these teachings have for an Islamic ‘Third Way’ (i.e. an Islamic contribution to economic philosophy and discourse that is in-between of, or an alternative to, both the purely individualistic primary concerns on prices, profits, and private property inherent in ""pure"" capitalism, and the purely communal command economics of communism, which often negates or discourages the promotion of self-interests). Part I of this paper intends to introduce the reader to the various sources of Islamic ‘law’ and its scope. In doing so, the philosophical nature and objectives of the Shariah will become evident, through the exploration of specific theological economic teachings. Part II intends to study Islam’s theological attitude toward entrepreneurship and the profit incentive, as well as the concept of the potential for salvation through ethical profits. Part III explores, in light of classical Islamic scripture, the various prohibitions within the Islamic concept of the economy. In doing so, the paper shall explore how values and theories found in classical Islamic scripture have found contemporary application within the growing modern Islamic finance industry, for example, through Shariah ‘screens’ applied on market indicies, such as the Dow Jones Islamic Market Index. Part III shall also explore Islamic edicts with regards to business practices, as well as environmental ethics. In doing so, Part IV concludes that there can indeed be such an Islamic ‘Third Way’, drawn along similar shared values found amongst other world religions.

A14|Human capital, collegiality, and stardom in economics: empirical analysis|Abstract This study investigates the importance of collegiality (i.e., good colleagues) and the quality of human capital investment in fostering the development and growth of stars in the field of economics, where stardom is measured by way of receipt of the John Bates Clark Medal, arguably the second-most prestigious award in economics. We provide a vignette as a foundation for both qualitative and quantitative analysis using Egghe’s g-Index. Our results indicate that three institutions, namely Chicago, Harvard and MIT, with secondary consideration to Princeton, generally rank highest in fostering the growth and development of stars in the field of economics.
A14|Research assessment using early citation information|Abstract Peer-review based research assessment, as implemented in Australia, the United Kingdom, and some other countries, is a very costly exercise. We show that university rankings in economics based on long-run citation counts can be easily predicted using early citations. This would allow a research assessment to predict the relative long-run impact of articles published by a university immediately at the end of the evaluation period. We compare these citation-based university rankings with the rankings of the 2010 Excellence in Research assessment in Australia and the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise in the United Kingdom. Rank correlations are quite strong, but there are some differences between rankings. However, if assessors are willing to consider citation analysis to assess some disciplines, as is the case for the natural sciences and psychology in Australia, it seems reasonable to consider also including economics in that set.
A14|From bilateral two-way to unilateral one-way flow link-formation|Abstract We provide a model that allows for a transition between the simplest variation of two basic models of strategic network formation: Bala and Goyal’s one-way flow model without decay, where links can be unilaterally formed, and a version without decay of Jackson and Wolinsky’s connections model based on bilateral formation of links. In the transitional model introduced here, these two benchmark models appear as extreme cases. We study efficiency and Nash, strict Nash and pairwise Nash stability for the intermediate model. Dynamics are also discussed.
A14|Die Krise der VWL und die Vision einer Pluralen Ökonomik<BR>[The Crisis in Economics and the Vision of Plural Economics]|Zusammenfassung Die andauernde Finanzkrise hat tiefliegende Probleme des ökonomischen Mainstreams offengelegt und lässt Forderungen nach einer Erneuerung des ökonomischen Denkens lauter werden. Die Autoren beschreiben die Kritik am Status quo und gehen dabei auf die Vorwürfe von Einseitigkeit, blinden Flecken, Realitätsferne und impliziter Normativität ein. Als vielversprechender Gegenentwurf wird die Vision einer Pluralen Ökonomik vorgestellt und anhand von fünf charakteristischen Säulen beschrieben: Theorienpluralismus, Methodenpluralismus, historische Fundierung, wissenschaftstheoretische und ethische Reflexion sowie Interdisziplinarität.
A14|Meritocracy Voting: Measuring the Unmeasurable|" Learned societies commonly carry out selection processes to add new fellows to an existing fellowship. Criteria vary across societies but are typically based on subjective judgments concerning the merit of individuals who are nominated for fellowships. These subjective assessments may be made by existing fellows as they vote in elections to determine the new fellows or they may be decided by a selection committee of fellows and officers of the society who determine merit after reviewing nominations and written assessments. Human judgment inevitably plays a central role in these determinations and, notwithstanding its limitations, is usually regarded as being a necessary ingredient in making an overall assessment of qualifications for fellowship. The present article suggests a mechanism by which these merit assessments may be complemented with a quantitative rule that incorporates both subjective and objective elements. The goal of ""measuring merit"" may be elusive, but quantitative assessment rules can help to widen the effective electorate (for instance, by including the decisions of editors, the judgments of independent referees, and received opinion about research) and mitigate distortions that can arise from cluster effects, invisible college coalition voting, and inner sanctum bias. The rule considered here is designed to assist the selection process by explicitly taking into account subjective assessments of individual candidates for election as well as direct quantitative measures of quality obtained from bibliometric data. Audit methods are suggested to mitigate possible gaming effects by electors in the peer review process. The methodology has application to a wide arena of quality assessment and professional ranking exercises. Some specific issues of implementation are discussed in the context of the Econometric Society fellowship elections."
A14|Ethics vs. Ethos in US and UK Megabanking|Company law in the US and UK fails to acknowledge that authoritiesâ€™ propensity to rescue giant banks from the consequences of insolvency assigns taxpayers a coerced and badly structured equity stake in too-big-to-fail institutions. The entrenched managerial norm of maximizing stockholder value lends a misplaced legitimacy to efforts by TBTF managers to take on dangerous levels of tail risk because their bankâ€™s deep downside is effectively eliminated by the prospect of unlimited taxpayer support. Conventional tools of prudential regulation constrain but do not de-legitimate this behavior. To accomplish that end, this paper calls for: (1) a formal recognition of the fiduciary duties that TBTF firms owe to taxpayers and (2) criminalizing aggressive pursuit of safety-net subsidies as â€œtheft by safety net.â€
