K29|Equity Finance: Matching Liability to Power|There is widespread concern that the bonus culture for senior managers in limited liability companies is having adverse effects, e.g. on risk-taking, leverage and lower longer-term investment. The moral hazard of limited liability was appreciated in the 19th century, when unlimited or multiple liability, especially for bankers, was widely adopted. Whereas outside, notably retail, investors still need the protection of limited liability, we advocate moving towards a two-tier equity system, primarily for banks, with insiders, senior managers and others with influence over corporate decisions, becoming subject to multiple liability. But the transition costs of doing so suddenly would be great, so our proposal is to start by applying this initially just to Systemically Important Financial Intermediaries.
K29|Teaching Romanian Business Law through the Medium of English|Objective - The course of Business Law aims to provide students with the basic legal terms and concepts necessary in their economic activity. Teaching law through the English language does not mean translating the course or the laws from Romanian but involves applying interactive methods so that the information is well conveyed and language does not become a barrier in the process of learning. Methodology/Technique - By turning to action research, the aim of the study is to identify students' perception on the relevance of the content and the teaching methodology of the current Business Law course, to identify the key elements of the new Business law course to be designed, employing active learning methodology and designing specific activities to be proposed to students. Findings - Debates or discussions are never absent from class activities, in which I try to engage all students. The lectures are delivered with visual aids, i.e. Power Point program, while the slides are drafted in an enjoyable manner. Novelty - Most recently in Romania, there has been a legislative change which saw the introduction of new fiscal advantages into limited liability companies fulfilling certain requirements (SRL-D), a topic which exceeds the current curriculum.
K29|Lawyers as Meddlers in the Mediation Process - A Malaysian Perspective|"Objective - The scope of a lawyer's role is common knowledge and is often construed as one who advises on the application of the law, especially in the area of litigation or conveyancing. Nevertheless, it is pertinent to consider the role of a lawyer in mediation and the link between lawyer and mediation. Methodology/Technique - Mediation as a form of dispute resolution is arguably still at its infancy in Malaysia. Judges in Malaysia do encourage people to use mediation to settle disputes, instead of settling disputes through the court. As such, lawyers play a significant role in mediation, especially when the society regards mediation to be one effective mechanism of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), compared to litigation. Findings - As such, the term 'mediation' refers to a process that generates structure negotiation, whereby a mediator (a neutral impartial third party that is acceptable to and independent of the parties) serves to facilitate agreement between the parties involved to resolve their disputes in a systematic manner by isolating the dispute issues, developing alternatives, and reaching a viable and acceptable resolution that satisfy the involved parties. Since the mediator plays the role in the mediation process, how does a lawyer play his role in the mediation process? Does he serve as a meddler in the mediation process? Novelty - A mediator claimed, ""…involvement of solicitors is significant. They comprehend the dynamics of positive engagement, apart from having the ability and being prepared for a constructive negotiation so as to look for resolutions, rather than reinforcing litigation. They possess the ability to offer advice and provide guidance to their clients as they seize the opportunity to bring matter to an end. This is an exceptional instance of professionalism at its best."" This statement has become, at present time, 'how does a lawyer apply his present skills in mediation settlement?"
K29|Försörjningsstöd, institutioner och strukturcykeln|Ur ett strukturcykliskt perspektiv sker en omvandling av ekonomi, institutioner och politik under omvandlingsperioderna. Då välfärd kan betraktas som en funktion av dessa borde det vara möjligt att analysera välfärd och de institutionella arrangemang som är nödvändiga för en välfärdsproduktion med hjälp av en strukturcyklisk ansats. Lennart Schön har i ett flertal studier diskuterat detta samband, men på en hög teoretiskt abstraktionsnivå. Denna uppsats syftar till att diskutera i vilken utsträckning ett strukturanalytiskt resonemang är tillämpligt vid analyser av tillkomst och förändring av olika välfärdsarrangemang och social reformarbete. Socialtjänst och försörjningsstöd, samt deras föregångare, används som exempel. Resultaten indikerar att 1871 års fattigvårdsförordning, 1918 års fattigvårdslag, 1956 års socialhjälpslag och 1997 års socialtjänstlag styrts eller i stor utsträckning påverkats av sociala utvecklingsblock, medan 1980 års socialtjänstlag snarare tillkommit enligt ett kris-/skördetidsmönster.
K29|Reinterpreting the Arbitration Legislation for Online Awards in Indonesia|"""Objective –The use of online arbitration is more convenient for disputing parties as their submissions can be archived by automated document management systems and be reviewed from any location, at any time. Yet, the process of online arbitration in Indonesia remains uncertain due to the fact that Indonesian arbitration legislation does not contain any provisions relating to online arbitration. It is also questioned whether online arbitration awards are domestic or international under that legislation. In order to answer the questions, this research examines and reinterprets Indonesian arbitration legislation to argue for the status of online arbitration and its awards in Indonesia. Methodology/Technique – This study adopts normative legal research by examining existing legislation and literatures relating to arbitration. Findings – The findings of this study show that the legislation does permit online arbitration because Indonesian IT legislation facilitates the use of electronic communication and devices for this type of arbitration. However, the status of awards rendered in the online arbitration process remains uncertain. This is because Indonesia has not adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law. Consequently, the legislation merely categorizes online arbitration awards based on whether they are rendered within Indonesian territory (domestic awards) or outside of Indonesia (international awards). Originality/value – The use of technology has penetrated business transactions and in some cases can give rise to legal disputes. Therefore, those who engage in online transactions should consider the type of dispute resolution mechanism they employ. In the context of online businesses, it may be beneficial for disputing parties to settle their disputes through online arbitration due to its ability to transcend national boundaries, and the potential enforceability of its awards.

K29|A New Outline of Corporate Law|"This paper continues to investigate legal corporate governance issues. Over the last decade few topics in corporate law have proven as alluring and as elusive as the connection between information technologies (IT), corporate governance (CG) and corporate law. The dynamics of the development of modern law are determined by many factors, one of which is the rapid involvement of IT in all spheres of life. Everything in physical life can become a digital sign. We are in the era of successful ""small"" firms whose business models are built on a combination of software platforms, telecommunications technology and commercial transactions conducted ""outside the firm"". IT allows them to remotely carry out various business transactions, including corporate actions, providing participation in the governance of the corporation. The term IT covers a large array of electronic vehicles from software to artificial intelligence. Due to technological development, IT has quickly entered corporate governance structures in a large number of corporations. Some scholars argue that artificial intelligence will also be the new reality of corporate life in the very near future. Several questions are raised in connection with this. For example, do current laws need any changes? What are the prerequisites for modern corporate law. There has been a progressive revision of the fundamentals of corporate law over the last few decades, considering that key provisions of corporate law were created during and after the industrial revolution. I explore two paths of legal research in CG and corporate law: using IT for CG procedures, and an adjustment of CG rules for e-corporations. In addition the question is raised whether a virtual corporation has to have a corporate structure similar to the structure of a modern corporation. This new outline of corporate law is a new understanding of current corporate law."
K29|Notice failure revisited: Evidence on the use of virtual patent marking|One source of uncertainty in the patent system relates to the difficulty in identifying products that are protected with a patent. This paper studies the adoption by U.S. patentees of “virtual patent marking,” namely the online provision of constructive notice to the public that an article is patented. It proposes a simple model of the decision to adopt patent marking and empirically examines factors that affect adoption. Data suggest that about 12 percent of patent holders overall provide virtual marking information (and perhaps about 25 percent of commercially active assignees). Econometric analysis suggests that the most discriminant factor of the adoption of virtual marking is the size of the patent portfolio. The likelihood of adoption increases with portfolio size, consistent with evidence that firms with a larger patent portfolio are more likely to be infringed.
K29|Sex, Drugs, and Baby Booms: Can Behavior Overcome Biology?|We study the behavioral changes due to marijuana consumption on fertility and its key mechanisms, as opposed to physiological changes. We can employ several large proprietary data sets, including the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, Nielsen Retail Scanner database, as well as the Vital Statistics Natality files and apply a differences-in-differences approach by exploiting the timing of the introduction of medical marijuana laws among states. We first replicate the earlier literature by showing that marijuana use increases after the passage of medical marijuana laws. Our novel results reveal that birth rates increased after the passage of a law corresponding to increased frequency of sexual intercourse, decreased purchase of condoms and suggestive evidence on decreased condom use during sex. More sex and less contraceptive use may be attributed to behavioral responses such as increased attention to the immediate hedonic effects of sexual contact, delayed discounting and ignoring costs associated with risky sex. These findings are consistent with a large observational literature linking marijuana use with increased sexual activity and multiple partners. Our findings are robust to a broad set of tests.
K29|The Attraction of Foreign Direct Investment in the East African Community: A Two-edged Sword for Equitable Economic Development|Created in 1999, the East African Community (EAC) is regional integration community constituted by six sub-Saharan countries, i.e. Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. One of the purpose of this integration is the promotion of equitable economic development of its member states through the attraction of foreign direct investment. However, although all EAC member states are developing countries, there exist deep discrepancies between their economies regarding key investment determinants such as their economic productivity, human capital, infrastructure, and normative framework. Despite these discrepancies, the member states have adopted a common market consecrating the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital. Yet, according to well tested New Economic Geography theory, a common market between highly asymmetric economies tend to cause agglomeration of FDI in the territories of the common market?s member states that present the best comparative advantage in terms of FDI determinants. Accordingly, only one or two EAC member states will end up reaping all the benefits of the common market in attracting the majority of FDI. This would definitely jeopardize the attainment of the EAC goal to reach an equitable distribution of FDI between its members states. As a consequence, the worse-off member states would be tempted to defect from the regional integration, which might lead to the collapse of the EAC just as it already happened in 1964 and in 1977 against the background of economic imbalances claims between member states.This paper takes this threat seriously and examines which legal and institutional framework is needed to mitigate the divisive nature of FDI in the EAC. It is postulated that partial transfer of competence on investment from the member states to a central body within the EAC in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity would effectively address the side effects of an intra-EAC competition for FDI attraction. But to be successful, this must be done within the framework of a robust common investment policy that the member states have to adopt. Otherwise, instead of being the wished catalyst of equitable economic development of the EAC member states, FDI is highly likely to rather become the trigger of a fatal intra-EAC competition.
K29|"The Connection Between ""Corporate Structures"" and ""Organisation and Management Models"" Pursuant to Leg. Decree 231/2001"|"The author examines the analogies, differences and connection between the obligation for companies to adopt ""appropriate corporate structures"" as envisaged by arts. 2381-2403 of the Italian Civil Code, and the obligation to implement suitable ""organisation and management models"", pursuant to Leg. Decree 231/01. This analysis starts from the observation that, in terms of the goals pursued by individual regulatory systems, the operational context addressed by the creation of ""appropriate corporate structures"" also embraces the context addressed by organisation and management models because, while the purpose of the former is to guarantee overall effective corporate management, the purpose of the latter is only to prevent the entity's administrative liability should one of the crimes contemplated by Leg. Decree 231/01 be committed. On the other hand, it is evident that the obligations that regard appropriate corporate structures address a smaller number of companies and entities than the obligation to adopt organisation and management models. The author also analyses both the characteristics that these corporate structures must have in order to be considered ""appropriate"", and those that organisation and management models must have to be considered ""suitable"" to meet the goals set by the respective regulations. He dedicates particular attention to an examination of the parties that must adopt corporate structures and organisation and management models and of those responsible for their appropriateness and suitability. Results and conclusions: The final part of the study considers whether, and to what extent, based on an examination of the various disciplines, it is possible to establish that, in the context of modern company law, corporate structures and models constitute two sides of the same coin: a mainstay of correct governance and a benchmark by which to judge the diligence of the management and control bodies."
K29|Voting Rules in Bankruptcy Law|We empirically evaluate creditors’ voting conditions and the bankruptcy voting rules of 90 countries. The severity of a voting rule is determined by the threshold values of the majority-voting rules by which creditors impose their interests. The higher the threshold values, the higher is the severity degree of the rule. We find that the bankruptcy laws of countries with German and French legal origin tend to have the least severe voting rules. The Nordic countries have moderate rules. The laws of the common law countries have the most severe rules. These results hold for secured and unsecured claimants. The court’s legal right of overcoming the voting result is granted more often by bankruptcy laws of French and German legal origin. The severity of the voting rules can influence the recovery of creditors’ debt. We show that a coalition of creditors that has a common interest can use the severity of the voting rule to influence the approval of a reorganization plan that provides a higher recovery rate of the creditors’ debt.
K29|The effect of corporate governance on firm value and profitability: Time-series evidence from Turkey|We study the corporate governance practices of Turkish public firms from 2006 to 2012, relying on hand-collected data covering the vast majority of listed firms. We build a Turkey Corporate Governance Index, TCGI, composed of subindices for board structure, board procedure, disclosure, ownership, and shareholder rights. TCGI predicts higher market value (with firm fixed effects) and higher firm-level profitability with firm random effects. The principal subindex which predicts higher market value and profitability, and drives the results for TCGI as a whole, is disclosure subindex. We also study the determinants of firms' governance and find that most firm-specific factors have little effect on firms' governance choices.
K29|Law and economics of training: a taxonomy of the main legal and institutional tools addressing suboptimal investments in human capital development|Abstract Economic literature has widely acknowledged the growing role of firm training in the knowledge economy. Training fosters labour productivity, boosts competitiveness, and strengthens firms’ capacity to innovate. This key role of training, however, raises relevant issues in terms of the optimal level of the corresponding investment. In fact firms that bear training costs may not be able to fully appropriate the relevant benefits. In addition training may facilitate structural changes and stimulate growth nationwide. Efficiency reasons thus justify the existence of legal and/or institutional tools, either voluntary or mandatory, aimed at addressing suboptimal investments in human capital development. The purpose of this study is to draw a systematic taxonomy of the main legal and institutional devices able to address the underlying inefficiencies of training investments. Training is on the top of the political agenda in many countries. The European Union is committed to increase adults’ participation in lifelong learning and to improve the quality of training programs and institutions. However, while training is of increasing political interest, a proper tool-box for policy makers is still missing.
K29|The balance between investor protection and the right to regulate in investment treaties: A scoping paper|There is vigorous debate about reforms to address the balance between investor protection and the right to regulate in the over 3000 existing investment treaties. This paper first notes the growing trend to analyse particular treaty rules rather than treaties as a whole and the importance of comparative analysis of balancing under other regimes. It then outlines issues in four areas: (i) the types of regulation potentially at issue in investment treaty claims by covered investors; (ii) the types and levels of investor protection; (iii) the degree of impact of treaties on regulation; and (iv) the processes and institutions that may be involved in balancing interests in investor protection and the right to regulate. While the paper recognises that dispute resolution institutions have a significant impact on the balance and the right to regulate, it focuses primarily on substantive issues in light of other ongoing work on dispute settlement.
K29|Addressing the balance of interests in investment treaties: The limitation of fair and equitable treatment provisions to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law|The fair and equitable treatment (FET) provision has leapt to prominence in the last 15 years as the principal ground of liability at issue in many if not most investment treaty arbitration claims. In debates about the impact of investment treaties on the right to regulate, FET is second only to investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) as the most-cited provision. This paper examines government action to address the balance between investor protection and the right to regulate by limiting fair and equitable treatment provisions to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law (MST-FET). The paper reviews the distinction between MST-FET clauses and autonomous FET clauses, and notes growing use of an express MST-FET approach in many regions. NAFTA governments’ views about the nature of the MST-FET standard, how it is identified, and its content are then examined in detail. An initial focus on NAFTA, while limited, is justified due to many singularities in NAFTA, including numerous government interpretations of MST-FET since 1994, their availability to the public and the comparatively higher success rate of NAFTA governments in defending FET claims. The paper concludes with brief comparisons between the government views and the views of ISDS tribunals and commentators.
K29|Accounting During the Austro-Hungarian Compromise and the Post-Communist Regime Change|The purpose of the article is to present Hungarian accounting regulations in two very important periods of Hungarian history: during the period of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and after the fall of Communism. The study compares the two periods on the basis of the relevant domestic and international literature; it examines the economic history and legislative parallels, compares the recognition and measurement of asset components, and elaborates on the possibilities of accounting techniques with a focus on the lesser known first period. Key conclusions: the regulations have been adapted in both cases, taking special domestic features into consideration. Essentially, they were modern and delivered the requirement of presenting a true and fair view. At the same time, the regulation of the profession was greatly influenced by the contemporary system of socioeconomic institutions.
K29|Does Bible and Quran Represent the True Word of God, The Economist case against Addictive substances|Policy prescription regarding addictive substances is one of the critical issues facing humanity since time immemorial. It is a universal truth that drug adductors are always trouble makers in terms of creating violence, corruption, incest and numerous other immoral and corrupt activities across the globe. In order to formulate the best and universal policy approach, the present study analyzed the policy prescription of economists and different religions. Christian church like the Jews not only permits but encourage the use of addictive substances in their various religious festivals. Mainstream economists case about addictive substances is based on confusion and contradiction. In sharp contrast Islam consider addictive substances as the mother of all evils and ills. Muslim jurists on one side strictly restrict the production and consumption of addictive substances, while on the other side through moral education its use is discouraged.
K29|Perspektif Lembaga Arbitrase Atas Persengketaan Bisnis Syariah (Ash-Shulh Wa Tahkim)<BR>[Perspective Of Arbitrase Institutions To The Shut Of Sharia Business (Ash-Shulh Wa Tahkim)]|The Qur'an is the main basis of Shari'ah. It states the principles while the sunnah of the Prophet provides the details of their application. For example, the Qur'an says: establish salah, observe sawm, pay zakah, take decisions by consultation, do not earn or spend in wrong ways but it does not describe how to do these things. It is the sunnah of the Prophet which gives us the details. The Qur'an is the main book of guidance and the Prophet taught how to follow it. The Prophet not only told us how to follow the guidance, he also practiced it himself. The Qur’an has rules for every aspect of life. It is complete and perfect, and guarantees us success, welfare and peace in this life on earth and in the life after death. For example, arbitrate and et all.
K29|Social justice, the food product consumer and non-communicable diseases: Implications of consumer protection legislation for the food industry in South Africa|Many health problems are related to food and diet patterns. Socio-economic development in South Africa has meant a change in diet patterns, with poorer communities moving away from traditional foods to convenience and processed foods. These foods have been associated with obesity and could greatly increase the risk of developing food-related non-communicable diseases, including diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. In addition, apartheid resulted in inequality among consumers in terms of education levels, literacy and understanding of the language used in labelling and product information, as well as in terms of access to good quality commodities that are arguably healthier. It also resulted in inequality in terms of knowledge of consumer rights and the ability to enforce them, and a lack of information and knowledge as to food related health challenges. Particular sectors in the food industry have been less concerned about the consumer health risks associated with their products or communicating such information to their consumers. Hence, recently there have been initiatives by government to protect consumers against food related non communicable diseases by proposing legislation to curb consumption of specific food products. The proposed ?sugar tax? on sugar sweetened beverages is one example. The Consumer Protection Act (CPA), passed in 2008, aims at protection of consumers by prohibiting or regulating a range of marketing and business practices and affording the consumer a range of legal rights and remedies. This paper investigates the implications of the CPA and related legislation, for the food industry and consumers of food products. The approach adopted for this paper is a descriptive critique engaging in a review of related literature, and pertinent legislation, particularly the CPA. It is envisaged that this paper will highlight the implications of the CPA in terms of the rights of consumers and the concomitant obligations of suppliers of food products, to re-examine the health risks related to their products, food labelling, disclosure of information particularly about associated health risks, and consumer education about products, in plain and understandable language. It will also identify possible gaps in the law requiring specific regulation.
K29|Wenn ich zwanzig Ziegen will und Du mir keine geben magst - Ein Überblick über die Möglichkeiten und Methoden der Streitbeilegung|Der Beitrag zeigt die verschiedenen Möglichkeiten einer Streitbeilegung in Deutschland auf. Ein Konflikt kann grundsätzlich im Machtmodell, im Delegationsmodell oder im Konsensmodell gelöst werden. Die Möglichkeit zur nachhaltigsten Konfliktlösung bietet die Konfliktlösung im Konsensmodell, da die Parteien im Rahmen des Konsensmodells die Gelegenheit erhalten, sich über ihre wirklichen Interessen klar zu werden und gemeinsam und eigenverantwortlich eine Lösung zu suchen, die ihren Bedürfnissen und Interessen gerecht wird. Wenn die Parteien nicht bereit sind, freiwillig und auf Augenhöhe gemeinsam an einer Lösung des Konflikts zu arbeiten, dann bietet das Gerichtsverfahren mit seiner Bindung an das materielle Recht, seinen prozessualen Verfahrensgarantien und seinem unparteiischen Entscheider zumindest eine gewisse Sicherheit dafür, dass der Unerfahrene oder wirtschaftlich Unterlegene eine angemessene Konfliktlösung auf der Grundlage der bestehenden Gesetze erhält. Mit der Verabschiedung des Verbraucherstreitbeilegungsgesetzes im Jahr 2016 ist die Diskussion über die richtige Konfliktlösungsmethode in Gesellschaft und Politik erneut in den Fokus gerückt. Dieses Gesetz sieht für vertragliche Streitigkeiten zwischen Verbraucher und Unternehmern ein flächendeckendes Angebot einer Streitbeilegung mithilfe eines Schlichtungsverfahrens, also eines Konsensverfahrens vor. Der Erfolg dieses Verfahrens wird entscheidend davon abhängen, ob es den Verbraucherschlichtungsstellen gelingt, das Machtgefälle zwischen Unternehmen und Verbrauchern aufzuheben und beide Seiten von den Vorteilen einer einvernehmlichen Konfliktlösung zu überzeugen.
K29|Decision-making during the credit crisis: Did the Treasury let commercial banks fail?|Limited attention has been paid to the comparative fate of banks benefiting from Capital Purchase Program (CPP) funding and less fortunate banks subject to FDIC resolution. We address this omission by investigating two core issues. One is whether commercial banks that ended up being subject to FDIC resolution received CPP funds. The other is whether the non-allocation of CPP funds made FDIC receivership more likely for viable commercial banks. Our findings show almost no overlap between CPP-funded and FDIC-resolved commercial banks, but we provide evidence that a significant number of FDIC-resolved banks could have avoided receivership if they had been allocated CPP funding. By comparing estimated funding and resolution costs we also show that bailing out more banks would have been cost-efficient. While our results do not allow for any policy suggestion on the optimality of bailouts per se, they suggest that once a bailout program is already on the table, it is better to err on the side of rescuing too many rather than too few banks.
K29|Can information be locked up? Informed trading ahead of macro-news announcements|Government agencies routinely allow pre-release access to information to accredited news agencies under embargo agreements. Using high-frequency data, we find evidence consistent with informed trading during embargoes of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) scheduled announcements. The E-mini Standard & Poor’s 500 futures’ abnormal order imbalances are in the direction of subsequent policy surprises and contain information that predicts the market reaction to the policy announcements. The estimated informed trades’ profits are arguably large. Notably, we find no evidence of informed trading prior to the start of FOMC news embargoes or during lockups ahead of nonfarm payroll, US Producer Price Index, and gross domestic product data releases.

K29|Global Spread of Pharmaceutical Patent Protection: Micro Evidence from the International Equivalents of Drug Patents in Japan|We investigate the global spread of pharmaceutical patent protection as acquired by firms, based on a novel global patent database for all significant medical drugs, including biologics, introduced in Japan. It gives us the propensity of filing and grant rate for each country for patents granted in Japan. The major findings of the study are as following. Both the filing propensity to and the grant rate of major Asian countries approached those of the OECD economies by the early 2000s for chemical substance inventions. However, substantial heterogeneity with respect to other drug inventions still exists, specifically, crystal, use, formulation or combination, suggesting significant future room for international harmonization of patent granting standards. We found clear evidence of policy impact on the spread of protection for the two largest non-OECD economies. The amendments to Patent Laws in China in 1993 had an immediate and significant impact on patent filing propensity to China (30 percentage points increase), before accession to the WTO in late 2001. Furthermore, Indiaâ€™s â€˜mailbox application systemâ€™ had a substantial effect as filing propensity reached 80 per cent of the number of corresponding European patent applications around year 2000, prior to implementing the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights for drug patents in 2005.

K29|Academic copyright in the publishing game: a contest perspective|Abstract As scientists are motivated by readership rather than by royalties, one might doubt that academic copyright is required for stimulating research. Consequently, establishing an open access regime is currently intensively being discussed. We contribute to the literature by using a contest-model in which differently talented researchers compete for limited journals space. The contest perspective adds a rent-seeking motive into the publishing game which questions that private incentives for research are always too low due to the positive externalities of scientific progress. In our model, open access always leads to higher social welfare when incentives are too high. When incentives are too low, then open access is only superior if the benefits from larger readership is sufficiently high.
K29|Elections, Ideology, and Turnover in the U.S. Federal Government|A defining feature of public sector employment is the regular change in elected leadership. Yet, we know little about how elections influence careers. We describe how elections can alter policy outputs and disrupt civil servants’ influence over agency decisions, potentially shaping their career choices. We use new data on federal career records between 1988 and 2011 to evaluate how elections influence turnover decisions. We find large levels of stability in the civil service but also pockets of employees that are responsive to presidential transitions. Senior career employees in agencies with views divergent from the president’s appear most affected. In the first three years of an administration, political factors such as elections, policy priorities, and political ideological differences, are estimated to increase turnover in the senior civil service by 30.9% in some agencies. We also find suggestive evidence that vacancies in high-level positions after elections may induce lower-level executives to stay longer in hopes of advancing.
K29|Regime of Carrier’s Macro and Micro-Liability Dealing with the International Carriage of Goods by Sea Contracts|The present research is dedicated on one of most significant legal problems dealing with in­ternational carriage of goods by sea contracts – the carrier’s liability. The carrier is the bearer of the characteristic contract’s performance. In this article some basic international con­ventional rules have been analyzed, as follows – the Haag rules (1924), the Haag-Visby rules (1968), the Hamburg rules (1978) and, first of all – the recent Rotterdam rules (2009), which, even if not yet ratified, after their entrance into force, they will trace the future development of international carriages of goods by sea.
K29|Performance Evaluation Systems In The Public Sector|Performance is a term that defines the purpose, namely the successful fulfillment of one or more activities performed by an organization. Performance assessment is a concept that cannot be defined exactly because it exceeds the scope of a particular scientific field. In the public sector, performance is difficult to identify because the processes are more difficult to quantify than in the private sector where the main purpose is profit. The paper aims to present the first major performance evaluation systems used in the public sector, followed by the advantages and disadvantages arising from their application and ends with conclusions and proposals to improve public sector performance. The paper will have a special section devoted to the status of implementation of performance evaluation systems in the public sector in Romania. Research methodology aims studying literature and law.
K29|On the Future Advances in Engineering and In-Vitro Culture of Human Embryos|"The far-reaching socio-economic, the censored methodologic-scientific, and the forgotten moral-ethical prospects of the lately emerging ""human engineering techniques"" are newly discussed here. The unanimously unmentioned future ""human embryo-based (embryogenic) transplantation methods"" are first claimed here as a potential and very powerful biomedical strategy that could now become enabled in the future due to these recent new protocols that could cause an unseen political and societal dilemma regarding their adequate, international, and humane regulation."
K29|The Indian Insolvency and Bankruptcy Bill: A Squandered Opportunity|In this perspective article, the author analyses the eventual efficacy of recently passed Insolvency and Bankruptcy Bill in India. The author ascertains that the Bill in its current form encourages liquidation at the cost of financial restructuring. An opinion is established based on secondary research that the Bill fails to provide adequate representation to certain key stakeholders. The author highlights a lack of clarity in the Bill regarding the appointment of executants. Certain lacunae in the Bill that may impede its overall effectiveness are explicitly identified. The issue of conflicts between various stakeholders is debated in the context of current Bill. The author draws upon cross-country experiences to suggest remedial measures that address current impediments in the successful implementation of the Bill.
K29|Untaxed Social-Media Problem and Potential Solutions|Advancement of internet innovation brings both pros and cons by changing the rules and dynamics of fields as trade, public service, education, entertainment, intelligence, and defense. The developments in web technology provided a lot of conveniences. On the other hand, this situation brought many problems because of lack of laws and rules in this field. One example of these challenges is those websites do not have branches in every country are not subject to taxation. This situation is directly related to the sovereign rights of the countries. Major international internet companies are only subject to tax in the countries where their headquarters are located and do not pay taxes in other nations where they earn money. Particularly in the developing countries, the tax loss reaches serious dimensions. This study will focus on the problem of social media taxation. Also, solution proposals will be presented especially for developing countries.
K29|Pokryzysowe regulacje płynności a zmiany organizacyjne w bankowości spółdzielczej|Celem artykułu jest ocena wpływu wdrożenia przepisów pakietu CRD IV/CRR w zakresie wyznaczania poziomu płynności banków oraz weryfikacja zasadności w przypadku grup spółdzielczych w Polsce. Metodą wykorzystaną przy realizacji celu jest analiza przepisów prawnych oraz analiza danych zrzeszeń spółdzielczych, przy opracowaniu której wykorzystano metody statystyczne. W wyniku przeprowadzonej analizy stwierdzona została wysoka stabilność poziomu depozytów banków spółdzielczych w bankach zrzeszających w Polsce, zarówno w warunkach normalnych, jak i w trakcie trwania kryzysu zaufania na rynku międzybankowym oraz brak uwzględnienia w regulacjach zewnętrznych struktury i charakteru działalności zrzeszeń banków spółdzielczych w Polsce. Najważniejsze wnioski płynące z dokonanej analizy wskazują na nieodpowiednie odzwierciedlenie poziomu płynności sektora bankowości spółdzielczej przy użyciu mierników określonych we wspomnianych regulacjach, których wartość, pomimo rzeczywistej nadpłynności sektora spółdzielczego, znajduje się znacząco poniżej minimalnych poziomów, a ich spełnienie jest w praktyce niemalże niemożliwe bez zmian w zakresie zmiany struktury sektora. Z drugiej strony, nowe regulacje wymuszają pozytywne przekształcenia w zakresie inte-racji sektora spółdzielczości bankowej, które mogą mieć zasadnicze znaczenie dla jego funkcjonowania i rozwoju w przyszłości.
K29|Contributions to the Analysis of Amendments of the Crime Stipulated in Article 43 of Law no. 255/1998 on the Protection of New Varieties of Plants Made by Law no. 187/2012 for the Enforcement of Law no. 286/2009 on the Criminal Code|The article brings into question the criminal protection of new varieties of plants. The author presents certain judicial norms, as previous issues, concerning the occurrence and protection of the rights over new varieties of plants through the granting of the variety patent. Furthermore, the study indicates the amendments made by Law no. 187/2012 on the enforcement of Law no. 286/2009 on the Criminal Code, concerning the counterfeiting crime incriminated in Law no. 255/1998 on the protection of new varieties of plants. Finally, the author underlines the specific elements of the contents of the investigated crime, thus providing the concerned parties with a table enabling, through the implementation thereof, the detection of the determining factors in the establishment and holding of the criminal liability of individuals infringing the rights of the plant variety patent holders, through counterfeiting.
K29|Explaining the Patenting Propensity: A Regional Analysis Using EPO-OECD Data|The aim of this chapter is to conduct an empirical study of the patenting propensity at the European regional level using the OECD-REGPAT dataset.We use patent applications by inventor’s region as, in this case, linkage to the territory is stronger than using applicant’s region. Data analysis reveals the existence of a deep, uneven distribution of patent applications, R&D expenditure and human capital. Richer regions show higher levels of both private and public R&D expenditure as well as a consistent share of the total European patent applications. Starting from the analysis of these key variables, we proceed explaining the determinants of patenting propensity. The results substantially confirm the significant role of R&D expenditure on patenting activity: mainly the business enterprises, but also the government sector component. Human capital variables show similar positive effect, while average enterprise size seems not to play a determining role in patent applications.
K29|The L&E of Intellectual Property – Do we get maximum innovation with the current regime?|Innovation is crucial to economic growth – the essential path for lifting much of the world population out of dire poverty and for maintaining the living standard of those who already have. To stimulate innovation, the legal system has to support the means through which innovators seek to get rewarded for their efforts and risks taken. Amongst these means, some, such as the first mover advantage or 'lead time,' are not directly legal; but secrets and intellectual property rights are legal institutions supported for the specific purpose of stimulating innovation. Whilst the protection of secrets has not changed very much over recent years, intellectual property (or IP) has. IP borrows some features from ordinary property rights, but is also distinct, in that, unlike physical goods, information, the object of IP, is not inherently scarce; indeed as information and communication technologies expand, the creation and distribution of information is becoming ever cheaper and in many circumstances abundant, so that selection is of the essence ('on the internet, point of view is everything'). New information builds on already existing information. Where rights on information extend too far, their monopolising effect may hamper innovation. The paper investigates the underlying structure of IP rights and surveys what we know empirically about the incentive effects of IP as about industries that flourish without formal IP. L'innovation est essentielle à la croissance économique, elle-même la voie obligée pour faire sortir une grande partie de la population mondiale de la misère et pour maintenir le niveau de vie des personnes qui en sont déjà sorties. Pour stimuler l'innovation, le système juridique doit soutenir les moyens par lesquels les innovateurs cherchent rémunération de leurs efforts et des risques pris. Parmi ceux-ci, certains comme l'« avance de départ » ne sont pas directement juridiques; mais le secret commercial et la propriété intellectuelle sont des institutions juridiques soutenues dans le but précis de stimuler l'innovation. Alors que la protection des secrets n'a pas beaucoup évolué au cours des ans, la propriété intellectuelle (PI) l'a bien. La propriété intellectuelle emprunte certains traits de la propriété classique des biens matériels, mais est aussi distincte, en ce que, contrairement aux biens matériels, l'information – l'objet de la PI – n'est pas par nature rare ; en fait, à mesure que les technologies de l'information et des communications s'étendent, la création et la distribution de l'information devient toujours moins chère. Dans certains cas, l'information devient même abondante à telle enseigne que la sélection et essentielle ('on the internet, point of view is everything'). L'information nouvelle s'appuie sur de l'information déjà disponible. Là où les droits sur l'information, et notamment la PI, s'étendent trop loin, leurs effets monopolisateurs risquent d'interférer avec l'innovation. Le texte examine la structure sous-jacente des droits de propriété intellectuelle et fait un survol de ce que nous savons de manière « empirique » sur les effets incitatifs de la PI de même que des industries qui prospèrent sans droit de propriété intellectuelle formel.
K29|Is Paper Money Just Paper Money? Experimentation and Variation in the Paper Monies Issued by the American Colonies from 1690 to 1775|"The British North American colonies were the first western economies to rely on legislature-issued paper monies as an important internal media of exchange. This system arose piecemeal. In the absence of banks and treasuries that exchanged paper monies at face value for specie monies on demand, colonial governments experimented with other ways to anchor their paper monies to real values in the economy. These mechanisms included tax-redemption, land-backed loans, sinking funds, interest-bearing notes, and legal tender laws. The structure and performance of these mechanisms are explained and assessed. This was monetary experimentation on a grand scale. ""[The colonies] cannot keep Gold and Silver among them sufficient for the Purposes of their internal Commerce... Paper Bills called Bills of Credit or Paper Money have therefore in the colonies long been substituted for real Money. Various Ways of issuing these and on different Foundations, have at different Times been thought of and practised.... On the whole no Method has been found to give any Degree of fixed, steady, uniform Value to Bills of Credit in America,..."" (Benjamin Franklin, 13 Feb. 1767)"
K29|Do fewer guns lead to less crime? Evidence from Australia|The 1996 National Firearms Agreement (NFA) in Australia introduced strict gun control laws and facilitated the buyback of over 650,000 firearms. While several studies have investigated the effect of the NFA on firearm deaths, none has looked at its impact on crimes. In this paper we adopt the difference-in-difference identification approach to examine the impacts of the NFA on crimes. We find that one and two years after the NFA was enacted, there were significant decreases in armed robbery and attempted murder relative to sexual assault, with weaker evidence in relation to unarmed robbery.
K29|Between consumer demand and Islamic law: The evolution of Islamic credit cards in Turkey|The elimination of interest from financial transactions has been a salient goal of Islamization movements around the world. Its proponents have had to balance this objective, which they claim to draw from Islamic law (Sharia), against consumer demand for convenient products. In general they have opted to accommodate consumer demand, but surreptitiously, using legal ruses to disguise their compromises. Turkey's experience with credit cards offers a revealing case of the obfuscation in question. Having denounced credit cards as un-Islamic, Turkey's Islamic banks have all proceeded to issue credit cards of their own in order to remain competitive with their openly interest-friendly, conventional rivals. With local variations, the Turkish pattern resembles that of other markets where Islamic credit cards have made inroads. In Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates, too, Islamic credit cards function like those of the conventional banks with which they compete for customers. The “Islamic” features of Islamic credit cards amount to branding. Contrary to the claims of their proponents, they do not involve fundamental financial innovations.
K29|Regulating European grant-making foundations. Lessons from the USA experience?|Grant-making foundations are private institutions that distribute their income to deserving organisations. In the USA, they enjoy fiscal incentives, but have to comply with complex rules securing that incentives are well deserved. In contrast, European countries have an embryonic legislation. This paper investigates whether the different tax rules adopted in the USA for independent and community foundations influence the grant-making behaviour of these organisations. Our econometric investigation underlines the existence of a large heterogeneity in the activities of both types, suggesting that the introduction of new regulations could benefit from a careful analysis of the nature and the features of these organisations.
K29|Apologija Novom Hrvatskom Insolvencijskom Pravu|Stecajni zakon donesen je u svibnju 1996. (NN 44/96) i nakon toga mijenjan (dopunjavan) sedam puta (NN 44/96, 29/99, 129/00, 123/03, 82/06, 116/10, 25/12 i 45/13 - dalje: SZ). Donošenje Stecajnoga zakona po uzoru na njemacki Insolvencijski zakon (Insolvenzordnung) od 5. 10. 1994. (Bundesgesetzblatt, 1994., I, str. 2866; posljednja izmjena Bundesgesetzblatt, 2011., I, str. 2854.) i prestanak važenja Zakona o prisilnoj nagodbi, stecaju i likvidaciji (NN br. 53/91 i 54/94) predstavljalo je korjenitu promjenu nacina na koji se provodio stecajni postupak u Republici Hrvatskoj. Kod gotovo svih promjena bilo je rijec o namjeri prevladavanja „akutnih“ problema u praksi i unaprjecenju sustava ostvarivanja stecajno-pravne zaštite, i to funkcionalizacijom, ubrzanjem i smanjenjem troškova stecajnoga postupka. Mecutim, kako je razdoblje nakon donošenja SZ-a vrijeme ekonomskoga rasta, posljedicno nije postojala svijest o potrebi da se spoznaju i stecaju daju i druge funkcije osim da služi samo kao instrument naplate dospjelih potraživanja od dužnika nesposobnih da izvršavaju svoje obveze, što za krajnji rezultat ima njihovu likvidaciju. Ipak, ceste financijske krize uvjetovale su potrebu za radikalnom reformom stecajne regulative, a buduæi da tehnika provocenja stecaja nije dala pomake i da se u stecaj ide, u pravilu, bez stecajnoga plana, javila se potreba za implementiranjem novoga zakona, Zakona o financijskome poslovanju i predstecajnoj nagodbi (NN 108/12, 144/12, 81/13 i 112/13 (71/15 i 78/15)). Iako je donošenjem ZFPPN-a 2012. znatno izmijenjen stecajni postupak u Republici Hrvatskoj, u njegovoj dvogodišnjoj prakticnoj primjeni uoceno je niz problema u tumacenju i ucincima pojedinih odredbi i instituta, što æe se pokušati otkloniti donošenjem novoga Stecajnog zakona (NN 71/15). Kako je „novi“ SZ drukcije od staroga definirao ovlaštenja i odgovornosti stecajnoga upravitelja, bilo je, prema shvaæanju zakonodavca, nužno i nomotehnicki urediti pitanje nagrade operativnih tijela stecajnoga postupka novom uredbom, a na temelju ovlaštenja iz SZ-a (Uredba o kriterijima i nacinu obracuna i plaæanja nagrade stecajnim upraviteljima objavljena je u NN 105/15). Nadalje, iako indikativna metoda utvrcivanja cinjenica ukazuje kako željeni ciljevi funkcionalizacije stecajno-pravne zaštite još nisu ostvareni, pred zakonodavcem je novi/stari zadatak – implementacija instituta potrošackoga stecaja kroz rješenja Zakona o stecaju potrošaca (NN 100/15). Štoviše, radi usklacenja s novim SZ, a u želji i daljnjega ekonomsko-socijalnoga poboljšanja najugroženijih u stecajnom postupku, dakle radnika, zakonodavac je po hitnom postupku drugi put novelirao Zakon o osiguranju potraživanja radnika u slucaju stecaja poslodavca (NN 86/08, 80/13 i 82/15). Svakako smatramo bitnim istaknuti kako prostor koji ovdje imamo ne dopušta detaljnu rašclambu ove problematike pa smo prinuceni ograniciti se iskljucivo, po mišljenju autora, na najvažnije aspekte nove insolvencije regulative. Štoviše, rezultat koji autor ovim radom želi postiæi jest uciniti jedan doprinos potpunijem i cjelovitijem shvaæanju pitanja koja se mogu postaviti (i pojaviti) u vezi s novim institutima. U cilju što sveobuhvatnijega odgovora na samu temu struktura ovoga rada je tomu morala biti prilagocena. Ovaj rad mogao je biti podijeljen na cetiri dijela, ali to formalno nije ucinjeno.
K29|Corporate Governance Legal Issues|This paper aims to add to the literature on the connection between corporate governance and corporate law development. “Corporate governance” came into vogue in the 1970s in the United States. Corporate governance had become the subject of debate worldwide by scholars, regulators, investors etc. This paper considers the nature and extent of corporate law contribution to the development of corporate governance and vice versa. In the last years, Russia and most continental countries (Germany, France, Italy) have enacted significant corporate law reforms. In Europe these reforms aim to strengthen the mechanisms of internal governance, empower shareholders, enhance disclosure requirements, and toughen public enforcement, which are the most effective tools for countering abuses by dominant shareholders. It is very much discussed among legal professionals in Russia that now we have the urgent need for the comprehensive review and modernization of corporate law and governance. However, the last two years Russian Civil Code and Federal Law “On Joint Stock Companies” were changed deeply. Under the new Civil Code, all legal entities (both commercial and non-commercial) are divided into corporate and unitary entities
K29|Arbitral Tribunal Power to Disqualify Unethical Counsel|In specific matters of conflicts of interest ethical issues in connection with the parties' legal representatives could occur in the course of arbitration proceedings. The purpose of this paper is to identify and investigate the current status of the arbitral tribunals and arbitral institutions power to sanction counsel's misconduct in the event of conflicts of interest. Parties have a fundamental right to choose the counsel and in the same time the right to an independent and impartial tribunal, therefore the source of the arbitral tribunal power to disqualify a counsel is a hot topic. There are no express provisions granting arbitrators such power, only soft law instruments, but which have no binding effect as long as the parties do not agree on them. For these reasons, two renowned cases where international arbitral tribunals have dealt with the subject are examined. Different set of international and domestic rules have been applied by the arbitral tribunals and even if they held that arbitrators are empowered to sanction counsel's misconduct, different outcomes on the issue have been retained: one tribunal found that the counsel is excluded from the proceedings, while the other deny this request and stated that such power would be exercised only rarely and in the most compelling situations. Therefore, developing 'truly transnational' ethical rules and their implementation by the arbitral institutions might be a solution. Arbitral tribunals are establishing this issue on the basis of the undertaken and applied international soft law (professional guidelines) which gained credibility and popularity and also became accepted international standards in the arbitration field.
K29|On Slavery and Libertarianism|There is all the world of difference between voluntary and coercive slavery. The physical invasions might be identical in the two cases, but the ethical analysis of each is diametrically the opposite. The only problem with real world slavery was that it was compulsory; the slave did not agree to take on this role. Otherwise, slavery was not only “not so bad” it was a positive good, for both the slave and the slave-master, at least in the ex-ante sense, as is the case with all economic behavior.
K29|Impacts of Planning Rules, Regulations, Uncertainty and Delay on Residential Property Development|Dwelling prices are determined in the long run by the total costs of a development, where costs include regulatory costs, including costs of delay and uncertainty. We outline a conceptual framework for the development process and then develop a real options model of housing development that indicates more formally how regulatory policies and regulatory practices affect development decisions. We apply these insights to the design of a survey of property developers active in the Auckland market, with an emphasis on the ‘affordable’ part of the market. In surveying developers, we aim to elicit their views regarding the impacts that planning rules and regulations have on total development costs. We do not attempt to value the corresponding benefits of the planning rules and regulations, so this study is not a cost: benefit analysis of council planning approaches; rather it documents the costs of the rules and regulations – as perceived by developers – to provide a basis for benefits to be compared. Almost 90% of surveyed developers have been affected by delays or uncertainties related to regulation. Regulations that have had major effects on the actual building costs of apartments include: building height limits, balcony requirements, conforming to Council’s desired mix of apartment typologies and minimum floor to ceiling heights. Major cost effects on developing residential sections and standalone dwellings include: infrastructure contributions not related to the specific development, section size requirements, extended consent processes and urban design considerations stemming from Council’s urban designers. Reserve and development contributions and Watercare levies affect the costs of both types of development. Excluding the cost of Watercare and reserve and development contributions, the typical cost range of the total impact of regulations is estimated to vary between $32,500 and $60,000 per dwelling in a subdivision. In terms of affordable apartments, assuming the total internal floor area remains the same and no deck is built, the impact on total cost typically is estimated to range between $65,000 and $110,000 per apartment.
K29|Legal Issues Relating to the Liability of the Carrier for the Air Carriage of Passengers|The analysis of the problems of the current legislation on the liability of the carrier for the carriage of passengers should cover both inter­nal acts and those of EU law and international treaties, as a result of it are derived existing in the Bulgarian Civil Aviation Act gaps. So that they be overcome made relevant proposals de lege ferenda for amendments to the said leg­islation. The detailed analysis of the national legislation requires comparing it with the right of countries with highly developed air transport. As the Bulgarian legal system follows the con­tinental tradition, as well as receptions of our private right of French law, the latter may serve as a suitable basis for comparative analysis and mapping trends in the development of legislation on issues of liability of the carrier in air transpor­tation passenger.
K29|A Good Defence – A Combined Effort Of The State And The Attorney|The responsibility of the attorney lays in his good training and moral conduct. The compelling of these demands is traditionally supervised by the professional body of the attorneys. Romania has a recent history of parallel professional associations of attorneys, a situation insufficiently solved by the state, with important repercussions. On the other hand, procedure rules have improved in the attempt to combine the need for an efficient public service of justice with the right to defence, according to the rules of a fair trial. Like for other liberal professions, confidentiality between the client and the professional is an important issue. In the legal area, the protection of confidentiality is very important, as it may influence the result of the service provided. Both the state and the attorneys, through their professional body worked to protect it. The paper presents an insight of the struggle of attorneys in the Romanian legal system, both at an institutional and a personal level, in respect with the above mentioned problems that affect a high quality defence. It is a continuation of other studies focusing on different issues in connection with the principles governing the profession of attorney, like independence of the professional and continuous training.
K29|Customs trade facilitation programs and the reduction of customs-related corruption. Are these concepts connected?|With the trade flows’ increase, the multinationals companies started to chase for lower costs of production in this order these companies changed their production model. Instead focus all its productive chain in one single spot, the companies started to allocate each phase of its productive process in the spots that enabled lower costs for the kind of activity made. Facing this reality, only those countries that were capable of offer competitive costs could participated on these international value chain, excluding many Less Developed Countries (LDC’s) and Developing Countries (DC’s) from the benefits of the trade liberalization. Analyzing the context, is possible realize that a big amount of this problem can be attributed to the low efficiency of the customs authorities in the processing of increasing volumes of trade transactions, inadequate facilities at the land and sea ports, weak physical infrastructure, inefficient bureaucracy and corruption. In this paper will be analyzed the latter reason for the low efficiency of customs authorities, the corruption. As we will see, inadequate customs procedures can create different kinds of problems, among these what most concerns today is corruption. Customsrelated corruption costs to World Customs Organization (WCO) members at least $2 billion of American dollars in customs revenue each year. Using data about bribe payers’ actual experiences in paying bribes, it is possible to show that the adoption of trade facilitation measures would only help reduce the levels of corruption and improve efficiency – in a large number of customs agencies – if the customs agency’s director undertakes a huge approach to reform. Based on corruption clubs theory this paper aims, on one hand, to show which customs agencies in the process of reform are either moving toward OECD levels of integrity and efficiency or, on other hand, which one are sliding toward a “red zone” group of countries. Such a sliding results from the incentives corrupt customs officials have to stymie reform. For instance, countries undertaking reform customs programs – i.e. those endorsed by the World Customs Organization – should not adopt reform measures piecemeal. They need to engage an anti-corruption and efficiency-enhancement programs deeply enough to ensure they benefit from trade facilitation. Removal of such trade barrier though improvement in trade facilitation measures will generate significant rise in trade among those countries. The methodology used in this paper was the analytical and deductive research’s methods in publications of international agencies and the analyze of recent data which shows that trade facilitation programs help decrease corruption only if the customs agency undertakes serious and extensive anti-corruption and efficiency enhancing work.
K29|Institutional Laws, and Mergers and Acquisitions in India: A Review/Recommendation|The paper intends to review, summarize and discuss various institutional laws refer to mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in India, and thereby recommend fruitful policy guidelines for institutions and managers participating in foreign investment and acquisition deals. Further, we also show the market for value of foreign inbound and outbound deals representing India for the period 2004 through 2013. The major observations include, higher valuation inbound-deals had delayed or failed due to weak financial infrastructure, erratic nature of government officials and political intervention, and the newly elected government has aimed to attract higher inflow of investment from other developed and emerging markets by easing investment rules and offering tax holidays. The study eventually would help policy makers, M&A advisors, legal consultants and investment bankers in assorted issues, and private equity firms and multinational firms intending to invest in Indian business.
K29|Estimating a corporate governance index for companies in Greece|European countries have gone through serious efforts to overcome the financial crisis and special measures had to be taken in order to limit the negative impact on businesses and stabilize a healthy economic environment for the single market. The specific governmental policies aimed to keep under control the effects of the crisis and relaunch the economic growth, but they were unpopular among a part of the European citizens. The economic situation forced most managers of private companies to rethink the business strategy and restructure the activity. Lately, Greece has been going through a difficult period, as the crisis worsened the economic situation of the country. The population did not welcome the drastic economic measures which were proposed by IMF and institutional creditors and this conflict almost lead to national insolvency. The problems of Greece are deeply rooted in the business models and economic philosophy. This paper has the purpose of analyzing the corporate governance regulation and practices in Greece and to determine whether it is possible to enhance business profitability and stability by enforcing a better legal framework in the area of corporate governance. The research focuses on the calculation of a corporate governance index for a selection of Greek companies form different sectors of activity (oil &gas, telecommunications, beverages) and the analysis of the results may lead to the identification of weaknesses in this domain. Improvements in the corporate governance practices are considered to lead to enhancing business stability and sustainability. The methodology for calculating the corporate governance index is adapted for Greek companies and is in accordance with the provisions of the Hellenic Corporate Governance Code.
K29|The Single-Member Board of Directors According to the New Turkish Commercial Code|The New Turkish Commercial Code was adopted on 13 January 2011 and entered into force with the exception of certain provisions on 1 July 2012. The New Turkish Commercial Code introduced many important innovations and changes, of which, those related to the law of corporations stand out. Especially, many obstacles encountered by foreign investors when they attempt to establish corporations in Turkey were eliminated by the New Turkish Commercial Code. Among the changes in question are many practical and functional innovations, such as the acceptance of independent auditing upon the abolishment of the board of auditors, which was previously a department of joint-stock companies, and the obligation for companies to set up a company web-site. The New Turkish Commercial Code has enabled the joint-stock companies to comprise one shareholder only, which, earlier, could have been founded by at least five shareholders. Another complementary regulation was also made in relation to the structure of the board of directors in joint-stock companies: The board of directors, previously required to comprise at least three members, could henceforth be formed by a single member. This situation is the result of and the obligation from regulations in Turkish Law decreeing the possibility to establish joint-stock companies by a single shareholder. However, the field of application for the single-member board of directors adopted to provide coherence with the single-shareholder joint-stock company is, in fact, not limited to only such companies; a single-member board of director can also be preferred in joint-stock companies with multiple shareholders. This memorandum was prepared to indicate the conditions and principles for the formation of the single-member board of directors in joint-stock companies. Some of the requirements for the membership in a multiple-member board of directors are not stipulated for single-member board of directors in Turkish law. In addition, principles for the representation, meetings, and decision-making of the single-member board of directors are different from those of multi-member board of directors in various cases. For this reason, this work aims to discuss the single-member board of directors in the New Turkish Commercial Code in general terms, insomuch as it differs from the multiple-member board of directors.
K29|Implications of cloud computing for personal data protection : An Indonesian perspective|ABSTRACTThe implementation of e-health programs and protection of data privacy: a comparative study between Indonesia, Australia and MalaysiaDr. Sinta Dewi RosadiThe application of e-health program refers to tools and services using information and communication technologies (ICTs) that can improve prevention, diagnosis, treatment, monitoring and management. The e-health program can benefit the entire community by improving access to care and quality of care and by making the health sector more efficient includes information and data sharing between patients and health service providers, hospitals, health professionals and health information networks; electronic health records; telemedicine services; portable patient-monitoring devices, operating room scheduling software. The e-health goals is to improve citizens' health by making life-saving information available and increase healthcare quality and access by making e-health as part of health policy and to provide health services more effective, user-friendly and widely accepted by involving professionals and patients in strategy, design and application. As one of the archipelago country with the total population estimated 255 million Indonesia has encounter many challenges in providing better health services so that the e-health program is one alternatives to provide better health services. However in the implementation of e-health program will facing legal challenges since the patients personal data is a sensitive data and its collection, use and storage needs legal protection and if the health care services provider does not keep the patients health data in confidential there will be a real risk that people will stop sharing their medical history with healthcare provider if they don?t have confidence that the right privacy controls are in place. This article is the result of preliminary study that analyze the legal framework of protection of e-health program relating data privacy protection is available and compare with Australia and Malaysia
K29|Regulating Cryptocurrencies in Poland and in the World as Exemplified by Bitcoin – the Legal Status and Economic (Regulowanie kryptowalut w Polsce i na swiecie na przykladzie Bitcoina – status prawny i interpretacja ekonomiczna )|The author presents the current legal status of cryptocurrencies in the world and in Poland and a preliminary economic assessment of legal solutions in Poland. The author points out that the current importance of Bitcoin is scarce in Poland and small in the world, despite the increasingly elaborate Bitcoin ecosystem, and that the Polish law is prepared for the adoption of this new phenomenon. However, there are still a lot of unresolved specific issues, particularly concerning tax, that make it difficult for financial institutions and users to take a stance on Bitcoin, which generates the need for an official arrangement on Bitcoin. The author also proposes an approach to enable the development of private exchange, which however would require extensive action on a global scale.

K29|The impact of internet file-sharing on the purchase of music CDs in Canada|This paper re-examines data from a survey commissioned by Industry Canada on the effects of internet peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing activities on music purchasing behaviour. The survey was designed to “inform Industry Canada's policy development work” (Quote from project Description from Industry Canada’s website at http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/ic1.nsf/eng/01464.html downloaded 23 January 2012) and the need for copyright law reform in Canada in light of the technological innovation posed by P2P file sharing. The Journal of Evolutionary Economics published a study of the Industry Canada data by Andersen and Frenz (AF) in 2010 which claimed to show “… no association between the number of P2P files downloaded and CD album sales (Andersen and Frenz 2010 ibid p 374),” and “… that P2P file-sharing is not to blame for the decline in CD markets. Music markets are not simply undermined by free music downloading and P2P file-sharing (Ibid p375).” Our paper corrects a number of fundamental errors in this analysis of AF, in particular the fact AF biased their results by excluding from their analysis the group of consumers who had completely stopped purchasing CDs (potentially because of P2P activity) prior to 2005. This is the very group who were most responsive, or likely to have substituted P2P downloading for CD purchases. We use longitudinal analysis of how reported changes in P2P downloading by individuals related to their reported changes in CD demand between 2004 and 2005 to better test the hypothesis of whether P2P downloading may reduce CD demand. Contrary to AF’s results we find negative and generally statistically significant partial correlations between CD purchases and P2P downloads under a number of specifications and sample definitions. The range of these estimated correlations is between −0.047 and −0.061. This implies that a 10 % growth in P2P downloads is associated with between a 0.47 and 0.61 % decline in CD purchases. Our estimated relationships between CD sales and P2P downloads are broadly consistent with market sales data up to the time of the Industry Canada survey, unlike AF.

K29|The Spirit of the Law over its Letter: The Role of Culture and Social Norms in Shielding Cooperative Banks from Systemic Shocks|The macroeconomic impact of banks� misconduct led users of financial services to be deterred from using the system to the detriment of market integrity and called upon policy makers and supervisors to turn to �culture� as a means to regain public trust and eventually guarantee the stability of the real economy. From this vantage point, the crisis showed that culture did indeed matter, as it can significantly influence the effectiveness of decision-making process and, thus, the risk appetite/profile of banks. Culture and behaviour have shown to be the main threat to financial stability policy makers and supervisors have currently to cope with. What is already clear is that culture is an important subject to focus on when supervising banks. Nevertheless, the problem is that current academic thinking lacks both clarity and expertise on what �culture� is all about and how it should be implemented by banks. This paper addresses this gap by exploring the illustrative case of cooperative banks. Extensive empirical evidence shows indeed that cooperative banks turned out to be more stable than commercial banks for several reasons related to the ownership structure and the business model. However, the extant literature lacks to take into account whether cooperative values (i.e. solidarity; mutualism; proximity; social commitment) contributed in motivating employees to do the right thing and to steer away from reckless behaviour. The investigation brings to the fore the main question of whether and how cooperative banks� values and culture played a role in ensuring the soundness and efficiency of risk-taking policies.
K29|3D printing and the intellectual property system|Three-dimensional (3D) printing – or “additive manufacturing” – technologies differ from traditional molding and casting manufacturing processes in that they build 3D objects by successively creating layers of material on top of each other. Rooted in manufacturing research of the 1980s, 3D printing has evolved into a broad set of technologies that could fundamentally alter production processes in a wide set of technology areas. This report investigates, from the perspective of an intellectual property scholar, how 3D printing technology has developed over the last few decades, how intellectual property rights have shaped this breakthrough innovation and how 3D printing technologies could challenge the intellectual property rights system in the future. As in other areas of innovation policy, the role of the intellectual property system in fostering innovation in 3D printing technologies is a complex one. It played a beneficial role in some instances (sometimes intended and sometimes unintended), and it may have played a neutral or detrimental role in other instances. Studying the progress of 3D printing technologies thereby also informs us about the intricate relationship between intellectual property and innovation.
K29|The Value And Economic Effects Of The Unapplied Inventions|The accounting regulations, the guidelines for their application and other articles by accounting specialists argue that inventions created internally are not recognized as intangible assets. Only assets acquired separately can be measured reliably, based on the document justifying the purchase transaction. Other specialised papers show that it is difficult to establish the existence of this intangible asset and its credible cost. That is, it can give or calculate a value of the invention only if it can show the acceptable cost of achieving it. But all these works argue that the protection of inventions is profitable if it is the basis of a new business, if it promotes or protects the current activity. However, these papers elude - because it is uncomfortable - the situation where an invention created internally has a value only because it forecloses the market. It is curious that an invention has accounting value only when traded.
K29|The meaning of a trainers profession deregulation in nowadays sport|According to recent act of trainer/instructor profession deregulation in Poland, no courses or exams are required to become a trainer or sport instructor. After changes, any common person is allowed to practice sports coaching. The aim of the research was to become familiar with the parents opinion on the act and on their children’s attendance to the sport classes. The tool to acquire responds was a 10-question questionaire of author’s project which has been completed by 378 citizens of Malopolska. The results revealed discrepancies in perception of trainer/instructor profession deregulation. Among others, around 60% of parents declared they never checked pro’s qualifications and would not mind their work if they had no certifications. Most parents do not focus on the trainers’ faculties and legal force of their title. It should be thought-provoking as kids’ safety is expected to be priority. There comes the conclusion that the act of deregulation, which is strongly depreciated by experts, is not being depreciated among parents of children practicing sports. There should be introduced educational campaign which would increase parents’ awareness.
K29|The Portuguese Law on Social Economy|This study is a reflection on the Portuguese Framework Law on Social Economy, highlighting, from a critical point-of-view, its contribution to the explicit institutional and legal recognition of the social economy sector. It does so by defining the concept of social economy and listing the entities engaged in this sector, by defining its guiding principles and the mechanisms for its promotion and encouragement, and also by describing the creation of a tax and competition regime which will take into account its specificities. The setting up of this foundation of the social economy was based on the constitutional principle of protection of the social and co-operative sector, which substantiates the adoption of differentiating solutions in view of the positive discrimination of this sector.
K29|Methods for multicountry studies of corporate governance: Evidence from the BRIKT countries|We discuss empirical challenges in multicountry studies of the effects of firm-level corporate governance on firm value, focusing on emerging markets. We assess the severe data, “construct validity”, and endogeneity issues in these studies, propose methods to respond to those issues, and apply those methods to a study of five major emerging markets—Brazil, India, Korea, Russia, and Turkey. We develop unique time-series datasets on governance in each country. We address construct validity by building country-specific indices which reflect local norms and institutions. These similar-but-not-identical indices predict firm market value in each country, and when pooled across countries, in firm fixed-effects (FE) and random-effects (RE) regressions. In contrast, a “common index”, which uses the same elements in each country, has no predictive power in FE regressions. For the country-specific and pooled indices, FE and RE coefficients on governance are generally lower than in pooled OLS regressions, and coefficients with extensive covariates are generally lower than with limited covariates. These results confirm the value of using FE or RE with extensive covariates to reduce omitted variable bias. We develop lower bounds on our estimates which reflect potential remaining omitted variable bias.
K29|The evolution of corporate governance in Brazil|We use extensive hand collected surveys reporting governance practices of Brazilian firms in 2004, 2006, and 2009 to build a broad corporate governance index and analyze the evolution of corporate governance in Brazil and the association between governance and firm value. We find that corporate governance practices improved significantly over this period. This evolution is due to two main factors: 1) growth in Novo Mercado and Level II (NM&L2) listings, mainly through IPOs by new firms, and 2) improved practices at non-NM&L2 firms, principally through adopting governance elements required for NM&L2 listing. Governance practices for firms already listed on NM&L2 were stable. Adoption of the elements of our governance index that are required for NM&L2 listing predicts higher firm value. In contrast, adoption of the remaining elements of our index does not predict firm value. Thus, governance changes appear to respond to investor preferences.

The relations between direct reports are of equality from a legal point of view. Still, the authority of a person that was assigned a leading position cannot rely exclusively on legal prerogatives. It must be the result of an array of professional and behavioural values, etc, granting it the quality of specialist. Therefore, a leader must be endowed with the ability to analyze the capacity of the human factor, in order to fully achieve objectives set by the programs drafted from one stage to another.

K29|Liability Rule Failures? Evidence from German Court Decisions|Since 2007, all insurance intermediaries face negligence liability that is supposed to reallocate risks and set economic incentives. Nonetheless, further measures are taken to improve consumer protection. So, the question arises does the liability rule influence the agents behavior, or not, and does it influence in the intended way, or not? Do court cases provide evidence for failure of the current liability rule? Based upon an economic analysis of liability rules, aspects concerning potential failures can be derived. An analysis of twelve verdicts suggests that understatement of intermediary responsibility as well as a potential overstatement of the consumer responsibility yields suboptimal results. Often, missing documentation reinforces that tendency.
K29|Notwendigkeit, Regelungen und Konsequenzen einer neuen Geldordnung|From an analysis of the uncertainties, deficiencies and negative effects of the present monetary system the necessity and the requirements for a new monetary order are derived. These requirements are fulfilled by the presented regulations of a monetary order, which is based on the proposals of Joseph Huber (Vollgeld), Henry Simons and Irving Fisher (100 %-Money), Milton Friedman (Chicago Plan) and others (Allais, 1988; Gödde, 1985; Benes / Kumhof, 2013). The new monetary order requires another cash management, adapted payment systems and a different monetary policy of the central bank. Results of the new monetary order are legally protected money, no bank runs, a substantial reduction of the public debt, self-regulated smoothing of economic and stock market cycles, stabilization of the monetary union and other advantages for the economy. By also addressing open questions and alternative solutions this paper intends to stimulate a discussion of the proposals and the further development of a new monetary order.
K29|The “regulatory authority dixit” defence in European competition law enforcement|The European Commission (EC) and the European Courts have being reaffirming in the Deutsche Telekom and Telefónica cases that guide-prices established by sector regulators upon electronic communications incumbents cannot per se exclude that conducts with anticompetitive foreclosure effects, such as margin squeeze, undertaken within the boundaries of those pre-established prices, can be considered abusive under Article 102 TFEU. The paper aims at showing that the reasoning put forward by the EC and the Courts not only dismantles the defensive reasoning put forward by the incumbents before the EC and on appeal before the Courts but actually reaffirms the centrality of the enforcement activity of the EC. The paper examines the reasoning behind the “regulatory authority’s instructions defence” – the argument of the incumbents stating that their actions were justified because they had set their wholesale access prices and retail prices in line with the guidelines imposed by the sectorial regulators. Recalled in this context were also the principles of proportionality, subsidiarity and fair cooperation between the EC and individual Member States. The affirmation of the “heliocentric” doctrine that puts the EC at the hearth of competition law enforcement vis á vis national regulators and domestic legislation (provided decisions of the regulatory authorities can be considered secondary law sources) should take into consideration the important precedent of Consorzio Industrie Fiammiferi. The latter affirms that competition authorities can automatically put aside legislation that goes against Article 101 TFEU. However, they cannot impose pecuniary fines when certain behaviours are imposed by national legislation (while they can impose fines if those behaviours were suggested or facilitated by national legislation).

K29|Several Conclusions from Research of Insolvency Cases in the Czech Republic|The survey of real outcomes of insolvency proceedings in the Czech Republic analysed by this study took place during 2012 and 2013. This is the first survey that enables (on the basis of a statistically declarative sample) the ascertainment of certain crucial data as to the actual outcome of insolvency proceedings in the Czech Republic, i.e. especially as to the yields which creditors obtain. The study analysis outcomes drawn from two waves of statistical research, compare these two waves together and place the results gained into an international context. In addition, the study also brings forward basic information on the structure of the insolvency act in the Czech Republic and possible changes in legislation that would create a more congenial environment for creditors.
K29|The relationship between services trade and government procurement commitments: Insights from relevant WTO agreements and recent RTAs|"To date, government procurement has been effectively carved out of the main multilateral rules of the WTO system. This paper examines the systemic and other ramifications of this exclusion, from both an economic and a legal point of view. In addition to relevant elements of the WTO Agreements, particularly the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), it derives insights from a large number of Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) that embody substantive provisions on both government procurement and services trade. An important finding is that, from an economic perspective, general market access commitments with respect to services trade and commitments regarding government procurement of services are complementary and mutually reinforcing. In contrast, from a legal point of view and at the multilateral level, disciplines in the two areas have been ""divided up"" into two Agreements with different (but complementary) spheres of application: the key provisions regarding the scope of application of the GATS and the GPA make clear that each serves purposes that the other does not. Analysis of corresponding provisions of RTAs broadly supports and extends this finding. In light of the foregoing, a question arises as to possible ways of deepening disciplines in this area. Part 5 sets out, for reflection, several related options: (i) the built-in mandate in the GATS for negotiations on services procurement (Article XIII:2); (ii) ""multilateralization"" of the GPA; (iii) the reactivation of work in the (currently inactive) WTO Working Group on Transparency in Government Procurement; and (iv) the taking up of relevant issues in the context of bilateral or regional negotiations. Overall, we find that each of these possibilities has potential merits, though none is without related challenges."
K29|The Preliminary Ruling Decision in the Case of Google vs. Louis Vuitton Concerning the AdWord Service and its Impact on the Community Law|The internet user after entering the keywords obtains two kinds of search results – natural and sponsored ones. The following paper deals with the issue of using keywords which correspond to trademarks registered by a third party for advertising purposes through internet search portals such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, Seznam, Centrum etc. (in principle web search portals). The objective of this article is to analyze decided cases dealing with the AdWords service issued by the Court of Justice of the European Union and compare them also with the attitude in similar disputes in the U.S. Within this knowledge it is necessary to determine the impact of these decisions on further national courts decisions of European Union member states. Moreover there is also legal impact on copyright law and responsibility of internet search engines deduced. The method of the analysis of courts decisions is used and the method of legal comparison is applied to different attitudes in similar cases. Where a third party uses a sign which is identical with the trademark in relation to goods or services identical with those for which the mark is registered, the trademark proprietor is allowed to prohibit such use if it is liable to affect one of the functions of the mark (particularly the function of indicating origin). Regarding to the liability of the Internet search engine itself, decisions of the courts in matters of Internet search engines in the European Union vary from state to state. Whereas the German courts tend to currently access the responsibility for the outcome of the search engines more freely, the French courts are often more stringent. Differently, we can say much more liberal, is the access of the U.S. courts to this issue. Preliminary ruling decision in case of Louis Vuitton Malletier SA vs. Google, Inc. and community practice in further cases follow similar (liberal) decisions of the courts of the U.S.

The IP legal protection of indications of geographic origin is, at the one side, wider than of the other intellectual properties because IP legal protection of registered indication of geographic indication is essentially featured by certain public law element. But at the other side, it is notably narrower because more than one legal entity can be authorised for commercial use of the same indication of geographic origin. Furthermore, an authorised user can not obtain a right in the application nor assign registered indication of geographic origin, since these are not a subject of commerce that is one of the most important powers comprised in all others intellectual property rights, except in collective trademarks and certification marks rights. Authors in this paper deal with legal aspects of indication of geographic origin use.
K29|Paying for the smart grid|Smart grid technologies may bring substantial advantages to society, but the required investments are sizable. This paper analyzes three main issues related to smart grids: reliability, demand response and cost recovery of investments. In particular, we show that generators will lose profits as a direct effect of demand response initiatives, and most of the benefits of smart grids cannot be easily converted into payments. Moreover, there are potential issues in the choices made by utilities for providing smart grids, and the reliability pertinent to smart grids is a kind of public good.
K29|New Countries and New Economies in the Balkans|The newly created economies in the former Yugoslav space advance on the transition road with more or less success. Each of the former Yugoslav republics has implemented its own transition policy, encountering different economic, political and social opportunities, as well as constraints. From another aspect, certain important similarities are also evident. This paper aims to present divergent economic and transition policies implemented in the Yugoslav space, and different outcomes in building the new economies. Particular attention is paid to comparative analysis of the privatization process carried out in all of them. Finally, the paper analyzes the progress achieved in building market economy structures in the new states. The analysis supports conclusions that, regardless of the speed of liberalization and privatization, different transition outcomes may have been influenced in the short run by the initial conditions, but in the long run the most important factors have been macroeconomic policy and institutional and regulatory reforms.
K29|Personal Bankruptcy Law, Fresh Starts, and Judicial Practice|We explore the rationale behind and the mechanisms employed by French judges while discharging personal debts in exchange for liquidation of debtors' assets. Our empirical results highlight the determinants of judicial selection between debtors whose debts are wiped out and those who have to reimburse them. We find that French judges tend to disqualify debtors with multiple creditors from debt discharge, and are sensitive to variables representative of economic activity in the courts' locality. These empirical results help us to understand better how much French personal bankruptcy law is rather pro-creditor than pro-debtor.
K29|Application of mathematical method in public works tendering in Greece|In Greece, the legal framework for public works has application in each one of them, without exceptions. Historically, the Greek collective capitalist has utilized this framework for the purpose of reinforcing the degree of concentration (oligopolization) of the Public Works market. In the course of the year 1998 the legislator sought through implementation of Law 2576 to effect a forcible restructuring of the market and redistribution of the sectoral product to the benefit of the construction companies dominating the Public Works sector. Its aim was to either liquidate weaker contracting capitals or convert them into sub-contractors for construction oligopolies. It nevertheless transpires that the opposite results were produced to what was expected, so that there was a fall in the amount of Product appropriated by the hegemonic construction companies. The legislator accordingly introduced Law 2940/2001 within a juridical framework that came into effect at the same time as Law 2576/1998, the objective being to rectify the deficiencies of the older legislation.

K29|Law versus Economics? How should insurance intermediaries influence the insurance demand decision|How should intermediaries influence the insurance demand decision? The answer must refer to the interdependence of economic determinants and legal duties. Intermediaries potentially guide demand decisions by delivering objective information and by considering individuals’ situation and economic circumstances. The economic theory provides determinants that are essential for the insurance demand decision. Undoubtedly, consumers lack information about certain variables, and therefore misjudge their demand for insurances. In response to the consumer, an intermediaries’ task is to discover possible misjudgments and to provide the correct information. Since the information in the insurance market is asymmetrically distributed, an insurance agent has an incentive to behave opportunistically, a tendency that is reinforced by the remuneration scheme in Germany. In 2007/2008, insurance intermediaries became regulated by law. That law states, among other things, the four basic obligations of insurance intermediaries and a liability rule to sanction violations. In order to interpret and substantiate the legal terms, those have to match the relevant economic determinants to state the ideal behavior of an intermediary.
K29|Regulation on the prohibition on monetary financing - obligations and opportunities|The prohibition on monetary financing restricts the central bank financing of institutions within the public sectors of the EU and member states, thereby strengthening the budgetary discipline and the commitment to price stability as the primary objective of monetary policy. However, compliance with the prohibition does not mean that there is no leeway left for the efficient fulfilment of central bank functions. The exceptions specified in the law allow central banks to attain the objectives and fulfil the basic tasks of the European System of Central Banks. The regulations concerning the prohibition on monetary financing also apply to the non-euro area central banks - thus to the Magyar Nemzeti Bank as well - and compliance with such regulations is monitored by the European Central Bank. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the key elements of the prohibition and the possibilities provided by the exceptions by presenting the central bank's lending practice, the purchase of debt instruments and the functions of the fiscal agent. The European Central Bank and member state central banks cannot grant credit to the public sector of the EU and of the member states. The central bank funding of publicly-owned credit institutions other than central bank money supply is irreconcilable with the prohibition on monetary financing. In respect of debt instruments, the purchase of securities issued by the public sector on the primary market is prohibited, and purchasing on the secondary market may not serve the circumvention of the prohibition either. Central banks may act as fiscal agents for the state; but any role they assume must comply with market conditions.
K29|Tearing the Veil of Privacy Law: An Experiment on Chilling Effects and the Right to Be Forgotten|Privacy law relies on the argument that consent does not entail any relevant impediments for the liberty of the consenting individual. Challenging this argument, we experimentally investigate whether consent to the publication of personal information in cyberspace entails self-coercion on a social norm level. Our results suggest that the monetary benefits from consent constitute a price that people are willing to accept for increased compliance with social norms. Providing people with a prior consent option is sufficient to generate chilling effects (i.e., a reduction of norm-deviant behavior). However, nudging people towards potential publicity does not increase the value they place on privacy. We also test how the default design of the right to deletion of personal information (right to be forgotten) affects chilling effects and privacy valuations. Surprisingly, the right to be forgotten does not reduce chilling effects. Moreover, individuals tend to stick with the status quo of permanent information storage.
K29|A Behavioural Analysis of Shareholders' Meetings|"The law relating to shareholders' meetings is almost invariably built on the assumptions of rational operators (shareholders, directors etc.), perfect information and no transaction costs. In such a model all operators select, within the alternatives available, the path of action that maximises their own utility; their decisions are based on stable, consistent and objective preferences; their choices are rational and based on all information available. Under this hypothesis, the only requirement needed in order to reach an ""efficient"" outcome in a shareholders' meeting is to provide its participants with the highest degree of information available. On the other hand, behavioural economics provides undisputable empirical evidence that all actors make their economic choices under the systematic - and, therefore, predictable - influence of errors in both reasoning and preferences, which leads them (sometimes far) away from the path of ""rationality"". When applied to shareholders' meetings and more generally to group decisions, behavioural analysis show that the patterns governing such events are very likely to bring the output of any group discussion far away from the objective of more informed decisions and a better composition between the different interests represented therein. In this paper we examine the most common errors at both the individual and group levels, providing some comments and highlighting how they may impact on shareholders' meetings. After such a summary, we develop some provisional proposals that we claim would contribute to debiase group decisions and help shareholders' meetings in reaching their scopes, highlighting the need for further research and action in this field."
K29|law and economics of copyright and trademarks on the Internet|This article provides an overview of the new opportunities and challenges for copyright and trademark law and economics research created by the Internet. It reviews the relevant literature in the field of copyright law, in particular as it relates to piracy, liability and market structure, Digital Rights Management, the relationship between copyright and contract, and incentives for creativity. As far as trademark law is concerned, the article describes the empirical literature, focusing on keyword advertising. The article concludes with an outlook on future research areas and methodologies.
K29|The Trade With Medicine|Is there a link between trade and medicine? As origins, commercial interests were foreign from the medical tradition; in other words, the answer would be negative. From this point of view, the differences between a hospital and a commercial enterprise should be more than obvious. It will therefore be very important to note the differences between a doctor from a trader, a patient from a customer, and eventually the patient from the merchandise. Is medicine a business? Although the answer is negative in theory, in practice we can find answers in formal terms that are positive (unfavorable but by implication). In fact, this is a tribute paid to a number of shortcomings: from the lack of a vocational education to the anemic reaction of various institutions with a precise role in this direction.
K29|The Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment Obligation: Trends Leading to its Marginalisation and whether a Threat to the Multilateral Trading System|The Most-Favoured- Treatment Obligation is a fundamental principle under the multilateral trading system of the World Trade Organisation. The principle requires Members to accord the same tariff and regulatory treatment given to the product of any one Member at the time of import or export of “like products” to all other Members. However, recent trends show deviation from this rule so much so that it is most often applied as an exception rather than as a general rule. This paper examines the MFN Treatment Obligation, trends leading to the importance of its marginalisation and whether with the recent retreat its marginalisation is a threat to the multilateral trading system or merely an evolutionary step on the path to greater trade liberalisation.
K29|Freedom of Movement Rights of Turkish Nationals in the European Union|This article is concerned with the evolving free movement rights of Turkish nationals in the European Union (‘EU’). The right to move freely represents one of the fundamental freedoms of the internal market, as well as an essential political element of the package of rights linked to the very status of citizenship of the EU. Given the fact that the holding of the nationality of a Member State is the condition sine qua non for acquiring citizenship of the EU, Turkish nationals are clearly not yet citizens of the EU; at best, they can be described as “EU citizens in being.” While the rights granted to Turkish nationals by the EU, are amongst the most extensive granted to third country nationals (‘TCNs’), the outer limits of their freedom of movement rights are firmly rooted in the specific free movement provisions in EU-Turkey Association Law. This naturally gives rise to several inter-related questions: how far should the free movement rights granted to EU nationals be extended to Turkish nationals, as citizens of an accession state? How do the freedom of movement rights of Turkish nationals compare with EU nationals? The freedom of movement rights for Turkish nationals, within the context of Turkey-EU relations, has been an important issue for Turkish citizens ever since 1980 when strict visa requirements were introduced. This problem confronts all strata of Turkish society, including the business community, the academic world, students, journalists, and almost 3 million family members of Turkish nationals living in the EU. This paper shows that the free movement rights of Turkish nationals under EU-Turkey Association law is independent of the political talks surrounding the re-admission agreement and “visa dialogue,” which are aimed at gradually permitting free movement in the EU for Turkish nationals. This paper shows that under the text of the AA, and as confirmed by ECJ case law, Turks have substantial free movement rights within the EU arising from EU-Turkey Association Law and these new agreements and requirements are evidence that the political consideration of the EU block continue to trump the legal considerations.
K29|Current Changes in the Role of the Insurance Sector|The authors analyze changes resulting from impacts of the globalization process and the crisis on the financial markets, particularly on the conservative insurance sector, which is forced to accelerate the dynamics of structural changes. The adequacy of the current regulatory measures for the financial/banking markets, and the insurance sector in particular, is discussed, together with the consequences of implementing measures aimed at consumer protection/anti-discrimination measures, including the search for balance between higher internal stability and client safety on the one side, and efficiency of insurance for clients and effectiveness of the activity itself on the other side. Furthermore, the article addresses current internal problems of the sector. An opinion is expressed in conclusion that the insurance sector has potential to remain a stable sector, in spite of the outlined problems.
K29|Telecommunications Regulation in Poland|The contributions cover selected elements of Poland's regulatory practice that were of special importance for the development of the national telecommunications market and proved relevant, at the same time, for the implementation of EU rules. A significant part of this book is devoted to the identification and discription of measures that were adopted by national legislative and regulatory authorities in order to take into consideration justified national circumstances while implementing the EU regulatory framework.

K29|The New Multilateralism: The Shift to Private Global Regulation|Non-state actors are increasingly engaged in authoritative decision-making over standards. As a result, frameworks for governing international economic transactions are increasingly being maintained by the private sector, both with and without government cooperation. Typically, these privately set standards help underpin cross-border exchanges, and increasingly help facilitate global trade beyond what World Trade Organization (WTO) rules or other government-to-government agreements have been able to do. This model of non-intrusive government vigilance could constitute a sort of “trusteeship,” promoting private regulation where it legitimately serves the public interest, while having governments act as guardians against abuse. Canada should give this phenomenon a more explicit place in its global commerce and competitiveness strategies.
K29|Vorschläge zur Verbesserung der kapitalgedeckten Altersvorsorge aus verbraucherpolitischer Sicht|The success of the government-sponsored pension depends on three main factors: (i) Empowering willing consumers to save additional money for the future. For it simplified, standardized, and comparable information about Riester products and expected benefits are needed. (ii) False incentives for distribution of financial products must be eliminated. (iii) Regulation has to be effectively supervised and the consumer protection has to be a focus of the regulatory authority. Der Erfolg der staatlich geförderten Altersvorsorge hängt von drei wesentlichen Faktoren ab: (i) Die Verbraucher müssen tatsächlich willens sein, zusätzliche Sparleistungen aufzubringen. Dafür müssen sie aber auch einfache und transparente Informationen zu den Produkten und bestehenden Anwartschaften erhalten. (ii) Fehlanreize im Vertrieb von Finanzprodukten müssen beseitigt werden; und (iii) Regulierung muss eine wirksame Aufsicht umfassen. Dies setzt bei der Aufsichtsbehörde aber auch einen Paradigmenwechsel voraus: Der Schutz der kollektiven Interessen der Verbraucher muss in den Fokus der Aufsichtspraxis rücken.
K29|Is Paper Money just Paper Money/ Experimentation and Local Variation in the Fiat Paper Monies Issued by the Colonial Government of British North America, 1690-1775: Part I|The British North American colonies were the first western economies to rely on legislative-issued fiat paper monies as their principal internal media of exchange. This system arose piecemeal. It was monetary experimentation on a grand scale. In the absence of banks and treasuries that exchanged local fiat monies at fixed rates for specie monies (outside monies) on demand, colonial governments experimented with other ways to anchor their fiat monies to real values in the economy. These mechanisms included tax-redemption, interest-bearing notes, land-backed mortgage loans, sinking funds, and legal tender laws. The structure and performance of these mechanisms are explained.
K29|Does Corporate Governance Determine Corporate Performance and Dividends during Financial Crisis: Evidence from Poland|This study seeks to investigate the relationship between corporate governance, measured by Corporate Governance Index (CGI), and firm's performance and dividend payouts during the financial crisis in Poland. The empirical approach in the study lies in constructing a comprehensive measure of the corporate governance for 298 non-financial companies listed on Warsaw Stock Exchange in the years 2006-2010. The results show a positive association between corporate governance and performance measured by Tobin's q. Moreover, I find evidence that higher corporate governance leads to an increase in cash dividends. Finally, the results presents that during the recent financial crisis corporate governance is positively associated with return on assets. However, in the period of the financial crisis better governed companies paid dividends less generously than do firms with lower corporate governance standards.
K29|What matters and for which firms for corporate governance in emerging markets? Evidence from Brazil (and other BRIK countries)|A central issue in corporate governance research is the extent to which “good” governance practices are universal (one size mostly fits all) or instead depend on country and firm characteristics. We report evidence that supports the second view. We first conduct a case study of Brazil, in which we survey Brazilian firms' governance practices at year-end 2004, construct a corporate governance index, and show that the index, as well as subindices for ownership structure, board procedure, and minority shareholder rights, predicts higher lagged Tobin's q. In contrast to other studies, greater board independence predicts lower Tobin's q. Firm characteristics also matter: governance predicts market value for nonmanufacturing (but not manufacturing) firms, small (but not large) firms, and high-growth (but not low-growth) firms. We then extend prior studies of India, Korea, and Russia, and compare those countries to Brazil, to assess which aspects of governance matter in which countries, and for which types of firms. Our “multi-country” results suggest that country characteristics strongly influence both which aspects of governance predict firm market value, and at which firms that association is found. They support a flexible approach to governance, with ample room for firm choice.
K29|Rearranging the roles of the performer and the composer in the music industry – the potential significance of Fisher v Brooker|The composer has historically been at the top of the tree in the music industry; most royalties due to artists flow back to composers/songwriters rather than performers. Over the last few decades, the enactment of stronger performers’ rights has sought to redress this historical imbalance by providing performers with, amongst a number of economic and moral rights, the right to receive compensation for the exploitation of their performances. However, this article explores the fact that there may be cases where performers may be ‘authors’ for the purpose of copyright, as opposed to performers’ rights. Some original works of joint authorship – musical arrangements – may not have been traditionally recognised as such within the music industry. For instance, with regard to the making of arrangements by a group of musicians, it appears from recent UK case law that as long as a performing musician makes an original contribution to the creation of an arrangement, he or she will be a joint-author of the resulting work. As a result of this, the performing musician is deserving of a share of copyright in that arrangement, and by analogy, a share of licensing revenue from the exploitation of the arrangement. However, this conclusion appears to be slightly at odds with historical practices within the music industry. Furthermore, the law in this area raises further questions concerning whether it ought to be the case that performers are potentially seen as joint authors in return for their creative contributions. In order to assess these issues in detail, this article first outlines the concept of the musical work under the CDPA, including analysis of the distinction between the composition and the arrangement. The article also discusses the historical hierarchy of musicians in the music industry, exploring the reasons why the composer of the work has traditional received more royalties than the performer of the work. An assessment of the originality of compositions and arrangements is also detailed over the course of this article. Furthermore, in order to properly assess the issues, the important UK cases in this area are examined in this article, with a particular focus on the case of Fisher v Brooker, a case which clarifies to some degree the law on the making of musical arrangements, and which also deals with the complex licensing issues that can arise from finding that a band member is in fact a joint author of a recorded arrangement. Ultimately, this article argues that the law on authorship and joint authorship in this area is clear - any musician who adds sufficient creative originality to a musical work during the performance and recording process is a joint author of the resulting arrangement. However, although the law is clear, the music industry practices may not take account of this. For this reason, it is important that musicians in groups place their legal relationship to each other regarding the works which result, including the terms of the distribution of royalties, in writing before they begin the artistic process.
K29|The economic and social impact of public procurement on the EUâ€™s internal market|Our paper proposes to analyze the role of public procurement in achievement of the objectives of Europe 2020 Strategy, highlighting the social and economic impact of this policy on the European market. The research is structured in four analytical chapters and one chapter of conclusions. The first chapter presents the main European regulations on public procurement emphasizing how the legislative framework can contribute to the efficiency of public procurement and to the achievement of economic objectives of Europe 2020 Strategy. The second chapter presents the economic and social impact of electronic procurement and the evolution of main indicators in the field. The third and fourth chapter underline the main obstacles that restrain the access of European enterprises on public procurement market and present some conclusions that illustrate the necessity of the modernization of this policy.

K29|Who Bets on Sports? Characteristics of Sports Bettors and the Consequences of Expanding Sports Betting Opportunities/¿Quién apuesta? Características de los apostantes deportivos y consecuencias de la expansión de las oportunidades de apostar|Currently, several proposed changes in sports betting laws are being debated in the United States and the European Union. This article examines the characteristics of sports bettors in three countries, Canada, Spain, and the United Kingdom, to determine who bets on sports in environments where this activity is both legal and popular. Uncondi¬tional and conditional analyses find that annual participation rates in sport betting are low, and that sport bettors tend to be young males with relatively high incomes. Sports bettors stand to gain the most from an expansion of legal sports betting opportunities, while the negative impacts of increased access to sports betting are expected to be mini¬mal in the United States and difficult to assess in the European Union. Actualmente, un importante número de cambios en la legislación del mercado de apuestas deportivas están siendo debatidos tanto en Estados Unidos como en la Unión Europea. En este artículo se examinan las características socio-económicas de los apostantes deportivos en Canadá, España y el Reino Unido con el objeto de determinar el perfil de estos jugadores en contextos donde está actividad es legal y muy popular. El análisis empírico muestra que la fre¬cuencia de participación en este mercado es baja y que el perfil de los apostantes tiende a ser el de un hombre joven con ingresos relativamente altos. Se concluye que los propios apostantes serían los potenciales beneficiarios de una expansión de las oportunidades de apostar, mientras que el impacto negativo de esta liberalización se espera sea mínimo en Estados Unidos y difícil de calcular en la Unión Europea.
K29|Wintertime for Deceptive Advertising?|Casual empiricism suggests that deceptive advertising about product quality is prevalent, and several classes of theories explore its causes and consequences. We provide unusually sharp empirical evidence on its extent, mechanics, and dynamics. Ski resorts self-report substantially more natural snowfall than comparable government sources. The difference is more pronounced on weekends, despite third-party evidence that snowfall is uniform throughout the week—as one would expect given plausibly greater returns to exaggeration on weekends. Exaggeration is greater for resorts that plausibly reap greater benefits from it: those with expert terrain and those not offering money back guarantees. (JEL D83, L15, L83, M37, Z31)
K29|The Present Requirements on Bank Prudence. Publicity Requirements and Sanctions|Requirements on banking activity impose regulation of specific issues concerning both the authorisation and the operation, and also ceasing the bank activity. This enforcement originates from the objectives pursued by the National Bank of Romania as own policy, but also as a separate member of the European financial structures. The analysis aims to identify, without exhaustive study, the intrinsic correlations of essential notions for banking field - prudence, prudential supervision, international publishing and sanctions, quartered obviously in risk area. We mention that risk, as related to surveillance and caution, represents the possibility of potential, expected or unexpected events to have a negative impact on bank capital or bank revenue.

K29|The Administrational Reform Of The Judicial System In Hungary|The Hungarian Constituion created the National Council of Justice as a constitutional organisation to reinforce of the independence of justice. It started its activities in 1997 and its basic regulation is the Act No. 66 of 1997 on the organisation and administration of the Courts. According to this act, the „National Council of Justice shall fulfill the central duties of administration of courts with the observation of the constitutional principle of judicial independence and exercise supervision of the administrative activities of the presidents of the courts of appeal and county courts.” In order to reinforce the independence of judiciary, the National Council of Justice is a fully independent legal entity, with its own, by the Parliament approved budget, the proposal which is submitted directly to the Parliamanet by its president, without the consent of the Government. The Parliament accepted in 2011 the new Constitution of Hungary which will come into force in 2012. New acts will regulate the administration and organization of the judiciary system. The reason of this, that the present system has some advantage but many rightful criticism arose. For example the system is very bureaucratic, expensive, do not assure the readiness of the cases, but gives too much power for the leaders of the courts which infringe the independence of the judges. Frequent criticism that the present administration and system do not assure the prevention of the justicmords. The necessity of the reform is out of doubt, and the devise of the best conception is the object of the year 2011.
K29|Fiscal Impulse Under Conditions Of The Slovak Republic|“The consolidation of public finance should create room for sustainable economic growth with low inflation, low interest rates, a stable exchange rate and positive expectations of stakeholders concerning future economic policy.” (Convergence programme D 2007, pp. 30) So far, the consolidation of public finance appears to be the only tool that can maintain the running of individual economies of the EMU member countries. Slovakia is not an exception. Throughout its 20-year history, Slovakia has experienced several phases of the public finance consolidation which have proved to be more or less successful. Just as in other countries, in times when its economy thrived, the push for consolidation was abandoned; however, at present, Slovakia is forced to return to the consolidation. Our goal and the object of this article is to highlight interconnections between the state of public finance, public finance management and investment activities under the conditions of Slovakia. We have focused primarily on the fiscal impulse which is one of the determinants of investment activities.

The current crisis has reached the consumers globally and intensified conversations about consumer protection. It has threatened their wealth as people have lost their assets, savings and they are facing major concerns about their future stability. This financial crisis began with a failure to protect consumers. Effective, affirmative and preventative consumer protection needs to be a major part of the global solution. This paperwork intends to make a contribution to those debates by addressing a few specific questions: Did a lack of consumer protection cause the financial crisis? Who is likely to benefit from this present financial crisis, and who is likely to lose out? How can countries design appropriate formal coordination policy and mechanisms between their central governments and other relevant consumer regulatory agencies? The approaches recommended by the paperwork are built upon the premise that national governments cannot be effective in isolation, and ultimately depend on collaboration with other regulatory agencies to effectively fulfill their mandate of consumer protection, price transparency, economic and financial stability. Additionally, this paper reviews documentation and some relevant research, articles, proposals that relates on the one side regarding consumers in the evolving reform of the consumer protection regime after the global financial crisis and on the other side to help understand the how consumer protection watchdogs can best respond.
K29|Do privacy laws affect the location decisions of internet firms? evidence for privacy havens|This paper empirically studies the location decisions of internet firms when they face high legal standards of privacy protection. Many factors might influence them: technological spillovers, lower taxation, and so on. Internet firms can also arbitrate national differences and many of them actually locate their activity in order to escape from national laws they consider over-stringent. In the current stage of development of the internet – the so-called Web 2.0 – the ease of access to personal data proved to be strategic input. So the more a jurisdiction makes collecting and using these data easy, the more attractive the country is, if all other things remain constant. One way for a firm to avoid such legal restrictions is to locate or to expand its business in less privacy protective countries. Our empirical results support this 'no-privacy haven' hypothesis. In particular, we highlight a new privacy paradox according to which the more stringent certain online privacy laws are, the more they induce firms to locate their business in less stringent countries, and finally the weaker actual privacy protection on the internet is.
K29|Contemporary Economics Dilemma: High Ethics or More Extensive Governing?|The authors of the article point out that economic theory has failed to yield a solid theoretical background in critical situations such as the current financial and economic crisis and the transformation of post-communist economies. Mainly the present crisis opens the question of the unsatisfactory status of economic science. While classical liberal or Keynesian concepts are failing, theorists cannot look to mathematical modelling for help. It seems that traditional concepts malfunction, and the financial market is particularly predisposed for this process. The application of mathematical models is overvalued. The article calls attention to the possible influence and adequacy of regulatory attitudes on a return to equilibrium. It seems that the part of ethics must be upgraded decidedly. The challenge for today´s theoretical economists is to find a new paradigm of economic science for today´s global era.
K29|Cooperative identity and the law|This paper deals with the legal identity of cooperatives. It is divided into three parts. The first part discusses the role and function of law and of comparative legal research on the topic of cooperative identity (sec. 2). The second part focuses on cooperative identity within the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) Principles and the ICA Statement on the Cooperative Identity at large (sec. 3). The third part compares the ICA Statement on cooperative identity with the legal identity that several European jurisdictions assign to cooperatives (sec. 4). Conclusions follow.
K29|New Study Group on European Cooperative Law: �Principles� Project|This paper presents both a new scientific network named �Study Group on European Cooperative Law� (SGECOL), and the �Principles of European Cooperative Law� (PECOL) project, which SGECOL has identified as its first research activity. SGECOL is a European group of cooperative law scholars, established in Trento (Italy), at the European Research Institute on Cooperative and Social Enterprises (Euricse), in November 2011. SGECOL�s general objective is to conduct comparative research on cooperative law in Europe, thus promoting increased awareness and understanding of cooperative law within the legal, academic and governmental communities at national, European and international level. SGECOL intends to achieve this objective through various research initiatives on cooperative law, beginning with the drafting of PECOL. PECOL will take the form of legal provisions accompanied by explanatory comments. They will be developed on the basis of the existing cooperative law in Europe, focusing in particular on six European jurisdictions (Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK). PECOL, however, will not simply summarize and describe the common core of European national cooperative laws. Going beyond that, the project aims to present the main general provisions through which � in the authors� view � cooperative law should be formulated to provide cooperatives with a definite and distinct legal identity vis-a-vis other business organizations. The PECOL project does not serve a single specific purpose, still less is its goal to impose harmonization on national cooperative laws. PECOL will be a scientific and scholarly work, capable of serving many potential functions, depending on the users� particular needs.

Así, las empresas gestoras asociadas a GECOPI han desarrollado sus “normas de buenas prácticas empresariales”, dictadas en enero de 2005, en íntima relación con el “código deontológico de la asociación de empresas gestoras de Cooperativas de viviendas y proyectos inmobiliarios”. Se presenta y estudia especialmente el primer texto, que contiene el CDC de las empresas gestoras de cooperativas de viviendas, cuya importancia y aplicación práctica ya ha sido contrastada en el sector.
K29|Notwendigkeit der Ausschüttungssperre des § 268 Abs. 8 HGB: Eine empirische Untersuchung der Einzelabschlüsse der DAX 30 Unternehmen|Mit dem Bilanzrechtsmodernisierungsgesetz (BilMoG) hat der deutsche Gesetzgeber eine weitreichende Änderung des deutschen Handelsrechts vorgenommen. Zielsetzung ist die Stärkung der Informationsfunktion des handelsrechtlichen Jahresabschlusses. Um dieses Ziel zu erreichen, ist nunmehr die Aktivierung unsicherer bzw. nicht realisierter Posten in der Bilanz erlaubt. Dennoch ist die Ausschüttungsbemessung weiterhin eine zentrale Funktion der Handelsbilanz. Um dieser Funktion gerecht werden zu können, bleibt der Gläubigerschutzgedanke und damit vor allem das Vorsichtsprinzip ein grundlegender Bestandteil des deutschen Handelsrechts. Folglich wurde die Aktivierung dieser Posten mit einer Ausschüttungssperre belegt. Die Zielsetzung des vorliegenden Beitrags ist es zu untersuchen, inwieweit diese Sperre im Normalfall notwendig ist, um dem Vorsichtsprinzip Rechnung zu tragen. Die handelsrechtlichen Einzelabschlüsse der DAX 30 Unternehmen werden dahingehend untersucht.

Analyzing some of those solutions, we have endeavored to argument the opinion according to which, in the case of the spouses’ marital community termination, the spouse who is not a partner is entitled to a quota of the monetary rights afferent to the shares owned by the other spouse, if the contribution of the latter falls under the legal status of a marital community item.

K29|How viable are spanish credit cooperatives after recent bank capitalization and restructuring regulations?|Over the past three years, major reforms have been approved in Spain in order to restructure the banking sector. The purpose of these reforms has been to reinforce the solvency of credit institutions through recapitalization and integration into larger organizations. The credit cooperatives have not presented any solvency problems which would justify these measures being applied to them. The problem that the financial authorities see in their case is their limited size. As a result, the credit cooperatives are immersed in an integration process which is not revolving around the Banco Cooperativo Español (BCE) or the Spanish Association of Rural Savings Banks, as might be expected, but is taking place through mergers between individual institutions and the setting up of various cooperative groups. While the credit cooperatives have not been channelled into bankization (conversion into banks) like the savings banks, ways to become banks have been opened up to them.
K29|Standard minimi di qualità: un approccio teorico|At least since Akerlof (1970), asymmetric information in the case of experience goods has been a central issue in the economic literature. This paper studies regulation in markets where the quality of the experience good is never completely verifiable by consumers even after purchase. In the proposed model firms can decide the quality of the good: always producing a high quality good creates a positive externality in the market, but it causes an incentive to the firms to deviate and produce low quality goods. The main policy instrument for the government, in order to maximize Social Welfare, is to fix a minimum quality standard, but imposing a too high standard might, in some cases, lower the average quality of the good in the market.

K29|Capital formation in new cooperatives in China: policy and practice|This paper aims to fill one knowledge gap on understanding the issue of capital formation in new co-operatives in developing countries. By doing so, it presents the main findings of capital formation and investment in a small sample of horticulture shareholding co-operatives in rural China, because shareholding co-operatives, as one best example of new multi-stakeholder co-operatives in China, have become a vehicle to mobilize additional resources. To better understand shareholder co-operatives� stakeholder heterogeneity, two main groups of stakeholders are identified, namely, member stakeholders (investor-members and patron-members) and non-member stakeholders (non-member investors and non-member donors/grant-givers). Following a brief theoretical overview concerning co-operative multi-stakeholdership and capital acquisition and constraints, I then analyze both the rules-in-form and rules-in-use with respect to the co-operative stakeholders� capital involvement in China. Cases observed indicate a hybridization feature of the co-operative capital base, including member contributions, public subsidies, income from the market sale, institutional capital and social capital. There exist at least four ways to raise equity capital from co-operative members. External capital comes mostly from direct government support in the form of grants and project funding, and indirect financial support through preferential treatment and policies. Different from the situation in the West, debt capital does not appear to be a widely-used traditional financing source. New co-operatives in China have difficulty even in borrowing short-term debt, not to mention receiving long-term loans. Also specialized/non-traditional external capital sources such as those provided by co-operative banks do not suffice. Co-operative banks are not always ready to provide micro-credit to co-operatives. Only when the government plays an active role, this lending process is facilitated. Many innovative financial systems are also observed in the field, which facilitate the mobilization of more external capital for co-operatives.
K29|Incentivierung des Managements bei Unternehmenskäufen/Buy-Outs mit Private Equity Investoren - eine empirische Untersuchung|Since years, incentives for the management have become a standard upon acquisitions of companies by Private Equity Investors - so-called Buy-Outs. However, until this date there are no empirical studies available on the arrangements of management participations and potential conflicts of interest especially on occasion of sales from one Private Equity Investor to another - so-called Secondary Buy-Outs. This present study is based on a survey among Private Equity Investors and Management Teams in companies controlled by Private Equity Investors. It shows a high degree of sensibility of all parties concerned for the issue of incentives and the potential conflict of interest involved with it. It also showed that market standards for management incentives have developed in the meantime. In practice, the instrument to prevent conflicts is therefore the transparency of the transaction. The only way to prevent criminal and civil consequences (damages) for the managers involved, as well as obstructing or even frustrating the process as a whole, is an open and transparent communication about the selling process and possible concepts of incentives between all parties concerned, i.e. seller, buyer and the management involved. Despite the frequency of such transactions there are - until today - no market standards or guide lines for this necessary transparency. The present study intends to create initial groundwork for this.
K29|Alternative Dispute Resolution through Mediation in Romanian Retail Banking|This article aims at exploring the stage of implementation of mediation as method for the alternative resolution of disputes among consumers and providers of banking services, in Romania. The importance of the topic stems from the increase in the number of customer complaints about banking services in Romania and from the current preoccupation at European level to identify extra-judicial methods for consumer disputes. The main objectives of the research consist in studying: the regulatory framework relative to mediation at the European Union level; the mediation schemes focused on banking services, in the Member States; the present regulatory framework relative to mediation in Romania; the existing mediation schemes and their development level on the Romanian banking service market. The research method applied has an exploratory character. The conclusions clarify the present state of mediation related to banking service disputes in Romania. Within this framework, the recommendations refer, among other aspects, to the organization of a further research phase that may contribute to the substantiation of future decisions aiming to enhance the protection of the rights and interests of consumers.
K29|Does Tort Law Reform Help or Hurt Consumers?| Legal limits on insurance damage claims have been introduced in Australia, the United States and other jurisdictions. In this article, I construct a simple competitive model to analyse the effect of tort law reforms on consumers. The model shows that reforms to limit non-economic losses make consumers unambiguously worse off ex ante. Although insurance premiums fall and these reductions are passed on to consumers in full, this gain is more than offset by the increased risk that consumers are forced to bear. In contrast, reforms for income‐related (i.e. economic) losses lead to ambiguous outcomes. The potential benefits from limits to economic loss arise due to the inability of insurers to price discriminate on the basis of income or expected loss. Because of this, there is an implicit cross subsidy from low‐ to high‐income consumers that is embedded in the insurance premium and relevant product price. Tort law reforms partially unwind this cross subsidy. The results presented in this article show that tort law reforms may achieve their stated goal, such as lowering monetary prices, but can still make consumers worse off by introducing an uninsurable risk. There is also an important difference between reforms that limit claims for economic and non‐economic losses. Insurance for economic loss will generally include an implicit cross subsidy and, as a consequence, reforms can alter the ex ante utility for different groups of consumers in different ways.
K29|Political Connectedness and Firm Performance: Evidence from Germany| This paper investigates politically connected firms in Germany. With the introduction of a new transparency law in 2007, information on additional income sources for all members of the German parliament became publicly available. We find that members of the conservative party (CDU&sol;CSU) and the liberal party (FDP) are more likely to work for firms than members of left-wing parties (SPD and The Left) or the green party (Alliance 90&sol;The Greens). Politically connected firms are larger, less risky and have lower market valuations than unconnected firms. They also have fewer growth opportunities, but slightly better accounting performance. On the stock market, connected firms significantly outperformed unconnected firms in 2006, i.e. before the publication of the data on political connections. Differences in stock market performance were much smaller in 2007. Copyright 2010 The Authors. German Economic Review 2010 Verein für Socialpolitik.
K29|Legal and Economic Analysis of the Czech Export Policy|In their article the authors deal with the sensitive issue of export subsidies. This topic is examined from the legal and economic point of view. The first part of the article will deal with legal regulation of international trade and export subsidies in the international public law. Main focus will be put on WTO regulation and agreements and understandings negotiated within the framework of the OECD. The second part of the article will focus on regulation of exports subsidies and export credits in the EU law. The forth part will examine the extent to which the Czech law has taken use from the legal framework given by both international and European Union law. And finally, the last part of the article will examine the economic aspects of export subsidies and the efficiency of the financial resources invested into this area of the Czech foreign trade.
K29|Working Paper 09-10 - Shifting of red tape? The impact of authority behavior on tax compliance costs|The compliance costs of private taxpayers are not only affected by the tax law itself but also by its implementation through the tax authorities. In the following paper we analyze the effect of administrative actions on the compliance costs of private businesses. We demonstrate in a theoretical model that compliance costs may partially be interpreted as externalities of authority behavior. As a result we expect a ”shifting” of administrative cost burdens from the tax administration to private taxpayers, what implies an economically inefficient outcome. Based on Belgian survey data, we find empirical evidence for the elucidated relationship. We give an quantitative estimate for the accordant effects and demonstrate, which activities of the administration are the most important cost drivers. Furthermore, we find empirical support that the effect of administrative issues is independent from the impact of the tax law itself.
K29|Droit et gouvernance:l’apport du courant comportemental|Dans le cadre de l’approche dominante de la gouvernance, le rôle du droit est d’aider à réduire les conséquences des conflits d’intérêts et des comportements stratégiques intentionnels des différents acteurs, notamment des dirigeants. Les décisions des dirigeants préjudiciables aux actionnaires et aux autres parties prenantes ne relèvent cependant pas toutes d’un comportement volontaire. Certaines résultent d’erreurs de jugement, de biais cognitifs et comportementaux. Sur la base du courant Behavioral Law and Economics qui s’est fortement développé aux Etats-Unis, l’objectif de l’article est de montrer que le rôle du droit à l’intérieur du système de gouvernance est également de contribuer à « débiaiser » les décisions ou à corriger les conséquences défavorables de ces biais.
K29|Trop de transparence tue la transparence|Chaque crise financière est accompagnée de son cortège de plaignants qui réclament toujours plus d'information, de transparence et de contrôle. En 1987, les accusés étaient les gérants de portefeuilles et les programmes informatiques. Les années 90 et 2000 ont vu successivement les crises être portées au débit des nations (Russie, Thaïlande, Argentine...), des dirigeants de start-up aux projets flous et obscurs, des administrateurs et des auditeurs (Enron et Worldcom), des normalisateurs comptables et des ingénieurs financiers (crise des subprimes). A chaque fois, les firmes sont incitées ou obligées à communiquer de plus en plus souvent, d'offrir plus de détails dans des rapports de plus en plus longs. A chaque nouvelle sortie de crise, le flot d'information en provenance des firmes et à destination des investisseurs, déposants, régulateurs s'accroît significativement.

K29|Contractual Freedom and its Limitations|Parties’ freedom of will is expressed through the following three principles: 1. contractual freedom; 2. the binding power of the contract; and 3. the relativity of the contract’s effects. The parties are free to contract or not, to choose the other contracting party and to determine the content of the contractual clauses. The principle of mutual consent appears as a corollary of the freedom of will principle. According to this principle, the parties’ simple manifestation of will is sufficient to form a valid contract.
K29|Particularities Arising from the Activity of the Romanian Constitutional Court on Legal Status of the Right of Property|In time, the legal status of the property had a distinct physiognomy, whether it was public or private. Such a situation was noted into the practice of the Constitutional Court of Romania when arrised the question about recovery of property which belonged to the former king of Romania. On this occasion public property was bordered by private property, on the one hand, and by the assets of the Crown, on the other side, and concluded that the former sovereign of Romania may regain only the assets that are being subject of private property.
K29|DREPTUL PARLAMENTAR, COMPONENTA A DEMOCRATIEI (Romanian version)|The modern state that emerged following the Peace of Westphalia has generated the development of political institutions in which to express the will of citizens and political parties. Parliament is an institution with a fundamental role in any democratic society, along with the institution of the head of state, government and judiciary organization. This article shows how it appeared for the first time, the institution of parliament, its constitution and composition (in different periods of development of society, from the appointment, continuing with the census and to universal suffrage). It also done a comparative analysis of unicameralism with bicameralism, presenting the advantages and disadvantages that each of these modes of existence of the institution of parliament implies. It is presented the political structure of parliament and it is insisted on the functions that Parliament has on the proper functioning of a state in good governance of public affairs, in representing citizens in the control of how the executive exercises the power.
K29|ABUZUL DE DREPT INTRE TRADITII SI PERSPECTIVE - LAW ABUSE BETWEEN TRADITION AND PERSPECTIVES (Romanian version)|One aphorism that aspires to eternity is the one stating that qui suo iure utitur neminem laedit. In time it has been invoked in different ways: while the absolute rights advocates have interpreted it in its formal aspect, focusing on the omnipotence of individual rights, the promoters of the relative rights have argued that one’s rights end where another's rights begin, so that the individuals with excessive exercising of their right commit an abuse of law. As for the explanation of its sanction, the classical theory treats it as liability in tort, based on moral conduct censorship. Meanwhile, more and more legal assumptions on it have been detached from guilt. The Romanian New Civil Code incorporates part of these trends, considering guilt as a basis for civil liability. This study aims to critically examine legal solutions advanced by the new regulation, trying to explain the sanction of abuse of rights from other perspectives, different from the imperative of sanctioning the guilty conduct of the holder.
K29|Trading Partners are in Conflict. Mediation, Arbitration, Court – the Current Settlement Possibilities|Integration issues in the contemporary world are a current concern of anyone who tends to the evolution of social, professional and beyond. As our business, Romans followed with interest the European integration and integration in the contemporary world, but from different perspectives, depending on various factors. Acts and deeds of trade are subject written or unwritten rules and pursue counterparties each first meeting his rights. This sometimes generates violating the rights of others and/ or failure of the legal obligations assumed made with the commercial legal relationship. A dispute and restore legality are possible so amicably and by resorting to a competent authority. Such authority may be the court or court of arbitration. By regulation of the mediator, has become a new authority in resolving a conflict competence including commercial. Mediation procedure seems to be a fast, less expensive and elegance of a dispute between partners. We consider the efficiency comparison in this paper the possibilities for settlement of conflicts between partners. The novelty of this work lies in the fact that until now have never been studied versus all three ways of solving disputes.
K29|Joint Ventures – An Alternative and Efficient Form of Economic Organisation|The joint ventures are now a quite often used form of organization for some economic activities, which make them mutually beneficial. They are based on the joint venture contract. This form of organization does not require registration and association formalities, detemines no new legal person, being a flexible contract, negotiated and agreed by the parts of the contract. These parts (individuals / entities) may estabish any kind of rules to determine their mutual rights and obligations. The size of the benefit or the loss that are generated of the outgoing of the joint activity is determined in percentage or due to the contribution of each partner in this contract.
K29|Contentious Constitutional And Contentious Administrative|The requirements of the State based on the rule of law, enshrined by Article 1 paragraph (3) first sentence of the Constitution, concern the major goals of state activity, foreshadowed in what is commonly called as being the rule of law, expression that implies subordination of the State to the law, ensuring those means that would allow the law to censor political actions and, within this framework, to ponder possible abusive, discretionary tendencies, of State structures. The rule of law ensures the supremacy of the Constitution, correlation of laws and of all legislative acts with the Constitution, the assurance of the regime of separation of public powers, which must act within the law, meaning within the limits of a law expressing the general will. The State based on the rule of law becomes so, the State that aims to ensure the supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law. Supremacy of the Constitution and compliance of the laws with the Basic Law is ensured through the jurisdictional review of the constitutionality of laws, by a separate authority, independent of all others, and which is regulated by the Basic Law. This authority is the contentious constitutional court, which contributes to the strengthening of the rule of law materialized in the decisions rendered within the review of constitutionality of laws before promulgation, as well as in those rendered within the a posterior review, on certain provisions contained also in laws on contentious administrative. The Contentious Administrative, being one of the fundamental institutions of public law, over time, has had different regulations regarding both formal matters (authorities called to solve disputes of this type) and material matters (categories of disputes covered by this contentious), being several times subject to constitutional review. Thus, the Contentious Administrative has a scope clearly defined by law. This legal regulation is subject to the will of the legislator and to the review of constitutionality, in both its modalities of expression. In this way, the competent judicial authorities and the Constitutional Court have competences in ensuring the rule of law, the functioning of democracy and in guaranteeing the exercise of human rights.

K29|The Convergence Of Industrial Property Rights|As regards the performance required for the development of the knowledge-based society, we view industrial property as an important level in this context. Therefore, in this paper we present (on a comparative basis) the system of industrial property rights and their protection in the European Union, the United States of America and Romania. At the same time, we analyse aspects of institutional, legislative and functional convergence/divergence of industrial property rights. The approach to these aspects is made on a correlative basis and deals with the interdependence of the industrial property field and the RDI field.
K29|Industrial Property As A Stimulator Of Scientific Creation And Innovation|In modern times, when progress is made through knowledge and knowledge is predominantly produced/used, industrial property rights, their protection and related specialized institutions play a stimulating role. Therefore, this paper presents first the requirements for stimulating scientific and technological creation and innovation in the European Research Area, in close relation to industrial property rights. In this context, we assess the size of scientific research and innovation in Romania in relation to industrial property rights. Considering the requirements for stimulating scientific and technological creation and innovation, we deal with issues on adapting and maintaining dynamism in law and institutional regulations, in order to achieve convergence, in general, and convergence in the industrial property field, in particular.
K29|M&A im Bereich Erneuerbarer Energien|Several top deals already closed, a still highly fragmented industry and strong pressure for further consolidation following the financial crisis - renewable energy certainly has become a red-hot topic in M&A. Surveying 220 companies in the solar photovoltaic, utility and financial sector as well as major technology corporations, which are identified as the key industries in the sector-specific takeover market, this working paper proves the common knowledge for the example of photovoltaics. With more than 93% of the respondents, a vast majority expects the M&A environment to further ameliorate and deals to increase. As for the fundamental market drivers, the survey suggests a shift from factors linked to the financial crises towards an increasing impact of general industry-related influences. In contrast, neither the industry sector nor other corporate characteristics are of significant importance. With respect to prevailing takeover strategies, the survey reveals a strong influence of general acquisition motives. However, an empirically significant connection can be determined between the industry sector of potential buyers and the most relevant motivation factors, which allows for the assumption of business-affected takeover strategies that are elaborated on more closely within the working paper. Examining an acquisition focus in terms of the targets' position in the photovoltaic value chain, no statistically valid connection can be observed with either the acquisition motivation or the industry sector of the potential buyer, leaving room for further research.
K29|The Corporate Governance of Privately Controlled Brazilian Firms|We provide an overview of the corporate governance practices of Brazilian public companies, based primarily on an extensive 2005 survey of 116 companies. We focus on the 88 responding Brazilian private firms which are not majority owned by the state or a foreign company. We identify areas where Brazilian corporate governance is relatively strong and weak. Board independence is an area of weakness: The boards of most Brazilian private firms are comprised entirely or almost entirely of insiders or representatives of the controlling family or group. Many firms have zero independent directors. At the same time, minority shareholders have legal rights to representation on the boards of many firms, and this representation is reasonably common. Financial disclosure lags behind world standards. Only a minority of firms provide a statement of cash flows or consolidated financial statements. However, many provide English language financial statements, and an English language version of their website. Audit committees are uncommon, but many Brazilian firms use an alternate approach to ensuring financial statement accuracy – establishing a fiscal board. A minority of firms provide takeout rights to minority shareholders on a sale of control. Controlling shareholders often use shareholders agreements to ensure control.
K29|Implications of the Law in Doing Business in the Czech Republic and Romania|The paper deals with investigations of regulations that enhance business activity. Business activity should be without any impediments along to the current economic approach. Index of Economic Freedom from The Heritage Foundation and Ease of Doing Business from The World Bank are used for this analysis. The Index of Economic Freedom contains 10 areas of economic activity in which freedom may be enlarged or constrained. Ease of Doing Business presents 10 quantitative indicators on business regulations and the protection of property rights. Goal of this paper is to show the main barriers constrained business activity in the Czech Republic and Romania and the main differences between these two countries.
K29|Patent laws and innovation in China|This paper explores whether the patent laws and intellectual property rights (IPR) system in China have resulted in innovation during the reform period. Subject to criticism on account of imperfect enforcement, the patent law system has produced a stock of patents which has grown rapidly alongside economic growth. The success rate of patent applications is similar across the country despite the considerable regional disparities in income and in the level of innovation. This paper presents a simple model of patent production in China derived from the patent law system that also considers the relevant contextual factors that could influence innovation. The main innovation input of R&D personnel is found to be a significant determinant of patents. While per capita GDP increases the propensity to innovate across all regions, notable heterogeneity exists whereby the coastal, central and interior areas are associated with different factors that produce innovation and influence the innovation process. The paper concludes that China's imperfect IPR system is nevertheless generating innovation as the country develops and hinges on the key factor of researchers.

K29|La función del órgano de control de una sociedad cooperativa europea domiciliada en España<BR>[The role of the authority of control of a european cooperative society home in Spain]|Como es sabido, el Estatuto jurídico contenido en el Reglamento (CE) 1435/2003 sobre la Sociedad Cooperativa Europea (SCE), fiel a su precedente y modelo, el Reglamento 2157/2001 sobre la Sociedad Europea, ha incorporado la posibilidad de que la SCE, vía estatutaria, pueda optar entre dos modelos de administración: el monista o el dual, este último, prácticamente desconocido en nuestro derecho cooperativo nacional. Precisamente, en tanto el sistema monista es conocido por todos y ha sido objeto de múltiples y meritorios trabajos por parte de nuestra doctrina, hemos considerado conveniente como objeto de esta investigación, centrarnos en el órgano de control (o vigilancia), en tanto es en él donde reside la verdadera “seña de identidad” de este sistema dual, para nosotros novedoso, de organización de la administración. No obstante, abordar la totalidad de su régimen jurídico excedería con mucho el objetivo de estas jornadas. Así, nos limitaremos, en esencia, a realizar una aproximación analítica y, en ocasiones, crítica, a las funciones que este órgano desempeña en el seno de la administración de una SCE domiciliada en España y a la relación que le vincula con el otro órgano administrativo, el encargado de la efectiva administración de la sociedad (el denominado “órgano de dirección” o, simplemente, “dirección”). No pocas dificultades vamos a tener que afrontar en esta tarea, relacionadas casi todas ellas con los problemas interpretativos y de adaptación de un derecho cooperativo como el español al exiguo régimen que ha dibujado el legislador comunitario y que va a resultar necesario integrar –con la normativa ya existente- y, en ocasiones, completar, mediante la articulación de aquellas disposiciones específicas que resulten necesarias para adaptar nuestra normativa a la nueva figura y, concretamente, al nuevo sistema dual de administración.
K29|Transaktionen und Servicing in der Finanzkrise: Berichte und Referate des Frankfurt School NPL Forums 2008|The report describes the current developments of the German market for Non Performing Loans/Distressed Debt as it is influenced by the financial crisis/credit crunch. Furthermore the sale of (small and medium sized) real estate portfolios since summer 2007 is analysed in more detail.
K29|Konstruktion einer Anleihe mit hypothekarischer Besicherung|This work describes the legal structuring of a mortgage covered bond in accordance with the regulations of paragraphs 791 cont. and 1184 cont. German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch). The work shows how to structure the share of common rights of the bond holders according to the regulations of the German Statue Governing Common Rights of Owners of Debt Securities (Schuldverschreibungsgesetz). Furthermore, the work describes how the bond creditors shall have preferences of the mortgages in case of default of the bond and how mortgages shall be limited through lending limit in relation to the market value decline of the real estate building. The market value determination will follow the regulations of paragraph 192 cont. German Building Act (Baugesetzbuch) in connection to the German Value Determining Regulations (Wertermittlungsverordnung). The legal aspects are embodied and tightened in the bond terms which are included in the work. The paper also points out which minimum information of the mortgage covered bond in a prospectus is required. The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesaufsichtsamt für Finanzdienstleistungen) scrutinises the prospectus for admission to public offering according to the regulations of the German securities prospectus act (Wertpapierprospektgesetz). Finally, the usability of a recovery rating which measures the probability of default of the mortgages is discussed in the paper.
K29|"Whistle-Blowing heißt nicht: ""verpfeifen"" - Ordonomische Überlegungen zur Korruptionsprävention durch und in Unternehmen"|Der vorliegende Beitrag skizziert ein ordonomisches Diskussionsangebot zur Korruptionsprävention durch und in Unternehmen. Hierzu nimmt er sowohl eine wirtschaftsethische (Korruptionsprävention durch Unternehmen) als auch unternehmensethische Perspektive ein (Korruptionsprävention in Unternehmen). Die Ordonomik zeigt in beiden Fällen, dass Unternehmen durch funktionale Bindungen einen wichtigen Beitrag zur Überwindung des Korruptionsproblems leisten können. Allerdings droht die Etablierung solcher funktionaler Bindungen oftmals daran zu scheitern, dass dysfunktionale Semantiken eine konstruktive Problemwahrnehmung erschweren. Wie insbesondere am Beispiel des Whistle-Blowing illustriert wird, bedarf es hier semantischer Aufklärung. In diesem Sinne lassen sich komplexe Probleme wie das der Korruption nur dann umfassend adressieren, wenn die Problemlösung auf der Ebene der Sozialstruktur und auf der Ebene der Semantik ansetzt. Es geht um Lernprozesse, die Innovation und gesellschaftliche Weiterentwicklung sowohl im Bereich der Institutionen als auch im Bereich der Ideen voranbringen.
K29|Blockholdings and corporate governance in the EU banking sector|Ownership structures widely differ across the EU. While large blockholdings dominate in the banking sector in Continental Europe, ownership is widely dispersed in the United Kingdom. These differences have consequences for corporate governance in the EU banking sector. This paper analyzes the efficiency of shareholder control and hostile takeovers as corporate governance mechanisms in the EU banking sector against the background of the regulatory environment and differences in the ownership structure of banks. Particular attention is put on current trends in the ownership structure of banks (e. g. sovereign wealth funds). The paper is based on a new dataset on shareholdings in listed banks in the EU banking sector. The results indicate that EU regulations have not always improved corporate governance in the banking sector. While shareholder control has been improved by a better protection of minority shareholder rights, the efficiency of the takeover market has been reduced in Continental Europe.
K29|Religion, Social Capital, and Business Bankruptcy in the United States, 1921-1932|We consider the value of social capital that derives from membership in a church. American states with larger churchgoing populations had lower business bankruptcy rates from 1921 to 1932, and states in which the churchgoing population was concentrated in few churches had business bankruptcy rates that were lower still. Both voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy were lower in states with higher church membership. The evidence suggests that church membership acted on bankruptcy through a safety net mechanism and not solely through indicating a preference for honoring commitment.
K29|WHAT DETERMINES THE “LEGAL” QUALITY Of BANK REGULATION AND SUPERVISION?|This article has two contributions. First, using the methodology of Neyapti and Dincer, it provides measures of legal quality of bank regulation and supervision (RS) for a new set of developed and less‐developed countries. Second, it investigates the determinants of RS in view of the hypothesis that the existing institutional environment matters for the quality of formal institutions such as banking laws. The empirical evidence in this article demonstrates that past financial crises and prevailing levels of both financial market development and foreign direct investment inflows affect RS beyond and above the effects of other potential factors, such as macroeconomic performance and good governance. Evidence from transition economies also supports these findings. (JEL E44, G2, K29, O1)
K29|Los procesos concursales en sociedades cooperativas. Especificidades en la información económico-financiera|The Law 22/2003, of July 9, Bankruptcy, has filled a need for bankruptcy reform legislation widely defendant in our country, motivated by the archaic and dispersal of the previous rules. The core budget of the new legislation, which eliminates the duality of treatment based on the legal nature of the debtor, is based on the concept of insolvency, understood as the state property that does not allow the debtor regularly meet their obligations. In assessing the creditworthiness business plays a vital role the economic and financial information transmitted through the financial statements, which presents certain specificities in the case of cooperative societies derived, among others, including their financial structure. This paper examines the impact that in bankruptcy situations have some substantive aspects of the cooperative from a financial point of view, as the nature of their own funds or accounting qualification of social capital.
K29|French Legislation And The Development Of Credit Availability For Microenterprise|The failures of the socialist model, evidenced by high unemployment, have led France to reorient itself towards more enterprise creation. These entrepreneurial ventures require financing. However, bankers do not want to assume the high risk of newly created enterprises. Moreover, small entrepreneurs who do manage to get financing may find themselves rationed at the margin if the rate of credit is capped by the legislature. Concurrently, the growth of microfinance in the world has shown that innovative techniques can increase credit availability, without unduly high risk. However, such increased credit availability may not materialize if credit rates are capped by usury laws, as it was in France. This paper traces out a number of legislative changes that took place in France in the last five years, focusing especially on usury laws and other barriers to credit. It places these legislative changes in a perspective of Western Europeâ€™s socialist model, comparing legislation on credit and usury in a number of developed countries. It also examines if these legislative changes have been accompanied by the desired impact. Finally, it examines alternative future legislative evolution possibilities.
K29|Reinforcing the Commission's Power in the Communications Sector. An Issue for the Regulatory Framework Review|The reform of the regulatory framework for electronic communications is in progress. One of its major issue could be an institutional one, as the European Commission announced its intention to reinforce its own power, in particular in order to supervise the remedies imposed by national regulators to the dominant operators. Highlighting the importance of the objective of consolidation of the Internal Market, this article examines the case for this reinforcement and analyzes the institutional architecture which endorses it. Even if the proposal to create a European Electronic Communications Authority constitutes an event, the issue of the reinforcement of the Commissions's power should not be considered in the sole light of this project which could be rejected or amended.
K29|Bankruptcy law: a mechanism of governance for financially distressed firms|This paper explores the various governance models for financially distressed firms. We offer a new typology of major bankruptcy models and provide a connection between this bankruptcy law puzzle and the variables depicting the governance of healthy firms in order to shed light on two topics: (1) the factors that the lawyer should consider before removing its national bankruptcy law, and (2) the risks associated with each bankruptcy model according to the economic literature on bankruptcy law. Our final aim is to test whether the various bankruptcy models detailed in the paper perform in separate economic and legal environments.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

K29|Schaeffler KG/ Continental AG im Lichte der CSX Corp.-Entscheidung des US District Court for the Southern District of New York: Meldepflichten bei öffentlichen Übernahmen und deren Umgehung durch Einsatz von derivativen Finanzinstrumenten|This report analyses the possibility to outflank disclosure obligations under the German Securities Trading Act as well as the German Takeover Act by using derivative instruments in the context of the attack of Schaeffler KG on Continental AG. Irrespective of a limited knowledge of the complete facts it comes to the conclusion that, under certain conditions, there are good reasons to assume violations of legal obligations that would entitle the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority to fix hefty fines but not to prohibit the offer.
K29|Aktionärsschutz in der AG falsch verstanden? Die Leica-Entscheidung des LG Frankfurt am Main|This article analyses the recent Leica judgement of the Higher Regional Court Frankfurt/Main and its consequences. In this judgement, the court has established an infringement of special formal requirements with respect to Leica´s invitation to the Annual General Meeting which, if correct, would bear dire consequences for a variety of listed companies, even in DAX. On the other hand, there is a recent decision of the Higher Regional Court Munich in a similar case concerning Hypovereinsbank, coming to the opposite conclusion. Besides the fact that, in the opinion of the authors, the Leica decision not only is legally unfounded and based on a completely unbalanced evaluation of formalistic requirements, it again proves the formalistic approach of German stock corporation law and leaves companies, especially with a respective regulation in their articles of association, their advisors and investors in a situation of uncertainty that has to be clarified urgently by the legislator.
K29|Private Equity und Familienunternehmen: eine Untersuchung unter besonderer Berücksichtigung deutscher Maschinen- und Anlagenbauunternehmen|Despite the common view that there is inherently a relationship of confliction, it is now impossible to imagine the financing of family-owned enterprises in Germany without the alternative method of Private Equity financing. Based on a survey on Private Equity in family owned companies specialising in the mechanical engineering sector, this working paper identifies that Private Equity in general is not as unwanted as once assumed. Overall more than 3/4 of the surveyed companies do not exclude investment capital. However, the study demonstrates that the time of large buy-outs is arguably up, and minority capital has now come into vogue. This working paper examines, from the viewpoint of the managing directors of the studied companies, the conceptions and beliefs held by such persons about Private Equity. Generally speaking, besides loss of control, managing directors primarily fear Private Equity because of exaggerated returns on investment at the expense of the long-term development of the company. On the other hand, this paper also highlights that managing directors expect that Private Equity can have a positive element as it can enable bank independence, especially at a time when it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain creditworthiness. Further, this paper analyses the relationship between the managing director of the family enterprise and the Private Equity investor. Because of the special situation of the managing director in a family owned company, trust between that person and the Private Equity investor is one of the most important factors. If there is a lack of trust the business relation is troubled from the start.
K29|10 Jahre deutsche Buyouts|Private equity has seen an impressive activity surge in Germany over the last ten years. This working paper meets the increasing thirst for information on the German buyout market with an overview of its historic development, a quantitative analysis of its performance and a future outlook. While the authors' findings show an outperformance of buyout-financed businesses with regard to sales growth on CAGR basis, profitability growth and capex expansion, significant underperformance in terms of interest coverage levels and equity funding becomes apparent. This is in contrast to studies conducted by private equity associations and consultancies, and gives some validity to the growing fear of target company collapses as a result of riskier financing at the next economic downturn. As far as activity is concerned, the authors project only a short time-out for private equity in the wake of the ongoing credit crisis. The majority of German buyouts are middle market transactions which are fairly unaffected by the crisis and continue to offer great hidden potential. Investor returns are likely to fall in the short and midterm due to higher interest rates and risk premiums but more restrictive financing, in turn, will also lower entry prices. If private equity groups can outbid strategic players at moderate levels going forward, returns should continue to be attractive.

K29|How Should the Scope and Content of Marketing Law Courses be Determined?|For a long time there have been marketing law or similarly named courses in business school programs in the USA, which are designed to give marketing students the legal knowledge they need. Collaborative studies by scholars, professional institutions and marketing professionals resulted in workshop reports and discussions regarding the courses, their textbooks and content. These reports have been published and presented to the public. Despite the fact that thereis a similar course named marketing legislation in Turkish vocational schools, studies or discussions on the course content are not widely available. This article proposes that collaborative studies and analyses about this course will result improved education.
K29|The Implementation of Competition Law in the Air Transport Sector|The competition rules areapplied in the transportation sector in European Union due to the fact that liberalization process has started. The competition law is applied in order to support the liberalization process. As a result of the liberalization, a free and honest competition has increased between airline companies. Similarly, the liberalization process in the air transportation sector has also started in Turkey. Because of liberalization, the competition has increased. Therefore, the competition law has become a current issue in Turkey. The aim of this study is to analyze Competition law rules that is implemented in air transportation both in European Union and Turkey and to determine differences and similarities.
K29|Droit, architecture financière et stratégies des banques|The legal origin influences the development of the financial system which impacts on the long run economic growth. So, we would like to conclude on the superiority of a special legal tradition or the bank based/market based system. However, the architecture of the financial system is neutral. It is rather the level of development of the financial sector that determines economic growth. Then, banks showed their capacity to react to the institutional changes through the multiplication of their activities and the choice of new debt contracts. Finally, common law, which a priori supports the development of the capital markets, generates nevertheless a legal risk related to the unpredictability of courts? decisions and some difficulties of harmonization due to a decentralized production of the law.

K29|Clasificación del capital social de la sociedad cooperativa: una visión crítica|The reform of international accounting standards, as a consequence of the process of harmonization of European accounting systems, involves significant changes to the financial instruments that affect all types of enterprises. Both the equity and liabilities of cooperatives, added to the impact of their very definition, should be considered in the light of the specific characteristics of their application in participating companies. An important debate arose when share capital was first considered as an instrument of debt in IAS32, which was developed in the IFRIC2 interpretation, although this was later questioned in the draft of amendments to IAS32 by the IASB. Reform in Spain seems to ignore this controversy. The aim of this article is to provide a critical yet constructive approach with alternative proposals for the classification and accounting of share capital in cooperatives, reviewing opinions that go against the initial proposals of international standards and the Spanish solution.
K29|The role of the external auditor in bank regulation and supervision: A comparative analysis between the UK, Germany, Italy and the US|This comparative analysis discusses the differences between the structure and systems of bank regulation operating in the UK, Germany, Italy and the US. The importance of harmonisation in achieving stated supervisory objectives is also emphasised. The main objective of this chapter is to illustrate how the external auditor's role could be harnessed more efficiently in the UK banking regulatory and supervisory process. This is of particular importance given the reduced supervisory role which the Bank of England has assumed since banking regulatory and supervisory powers and functions were transferred to the Financial Services Authority. External audits and in particular external auditors, have a greater role to play in bank regulation and supervision than was the case over 20 years ago. This is so mainly as a result of globalisation. The need for a single regulator which regulates not just the banking sector, but also the insurance and securities sectors, has arisen principally because of the rise of conglomerate firms. Single regulators are able to manage more effectively cross sector services' risks. Correspondingly, the functional overlaps between banking, insurance and securities business and their universal scope make it more difficult for a regulator to observe and comprehend such businesses. The difficulty of measuring and assessing risk within such institutions along with the speed with which assets can be adjusted in derivatives markets has led to more emphasis being placed on internal managerial control. Consideration is also being given to the structures that can be put in place to re inforce the incentives of all parties involved – not just to management but all parties including auditors and regulators. Because banking has evolved to a stage where conglomerates now have a significant presence and provide a range of services (and not just banking services), and because of the growing presence of international firms, the role of the external auditor has become so important.
K29|The Strength of Weak Cooperation:an Attempt to Understand the Meaning of Web 2.0|This paper examines some continuities and ruptures in the use of Web 2.0 such as blogs, social media, user-generated content services etc. vis-à-vis earlier web services. We hypothesize that one of the sociological characteristics of Web 2.0 services is that making personal production public creates a new articulation between individualism and solidarity, which reveals the strength of weak cooperation. Web 2.0 services allow individual contributors to experience cooperation ex post. The strength of the weak cooperation arises from the fact that it is not necessary for individuals to have an ex ante cooperative action plan or altruistic intention. They discover cooperative opportunities only by making public their individual production. The paper illustrates this phenomenon by analysing the uses of different services and by looking at the new process of innovation that appears through Barcamp and Coworking spaces.

Web 2.0 is, in fact, a ""revolutionary evolution."" Technically speaking, Web 2.0 is a ""simple"" evolution because it is not a technical ""breakthrough,"" as it is essentially based on an aggregation of existing technologies. However, the impact of Web 2.0 is such that it can actually be described as an evolution that will shake our sociological, economic and legal bases. This paper addresses the legal aspects of Web 2.0 and tries to explain that while Web 2.0 is not a lawless domain, it is highly likely to create a legal tsunami."
K29|Causes Of Bankruptcy In Europe And Croatia|Bankruptcy is an interesting object of research, being habitually perceived as a shocking and scandalous event, tarnishing management reputation, stigmatizing its owners, and regularly leading to a dishonourable death of the company, leaving outstanding debts in legacy. Its interdisciplinary character makes it even more challenging and extends the reasons for researching it in depth. Apart from these motives, recently a number of researchers significantly contributed to this field, and some of them will be presented in this paper. On its way to becoming a member of the EU, the Croatian economy (and society in general) extensively compares its characteristics with the existing members. Since Croatian bankruptcy law is for the most part transferred from the corresponding German Insolvenzordnung (Insolvency law), German experiences in this field are especially interesting for Croatian bankruptcy researchers. Even though being a part of the EU, the United Kingdom’s Anglo-Saxon legislative theory and practice is relatively different from those of mainland Europe, therefore making it attractive for comparison. This triangle of country-specific bankruptcy features, where Germany and the United Kingdom embody rich diversity of the European Union, and Croatia symbolizes new member states (although not yet being a constituent) with their particular transition traits, is fit into Ooghe and Waeyaert’s (2004) universal, conceptual failure model. Thus, first presented will be a general bankruptcy cause model. Ooghe and De Prijcker (2006) presented four main types of failure processes. Their findings of bankruptcy causes are based on a case study of bankrupt Belgian companies but can be generalized as universal bankruptcy causes. They are examined in the second section. According to this model country-specific (the United Kingdom, Germany and Croatia) insolvency causes will be studied. Euler Hermes Kreditversicherung and the Center for Insolvency and Reorganization at the University of Mannheim published in November 2006 a comprehensive study of bankruptcy causes. This research and its results are exhibited in the third section, as well as an overview of the less recent Wieselhuber & Partner (2003) study of the insolvency causes and success factors of reorganization from the insolvency. At the same time the Euler Hermes and the Center for Insolvency and Reorganization study was being finalized, unacquainted with it, a somewhat similar research was being conducted in Croatia. Our research of bankruptcy causes in Croatia is presented in the fourth section. Finally, the concluding remarks will summarize the main findings of this paper.

K29|Executive Managers in Peru's Family Businesses|As in many other developing countries, family businesses are major players in the Peruvian economy. Despite their growth into large-scale groups spanning a wide range of businesses, the owner families still have strong control over their ownership and management. However, Peru's liberal economic reforms in the 1990s brought intense competition into the national market. Not only have these family businesses been forced to compete against large-scale foreign capital that entered the national market through the privatization of state enterprises, but also against cheap goods imported from foreign countries. In order to compete, family businesses have had to move beyond the limited human resources available within the family. The advancement within owner families of new generations with better education and training together with the promotion to top managerial positions of professional salaried managers from outside the family are some of the measures owner families are taking to overcome their human resource limitations.
K29|Which Institutions Are More Relevant Than Others in Inequality Mitigation?|The paper estimates the respective contributions of legal, economic, political and social institutions on inequalities within countries across the globe, while using various measures of openness and trade policy as our control group. The results suggest that institutions have significant effects on inequality. Among legal institutions, rule of law and control for corruption have a stronger impact on inequality than voice and accountability. Though we find that countries which practice democracy are less prone to unequal outcomes, we also find that autocratic setups may not necessarily lead to greater inequalities. Both frameworks may carry redistributive effects, as both are found to be positively associated with the incomes of the poorest and negatively associated with the incomes of the richest. Secondly, whether a country is politically stable is rather a more decisive institutional factor apropos inequality than whether a country has an autocratic or a democratic orientation. Economic institutions also seem to play an important role in alleviating inequalities within countries. Whether the government is functioning effectively and whether it has a robust fiscal and monetary policy seems to have stronger impact on inequality than regulatory quality. Education for all, a proxy for social institutions, has a strong redistributive power. Overall, legal institutions trump any other institutional categories in reducing inequalities in a country. On the other hand, middle income group is most likely to benefit from good functioning institutions than any other income group.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
K29|Cost Benefit Analysis, Value Of A Statistical Life And Culture: Challenges For Risk Regulation|The author studies three aspects of human live valuation and its relation with cost benefit analysis and regulation. More precisely the author addresses the problem of valuation of a statistical human life and its relation with cost benefit analysis in mortality risk reduction. First, studies the debate about Valuation of a Statistical Human Life (VSL) and Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) in mortality risks regulation; second, deals with two challenges to CBA and VSL, these are (a) the problem of discount rates and the problem of (dis)counting of future human lives, and (b), tests if culture (represented as a set of values) has an incidence in risk preferences and therefore, in willingness to pay for life in different countries.
K29|e-Communications: Investment and the Regulatory Framework|The EU regulatory framework for e-communications was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in 2002, and became applicable from 2003. It has three primary objectives: (1) to promote competition; (2) to develop the single market; and (3) to promote citizens' rights. The European Commission's DG Information Society commissioned London Economics to estimate the level of e-communications investment in the EU and to examine its main drivers as part of a contributio to the Commission's 2006 review of the e-communications framework. This paper outlines some of the findings of that study. The paper provides a description of the process of collecting data on investment in physical infrastructure in the e-communciations sector by country and by sub-sector. It also presents the collected data, showing a decline in overall investment between 2001 and 2003 and a subsequent upturn in 2004. An econometric analysis of the drivers of investment over the period is undertaken, which suggests that better performing regulatory regimes, as measured by an OECD regulatory index, can contribute to higher levels of investment in the sector.
K29|Markets Susceptible to ex ante Regulation : Methodology and Commission Recommendation|"The EU regulatory framework for electronic communications services distinguishes between markets that are susceptible to ex ante regulation and those that are subject to competition law alone. The paper lays out the methodology for identifying relevant markets that may be considered for ex ante regulation. It also provides a summary of the relevant markets that should be susceptible to ex ante regulation based on an analysis of conditions likely to prevail in a ‘representative"" member state. The paper finally addresses the role of the European Commission, and in particular its Relevant Markets Recommendation, as a means of providing guidance to NRAs."

They focus upon the Article 7 and Article 4 procedures of Directive 2002/21. They conclude that the Commission proposals leave key questions and their implications outside of discussion and fail to address core issues such as the standard of assessment under Article 7, the accountability for decisions taken upstream of the NRA, and the scope and depth of judicial review.
K29|Repercusiones de la definición de tamaño empresarial en los resultados empíricos sobre eficiencia y financiación<BR>[Repercussions of firm size definition on empirical results for firm efficiency and financing research]|A huge number of quantitative and qualitative criteria perform the research practice and legal issuing on firm size and firm-size-related measures. Inside each of those criteria, quantitative boundaries between two firm categories have also been diverse, even arbitrary. This approach to firm size concept finds out a convergence among variables —assets, market share, labour cost— with activity segment remarks (where both a traditional division and a original proposal have been used). It is demonstrated that previous founding on industry-size relations —as well as profitability or financial structure measurements— clearly depend on firm size and industry (explicative variables) definitions and also on depending variables definitions (mainly profitability).
K29|Determinants of Interstate Differentials in the Real Median Price of Single Family Homes|This empirical study investigates determinants of interstate real median home price differentials for the year 2005. While the literature on geographic cost-of-living differentials is well developed, the literature on geographic housing price differentials is much less so. Given the relatively large impact of housing prices on overall living costs, this research seeks to address this issue and shed light on specific factors influencing the real median price of housing across states. The ordinary least squares results imply that the real median price of a single-family home in a state is positively a function of the state's population growth rate, its per capita income, and its relative amount of shoreline on major bodies of water, and negatively a function of toxic waste releases in the state, the state's geographic area, and the presence of right-to-work laws in the state.
K29|The Role of the External Auditor in UK Bank Regulation and Supervision|ABSTRACT The role of the external auditor in the supervisory process requires standards such as independence, objectivity and integrity to be achieved. Even though the regulator and external auditor perform similar functions, namely the verification of financial statements, they serve particular interests. The regulator works towards safeguarding financial stability and investor interests. On the other hand, the external auditor serves the private interests of the shareholders of a company. The financial audit remains an important aspect of corporate governance that makes management accountable to shareholders for its stewardship of a company. The debate surrounding the role of external auditors focusses in particular on auditor independence. A survey by the magazine “Financial Director” shows that the fees derived from audit clients in terms of non-audit services are significant in comparison with fees generated through auditing. Accounting firms sometimes engage in a practice called “low balling” whereby they set audit fees at less than the market rate and make up for the deficit by providing non audit services. As a result, some audit firms have commercial interests to protect too. There is concern that the auditor's interests to protect shareholders of a company and his commercial interests do not conflict with each other. Sufficient measures need to be in place to ensure that the external auditor's independence is not affected. As well as considering threats to auditor independence and safeguards to protect against such threats, this paper focuses on how the external auditor can assist the FSA through two of its principal regulatory tools in the FSA's response to risk, namely supervision and enforcement. A lot of work and improvements on audit independence have been carried out over the years and there should be an ongoing process of review and further efforts aimed at improvement.

K29|Grading Estimates of the Benefits and Costs of Federal Regulation|I review two recent estimates of the costs and, in one case, benefits of federal regulation. The first is found in the Office of Management and Budget’s 2005 report to Congress on the benefits and costs of federal regulations (OMB 2005b). OMB estimates annual benefits in 2004 to be $70 to $277 billion and costs to be $34 to $39 billion, but these estimates omit a great deal; the cost estimate, in particular, is generally acknowledged to be an underestimate. The other estimate, written by Mark Crain (Crain 2005) and sponsored by the Small Business Administration, uses a different approach and generates an estimate of $1 trillion. Crain also finds that the burden on small firms is much greater than the burden on large firms. In the final section of the paper, I also review a recent comparison, presented in the 2005 report to Congress, of ex ante and ex post estimates of the benefits and costs of individual regulations. I find the Crain report to be deeply problematic and the OMB’s ex ante/ex post comparison slightly less so.
K29|The Welfare Effects of Discrimination in Insurance|We study an insurance model characterized by a continuum of risk types, private information and a competitive supply side. We use the model to investigate the welfare effects of discrimination (also known as risk selection). We postulate that a test is available that determines whether an applicant's risk exceeds a treshold. Excluding the highest risks softens adverse selection, but constitutes a welfare loss for the high risks. In contrast to a lemons market intuition, we find that aggregate surplus decreases when risk aversion is high. When risk aversion is low however, discrimination increases aggregate surplus.
K29|Work-out und Servicing von notleidenden Krediten: Berichte und Referate des HfB-NPL Servicing Forums 2006|The report deals with the current questions relating to the work-out, outsourcing and servicing of non-performing-loans. After a brief market description the paper addresses the specific problems, which arise when servicing real estate and corporate loans. Within these framework issues, which include banking secrecy rules, the risk of civil liability for banks in respect to non-performing-loans, banking regulation law, are explained and practical suggestions for a proposed line of action are made. The main objective is to identify the basic lines taken in the discussion so far and to define different approaches to the topic for the purposes of research and legal practice.
K29|Vergleichbarkeit von Gesamt- und Umsatzkostenverfahren: Auswirkungen auf die Jahresabschlussanalyse|Sowohl nach Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB) als auch nach International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) kann die Gewinn- und Verlustrechnung entweder nach dem Gesamtkostenverfahren oder nach dem Umsatzkostenverfahren aufgestellt werden. Beide Verfahren führen zwar zum gleichen Ergebnis, unterscheiden sich aber in der Höhe der in einer Periode ausgewiesenen Aufwendungen und Erträge sowie in ihrer Gliederung. Damit beeinträchtigt das Wahlrecht die Vergleichbarkeit der Unternehmen im Rahmen der Jahresabschlussanalyse. Ziel der Arbeit ist es, Möglichkeiten zur Erhöhung der Vergleichbarkeit aufzuzeigen. Dazu wird zunächst analysiert, welche Positionen der Gewinn- und Verlustrechnungen von vornherein vergleichbar sind. Anschließend wird versucht, die Gewinn- und Verlustrechnungen in die jeweils andere Darstellungsform umzuwandeln. Die Untersuchung erfolgt getrennt für die Vorschriften des HGB und der IFRS.
K29|What Drives the Optimal Bankruptcy Law Design? (in English)|In this paper the authors discuss the factors that interact in the design of an optimal bankruptcy law. The authors focus on issues that are often overlooked in both the policy debate and in the academic research on bankruptcy. After answering the question why a bankruptcy law is needed at all, the authors discuss the criteria of ex ante vs. ex post efficiency. The second factor the authors deal with is institutional quality, namely the quality of the judiciary. They argue that, considering factors such as imprudence and corruption, it may be optimal to resign on the first-best solution that could be theoretically achievable with a benevolent and omniscient judiciary. The optimal bankruptcy law would then contain more simple and automatic rules and less space for judicial (i.e., individual) discretion. The authors´ concluding comment concerns the lack of empirical research in the bankruptcy area in the Czech Republic and the essential need for such research.
K29|Measuring the Quality of Bank Regulation and Supervision with an Application to Transition Economies| This study develops a methodology to evaluate the quality of the legal aspect of bank regulation and supervision (RS). We use both the Basle guidelines and the letter of banking laws to form an extensive set of criteria to evaluate banking laws. As an application, we provide measures of RS for 23 transition economies. Our measurements indicate that legal banking reforms in Poland, Hungary, and Estonia have been more ambitious than the rest of the countries in transition. Controlling for various other relevant factors, empirical evidence reveals a significant positive relationship between RS and real GDP growth in transition economies.

K29|« Ex post » vs « Ex ante » : le cas de l’économie du droit de la faillite|[eng] Bankruptcy law : justification and reform . This article deals with the Law and Economics approach of bankruptcy law. The author presents this field of research in two parts. First, he studies the conditions of ex post efficiency in the sense that stakeholders select the issue which maximizes the value of the financially distressed firm. In other words, the author justifies the existence of bankruptcy rules as a way of coordinating stakeholders on the optimal issue. Second, he studies the impact of bankruptcy rules on debtors’ and creditors’ ex ante behaviours, that is to say before the financial distress. At this time, he considers both alternative models of bankruptcy resolution and the impact of current bankruptcy rules on stakeholders’ strategies. Based on these new considerations, the author tries to explain the diversity of various national bankruptcy systems. . JEL Classification : G33, K29 [fre] Cet article offre une revue de la littérature en économie du droit de la faillite. L’auteur montre comment l’économiste appréhende ce droit particulier et traite la question de son efficacité ex post et de son efficacité ex ante. Dans le premier cas, il juge le droit de la faillite au vu du critère de la maximisation de la valeur de l’entreprise en difficulté. Dans le second cas, l’auteur étudie comment l’économiste analyse les règles de droit par le prisme des effets qu’elles devraient normalement produire, notamment des incitations sur le comportement du débiteur et des créanciers. Il aborde, en particulier, les problèmes liés à la dissimulation des difficultés financières, à l’effort des dirigeants déterminant le résultat de l’entreprise, à la prise de risque ou aux stratégies d’enracinement des dirigeants. Enfin, l’auteur discute également l’hypothèse selon laquelle la diversité des codes de la faillite nationaux serait liée aux différences entre les systèmes financiers des pays. .

K29|Testing which proposed regulations need “competition-proofing”|When assessing the likely net impact of regulation, many jurisdictions test for specific effects on areas of concern, such as small businesses or the environment, as well as for more generalised costs and benefits. This paper considers how best to design a negative-clearance test for the competition effects of regulations. We start by examining the well-documented UK “competition filter”, which proves to have serious shortcomings. Important classes of potentially damaging measures will not trigger the UK filter, and we illustrate this by applying the filter to four controversial measures that are currently, or were recently, on the statute books in Ireland. Structural and other features of the UK filter that lead to these outcomes are identified. We then outline an alternative test structure that should reduce such “false negatives” while remaining practical to apply.
