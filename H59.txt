H59|Is the emergence of new sovereign wealth funds a fashion phenomenon?|Abstract The paper deals with the important financial policy issue of the decision for a country to establish a sovereign wealth fund (SWF). Using a large-scale database, we analyze the economic, political and institutional factors that should be considered in such a decision. In particular, we test if the emergence of SWFs and more specifically of a specific type of SWFs can be explained by the following factors: the excess foreign exchange reserves due to natural resources rents or persistent current account surpluses; the volatility of commodity prices; the appreciation of the real exchange rate leading to the “Dutch Disease” effect and the governance of the country. The results suggest that countries with excess foreign exchange reserves, which are dependent on a commodity and which suffer from an appreciation of the real exchange rate are more likely to create a fund. We also find that commodity-based funds tend to be established in low democratic countries. Finally, our results suggest that the factors driving SWFs creation are different depending on the origin of the funding (commodity or non-commodity) and the macroeconomic objective(s) assigned to the fund. Our results may be of interest for policymakers debating whether or not it can be optimal for the country to establish a SWF.
H59|Crime and Government Expenditure in Brazil: Estimating the Impact of Government Security Spending on Homicide Rates|Despite the widespread debate about crime in Brazil and the alarming increase in homicides in recent years, few studies have analyzed or exposed evidence of the impact of public security spending on deterring violence in the country. This may be due to issues of endogeneity when estimating the relationship between security spending and the rate of homicides. The primary innovation presented in this paper is the use of a Bartik-inspired instrument to address the simultaneity issue. It measures government security spending in a two-stage least squares estimation, obtaining outcomes that are not only statistically but also practically significant. Results indicate that an increase of R$10 per capita in annual security expenditure leads to a decrease of 0.6 per 100,000 people in the number of homicides.
H59|Crime, Human Capital, and the Impact of Different Taxation|This paper presents a macroeconomic model with crime, human capital, and three taxation policies (consumption, labour, and capital income taxes). In an extension, we endogenize the probability of escaping punishment to depend on government expenditure on public security/police. The model is solved analytically and numerically to derive propositions, which are then verified empirically using cross-country data. Compared to the literature, we find a much higher threshold probability. Above the threshold, the equilibrium crime rate is positively related to the escape probability. In addition, above this threshold level, a rise in capital income tax or a decline in labour income tax would lead to a higher equilibrium crime rate, if the taxes are modelled using marginal tax rates. There also appears to be empirical supports where the equilibrium human capital level depends positively on consumption tax. Lastly, when the probability is endogenized, there also exists a threshold level for the spending on public security/police, above which consumption tax and capital income tax have positive eÂ¤ects on the equilibrium level of human capital.
H59|Der Wohlfahrtstaat als Grundbestandteil des modernen demokratischen Staatsgefüges<BR>[The welfare state as a basic component of the modern democratic state structure]|Defining the welfare state is not a simpleminded task. Actually, there are numerous definitions which try to reflect at least some of the basic characteristics of the welfare state or its objectives and its functions. For some, there is primarily an institutional parameter, for others there are functional issues which have to be firstly indicated and for others, the ideological and political factors determine the definition and the attitude towards the welfare state. Apart from all these crucial ascertainments, there are some basic fundamental characteristics and values of the welfare state which render it as a precondition of the existence of the modern state. Unquestionably, it reflects a distinct part of the state but most importantly, it comprises a prerequisite for its existence. This is the exact aim of this paper; to surpass the theoretical diversifications and to find the fundamental common ground which forms the indispensability for the existence of the welfare state.
H59|Recenti iniziative europee ed italiane per la valorizzazione del patrimonio culturale|Nel presente studio si illustrano â€“ in occasione della fine dellâ€™anno dedicato dalla Commissione europea al Patrimonio culturale â€“ le piÃ¹ significative iniziative condotte sia da parte dellâ€™Unione europea che da parte italiana a favore dei beni culturali. Ovviamente, dopo aver debitamente accennato al quadro giuridico-istituzionale e alla sua evoluzione nel tempo, si evidenziano i principali aspetti di carattere strutturale che si riflettono sulle attivitÃ recentemente realizzate in tale ambito soprattutto in Italia, Paese a cui viene riconosciuta una indiscussa leadership quantomeno a livello europeo.
H59|Fertility and population policy|There have been significant changes in both the fertility rates and fertility perception since 1970s. In this paper, we examine the relationship between government policies towards fertility and the fertility trends. Total fertility rate, defined as the number of children per woman, is used as the main fertility trend variable. We use panel data from the United Nations World Population Policies database, and the World Bank World Development Indicators for the period 1976 through 2013. We find a significant negative association between a countryâ€™s fertility rate and its anti-fertility policy. On the other hand, there is no significant and robust relationship between the fertility rate and a countryâ€™s pro-fertility or family-planning policies. In addition we find evidence of spatial autocorrelation in the total fertility rate, and spatial spillovers from a governmentâ€™s policy on fertility.
H59|The impact of state development institutions on the innovative behavior of firms: Qualitative effects|Basing on a series of in-depth interviews with top executives of Russian innovation companies, the paper analyzes qualitative effects generated by the support from the state development institutions. Non-financial impacts, in particular, changes in firms’ innovation behavior, turned out to be quite significant. At the same time, tightening of formal control of the development institutions increases the risks and costs faced by the supported companies. We have identified two models of firms’ innovation behavior associated with different demand for public support instruments. These models are conditioned not so much to firms’ characteristics, but rather by the values of top managers and their views on appropriate forms of state intervention in innovation processes.
H59|Co-movements between public and private wages in the EU: what factors and with what policy implications?|Abstract This paper assesses the relationship between public and private wages in the EU, as measured by general government and manufacturing compensations, respectively. We find that the long-run relation between the two is stronger when the government is a large employer. Manufacturing compensations are better aligned with productivity and unemployment when general government compensations, to which they generally respond, are set through bargaining. Finally, manufacturing compensations react in the same way whether those in the general government sector are increased or cut, a relation that seems to hold also under fiscal consolidation provided the government is a large employer.

H59|Veterans in Workforce Development: Participation and Labor Market Outcomes|This paper compares the employment status and earnings of veterans and nonveterans following their receipt of public workforce development services in Washington State during the years 2002–2012. It also describes workforce program participation patterns for veterans and nonveterans to determine if veterans have equal or prioritized access to key programs, where prioritization is required by law. Based on tabulations and propensity score weighted regressions using administrative data, the results indicate slightly lower levels of participation by veterans than nonveterans in two major workforce programs (Wagner-Peyser and the Workforce Investment Act Adult program), and high participation in veteran-specific programs (Disabled Veterans Outreach Program and Local Veterans Employment Representative). Employment rates of veterans after program receipt are substantially lower than those for nonveterans. Meanwhile, average earnings are slightly higher, conditional on employment. These results highlight the ongoing challenge of closing the gap in employment between veterans and nonveterans to reach goals stated by policymakers.
H59|Does Increased Access to Health Insurance Impact Claims for Workers' Compensation? Evidence from Massachusetts Health Care Reform|We study over 20 million emergency room (ER) discharges in Massachusetts and three comparison states to estimate the impact of Massachusetts health care reform on claims for Workers’ Compensation (WC). Prior evidence on the relationship between health insurance and WC claiming behavior is mixed. We find that the reform caused a significant decrease in the number of per-capita ER discharges billed to WC. This result is driven by larger decreases in WC discharges for conditions for which there is greater scope to change the payer or the location of care. Conversely, we estimate smaller impacts for weekend versus weekday admissions and for wounds compared to musculoskeletal injuries. Our findings are consistent with the reform lowering WC medical costs for employers/insurers, primarily by inducing injured workers to seek care at less costly sites. The results suggest much smaller impacts on the propensity to bill WC for a given injury.

H59|Price of Political Uncertainty: Evidence from Ghanaian Treasury Bills|Whilst democracy facilitates stabilization, political uncertainty around elections can be costly to economic growth, especially if investors believe it increases earning uncertainty and causes them to reduce their investments until after elections. The paper conjectures that new democracies (whose political environments are widely accepted to be characterized by political uncertainty problems) will even have investors demanding some compensation to buy assets which are generally considered risk-free. Data on the Ghanaian treasury bills (T-bills) market empirically supports this: Rates increase around elections (compared to non-election period), suggest that political uncertainty is even priced in a risk-free asset such as T-bills, thus creating electoral cycles. The paper proposes that new democracies should endeavor to strengthen financial institutions and frameworks that promote policy credibility to help mitigate the cost of political uncertainty.
H59|Fiscal Revenues and Commitment in Immigration Amnesties|Immigration amnesties aim at reducing the size of the informal sector and identifying employers of undocumented workers. However, potential fiscal gains are also important: tax revenues are crucial in all kinds of amnesties. Nevertheless, over the last thirty years an average of 24% of all applications have been rejected. It remains an open question as to why governments accept this loss of fiscal base. We argue that applying for amnesty is basically self-incrimination, and that immigration-averse governments have an incentive to use applications as a means to identify and expel illegal workers. In equilibrium only applicants with the highest income are granted amnesty, while the poorest immigrants do not apply, and fiscal revenues remain sub-optimal. We show that electoral accountability can solve the commitment problem. However, the large number of rejections suggests that the strict voter-coordination required by this mechanism is hard to obtain in practice. Therefore immigration amnesties seem doomed to inefficiency.
H59|Dual-use products export multipliers with the indirect effects|The micro–macro link is provided for the impact of the dual-use defence-civilian exports of products and services on the Slovenian economy. The unique firm-level data on the dual-use export is integrated in the symmetric 60 groups of activities input–output tables. The classification of the economic activities is used to integrate data on the firm-to-firm dual-use export transactions in the symmetric input–output coding system to avoid the double counting. The input–output modelling approach is used for the measuring of the direct input–output flows and the dual-use products export multipliers with the indirect effects. The direct and indirect effects are analysed by the economic activities, technological intensity of the products and services, and statistical regions in Slovenia. Comparisons with alternative non dual-use high tech are analysed by economic activities in terms of value-added and labour productivity. The dual-use export is associated with high technologically intensive suppliers and sub-suppliers of defence-civilian goods and services. The empirical estimations can serve as a guide in questions of comparing with alternative in economic policy design when investigating trade-offs between allocation of expenditures for defence equipment and their opportunity costs for non dual-use of high tech products and services.
H59|The missing link: Are individuals with more social capital in better health? Evidence from India|This paper extends a two-period Overlapping Generations (OLG) model of endogenous growth in which associations between human capital, social capital, and health outcomes are critically examined for a low income country, India. If individuals with higher level of human capital can build strong social ties and have more robust social networks, they are then less likely to have health problems and are therefore physically healthier. In an attempt to test the so-called relationship between the variables in question, a unique dataset, where micro-level data from the World Values Survey (WVS) and regional-level macro data from the Central Statistics Office of India were both utilized, was accessed. A three-equation model has been then estimated using the conditional mixed-process (CMP) method in order to explicitly address endogeneity issues. Our estimation results provide important insights into the theoretical thesis in several ways. Firstly, human capital has a favorable impact upon social capital, which in turn enhances self-reported health. Secondly, we provide a comparison of three main experiments: an increase in the share of public spending by region on education, social capital-enhancing activities, and health. The results confirm the positive effect of an increase in each form of government spending on outcome variables. Thirdly, the correlation coefficient between disturbances of these three equations turns out to be statistically significant, suggesting that there are unobserved factors, which can affect self-reported health, social capital and human capital variables.
H59|Co-movements between Public and Private Wages in the EU: Which Factors Play a Role?|This paper assesses the relationship between government and manufacturing wages. We find that the long-run relation between the two wages is stronger when the government is a large employer. Manufacturing wages are better aligned with productivity and unemployment when public wages, to which they respond, are set through bargaining. Finally, manufacturing wages react in the same way whether public wages are increased or cut, a relation that seems to hold also under fiscal consolidation provided the public sector is a large employer.
H59|Cap Direct Payments As The Main Tool To Support The Eu Farmers: An Analysis Of Their Implementation Based On Spain Experience|Direct payments are the main tool of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the main objective is to support EU farmers incomes. They benefit from a particular attention during the new 2014-2020 reform. For the first time direct payments were introduced in 1992 after MacSharry reform and known as coupled payments (payments per hectare and animal head). In 2003 were introduced the decoupled payments focused at encouraging farmers and enhancing the competitiveness and sustainability of the EU agriculture. The aim of this paper is to analyze the application of direct payments as main support instrument to the EU farmers based on Spain experience. In Spain the new changes in the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) were first introduced in 2006, beginning with the regime of partial decoupling, until 2012, when the coupled payments disappeared, being integrated under the SPS or transformed into additional payment. In this analysis, secondary data provided by the Spanish Agrarian Guarantee Fund (FEGA), Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment of Spain (MAGRAMA) and Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN. The analyzed data refers to the amount of allocated direct payments in Spain and EU countries, number of beneficiaries and its distribution on territorial aspect. So far, the distribution of direct payments in Spain, similar to other EU member states, is unequal, as a result of various factors, as the CAP development and diversity of production, the use of historical references to fix the decoupled payments per farm and others.
H59|Development of the Corporate Social Responsibility Concept in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises|The paper presents results of the research conducted in the area of CSR in the Czech Republic in 2013/2014. We focussed on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Correlation between the size of the enterprise, awareness, commitment and the number of used CSR activities is evaluated. The paper follows the involvement of SMEs in specific activities within the social, economic and environmental pillars and suggests possibilities for further development of the National Action Plan (NAP) for SMEs. The results of the statistical analysis show that engagement of organizations in the CSR activities growths with the size of the organization. Only 30% of micro and small enterprises in the Czech Republic know and make use of the CSR concept comprehensively and are active in all three pillars of CSR. Approximately 30% are involved in only one pillar - mostly in the economic one. 30% do not apply the CSR concept within their business at all. SMEs are not sufficiently engaged in activities primarily in the environmental pillar and activities aiming towards outside the organization.
H59|Evaluation of the results of scientific workers: the experience of New Zealand<BR>[Оценка Результатов Деятельности Научных Работников: Опыт Новой Зеландии]|Due to the growing importance of science for the economy and hard budget constraints in Russia the issue of increasing the efficiency of public funding of research activities is becoming increasingly urgent. The planned transition to a system of effective contracts in science requires regular assessment of the scientific staff's performance, resulting in the need for such an assessment methodology. As part of this article presents an analysis of the individual evaluation of researchers working in the OECD results on the example of New Zealand's experience of the countries and the ways to apply this experience in Russia in the development of methodology for assessing the performance of researchers.
H59|Analysing job creation effects of scaling up infrastructure spending in South Africa| In a first for South Africa, this article draws on literature on infrastructure productivity to model dynamic economy-wide employment impacts of infrastructure investment funded with different fiscal tools. Using a dynamic computable general equilibrium model, the South African investment plan is modelled, given the infrastructure externality. Alternative fiscal scenarios to finance the policy are modelled in the article. In the long run, unemployment decreases for all types of workers under one of the scenarios. In the short run, only elementary occupation workers benefit from a decrease in unemployment; for the rest, unemployment rises.
H59|Larger is Better: the Scale Effects of the Italian Local Healthcare Authorities Amalgamation Program|Consolidation is often considered as a means to lower service delivery costs and enhance accountability. This paper uses a prospective evaluation design to derive estimates of the potential cost savings that may arise from Local Healthcare Authorities (LHAs) amalgamation process, which is concerning the Italian National Health System. We focus specifically on cost savings due to scale economies with reference to a particular subset of the production costs of the LHAs, i.e. the administrative costs together with the purchasing costs of both goods as well as non-healthcare related services. Our results demonstrate the existence of economies of scale linked to the size of the LHA population. Hence, the decision to reduce the number of LHAs may result in larger local health authorities that are more cost efficient, especially when the consolidation process concerns merging a large number of LHA.
H59|Singapore's Real Estate:50 Years of Transformation|"Singapore's Real Estate: 50 Years of Transformation documents the transformation and development of the real estate market in Singapore over the past 50 years. This volume is organised around two major themes, and covers issues from the ""bricks and mortar"" to the capital markets; and from local to international real estate markets. The themes aptly describe how real estate has played an important role in the economic development and growth of Singapore from a third world to a first world country. Written by well-renowned experts with deep academic and practical knowledge of the progress of real estate in Singapore, this book highlights the uniqueness of real estate markets and institutions in Singapore, which have constantly been replicated and adopted in other markets."
H59|Evolution of the Real Estate Industry in Singapore|Singapore's transformation since Independence in 1965, from a poor port city of the Third World to a modern world-class metropolis with one of the most developed and sophisticated real estate markets in the world, is truly remarkable. Very few markets in the world can claim the distinction of achieving so much as rapidly as Singapore has. This 50-year journey, made not without trials and tribulations, reflects in many ways a successful public-private partnership, combining pragmatic government policies with the entrepreneurship of the private sector. This book traces the evolution of the Singapore real estate industry and identifies the contributory factors to the successful partnership. The introductory chapter is an overarching summary of the book and subsequent chapters discuss in more detail the roles played by the government and the private sector - developers, investors, financiers, fund managers and consultants and other intermediaries - in this transformational journey from the simple beginning of a locally focused bricks-and-mortar market, building largely for owner-occupation through to globalisation and securitisation of real estate. The last two chapters look into the role of real estate education and collate the views and comments from the alumni of the NUS Real Estate school, on the future of Singapore real estate…

Lagging behind in the early years, Singapore has largely caught up with the developed markets, where not only has real estate become a global business, it is now fully integrated with the capital markets. Fifty years ago, commercial real estate investment was a relatively unsophisticated business: entirely local in nature, focused on bricks-and-mortar and quite detached from the world of finance. It has since evolved from this simple beginning of building largely for owner-occupation through to the development of investment markets with institutional participation, and then to globalisation with increased cross-border investments and eventually to securitised real estate equity and debt in both private and public markets…

Indeed, as the only real estate degree programme offered in Singapore, the National University of Singapore (NUS) Department of Real Estate has been producing graduates for the real estate industry since its inception in 1969, four years after Singapore's independence. Today, these graduates can be found in both public and private sectors. Many are leaders in professional consultancy firms, real estate investment trusts and funds, development and other real estate-related companies and various government agencies…

H59|Trade Liberalization, Economic Size and Macroeconomic Volatility: Empirical Evidence from Pakistan|The purpose of this paper is to investigate the link between trade liberalization, government size and the macroeconomic volatility in case of Pakistan. For this purpose, paper used time series data from 1967-2010 and employed co integration technique to find long run relationship. The results proposed that in long run trade liberalization and economic size create volatility in output. However consumption volatility is directly link with trade liberalization and government size. It is proposed that increase in trade liberalization and government size may reduce the investment volatility in long run. Furthermore error correction model suggested that in short run output volatility, trade liberalization, and economic size are negatively linked whereas government size directly linked with output, consumption and investment volatility in the short run.
H59|Trade debts of Italian general government: an unsolved problem|This paper examines the phenomenon of late payment by Italy’s general government. Its main contribution to the debate are new estimates on the stock of trade payables and the average payment times for the years 2008-14 which, compared with those published in the Bank of Italy’s Annual Reports, incorporate a number of methodological refinements. We also investigate the distribution of trade debts according to several characteristics of creditor firms (sector, size, geographical area, intensity of relations with the public sector) and propose some useful elements for evaluating the effectiveness of the Government’s 2013-14 programme aimed at reducing the outstanding debts.
H59|Public R&D support for newly founded firms – effects on patent activity and employment growth|By addressing the effectiveness of entrepreneurship policy this paper attempts to fill a gap in the literature. By using a dataset of highly innovative start-ups in the East German state of Thuringia the impact of R&D subsidies on start-ups? employment growth and their patent output is analyzed. Presumed selection biases between subsidized and non-subsidized start-ups are accounted for by conducting propensity score matching. We find that R&D subsidies lead to an increase in employment growth of about 66%. Furthermore, subsidized start-ups show a 2.8?times higher patent output. These estimates provide evidence for the additionality of R&D subsidies within the first three business years. Moreover, our analysis points to a successful policy targeting of academic spin-offs.

H59|Language Rights - A Welfare-Economics Approach|Distributions of language rights in multilingual settings are analyzed from a normative viewpoint in this chapter. If the cost structure of providing rights is concave in the number of beneficiaries, then a critical-mass criterion for the determination of an optimal rights structure results. It is further shown that an efficiency analysis based on a ‘naive’ cost-benefit calculation has to be augmented in various ways if rights influence the status of a language, which in turn influences the preferences for language rights. Also the inter-generational transfer of language repertoires to the next generation leads to an endogeneity of preferences. The endogeneity of preferences in turn can make the cost-benefit analysis contradictory. In a welfare-maximizing approach, redistribution goals further modify the analysis.

H59|Strategic behavior by federal agencies in the allocation of public resources|How do government agencies allocate program resources? Some authors presume that agencies seek to maximize program objectives; others suggest agencies favor the districts important to the president’s election. In addition, agencies may distribute larger program resources to those districts whose congressional representatives are best positioned to help the agency. We examined how federal government agencies responded both to the 2006 election, when control of Congress shifted from the Republican to the Democratic Party, and to the 2010 election, when the House switched from Democratic to Republican control. We used a difference-in-difference analysis to evaluate the impact of each election on the agencies’ allocations of contracts. Agencies generally responded to the elections by allocating more contract resources to districts represented by the winning party. However, federal agencies reacted differently to changing political environments, depending on the characteristics of the agency. For example, after the 2006 election, those agencies with programs favored by Republican members of Congress allocated more resources to Democratic districts. These “Republican agencies” presumably are the most vulnerable to the risk of losing future appropriations. “Democratic agencies” (and “neutral agencies”), facing no significant threats to their appropriations, did not respond to the election as strongly. Finally, more vulnerable districts received the most support, especially by the “Republican agencies.” We reaffirmed these results by using the 2010 congressional elections, in which the political orientations of the districts favored with more contract distributions was reversed.

H59|A Causality Test of the Revenue-Expenditure Nexus in Ghana|Abstract The paper investigates the revenue-expenditure nexus for Ghana. The study covers the period 1980-2013. It examines whether increases in government revenue cause increases in government expenditure or increases in government expenditure cause increases in government revenue. It also examines if changes in government expenditure and revenue have feedback effects on each other. The stationarity test indicates that both variables are stationary at the levels when the test is done with a constant and a trend, and are first difference stationary when the test is done with a constant but no trend. The paper analyses the long-run relationship between government expenditure and government revenue using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method. The short-run relationships between the two variables are tested in a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) framework. The results show a very strong long-and short-run relationship between the variables. The second period lag of the revenue variable shows a negative relationship between government revenue and government expenditure. This indicates the possibility of the absence of Fiscal illusion in every two years of increased government expenditure. Granger causality test is done to determine the direction of the causal relationship between government expenditure and government revenue. The test gives a unidirectional causality running from revenue to expenditure. This implies government revenue causes government expenditure. Therefore, evidence of Tax-spend hypothesis is found. The implication is that, government must improve its revenue generation efforts in order for it to fund its ever increasing expenditure and to control the frequent fiscal slippages.
H59|Diskrepanzen in Finanzkraft und Besoldung nach der Föderalismusreform|The financial strength of federal and state governments must be adequately compensated in federalism. The results of financial equalisation for 2014 point to the weaknesses and problems of the German system. Furthermore, a close correlation between the financial strength of the government levels and the salary levels of German officials in federal and state governments can be shown. Their payment has evolved differently since 2006. Economically, this can be interpreted as a positive element of competition; however, limits are set by the constitutional courts of federal and state governments. Given the debt ceiling and rising pension obligations, this problem will yet increase in the future. Copyright ZBW and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015
H59|Organizing for Emergencies - Issues in Wildfire Fighting in Croatia|Croatia's accession to the European Union implies inevitable changes in the national emergency management system. New requirements for adjustment in accordance with the EU standards and practices also apply to the fire-services organization. Harmonious functioning of a large number of relatively autonomous organizations related to the National Protection and Rescue Directorate necessitates clear decision-making authority and coordination mechanisms as well as a high level of interoperability and core competencies development. This paper gives an overview of the Croatian fire protection organization along with its accompanying legislation, followed by an analysis of identified problems, especially those concerning fighting of wildfire. In our research a survey questionnaire comprised of Likert-scale items was used to assess the attitudes and experiences of trained fire department members. The respondents reported a relatively low evaluation of effectiveness and appropriateness of the following key fire service attributes: organizational structure, legislation and firefighting logistics support. From the obtained results guidelines can be drawn for possible redesign of the emergency management organization, especially those concerning the fire protection service.

H59|Does The Government Size Cause Economic Growth? Empirical Evidence from Selected ASEAN Countries|This paper investigates the link between government size and growth in the long run for an unbalanced panel of seven ASEAN-3 countries (N=7) with annual data for the period 1980-2012 (T=33).The relation between government expenditure and economic growth has been extensively investigated by the use of different models. The model used is the pooled mean group, mean group and dynamic fixed effect model. By examining both short run and long run effects, the empirical results demonstrate a positively significant influence of government expenditure on economic growth on the long run. Furthermore, average error-correcting speed is approximately 0.04% per annum, which shows that a country converges to the common steady-state income path extremely slow.
H59|Inversión pública y privada en México y su incidencia en el crecimiento|En este trabajo se analizan las relaciones entre la inversión pública, la inversión privada y el crecimiento en México en los últimos 20 años con el objetivo de verificar si en ese periodo hay evidencia del efecto de desplazamiento o lo contrario; efecto de atracción, es decir, si la inversión pública ha desplazado a la inversión privada o la ha fomentado. Los resultados del análisis permiten descartar la presencia del efecto crowding out, observándose en lugar de ello retroalimentación entre la inversión pública y la inversión privada, es decir, existe complementariedad entre ambos tipos de inversión y ambas pueden incidir en el crecimiento de la económica./ In this paper, the relationship between public investment, private investment and growth in Mexico over the past 20 years with the aim of verifying analyzed for evidence of crowding out or otherwise crowding in in that period, ie if public investment has shifted to private investment or fostered. The analysis results can rule out the presence of crowding out effect observed instead feedback between public investment and private investment, i.e, there is complementarity between the two types of investment and both can affect economic growth.
H59|Does government employment crowd out private sector employment in sids? the case of Barbados|This paper uses a two-step Markov-switching error correction model to determine the impact of government employment on the labour market in Barbados, a small island developing Caribbean state. The results suggest that there is partial crowding out, as public sector hiring reduces private employment but the net impact of unemployment is negative. These findings hint that there may be some merit in a countercyclical employment policy in SIDS. In addition, the results suggest that the tax and debt expense are two channels through which crowding out can occur.
H59|Public Preferences for Redistributive Policies in Israel|This paper contributes to the literature on inequality and welfare policy by studying public support for redistributive policies in Israel, a society with an extreme level of socioeconomic inequality. Drawing on the relevant literature and taking into consideration the distinct demographic makeup of contemporary Israeli society, the study aims to describe public support for opportunity-enhancing and outcome-based redistributive policies and to explore the extent to which individual economic and demographic characteristics are associated with policy preferences. Analysis of data from a unique topical module of the 2008 Israel Social Survey reveals that support for opportunity-based programs is strong overall, but that the Israeli public is deeply divided along ethnic lines, religious affiliation, and immigration status. While results from multinomial regression analyses provide support for the self-interest theory, the findings also underscore the significance of various demographic and social indicators as determinants of policy preferences. These findings are discussed in light of the current debates on the sources of, and possible remedies for, the growing social and economic polarization within Israeli society.
H59|The Early History of Program Evaluation and the Department of Labor|My contact with the Department of Labor began more than 40 years ago, so it is a little alarming to consider that the Department is merely 100 years old! These remarks are addressed to those early days in the history of program evaluation 40 years ago, days that were both challenging and, in retrospect, more influential than anyone in the Department imagined.
H59|Thailand?s Flood Management Policy: Issues, Developments and Implications for the Thai Tourism Industry|This paper aims to propose initiatives for flood management in order to prevent and alleviate the instability of tourism flows and economic loss of tourism industry, including cultural heritage tourism. Urbanisation and changeable demographics of floodplains and flood behaviour as well as the climate change have increased the exposure to flood risk in Thailand. Thai tourism sector was heavily affected by the floods in 2011. The disaster caused severe damages and losses such as a slowdown in income and a decline in the number of foreign tourists. Nonetheless, the negative impacts can be mitigated. Proper countermeasures include the developments of a proactive and integrated disaster risk management policy and effective non-structural strategies.
H59|Does Public-Sector Employment Fully Crowd Out Private-Sector Employment?|We quantify the extent to which public-sector employment crowds out private-sector employment using specially assembled datasets for a large cross-section of developing and advanced countries, and discuss the implications for countries in the Middle East, North Africa, Caucasus and Central Asia. These countries simultaneously display high unemployment rates, low private-sector employment rates and high proportions of government-sector employment. Regressions of either private-sector employment rates or unemployment rates on two measures of public-sector employment point to full crowding out. This means that high rates of public employment, which incur substantial fiscal costs, have a large negative impact on private employment rates and do not reduce overall unemployment rates.
H59|Impact of fiscal policy in an intertemporal CGE model for South Africa|This paper uses an intertemporal computable general equilibrium model to investigate the consequences of an expansive fiscal policy designed to accelerate economic growth in South Africa. A key contribution is made to existing literature on the transmission mechanism of fiscal policy in African economies. To the best of our knowledge, no published study has empirically analyzed the macroeconomic effects of fiscal policy in the context of an open, middle-income sub-Saharan African economy like South Africa using an integrated intertemporal model with such disaggregated production structure. The paper shows that an expansive fiscal policy would have a temporary impact on gross domestic product (GDP) but would translate into higher debt relative to GDP. Using increased taxation to finance the additional spending would lessen this impact but would also negatively affect macroeconomic variables. Increased investment spending would improve long-term GDP, under any financing scheme, and would decrease debt-to-GDP ratio as well as deficit-to-GDP ratio. This outcome is driven by the positive impact infrastructure has on total factor productivity. Sensitivity analysis shows that these conclusions are qualitatively similar for wide values of the elasticity of the total factor productivity to infrastructure. In fact, the conclusions hold even when comparing different financing schemes.
H59|Crime and the effectiveness of public order spending in Greece: Policy implications of some persistent findings|Increasing crime rates invariably result in calls for more police protection which requires the allocation of additional scarce resources to policing and public order. In an environment of fiscal pressures, the effectiveness of such public spending in deterring crime emerges as an important issue. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of public order spending on recorded crime in Greece. Results reported herein show that public order outlays do not have any crime reducing impact. The findings may tentatively be interpreted as either reflecting inefficient use of resources and/or that crime is driven by a cohort of other factors and hence it is unaffected by the allocation of resources to policing. Both interpretations have important policy implications both in terms of crime prevention policies as well as in terms of the operational efficiency and effectiveness of the agencies assigned with the task to thwart criminal activity.
H59|Government science and technology budgets in times of crisis|Following a recent paper by Filippetti and Archibugi [Filippetti, A., Archibugi, D., 2011. Innovation in times of crisis: National systems of innovation, structure and demand. Research Policy 40(2), 179–192], this article aims to contribute to the sparse literature on the impacts of the recent economic downturn on the government expenditures and innovative activities of the countries of the enlarged European Union (EU-27). Using Eurostat's socio-economic objectives i.e. the Nomenclature for the Analysis and Comparison of Scientific Programmes and Budgets (NABS 2007 classification), this paper addresses the impact of the recent economic downturn on governments’ science and technology (S&T) budgets across the 27 EU countries. Most countries followed a pro-cyclical pattern, where the government S&T budgets in most NABS shrunk along slowing gross domestic product growth in similar pace with total government expenditure. The new member states of Eastern Europe were the most affected.

H59|Environmental protection expenditure: Ex-post evaluation|The paper presents the methodology for monitoring and evaluating the efficiency of current environmental protection expenditures of municipalities developed within the project of Ministry of Environment of the Czech Republic. The methodology has been approved as the voluntary environmental tool for municipal officials. A proposal of methodological procedure for evaluating municipal environmental protection expenditure is based on multi-criteria weighed assessment. It gives municipalities the instrument for assessment of expenditure efficiency and includes all three pillars of sustainable development – economical, ecological and environmental. In the paper are investigate outputs which results from the evaluation of environmental protection expenditures in the city of Brno that is the second largest city in the Czech Republic and represents the territory where live approximately 380 000 citizens. The results show real state of expenditure efficiency in the city Brno and point out the possibility of improving the current situation. The methodology is assessing tool based on available data usable for other states and their municipalities for evaluation of effectiveness of public spending at the local level.
