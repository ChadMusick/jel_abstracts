L60|Measurement Of Digital Activity In Medium, High-Tech And Low-Tech Manufacturing Industries|The spread of digital technologies changes production processes and business models, which has important effects for diversification of the economy. The fourth industrial revolution and the Industrial Internet of Things open up new opportunities for the introduction of technologies, having a significant impact on the production cycle, starting with highly automated production lines and ending with the large-scale implementation of technological solutions designed to improve productivity, optimize costs, quality and reliability. Defining digital transformations, primarily in the manufacturing industry as a strategic imperative for the entire economy, for the first time, based on opinions and intentions of entrepreneurs (short and medium-term), key aspects of the digitalization process in Russian medium, high-tech and low-tech manufacturing industries are revealed. A set of tendencies in the development of digital technologies by their main types is presented, the level of industry participation in digital transformation is shown, as well as many other important digital transformation processes in enterprises that are not measured by quantitative statistics. For all the studied industries, factors hindering digital transformation are identified and ranked.
L60|Innovation, Productivity, and Spillovers Effects: Evidence from Chile|This paper estimates the direct and spillover effects of two matching grants schemes designed to promote firm-level research and development (R&D) investment in Chile on firm productivity. Because the two programs target different kinds of projects—the National Productivity and Technological Development Fund (FONTEC) subsidizes intramural R&D, while the Science and Technology Development Fund (FONDEF) finances extramural R&D carried out in collaboration with research institutes—analyzing their effects can shed light on the process of knowledge creation and diffusion. The paper applies fixed-effects techniques to a novel dataset that merges several waves of Chile’s National Manufacturing Surveys collected by the National Institute of Statistics with register data on the beneficiaries of both programs. The results suggest that while both programs have had a positive impact on participants’ productivity, only FONDEF-funded projects have generated positive spillovers on firms’ productivity. The analysis reveals that the spillover effects on productivity display an inverted-U relationship with the intensity of public support. Spillover effects were found to occur only if firms were both geographically and technologically close.
L60|Determinants of Productivity Gap in the European Union: A Multilevel Perspective|The paper explores the determinants of productivity gap within the European Union in four industrial manufacturing sectors (computers, chemicals, basic metals and food) of strong macroeconomic significance and varied 'Research and Development' (R&D) intensity. Our analysis reveals that some of the most important factors determining productivity gap across the EU are related to technology gap variables - R&D intensity and R&D embedded in purchased equipment and machinery - and how they interact. While the signs for both R&D and embedded R&D are as expected and our results emphasise the relevance of technology for closing the productivity gap, this is not the case with the interaction between these two variables. The estimates for the interaction terms are indeed very significant and consistently negative in three out of four sectors. This negative relationship suggests that there is no complementarity between these two modes of technology acquisition - R&D and embedded R&D investments - which are however each separately crucial for catching up. In policy terms, this situation suggests that there is a lack of coordination between R&D policy and technology transfer (FDI, trade and industrial policy). Given that, our results also show a widening productivity gap between the countries of the EU periphery (South and East) and the rest of the sample.
L60|Global production networks and the evolution of industrial capabilities: Does production sharing warp the Product Space?|Do production capabilities of countries evolve from existing capabilities, or do they emerge de novo? The Product Space approach developed by Hidalgo, Klinger, Barabási & Hausmann (2007) postulates that a country’s existing industrial structure largely determines its opportunities for industrial upgrading. We advance the Product Space approach to accommodate the role of global production sharing. Using a newly constructed multi-country dataset of manufacturing exports that distinguishes between trade within global production networks and traditional horizontal trade we show that existing industrial structure has a lesser impact on industrial upgrading within vertically integrated global industries.
L60|Tales of the City: What Do Agglomeration Cases Tell Us About Agglomeration in General?|This paper considers the heterogeneous microfoundations of agglomeration economies. It studies the co-location of industries to look for evidence of labor pooling, input sharing, and knowledge spillovers. The novel contribution of the paper is that it estimates single-industry models using a common empirical framework that exploits the cross-sectional variation in how one industry co-locates with the other industries in the economy. This unified approach yields evidence on the relative importance of the Marshallian microfoundations at the single-industry level, allowing for like-for-like cross-industry comparisons on the determinants of agglomeration. Using UK data, we estimate such microfoundations models for 97 manufacturing sectors, including the classic agglomeration cases of automobiles, computers, cutlery, and textiles. These four cases - as with all of the individual industry models we estimate - clearly show the importance of the Marshallian forces. However, they also highlight how the importance of these forces varies across industries - implying that extrapolation from cases should be viewed with caution. The paper concludes with an investigation of the pattern of heterogeneity. The degree of an industry's clustering (localization), dynamism, incumbent firm size, and worker education are shown to contribute to the pattern of heterogeneous microfoundations.
L60|Are global value chains receding? The jury is still out. Key findings from the analysis of deflated world trade in parts and components|In this article, we examine the dynamics of Global Value Chains (GVCs) since the 2000s. Did it show a marked expansion up to the Great Recession and did GVCs begin a downturn in the 2010s? To better understand the evolution of GVCs at the world level, we use very detailed trade data for 2000 to 2016, which distinguishes different production stages along the GVC. In particular, among intermediate goods, we focus on Parts and Components (P&C) rather than semi-finished products since the manufacture of P&C corresponds to activities more embedded in GVCs. We control, also, for the global business cycle and price effects using an original production stages deflator based on detailed bilateral trade unit-values. This new GVC indicator shows moderate growth over the study period with no trend reversal.
L60|What Drives Differences in Management Practices?|"Partnering with the US Census Bureau, we implement a new survey of ""structured"" management practices in two waves of 35,000 manufacturing plants in 2010 and 2015. We find an enormous dispersion of management practices across plants, with 40 percent of this variation across plants within the same firm. Management practices account for more than 20 percent of the variation in productivity, a similar, or greater, percentage as that accounted for by R&D, ICT, or human capital. We find evidence of two key drivers to improve management. The business environment, as measured by right-to-work laws, boosts incentive management practices. Learning spillovers, as measured by the arrival of large ""Million Dollar Plants"" in the country, increase the management scores of incumbents."
L60|Firms' Exports, Volatility and Skills: Evidence from France|Inequalities between workers of different skills have been growing in the era of globalization. Firms' internationalization mode has an impact on job stability. Exporting firms are not only exposed to different foreign shocks, they also pay skill-intensive fixed costs to serve foreign markets. This implies that, for larger exporters, the labor demand for skilled workers is expected to be less volatile than for unskilled workers. In this paper we study the relationship between firms' export activity and job stability across employment skills. Relying on detailed firm-level data from France for the period 1996-2007, we show that firms with higher export intensity exhibit a lower volatility of skilled labor demand relative to the volatility of unskilled labor demand. Our identification strategy is based on an instrumental variable approach to provide evidence on the causal effect of the export performance of the firm on the volatility of employment of different skills. Our findings suggest that exporting increases the stability of skilled jobs, but feeds the precariousness of unskilled ones.
L60|Services and Manufacturing in Global Value Chains: Is the Distinction Obsolete?|Many studies discuss the “de-industrialization” or “servicification” of economies in both developed and developing countries. Such studies rely on statistics that distinguish a manufacturing from a service sector. But in the age of global value chains (GVCs), it becomes increasingly difficult to disentangle manufacturing from service activities. Goods are produced with services, services are produced with goods, some manufacturing firms are factory-less, and companies tend to sell solutions to customers by bundling goods with services. This business reality has important implications for trade and industry analysis. Against this backdrop, the paper introduces a taxonomy of service activities in GVCs and describes the main statistical challenges in assessing the contribution of manufacturing and services to output, value added, or trade. It then reviews three approaches that take GVCs into account in the analysis of income, comparative advantage, and productivity to address these challenges. As statisticians are working on improving the framework for understanding global production, policymakers should be aware of the blurring lines between goods and services.
L60|The Labor Market Effects of the China Syndrome: Evidence from South Korean Manufacturing|We evaluate the direct impact of China trade shock on the Korean labor market following the approach of Acemoglu et al. (2016). Using firm- and industry-level data for the period 1993â€“2013, our direct estimates imply that the net employment effect of the China shock in the manufacturing sector is the creation of 0.52 million jobs. The positive impact is mostly driven by Chinaâ€™s rising demand for intermediate inputs and capital goods from Korea to support its export expansion to the global economy. The import-competition channel plays a negligible role in manufacturing employment because it creates temporary jobs that merely compensate for the loss in permanent jobs. By contrast, over the same period, the average wage declined by 2.4 percent, and income inequality, measured as the gap between the high- and low-income quantile, grew substantially in manufacturing. In addition, we find that the direct effect of China shock lowers labor market concentration by shifting workers from big firms to small and medium-sized firms.
L60|What gains and distributional implications result from trade liberalization?|This paper investigates the distributional impacts of trade liberalization across firms, consumers and workers. Using firm-product-level census data for Ecuador, we exploit exogenous tariff changes at entry to the World Trade Organization. We show that with input tariff cuts firms access higher quality and new input varieties. Consequently, firms increase their product scope and quality, while their production’s skill-intensity increases and costs decrease. “Real” productivity (TFPQ) increases only in the medium run, following adjustments to produce more and higher quality products. Positive immediate revenue productivity (TFPR) gains result because firms’ markups increase. Consumers still gain as quality-adjusted prices decrease and varieties increase. Workers benefit differentially: skilled workers’ wages rise compared to less skilled workers’ wages. Input-tariff liberalization also has distributional impacts across firms. Only more productive firms with high markups increase product scope and quality and gain market shares. With output-trade liberalization the least productive firms decrease their product scope.
L60|Firm Size and Innovation in the Service Sector|A rich literature links knowledge inputs with innovative outputs. However, most of what is known is restricted to manufacturing. This paper analyzes whether the three aspects involving innovative activity - R&D; innovative output; and productivity - hold for knowledge intensive services. Combining the models of Crepon et al. (1998) and of Ackerberg et al. (2015), allows for causal interpretation of the relationship between innovation output and labor productivity. We find that knowledge intensive services benefit from innovation activities in the sense that these activities causally increase their labor productivity. Moreover, the firm size advantage found for manufacturing in previous studies nearly disappears for knowledge intensive services.
L60|Firm Performance Under Infrastructure Constraints: Evodence from Sub-sahara African Firms|The poor business environment mainly poor infrastructure is found to has paramount importance in explaining Africa's disadvantage relative to other similar countries. To cope with this poor supply of electricity, firms adopt different mechanisms to reduce the resulting effects. The commonly adopted coping strategy is an investment in self-generation of electricity. This study examined the role of investing in self-generation in mitigating the outage loss and evaluated the outage loss differential between �firms that invested in self-generation and those that did not, using World Bank Enterprise Survey data collected from �firms operating in 13 Sub-Saharan African countries. The result obtained shows that, though self-generation has reduced the amount of outage loss for fi�rms that invested in self-generation, these firms continue to face higher unmitigated outage loss compared to firms without such investment. In spite of this, �firms that invested in self-generation would have incurred 36%-99% more than the current amount of outage loss if they do not engaged in self-generation. Similarly, �firms that did not invest in self-generation would have reduced their outage loss by 2% - 24% if they had engaged in self-generation. The study thus, recommended a di�fferential supply interruption to be followed by public authorities based on �firms' degree of vulnerability to power interruptions.
L60|Management Practises in Finnish Manufacturing Establishments: Evidence from FMOP|Abstract Data collected by the recently conducted Finnish Management and Organizational Practices Survey (FMOP) by Statistics Finland is used to examine the management practices in Finnish manufacturing establishments. The FMOP project was funded by the Strategic Research Council. This paper presents the descriptive statistics, some indicative international comparisons using poststratification weighted averages and a cross-regional comparison of the large areas of Finland. The management scores appear to be only slightly behind those of the US and approximately on par with those of Germany. This suggests that the management practices in Finnish manufacturing are on a comparatively high international level. We also find evidence of cross-regional differences in management quality in Finland with aggregate (employment weighted) but not unweighted management scores, which suggests that the differences in the allocation of employment between establishments may explain regional disparities in Finland. To analyse the statistical significance of the regional disparities in workforce allocation in greater depth, we utilize a moment-based estimation procedure that allows for statistical inferences using the Olley-Pakes decomposition. We find evidence of regional variations in the policy relevant allocation component.
L60|Services and Manufacturing in Global Value Chains: Is the Dstinction Obsolete?|This paper introduces a taxonomy of service activities in GVCs and describes the main statistical challenges in assessing the contribution of manufacturing and services to output, value added, or trade. It then reviews three approaches that take GVCs into account in the analysis of income, comparative advantage, and productivity to address these challenges. As statisticians are working on improving the framework for understanding global production, policymakers should be aware of the blurring lines between goods and services.
L60|Entry Preemption by Domestic Leaders and Home-Bias Patterns: Theory and Empirics|This paper studies a mechanism which arises through the strategic use of demand-enhancing investments by domestic leaders. To accomplish this, I develop a parsimonious framework that allows for firm heterogeneity, strategic interactions, multiple choices, and extensive margin adjustments. The mechanism is such that, relative to a non-strategic benchmark, domestic leaders follow an overinvestment strategy which preempts the entry of importers and increases their domestic sales. This generates greater concentration and home-bias patterns at both the firm and aggregate level. The results are robust to the type of competition (i.e., prices or quantities) and whether investments trigger increases or decreases in prices. Estimating the model for Danish manufacturing industries, I show that, in industries with lower substitutability, the strategic effect on concentration and domestic intensity is greater for consumer goods, and lower regarding concentration for producer goods.
L60|Estimation and Forecasting of Industrial Production Index|It is essential for policy makers to timely consider the cyclical changes in output. Monthly industrial production is one of the most important and commonly used macroeconomic indicators for this purpose. In Pakistan monthly estimates of industrial production are not available. Alternatively, policy makers rely on Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) index which accounts for only 10% of the GDP. Another limitation of LSM is that it mainly accounts for private sector industry thus leaving out direct public sector presence in industrial production. LSM is relied upon heavily by economic policy makers to gauge economic activity in Pakistan. In this paper, we present a new Industrial Production Index (IPI), which covers whole of industrial sector in Pakistan. The advantage of this IPI index is that it provides additional information that LSM misses out. Post estimation, we built seven econometrics models reflecting conditions in real, financial and external sectors to estimate YoY changes in the proposed Instrial Production Index (IPI). Our results show that the root mean square error of the ARDL model reflecting financial conditions is lowest across all horizons
L60|The Importance of Defense Industry in Turkish Economy|This study analyzes the extent of economic importance of defense industry in Turkey by using SIPRI database for the period 1953 through 2018. For this purpose, firstly, the development pattern of Turkish total military expenditure (in constant 2017 US$) is evaluated over 66 years from 1953 to 2018. Next, the statistics on the military expenditure per capita (1988-2018) is analyzed in order to analyze how a change occurs on the expenditure with increasing population. In order to determine how the defense industry evolved in a developing economy, we also examine the expenditure statistics as a share of Turkish government expenditure (2000-2018 period) and GDP (1960-2018 period). Finally, the position and importance of the Turkish defense industry in the world, and in Europe and Middle East region is revealed when compared to other 173 countries. Main findings of the study could be summarized in the following way. The statistics reveal that the industry ranks 14th in the world and 6th in Europe, with a total expenditure of US$ 22B in 2018. Among top 100 arms-producing companies in the world, there are two Turkish companies, ASELSAN and Turkish Aerospace Industries, ranked as 61st and 70th in 2017, respectively. Although it is seen an increasing trend in the expenditures over 1960-2018 period, its share in GDP continuously falls over the same period, and reached to 2.5% in 2018. As the expenditures as a share of GDP, the industry ranks 27th in the world and 5th in Europe in 2018. When we examine per capita expenditures, it is seen an increasing trend over 1988-2018 period, and we see that there is five times increase from $50 in 1988 to $250 in 2010, and the industry ranks 46th in world with $232 per capita expenditure in 2018. When we analyze the share of expenditures in Turkish government spending over 2000-2018 period, it is found that the average is around 7% for 19 years, with the lowest 5.5% in 2015 and the highest 9.2% in 2000. As a share of government spending, there is a rapid downward trend in the expenditures from 2000 to 2015, this corresponds to 40% decrease, but this process is reversing after 2016, and reached to 7.1% in 2018.
L60|Why Export Is Hope For Economic Growth For North Macedonia|The development of international trade today represents one of the priorities of the world economies. Scientific studies dealing with the relationship between foreign trade and economic development are numerous and with no doubt increase the interest among the readers. As a result, researchers make a variety of analyzes and conclusions that presents valuable contributions to the science of economics. North Macedonia in its macroeconomic policy as a priority enlist the development of international trade. However, the trade balance in 2018 year revealed the existing problem of trade deficit, as again reached a very high percentage. This is a signal that warns the country?s economy in the present and in the future. The causes of this situation are various, but some are more fundamental. As one of the most was undoubtedly the global financial and economic crisis that were present especially in the European Union member countries. Countries being in this situation, reduced the demand for goods from the different companies from North Macedonia. But this is not the only reason for the difficult position of North Macedonia. Another unfavorable condition is the economic structure of the North Macedonian economy which perhaps is the most important reason. To get out of this situation, North Macedonia in the future must change its economic structure and should be oriented in producing goods that are required more in the global market. It cannot hope to compete in the world market with the goods that competes nowadays in order to be able to improve the balance of foreign trade.
L60|Euro Area Accession and its Effect on Manufacturing|A single currency could bring both benefits and challenges, hence, this paper examines one of the various dimensions of euro adoption. Moreover, although previous studies have illuminated the euro effect on inflation and trade, the research on manufacturing remains limited. The paper aims to make an assessment of whether euro area accession has an impact on industrial output in the context of the manufacturing sector, as this sector is considered to have a crucial role for sustainable economic growth. The research fits a panel regression model for seven-euro area member states from Central and Eastern Europe and covers a 16-year period from 2003 to 2018. The findings suggest that the participation in the monetary union might increase manufacturing turnover for its members.
L60|Does Import Competition Reduce Domestic Innovation? Evidence from the 'China Stock' and Firm-Level Data on Canadian Manufacturing|A key economic issue in Canada is the declining Business Enterprise Research and Development in manufacturing since the early 2000s. Accompanying this, the total factor productivity (TFP) growth in manufacturing slowed after 2000. However, there has not been a definitive explanation for these trends. To deepen our understanding of this phenomenon, we focus on the increasing Chinese import share in the total domestic absorption in Canadian manufacturing since the early 2000s, which appears to be driven by positive supply shocks within Chinese manufacturing. Based on a firm-level database covering all incorporated firms in Canadian manufacturing, we find that rising Chinese import competition led to declines in R&D expenditure and TFP growth within firms but reallocated employment towards more productive firms and induced less productive firms to exit. The negative within-effects were pronounced for firms that were initially smaller, less profitable, and less productive. These firms also experienced declines in their profit margins due to rising Chinese import competition while larger and better-performing firms did not. Our estimates imply that rising Chinese import competition can explain about 7 per cent of the total decline of $1.36 billion (2007 CAD) in R&D expenditure in Canadian manufacturing between 2005 and 2010. Although it led to declines in TFP within firms, the positive reallocation effects more than offset the negative within-effect. Had there been no increase in Chinese import competition between 2005 and 2010, TFP in Canadian manufacturing would have declined by 1.26 per cent per year instead of the actual 1.09 per cent per year over this period.
L60|The Evolution of Import Content of Production and Exports in Turkey: 2002-2017|This study explores the evolution of the import content of production and exports in Turkey for the 2002-2017 period. Using 2002 and 2012 input-output tables, we estimate the production and imported input use for the remaining years based on a large data set of production and foreign trade for 20 selected sectors, mostly from the manufacturing industry. Import requirement ratios, comprising both direct and indirect linkages, for each sector are calculated using the Leontief inverse matrix. Our findings indicate that import dependency increases for exports, but stays roughly the same for production over time. In general, the import content of production is below the import content of exports. This divergence can mainly be attributed to the services sector, which has relatively low import dependency, yet a significant share in production. Sectors with the highest import requirements are found to be those with higher capital and technology intensity such as coke and refined petroleum products, basic metals and motor vehicles. Agriculture, forestry, and fishery; service and mining sectors are found to have the lowest import requirements.
L60|What gains and distributional implications result from trade liberalization|This paper investigates the distributional impacts of trade liberalization across firms, consumers and workers. Using firm-product-level census data for Ecuador, we exploit exogenous tariff changes at entry to the World Trade Organization. We show that with input tariff cuts firms access higher quality and new input varieties. Consequently, firms increase their product scope and quality, while their production's skill-intensity increases and costs decrease. “Real” productivity (TFPG) increases only in the medium run, following adjustments to produce more and higher quality products. Positive immediate revenue productivity (TFPR) gains result because firms' markups increase. Consumers still gain as quality-adjusted prices decrease and varieties increase. Workers benefit differentially: skilled workers' wages rise compared to less skilled worker's wages. Input-tariff liberalization also has distributional impacts across firms. Only more productive firms with high markups increase product scope and quality and gain market shares. With output-trade liberalization the least productive firms decrease their product scope
L60|What a firm produces matters: diversi cation, coherence and performance of Indian manufacturing|Economic growth and development of a country involves accumulation of knowledge and dynamic capabilities (Cimoli et al., 2009). Past research has begun to investigate the capability accumulation and macro-economic development of countries and sectors (Dosi et al., 1990), also by means of introduction of new products (Hausmann and Rodrik, 2003). In this work, recognizing that firms are the actual domain in which production takes place, we focus on the firm-level process of capability accumulation and diversification in a developing country. We investigate the relationship between diversification (and coherent diversification) and firm performance by employing an extensive database of Indian manufacturing firms with detailed information on product mix of firms. We claim that such an understanding of firms' incentives to diversify is relevant not only for the corporate management, but also for the diversification of countries and thereby its development. First, we explore the reasons behind firms' strategy to diversify, i.e, which firms choose a broad product scope and whether the change in the scope of the firm results in improved performance in terms of firm profitability and sales growth. Second, we look at the idiosyncratic characteristics of different products, by emphasizing the synergies of a product line with respect to the overall product basket of the firm. In this line, we develop a measure that captures the synergies and economies of scope between different products, and observe that the firms' future performance crucially depend on the interactions between the products that comprise its basket. Overall, our results are consistent with an intangible- capabilities model of firm diversification: diversification results in improved firm performance if the firm has underused capabilities and the new production line is able to exploit them.
L60|Patent-Based News Shocks|In this paper we exploit ﬁrm-level data on patent grants and subsequent reactions of their stocks to identify technological news shocks. Changes in stock market valuations due to announcements of individual patent grants represent expected future increases in the technology level, which we refer to as patent-based news shocks. Our patent-based news shocks resemble diﬀusion news in that they do not aﬀect total factor productivity in the short-run but account for about 20 percent of its variations after ﬁve years. These shocks induce positive comovement between consumption, output, investment and hours. Unlike the existing empirical evidence, patent-based news shocks generate a positive response in inﬂation and the federal funds rate, in line with a standard New Keynesian model. Patenting activity in electronic and electrical equipment industries within the manufacturing sector and computer programming and data processing services within the services sector play a crucial role in driving our results.
L60|Multiproduct Firms and the Business Cycle|Multiproduct firms account for a large fraction of economic activity and are actively engaged in changing their product mix. In this paper, I investigate changes in product scope, the number of products that a firm offers, over the business cycle and decompose the impact of such changes on aggregate output. I use the Nielsen Retail Scanner data, the weekly transactions of U.S. consumer goods, for 2007-2014. I find that firm product scope is an important margin of adjustment. The changes at the new margin are procyclical on average and heterogeneous across firms. Such product scope changes affect aggregate consumption and output by changing the total number of products available in the market and by affecting firms' markups. This decomposition is shown in a model featuring heterogeneous multiproduct firms, oligopolistic competition and free firm entry. In a recession, lower average product scope implies a lower number of product varieties, which disincentivizes consumption. Additionally, since the most productive firms have higher market shares, as the data suggests, they charge higher markups as oligopolistic competitors. The implied average markup goes up and further decreases consumption.
L60|The gender gap in international trade: Female-run firms and the exporter productivity premium|Female-run firms are less likely to be exporters although they exert positive influence in various aspects in an economy and society. With a new and comprehensive data set on manufacturing plants, I investigate the exporter productivity premium of female-run firms in Germany. The results show that female-run firms gain a higher exporter-productivity premium than male-run firms. I find evidence for selection into exporting but no impact for learning from exporting for female-run exporting firms. These results give hint to discrimination barriers that female-run firms face when they are exporting as compared to male-run firm exporters.
L60|Firm heterogeneity, productivity, and the extensive margins of trade - differences between manufacturing firms in East and West Germany|I investigate the relationship between the extensive margins of imports and exports (the number of countries traded with and the number of goods traded) and firm productivity using a newly constructed and rich panel data set of German manufacturing firms for the years 2009-2014. I do for the first time construct a data set based on German trade data and firm data that accounts for the substantial change in the German register of firms statistics after 2012. The extensive margins are significantly and positively associated with firm-level productivity both for West and East German firms in cross-sectional estimations, which is in line with the previous literature. Productivity is higher in firms that import and export more goods and trade with more countries. However, results based on panel analyses reveal that especially for East German firms the relationship becomes insignificant when unobserved firm heterogeneity is controlled for. The results point to a high degree of firm heterogeneity, of factors that are relevant and differ within the firm only, for firms in East Germany.
L60|Produktportfolio-Management im Zeitalter der Digitalisierung|Dieses Papier beschäftigt sich mit dem Produktportfolio-Management (PPM) und seiner Rolle im Zeitalter der Digitalisierung. Während einige betonen, dass strategische, langfristige Planung und PPM in Zeiten kürzerer Produktlebenszyklen, digitaler Innovationen und disruptiver Geschäftsmodelle veraltet zu sein scheinen, betonen andere die zunehmende Bedeutung von PPM, die Notwendigkeit einer effektiven Ressourcenallokation und eines Risikoausgleichs bei der Integration von Smart Products und digitalen Produkt-Service-Systemen in bestehende Produktportfolios. In der Praxis ist die Aufgabe des Value Proposition Design und Portfoliomanagements oft auf verschiedene Geschäftseinheiten, Abteilungen und Rollen (z.B. Produktmanagement, New Product Business, Servicegeschäft, Digital Business) verteilt. Die Mehrheit der Unternehmen erkennt das Potenzial eines systematischen Produktportfoliomanagements noch nicht vollständig. Sowohl die Literatur als auch die Ergebnisse unserer empirischen Studie zeigen, dass ein systematischer Ansatz für das Produktportfolio-Management zu höheren Gewinnmargen und erfolgreicheren Innovationen führt. Um den Kundennutzen zu maximieren und die Effizienz zu steigern, ist ein integrierter Ansatz erforderlich. Basierend auf einem umfassenden Literaturüberblick stellt dieses Papier einen integrierten PPM-Rahmen vor. Es soll eine Grundlage für die Diskussion darüber geschaffen werden, wie PPM in Bezug auf physische Produkte, digitale Produkte, Dienstleistungen und Produkt-Dienstleistungssysteme im Zeitalter der Digitalisierung organisiert werden kann.
L60|Labour market power and the distorting effects of international trade|This article examines how trade shocks shape labour market imperfections that create market power in labour markets and prevent an efficient allocation of labour. I develop a framework for measuring such labor market distortions in monetary terms and document large degrees of those distortions in Germany's manufacturing sector. Import competition can only exert labor market disciplining effects when firms rather than workers have labour market power. Otherwise, export demand and import competition shocks tend to fortify existing distortions by amplifying labour market power structures. This diminishes the gains from trade compared to a model with perfectly competitive labour markets.
L60|Micro-mechanisms behind declining labour shares: Market power, production processes, and global competition|This article investigates how changing production processes and increasing market power at the firm level relate to a fall in Germany's manufacturing sector labour share. Coinciding with the fall of the labour share, I document a rise in firms' product and labour market power. Notably, labour market power is a more relevant source of firms' market power than product market power. Increasing product and labour market power, however, only account for 30% of the fall in the labour share. The remaining 70% are explained by a transition of firms towards less labour-intensive production activities. I study the role of final product trade in causing those secular movements. I find that rising foreign export demand contributes to a decline in the labour share by increasing labour market power within firms and by inducing a reallocation of economic activity from nonexporting-high-labour-share to exporting-low-labour-share firms.
L60|The Micro-economics of Export Supply: Firm-Level Evidence from Mexico|This paper uses firm-level data for Mexican exporters to understand how firm-level export decisions shape a country's aggregate exports. The data allows for a characterization of both the crosssectional distribution of Mexican exports, across destinations and across exporting firms, and of the time-series variation in aggregate exports and its relation to time-series variation in the export supply decisions of firms. It is found that the cross-sectional variation of exports is mostly accounted for the extensive margins of trade, particularly the extensive margin of number of products exported, while the time-series variation in aggregate exports is mostly accounted for by the intensive margin of trade, and in particular by the growth of exporting firms that retain their export status from year to year.
L60|Are global value chains receding? The jury is still out. Key findings from the analysis of deflated world trade in parts and components|In this article, we examine the dynamics of Global Value Chains (GVCs) since the 2000s. Did it show a marked expansion up to the Great Recession and did GVCs begin a downturn in the 2010s? To better understand the evolution of GVCs at the world level, we use very detailed trade data for 2000 to 2016, which distinguishes different production stages along the GVC. In particular, among intermediate goods, we focus on Parts and Components (P&C) rather than semi-finished products since the manufacture of P&C corresponds to activities more embedded in GVCs. We control, also, for the global business cycle and price effects using an original production stages deflator based on detailed bilateral trade unit-values. This new GVC indicator shows moderate growth over the study period with no trend reversal. In the electronics sector, where GVCs are particularly well-developed, we observe contrasting effects: the share in P&C trade for office machinery and computers has decreased, while it has increased in the case of telecommunications equipment, the flagship IT revolution industry. Also, counts of clients or suppliers by stages of production indicate higher and growing geographical diversity for P&C.
L60|Does Electrification Cause Industrial Development? Grid Expansion and Firm Turnover in Indonesia|I ask whether electrification causes industrial development. I combine newly digitized data from the Indonesian state electricity company with rich manufacturing census data. To understand when and how electrification can cause industrial development, I shed light on an important economic mechanism - firm turnover. In particular, I study the effect of the extensive margin of electrification (grid expansion) on the extensive margin of industrial development (firm entry and exit). To deal with endogenous grid placement, I build a hypothetical electric transmission grid based on colonial incumbent infrastructure and geographic cost factors. I find that electrification causes industrial development, represented by an increase in the number of manufacturing firms, manufacturing workers, and manufacturing output. Electrification increases firm entry rates, but also exit rates. Empirical tests show that electrification creates new industrial activity, as opposed to only reorganizing industrial activity across space. Higher turnover rates lead to higher average productivity and induce reallocation towards more productive firms in electrified areas. This is consistent with electrification lowering entry costs, increasing competition and forcing unproductive firms to exit more often. Without the possibility of entry or competitive effects of entry, the effects of electrification are likely to be smaller.
L60|Tales of the City: What Do Agglomeration Cases Tell Us About Agglomeration in General?|This paper considers the heterogeneous microfoundations of agglomeration economies. It studies the co-location of industries to look for evidence of labor pooling, input sharing, and knowledge spillovers. The novel contribution of the paper is that it estimates single-industry models using a common empirical framework that exploits the cross-sectional variation in how one industry co-locates with the other industries in the economy. This unified approach yields evidence on the relative importance of the Marshallian microfoundations at the single-industry level, allowing for like-for-like cross-industry comparisons on the determinants of agglomeration. Using UK data, we estimate such microfoundations models for 97 manufacturing sectors, including the classic agglomeration cases of automobiles, computers, cutlery, and textiles. These four cases – as with all of the individual industry models we estimate – clearly show the importance of the Marshallian forces. However, they also highlight how the importance of these forces varies across industries – implying that extrapolation from cases should be viewed with caution. The paper concludes with an investigation of the pattern of heterogeneity. The degree of an industry’s clustering (localization), dynamism, incumbent firm size, and worker education are shown to contribute to the pattern of heterogeneous microfoundations.
L60|Trade Induced Technological Change: Did Chinese Competition Increase Innovation in Europe?|Bloom, Draca, and Van Reenen (2016) find that Chinese competition induced a rise in patenting, IT adoption, and TFP by 30% of the total increase in Europe in the early 2000s. We find that the average patents per firm fell by 94% for the most Chinacompeting firms in their sample, but also by 94% for non-competing firms (starting from an initially higher level), and that various intuitive controls, such as controls for sectoral trends, renders the impact on patents-per-firm insignificant. We also find that while TFP appears to be positively correlated with the rise in Chinese competition, IV estimates are inconclusive, and other measures of productivity, such as value-added per worker and profits, are not correlated. Various instrumental and proxy variable approaches also do not support a positive impact of the rise of China on European patents.
L60|Los límites del crecimiento económico en la frontera norte de México|La frontera norte de México ha jugado un papel estratégico en el desarrollo nacional. A partir de la implementación del Programa de Industrialización Fronteriza, cuyo eje fue la Industria Maquiladora de Exportación, las ciudades de esta región experimentaron una transformación socioeconómica radical y varias de ellas se convirtieron en las más dinámicas del país. No obstante, luego de casi cuarenta años, las crisis de principios del siglo XXI revelaron serias limitaciones estructurales del modelo de crecimiento maquilador las que, a la postre, arrojaron como saldo una región fronteriza vulnerable, lejana del potencial de crecimiento económico y el espacio de bienestar que se esperaba. En este ensayo se hace una reflexión de los límites del crecimiento económico de la frontera norte de México resaltando los problemas de ingreso, inversión, acumulación, distribución e innovación que han sido en gran medida los principales obstáculos para su desarrollo.
L60|Educación en Colombia: Un análisis regional|Uno de los retos que tiene el país en materia de políticas públicas es mejorar la cobertura, calidad, la equidad y la pertinencia en su sistema educativo, como uno de los pilares claves para mejorar la equidad social y la prosperidad económica. En esa vía, el país ha mostrado avances importantes en sus indicadores educativos, pero que aún no son suficientes para alcanzar la meta de ser el país más educado de la región, sobre todo se evidencian importantes brechas y diferencias entre los departamentos y regiones del país, que son necesario cerrar para lograr ese propósito. En este documento se muestra las diferencias en algunos indicadores educativos entre departamentos, como las tasas de asistencia neta, los promedios educativos e indicadores de calidad, entre otros, que contribuyen a entender las mencionadas brechas. Adicionalmente, se estima un modelo mixto tipo jerárquico que permitió estimar el efecto que sobre la calidad (Saber11) tienen los diferentes eslabones del proceso educativo: individual, el establecimiento y las características de los entes territoriales. Se encontró que en promedio para el país el más importante es el individuo (67%), seguido del establecimiento (27%) y un 6% el territorial.
L60|The impact of real exchange rate shocks on manufacturing workers: An autopsy from the MORG|We study the impact of large real exchange rate shocks on workers in sectors initially more exposed to international trade using the Current Population Survey’s (CPS) Merged Outgoing Rotation Group (MORG) from 1979 to 2010 combined with new annual measures of imported inputs, a proxy for offshoring. We find that in periods when US relative prices are high, and imports surge relative to exports, workers in sectors with greater initial exposure to international trade were more likely to be unemployed or exit the labor force a year later, but did not experience significant declines in wages conditional on being employed. Contrary to the usual narrative, we find negative wage effects for higher-wage, but not lower-wage workers, particularly for those who are less-educated.
L60|Working Paper 299 - The Structure and Performance of the Ethiopian Manufacturing Sector|Although Ethiopia has emerged as one of Africa’s fastest-growing economies, its manufacturing sector is still far from being an engine of growth and economic transformation. It currently plays a marginal role in employment creation, exports, and output, and falls short on stimulating domestic linkages. The sector is dominated by small firms and resource-based industries, low-value and low technology products, and weak inter-sectoral and intra-sectoral linkages. The manufacturing sector’s export orientation has been low and stagnant. Based on data and evidence from the past 25 years, the paper provides an in-depth analysis of the structure. and performance of the Ethiopian manufacturing sector and further explores the reasons behind the ‘paradox’ of the slow growth of industrial outputs and structural shifts. Since the mid-2010s, however, there are some promising signals that the manufacturing sector might be coming out of its doldrums and showing positive dynamics. The paper summarizes the growing challenges of building an industrial workforce and domestic capability, together with export capacity. The findings from this study show a bias for hope, as well as a potential structural transformation. JEL classification: L16, L60, L67, 014.

L60|Foreign Multinationals and Vietnamese Firm Exports, 2010-2013| This paper examines the role foreign multinational enterprises (MNEs) played in Vietnamese firm exports during 2010-2013. Consistent with patterns observed in commodity export data, MNEs are found to account for the majority of firm exports during this period. Wholly-foreign MNEs (WFs), which accounted for the vast majority of MNE production in Vietnam, accounted for most MNE exports. Both WFs and MNE joint ventures (JV) made larger direct contributions to exports than to production or employment, as observed in other Asian developing economies. There was a strong tendency for WFs to have the highest export propensities (export-turnover ratios) followed by JVs. Manufacturing firms exported over four-fifths of the total in most years. Tobit estimates that controlled for the effects of firm size, capital intensity, liquidity, location, and industry affiliation for manufacturers indicate WFs also had the highest conditional export propensities, followed by JVs, private firms, while export propensities tended to be similar in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and private firms in most industries. Because Vietnam imposes few ownership restrictions on MNEs, these results imply that MNEs generally prefer to export from WFs rather than JVs, and are consistent with previous results for Thailand and Indonesia, for example.
L60|Foreign Ownership and Exports of Thai Manufacturing Plants by Industry in 1996| This paper investigates how foreign multinational enterprises (MNEs) contributed to exports by Thai manufacturing plants at the industry level in 2006. The mean export-sales ratio (export propensities) in heavily-foreign MNEs with foreign ownership shares of 90 percent or more exceeded 50 percent and heavily-foreign MNEs accounted for one-third of plant exports. Minority-foreign (10-49% foreign shares) and majority-foreign (50-89% shares) MNEs combined to account for another one-fifth of plant exports but had lower export propensities, about 30 percent and 40 percent, respectively. The mean export propensity for local plants in 20 sample industries was only 15 percent. In large samples of all 20 industries combined, econometric estimates controlling for industry affiliation with intercept dummies as well as the effects of the scale, age, factor intensities or labor productivity, and BOI-promotion status of plants also indicated that export propensities were the highest in heavily-foreign MNEs, followed by majority-foreign MNEs, minority-foreign MNEs, and lastly by local plants. Moreover, ownership-related differences in export propensities were highly significant statistically. When inter-industry heterogeneity was more fully accounted for by allowing slope coefficients as well as intercepts to differ among the 20 industries, export propensities were the highest in heavily-foreign MNEs and significantly higher than in local plants in 12 industries. However, differences among MNE ownership groups were usually insignificant and MNE-local differentials in export propensities differed substantially among industries, suggesting it is important account for inter-industry heterogeneity as fully as possible.
L60|Financial constraints, institutions, and foreign ownership|We develop a model of cross-border acquisitions in which the foreign acquirer's ownership choice reflects a trade-off between easing the target's credit constraints and the costs of operating in an environment with weak institutions. Data on domestic and foreign acquisitions in emerging markets over the period 1990–2007 support the model predictions. The share of full foreign acquisitions is higher in sectors more reliant on external finance, in countries with lower financial development, and in countries with higher institutional quality. Sectoral external finance dependence accentuates the effect of country-level financial development and institutional quality. By contrast, the level of foreign ownership in partial acquisitions is insensitive to institutional factors and depends weakly on financial factors.
L60|Recent trends in economic activity and TFP in Italy with a focus on embodied technical progress|In this paper we provide fresh evidence on TFP performance in the Italian economy since 1995, taking into account the changing composition of primary inputs across different capital goods and employment skills, as well as technical progress embodied in different vintages of the productive assets. We first estimate a technical depreciation rate by using individual data on Italian industrial firms. We then obtain an experimental measure of the capital stock adjusted for technical efficiency, by augmenting the standard depreciation rate by our own estimate of technical depreciation (about 5 per cent per year). Once we introduce our measure of capital stock in a standard growth accounting exercise, we find a less dismal performance of the Italian TFP than usually estimated. Focusing on the years between 2007 and 2016, the upward correction in TFP amounts to around 1.5 percentage points in the overall period for the total economy and to about 2.5 percentage points when only considering manufacturing. These findings shed a somewhat more positive light on future TFP developments in Italy, suggesting a more rapid increase of potential output than otherwise estimated. In addition, the efficiency of installed capital might soon return to growth, as the expected recovery of investment results in the replacement of old vintages with new and more technically advanced ones.
L60|The Effect of Uncertainty on Foreign Direct Investment: the Case of Mexico|This paper investigates the effect of uncertainty on FDI flows into the Mexican manufacturing sector during the period 2007-2015. Using a panel of manufacturing subsectors, we estimate a model by System GMM that includes domestic and external factors, as well as idiosyncratic (i.e. that affect manufacturing subsectors in a particular way) and aggregate (i.e. that affect all manufacturing subsectors in general) uncertainty measures as explicative variables. We also perform some simulations to quantify the effect of uncertainty on FDI flows. The main results show that uncertainty discourages FDI flows into the Mexican manufacturing sector. We also find that the idiosyncratic uncertainty measures are more important in explaining FDI flows than the aggregate uncertainty measures, with the exception of the global risk aversion index.

L60|Productivity Growth and Levels - A comparison of Formal and Informal Manufacturing in India|A comparative analysis of total factor productivity (TFP) growth in the formal and informal segments of Indian manufacturing industries is undertaken, along with an analysis of differences in the level of TFP between the two segments of these industries. The period covered for the analysis of TFP growth is 1980-81 (1980) to 2011-12 (2011), which is broken into three-sub-periods, 1980-1993, 1994-2002 and 2003-2011. The period covered for the analysis of TFP level differences is 2003-04 to 2011-12. From the analysis of TFP growth trends, it is found that the average growth rate in TFP in the informal manufacturing sector during 1980-2011 was significantly lower than that in the formal manufacturing sector (0.6% per annum as against 4.4% per annum, based on value added function framework). Both formal and informal manufacturing experienced a fall in the rate of TFP growth during 1994-2002 as compared to 1980-1993, and then achieved a marked acceleration in TFP growth during 2003-11. The acceleration in TFP growth in aggregate formal manufacturing in India in the period since 2003 is contributed mainly by improved TFP growth performance of Coke and refined petroleum products industry with additional contributions made by Food, beverages and tobacco products, Chemicals and chemical products, and Textiles and leather products. In the case of informal manufacturing, the acceleration in TFP growth after 2003 is mainly traceable to the improved TFP growth performance of Textiles and leather products industry with additional contributions made by Wood and wood products, Food, beverages and tobacco products, and Chemicals and chemical products. The comparison of the level of TFP between the formal and informal segments of Indian manufacturing industries for the period 2003-2011 brings out that it is substantially lower in informal manufacturing than formal manufacturing.
L60|New Perspectives on the Decline of US Manufacturing Employment|We use relatively unexplored dimensions of US microdata to examine how US manufacturing employment has evolved across industries, firms, establishments, and regions. These data provide support for both trade- and technology-based explanations of the overall decline of employment over this period, while also highlighting the difficulties of estimating an overall contribution for each mechanism. Toward that end, we discuss how more careful analysis of these trends might yield sharper insights.
L60|Decentralized Environmental Regulations and Plant-Level Productivity|Using a unique plant-level dataset we examine total factor productivity (TFP) growth and its components, related to efficiency change and technical change. The data we use is from Sweden and for their pulp and paper industry, which is heavily regulated due to its historically large contribution to air and water pollution. Our paper contributes to the broader empirical literature on the Porter Hypothesis, which posits a positive relationship between environmental regulation and “green” TFP growth of firms. Our exercise is innovative as Sweden has a unique regulatory structure where the manufacturing plants have to comply with plant-specific regulatory standards stipulated at the national level, as well as decentralized local supervision and enforcement. Our key findings are: (1) prudential regulation limits expansion of plants with high initial pollution; (2) regulation, however, is not conducive to plants’ “green” technical change, which provides evidence against the recast version of the Porter Hypothesis; (3) decentralized command-and-control regulation is prone to regulatory bias, entailing politically motivated discriminatory treatment of plants with otherwise equal characteristics.
L60|Firms and Labor in Times of Violence: Evidence from the Mexican Drug War|I study urban violence due to drug trafficking and how it affects the industrial development in an emerging economy. Employing rich longitudinal plant-level data over 2005-2010 that covers all of Mexico, and exploiting plausibly exogenous spatiotemporal variation in homicide rates during the outbreak of violence in Mexico commonly referred to as the Mexican Drug War, I show that a violent environment has significant negative impact on manufacturing plants’ output, product scope, employment and capacity utilization. Violence generates a negative blue-collar labor supply shock, leading to significant increase in skill-intensity within firms. It also deters internal, but not international, trade. The effect of the violence shock on firms is very heterogeneous: the output effect of violence increases with reliance on local demand and sourcing, and the employment effect of violence is stronger on plants with higher shares of lower-wage and female workers. The results reveal significant distortive effects of the rise of violence on domestic industrial development in Mexico and suggest that the Mexican Drug War accounted for the majority of the aggregate decline in manufacturing employment in Mexico over the sample period.
L60|The involvement in global value chains and its policy implication in Vietnam|This article examines the involvement pattern in global value chains (GVCs) with its policy implication in Vietnam, in comparison with those of the other Asian countries, by using the OECD value-added-trade data. The study first identified the “smile curve” as the average pattern of the Asian GVCs development paths in total manufactures, in which the domestic value share to exports declines at the early development stage and regains itself at the later stage with the turning point being at 2,015 US dollars as per capita GDP. The study then found that the Vietnamese economy stood at the critical position in its GVCs development path, such that the Vietnamese current per capita GDP is very close to 2,015 US dollars, the Asian average turning point in total manufactures. The sectoral analysis in Vietnam also implied that sophisticated manufacturing sectors needs to be transformed from only assembling activities toward developing domestic capacities to produce parts and components. The Government policies in Vietnam thus matter to nurture local productive capacities, and the “enterprise clustering” and “linkages development” should be the key strategies to facilitate technological transfers from international firms to local ones in line with the GVCs involvement.
L60|Export Survival of Manufacturing Firms in Ethiopia:Empirical Evidence|This study used panel data for manufacturing firms from 2006 to 2016 to analyze the patterns and determinants of export survival of exporting firms in Ethiopia. The empirical investigation has two parts: non-parametric and semi-parametric methods. The non-parametric method analyzes the survivor function and the hazard (exit) rate of firms on the whole sample and by groups, while the semi-parametric analyzes a regression outputs based on the discrete-time model of proportional hazard model. The result from the survivor function analysis shows that, at the end of the study period, the number of firms that survive in export market are more than 50%. Moreover, the result of the hazard rate reveals as the duration of time increases, the rate at which firms exit the export market decreases sharply. With regard to our semi-parametric analyses, we examine the factors that affect survival of manufacturing firms in international market and observed the direction of the impacts they have on the survival rates. The findings show that large and medium firms, firms that have higher productivity, export oriented firms, private owned enterprises, firms located in textile and garment industries, firms located outside Addis Ababa and firms categorized as importers have higher probability of staying in export markets than the others.
L60|Analysis of the “Dutch Disease” effect and public financial management: the case of Mongolia|This paper aims to diagnose Mongolian economy on whether the economy has suffered from the Dutch Disease by applying a vector auto-regression model for the period from 1993 to 2016 under the current market-based regime including resource-booming times. From the outcomes of a VAR model estimation, it was found that there is a great possibility that Mongolian economy has been suffering from the Dutch Disease through the resource movement effect and the spending effect such that the boom in the mining sector has crowded out manufacturing activities; and that the boom in the mining sector has not contributed to, or even deteriorated the capital accumulation effect that alleviates the Dutch Disease. The strategic policy implications for the current Mongolian public financial management are that the part of the existing resource fund should be used for public investment to facilitate capital accumulation, specifically, for the projects on education, health and economic infrastructure to promote industrial diversification.
L60|Exploring Determinants of Productivity in Pakistani Manufacturing Firms|This study examines the determinants of productivity among manufacturing firms in Pakistan using firm level data gathered in the World Bank Enterprise Survey of 2007. The research econometrically investigates the impact of various structural, organizational and technological characteristics of firms on the level of Total Factor Productivity (TFP). Findings of The study suggest thatfactors which enhance the firms’ performance and level of productivity include; foreign ownership, use of information and communication technology, schooling of production workers, presence of labor welfare programs, access to international market and use of innovative production process. In contrast, unionization of workforce and power outages are negatively associated with TFP
L60|Industry rates of return in Korea and alternative theories of competition: equalising convergence versus tendential equalisation|This paper considers convergence and equalisation in industry profit rates in the Republic of Korea in the period of 1970–2015, from the perspective of alternative paradigms of competition – classical and neoclassical. Two measures of profitability are estimated: average rate of profit based on the total capital stock in the economy, and incremental rate of profit (IROP) based on the concept of regulating capital. It is shown that little convergence in industry rates of profit occur when the former measure is used, while almost complete equalisation of IROP is achieved. The classical-type equalisation takes place in particular capital accumulation and competitive settings in Korea, characterised by the prominent role of diversified conglomerate firms, the capital flows within conglomerates, investment coordination by the state, and the fast pace of capital accumulation and renewal).
L60|Domestic value creation in the involvement in global value chains: Evidence of China|This paper examines how the Chinese economy has been involved in global value chains from the perspective of domestic value creation, by using the OECD value-added-trade data (OECD TiVA database). This study contributes to the existing literature by decomposing the domestic value creation into a direct effect from export industries and an indirect effect from the other supporting industries. The empirical estimation first identified the “smile curve” in the “indirect” domestic value creation in total manufactures as the average pattern of the Asian GVCs development paths, in which the domestic value share to exports declines at the early development stage and regains itself at the later stage with the turning point being at 1,830 US dollars as per capita GDP. Then the analysis confirmed the position of Chinese economy, which has already passed the Asian average turning point and has entered the phase of regaining the domestic value share to exports. Finally, the analysis found that the domestic value creation in China has originated from the development of supporting industries, in particular, service industries, which might reflect the progress in basic infrastructure there.
L60|Modeling the effect of competition using robust conditional nonparametric frontiers: Evidence from U.S. manufacturing sector|The study applies the probabilistic framework of nonparametric frontier estimation in order to model the effect of competitive conditions on sectors’ production efficiency levels. We utilize conditional Order-m robust frontiers modeling the dynamic effects of competitive conditions on a sample of 462 U.S. 6-digit manufacturing sectors over the period 1958-2009. The results derived from the time-dependent robust conditional estimators unveil a non-linear relationship between market competition and productive efficiency. Our findings suggest that for higher competitive conditions the effect is positive up to a certain threshold point after which the effect becomes negative.
L60|Technological Trajectories and FDI: Top Bananas and Underdogs|Previous empirical evidence searching for externalities from Foreign Direct investment in Portugal showed mixed results. Using a new database containing 5,045 Portuguese manufacturing firms grouped by technological trajectories, we investigate the occurrence and magnitude of externalities from FDI in 1995-2007. We find both positive and negative externalities in scale-intensive and supplier-dominated industries. The magnitude of externalities is higher in the current period than in lagged periods. Because positive externalities outweigh the negative externalities, on the whole a 1% increase in foreign presence (measured by turnover) increases the Total Factor Productivity of domestic firms by 0.42 percentage points. Thus, the Investment Promoting Agency should attract foreign projects in those technological groups.
L60|Can Chinese foreign direct investment promote industrialization in African countries?|This paper investigates the relationship between Chinese foreign direct investment and industrialization for 41 African countries over the period 2003-2015. Based on System Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), empirical findings show that Chinese foreign direct investment did not significantly influence the industrialization process in African countries.
L60|Domestic value creation in global value chains in Asian economies|This article examines the structural changes in domestic value creation in exports in the involvement process of global value chains with a focus on eight Asian economies, through the quantitative analyses using the updated OECD value-added-trade data. The major research questions are: what is an average turning point in terms of per capita GDP in regaining domestic value added share to exports, and which industries, the export industry or supporting industries, have contributed to regaining domestic value added share to exports. The empirical analyses using the dynamic panel analysis, the vector auto-regression estimation for causality tests and the sectoral observation of the decomposed domestic value creations in all the sample economies could identify an accurate turning point at 2,270 US dollars as per capita GDP in regaining domestic value added share to exports, and could also show that the supporting industries including service sector, rather than the exporting industry itself, have played an active role to push up the domestic value added share to exports in the involvement process of global value chains.
L60|R&D expenditures - growth nexus in Turkey|Technological development and investment in knowledge seem to be very important in order for countries to demonstrate effective growth performance. The first concept that comes to mind when investing in information is the R&D activities. In the past, efforts to develop in countries for years can be realized within months nowadays and technological developments have rapidly changed and can be worn out in a short period of time. Therefore, it can be said that the information economy is the speed economy. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between R&D expenditures and GDP in Turkey for the period 1996-2014 with the help of VAR analysis. Before the study, it was determined whether the series were stationary by Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Peron (PP) unit root tests and it was determined that the variables of GDP and R&D expenditure were stationary in the level values. According to the results of variance decomposition and effect-response functions; It is seen that the effect of GDP changes in Turkey on R&D expenditures is negligible. However, it is seen that R&D expenditures are significantly affected by the changes in GDP. Ülkelerin etkili bir büyüme performansı gösterebilmesi için teknolojik gelişmenin ve bilgiye yatırım yapılmasının oldukça önemli olduğu görülmektedir. Bilgiye yapılan yatırım denilince de ilk akla gelen kavram Ar-Ge faaliyetleridir. Geçmişte ülkelerde yıllarca devam eden gelişme çabaları günümüzde aylar içinde gerçekleşebilmekte ve teknolojik gelişmeler hızlı bir şekilde değişim göstererek kısa bir süre içinde yıpranabilmektedir. Dolayısıyla bilgi ekonomisinin hız ekonomisi olduğu söylenebilir. Bu çalışmanın amacı, Türkiye’de 1996-2014 dönemi için Ar-Ge harcamaları ve GSYİH arasındaki ilişkiyi VAR analizi yardımıyla araştırmaktır. Çalışmada önce durağanlığın belirlenmesi için Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) ve Phillips-Peron (PP) birim kök testiyle serilerin durağan olup olmadıkları belirlenmiş ve GSYİH ile Ar-Ge harcamaları değişkenlerinin seviye değerlerinde durağan oldukları tespit edilmiştir. Varyans ayrıştırma ve etki-tepki fonksiyonlarına ait sonuçlara göre; Türkiye’de GSYİH değişimlerinin Ar-Ge harcamaları üzerinde etkisinin yok denilebilecek kadar az olduğu görülmüştür. Ancak Ar-Ge harcamalarının GSYİH’daki değişimlerden oldukça etkilendiği görülmektedir

L60|Adjustment to Trade Opening: The Case of Labor Share in India's Manufacturing Industry|We study how manufacturing plants in India adjusted to trade liberalization during the period 1998–1999 to 2007–2008. We estimate how the labor share changed due to tariff reduction. Our results indicate that a decline in output tariffs led to an increase in the labor share of income. In contrast, a fall in input tariffs led to a decrease in the labor share. Controlling for factor intensity, we find that in technology-intensive and human capital resource-intensive sectors, both a decline in input and output tariff rates led to a decline in labor share. A fall in tariffs only led to an increase in labor share for labor-intensive and low-technology plants. Hence, India’s bias toward capital- and technology-intensive production explains the overall decline in labor share in the post reform period. Furthermore, the empirical results show that labor adjustment occurred more efficiently in Indian states with flexible labor laws.
L60|Capital–energy substitutability in manufacturing sectors: methodological and policy implications|Abstract The debate on the capacity of the production system to adequate to a low-carbon economy is addressed by computing the capital–energy substitution elasticities $$(\sigma_{KE} )$$ ( σ KE ) for manufacturing sectors. We estimated the $$\sigma_{KE}$$ σ KE at aggregate level for the whole manufacturing industry and for 10 distinguished sectors for 21 OECD countries (1990–2008); average substitution values are also computed at sector level comparing alternative econometric methods and for separate sub-periods to trace the time dynamics. Such methodology allows assessing how different sectors could respond to the introduction of new (energy saving) technologies, as in terms of factor productivity and substitutability opportunities. This corresponds to a dynamic evaluation of the speed of reaction of each sector in improving its energy efficiency and the capacity to be on track in a sustainable transition. Such assessment also helps policy makers to individuate sectors deserving transition support according to the speed of adjustment of elasticity values over time.
L60|The appearance of digitalisation among the viewpoints of Balanced Scorecard|In the early 1990s, Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton developed a balanced evaluation- and index-system that supports the implementation of the strategy. This strategic control tool is the Balanced Scorecard which approaches and evaluates the company's activities and strategy from several perspectives, viewpoints. Today, one of the most important trend is the Industry 4.0 which creates intelligent, networked value chains through cyber-physical systems. Planning and deploying this is not easy but as a strategic issue it must appear in the Balanced Scorecard. Indicators to assist in the implementation of Industry 4.0 should be built in. We are reviewing the importance of Industry 4.0 and developing a Balanced Scorecard model that includes the factors that help to implement the strategy at Industry 4.0.
L60|En quoi la dépense d'investissement des entreprises françaises est-elle énigmatique ?|Cette étude offre une description et caractérisation de l’investissement des entreprises françaises. Tout d'abord, la dépense d'investissement des entreprises françaises est soutenue en valeur absolue et en intensité (taux d'investissement) relativement à ses partenaires. Si la crise a affecté fortement l'investissement des entreprises françaises, celui-ci a continûment augmenté depuis les 20 dernières années. Ce qui caractérise la France, c'est une évolution moins cyclique relativement aux autres pays et une augmentation tendancielle du taux d'investissement avec ou sans construction. Il est frappant aussi d'observer la proximité des taux d'investissement allemands et français en niveau et en évolution hors investissement de construction sur l'ensemble du secteur marchand. Ensuite, l'investissement français se singularise par une faiblesse des investissements en équipements et machines alors qu'au contraire les investissements en actifs immatériels comme la R&D et les logiciels et bases de données sont importants dans la dépense d'investissement.

La faiblesse de l'intensité en robots résulte de la faiblesse de la part du manufacturier et notamment du secteur de l'électronique.
L60|A Statistical Analysis of Industrial Penetration and Internet Intensity in Taiwan|This paper investigates the effect of industrial penetration (geographic concentration of industries) and internet intensity (the proportion of enterprises that use the internet) for Taiwan manufacturing firms, and analyses whether the relationships are substitutes or complements. The sample observations are based on 153,081 manufacturing plants, and covers 26 two-digit industry categories and 358 geographical townships in Taiwan. The Heckman selection model is used to accommodate sample selectivity for unobservable data for firms that use the internet. The empirical results from two-stage estimation show that: (1) a higher degree of industrial penetration will not affect the probability that firms will use the internet, but will affect the total expenditure on internet intensity; (2) for two-digit SIC industries, industrial penetration generally decreases the total expenditure on internet intensity; and (3) industrial penetration and internet intensity are substitutes.

L60|Digital technology adoption and knowledge flows within firms: Can the Internet overcome geographic and technological distance?|Under what conditions does digital technology adoption increase cross location knowledge flows within firms? We investigate this question by studying the impact of adopting basic Internet access on cross-location knowledge flows within the same firm. We construct a large data set of Internet adoption and patent citations among dyadic pairs of firm-locations between 1992-1998. We find that when both locations in the pair adopt basic Internet there is an increase in the likelihood of a citation between the citing and (potential) cited location. In contrast, we find no significant effect of Internet adoption at only the citing location. We further study how this effect varies according to the proximity of the research activities between the source and recipient of knowledge and specialization of the research activities within the recipient. We find that the likelihood of a citation increases more after dyadic Internet adoption when the pair is working in similar research areas and when the research areas in the citing location are less specialized. These results, which are robust to a range of robustness analyses, suggest that digital technologies such as Internet connectivity are able to facilitate knowledge flows between locations only when they share a common knowledge base.
L60|Back on Track? A Macro–Micro Narrative of Italian Exports|Abstract Using both macro and firm-level data, we provide an in-depth analysis of Italy’s goods exports relative to its three main trading partners (Germany, France and Spain) in order to gauge the causes of its relative underperformance prior to the 2008–2009 crisis and to assess whether the improvement observed since 2010 reflects cyclical or structural factors. We argue that Italy’s relatively unsatisfactory performance in the 2000s was the result of the interplay between the appreciation of its real effective exchange rate, its specialization in products that were particularly exposed to increasing competition from China, and the size distribution of its exporters, skewed towards small firms. In recent years signs of structural improvement have emerged, alongside cyclical factors, in connection with a shift in the specialization of exports towards sectors that are less exposed to competitive pressures; moreover, the selection process triggered by the exceptional difficulties encountered by micro and small firms both before and during the global financial crisis have plausibly strengthened the population of Italian exporters, making it structurally more resilient to exchange rate appreciations and more capable of keeping pace with external demand developments.
L60|Firm Size and Innovation in the Service Sector|A rich literature links knowledge inputs with innovative outputs. However, most of what is known is restricted to manufacturing. This paper analyzes whether the three aspects involving innovative activity - R&D; innovative output; and productivity - hold for knowledge intensive services. Combining the models of Crepon et al. (1998) and of Ackerberg et al. (2015), allows for causal interpretation of the relationship between innovation output and labor productivity. We find that knowledge intensive services benefit from innovation activities in the sense that these activities causally increase their labor productivity. Moreover, the firm size advantage found for manufacturing in previous studies nearly disappears for knowledge intensive services.
L60|Regional knowledge, entrepreneurial culture, and innovative start-ups over time and space―an empirical investigation|Abstract We investigate the role of entrepreneurship culture and the historical knowledge base of a region on current levels of new business formation in innovative industries. The analysis is for German regions and covers the time period 1907–2014. We find a pronounced positive relationship between high levels of historical self-employment in science-based industries and new business formation in innovative industries today. This long-term legacy effect of entrepreneurial tradition indicates the prevalence of a regional culture of entrepreneurship. Moreover, local presence and geographic proximity to a technical university founded before the year 1900 is positively related to the level of innovative start-ups more than a century later. The results show that a considerable part of the knowledge that constitutes an important source of entrepreneurial opportunities is deeply rooted in history. We draw conclusions for policy and for further research.
L60|Computerization, labor productivity and employment: impacts across industries vary with technological level|Technical progress notably through computerization raises concerns about the future of labor. In parallel, productivity became sluggish in many developed countries and computers are everywhere but not in all productivity statistics, especially not among non IT producing manufacturing industries in the United States (Acemoglu, Autor, Dorn, Hanson, and Price, 2014). To observe whether job losses and missing labor productivity gains from computerization are localized in the same part of the manufacturing sector, this paper delves into targeted disaggregated focuses in France between 1994 and 2007. As computers can be used as complements or substitutes for labor depending on the (non-) routine nature of tasks, we concentrate on low-tech vs. mid/high tech industries and on high-skilled vs. low-skilled workers. Our main results are the following. Contrary to the United States, labor productivity is not driven to a large extent by IT-producing industries. Yet, for the whole IT-using manufacturing sector, computerization is associated with positive but fragile effects on labor productivity, and to unambiguous declines in employment. Actually, a labor saving effect of computerization is massively concentrated among industries relying on low production technology. For mid/high-tech IT-using industries, evidence is less straightforward on labor productivity. Among them, computerization is not associated to job cuts whatever the job type, and is related to a rise in the share of high-skilled workers. In the end, computerization could go in hand in hand with economy wide structural changes, with strong productivity improvements in declining sectors and labor deepening in rising ones.
L60|Below the Aggregate: A Sectoral Account of the UK Productivity Puzzle|We analyse new industry-level data to re-examine the UK productivity puzzle. We carry out an accounting exercise that allows us to distinguish general macroeconomic patterns from sector trends and idiosyncrasies, providing a roadmap for anyone interested in explaining the puzzle. We focus on the UK market sector. Average annual labour productivity growth was 2.5 percentage points lower during the period 2011-2015 than in the decade before the financial crisis that began in 2007. We find that several years on from the financial crisis stagnation remains widespread across detailed industry divisions, pointing to economy-wide explanations for the puzzle. With some exceptions, labour productivity growth lost most momentum in those industries that experienced strong growth before the crisis. Three fifths of the gap is accounted for by a few industries that together account for less than one fifth of market sector value added. In terms of why we observe continued stagnation, we find that capital shallowing has become increasingly important in explaining the labour productivity growth gap in service sectors, as the buoyancy of the UK labour market has not been sufficiently matched by investment, although our figures suggest that the majority of the productivity gap is accounted for by a TFP gap. The collapse in labour productivity growth has been more pronounced in the UK than elsewhere, but the broad sector patterns of productivity stagnation are in many respects similar across other advanced economies, emphasising the importance of global explanations for the puzzle. UK industries that saw the biggest reductions in productivity growth tended to be internationally competitive and more dependent on global demand than other industries. They were also industries where productivity is difficult to measure.

L60|En quoi la dépense d’investissement des entreprises françaises est-elle énigmatique ?|Cette étude offre une description et caractérisation de l’investissement des entreprises françaises. Tout d'abord, la dépense d'investissement des entreprises françaises est soutenue en valeur absolue et en intensité (taux d'investissement) relativement à ses partenaires. Si la crise a affecté fortement l'investissement des entreprises françaises, celui-ci a continûment augmenté depuis les 20 dernières années. Ce qui caractérise la France, c'est une évolution moins cyclique relativement aux autres pays et une augmentation tendancielle du taux d'investissement avec ou sans construction. Il est frappant aussi d'observer la proximité des taux d'investissement allemands et français en niveau et en évolution hors investissement de construction sur l'ensemble du secteur marchand.Ensuite, l'investissement français se singularise par une faiblesse des investissements en équipements et machines alors qu'au contraire les investissements en actifs immatériels comme la R&D et les logiciels et bases de données sont importants dans la dépense d'investissement. Si on observe le taux d'investissement dans les actifs matériels hors construction, la France sous- performe par rapport à ses partenaires. Enfin, la trajectoire du secteur manufacturier relativement aux autres secteurs explique une grande partie des caractéristiques de l'investissement du secteur marchand. La faiblesse del'intensité en robots résulte de la faiblesse de la part du manufacturier et notamment du secteurde l'électronique.
L60|Electricity and manufacturing firm profits in Myanmar|We examine the impact of being located in areas with higher availability of electricity on manufacturing firm profits in Myanmar. Using a survey of 497 manufacturing firms conducted in 2014 and covering the whole territory of Myanmar, we investigate whether firms belonging to industries that tend to make more intensive use of electricity show better performance if such firms are located in areas with higher availability of electricity. We find that electricity provided by the national power grid tends to have a positive impact on manufacturing firm profits. Results are robust to reducing the sample to firms that could not have chosen their location endogenously, as well as to the use of an instrumental variable.

L60|Oligarchic place leadership and resistance to change in industrial districts|The capability of local productive systems to react positively to disruptive challenges, entering new paths of development, depends on the presence of supportive local institutions, organizations and actors. A quite recent literature points out the key support given to path transformation by sets of local actors expressing a place leadership (PL). With a focus on industrial districts (IDs), characterized by a manufacturing specialization and a decentralized business organization based on SMEs, the paper aims at exploring conditions of a PL resisting change. We develop a conceptual frame that enables the identification of three different types of PL: open PL, corporate PL, and oligarchic PL. Specifically, oligarchic PL allows to reflect on models of developments and structural conditions where changes to meet disruptive challenges could be intentionally obstructed. In this regard, the paper provides some considerations and examples on how a model deviating from the canonical ID of local development and expressing an oligarchic PL could drive local productive systems through lock-in conditions.
L60|Agglomeration externalities in Ecuador: do urbanization and tertiarization matter?| The paper investigates whether the tertiarization and rapid urbanization faced by developing countries favour agglomeration economies. Focusing on Ecuadorian cantons, a productivity equation is estimated using the generalized method of moments model with instruments controlling for endogeneity. The varying impact of industrial concentration, diversity, competition and density across industries is investigated and, for the first time, the implication of the level of urbanization on agglomeration externalities is studied. Stronger effects are found for services. The threshold of urbanization at which diversity, density and competition agglomeration externalities all generate positive effects was 33%, while they seem challenged by congestion in highly urbanized cantons.
L60|The Roles of Institutional Frameworks in Enforcing Food Safety in Malaysia|Objective - Food is one of the basic elements of survival. Nevertheless, the advancement of science and technology has made food safety a complex issue. Chemical additives that are harmful to health are constantly added into our food products. Food safety involves the health of the society at large and the productivity of individuals in our country. There needs to be a tightening of laws to ensure that the food safety of our products is always protected. The objective of this paper is to examine the roles of various enforcement agencies - both governmental and non-governmental - and to conduct a comparative study with the Food Standard Agency in the United Kingdom. Methodology/Technique - The governmental agency involved in this study is the Food and Quality Division under the Ministry of Health Malaysia. The paper also examines the role of non-governmental agencies, namely, the Consumer Association of Penang and the National Consumer Complaints Centre, in channeling and documenting complaints from consumers to relevant enforcement agencies. A qualitative methodology is adopted to analyze the relevant documents. Findings - The results of the research identifies that the enforcement of the laws by governmental bodies needs to be improved. On the other hand, non-governmental bodies are found to be effectively executing their duties. Therefore, it is suggested that government agencies should increase transparency in reporting their cases to the consumers, particularly through their website. It is also suggested that they report irresponsible food manufacturers in newspapers and seek to prosecute those manufacturers in courts. Novelty - It is hoped that this paper will act to advise food manufacturers of the governmental and non-governmental regulatory bodies in place. The paper also proposes that the Food Safety and Quality Division work together with non-governmental bodies, namely the Consumer Association of Penang and the National Consumer Complaint Centre, to combat food safety and quality, to increase transparency and enforce the laws on food safety more rigorously.
L60|Is Austria’s Economy Locked-in to the CESEE Region? A Mesoeconomic Analysis|In this paper we do a detailed analysis of Austrian gross export data at the industry level in order to detect potential trade specialisation lock-in effects vis-à-vis the countries from Central, East and Southeast Europe (CESEE). In addition we analyse Austrian global value added export development, Austrian trade in services as well as the link between industry-specific specialisation lock-in effects and foundational competitiveness of Austria. The main findings are the Austrian global gross export market share has declined since 2004 (the year of the EU eastern enlargement) in all industries, except for pharmaceuticals and chemicals; however, Austria managed to increase its global export market share in terms of value added, primarily through an increase in price competitiveness; Austria’s CESEE potential lock-in effects have stagnated since the outbreak of the global financial crisis, with some negative effects only in the medium-high-tech industries (i.e. to a large extent the automotive sector) on Austria’s competitiveness.
L60|How Much Do Trading Partners Matter for Austria’s Competitiveness and Export Performance?|Based on a panel data set for 38 European countries over the period 1995-2014 and by using the definition of ’foundational competitiveness’, which we operationalise as GDP per working-age individual at PPP, this paper analyses how much trading partners matter for the national competitiveness of European countries. Results based on a growth regression framework show that higher growth of trading partners’ competitiveness has a positive impact on the growth of national competitiveness. We find evidence that there are diminishing national returns to increasingly competitive trading partners, but we cannot find strong evidence for a lock-in effect of Austria with the CESEE region. Furthermore, regression results on the determinants of the Austrian bilateral export market shares with European trading partners over 1995-2016 provide evidence that Austria’s export performance is sensitive to changes in its trading partners’ business cycle position, but not more sensitive than that for other selected eurozone countries.
L60|Technological Trajectories and FDI: Top Bananas and Underdogs|Previous empirical evidence searching for externalities from Foreign Direct investment in Portugal showed mixed results. Using a new database containing 5,045 Portuguese manufacturing firms grouped by technological trajectories, we investigate the occurrence and magnitude of externalities from FDI in 1995-2007. We find both positive and negative externalities in scale-intensive and supplier-dominated industries. The magnitude of externalities is higher in the current period than in lagged periods. Because positive externalities outweigh the negative externalities, on the whole a 1% increase in foreign presence (measured by turnover) increases the Total Factor Productivity of domestic firms by 0.42 percentage points. Thus, the Investment Promoting Agency should capture foreign projects in those technological groups.
L60|An EOQ model for multiple products with varying degrees of substitutability|In this paper, the authors present an EOQ model with substitutions between products and a dynamic inventory replenishment policy. The key assumption is that many products in the market are substitutable at different levels, and that, in most cases, a customer who discovers that a desired product is unavailable will choose to consume a product with similar attributes or functionality, rather than not purchase at all. Therefore, given a firm that stocks multiple substitutable products, the authors assume that a stock out of one product has a direct impact on other products' demand. The main purpose of the model is to enable inventory managers to develop ordering policies that ensures that, in the event that a specific product runs out and cannot be replenished due to unforeseen circumstances, the consequent increase in demand for related products will not cause further stock out incidents. To this end, the authors introduce a dependency factor, a variable that indicates the level of dependency, or correlation, between one product and another. The dependencies among the various products offered by the firm are embedded into the EOQ formula and assumptions, enabling managers to update their ordering schedules as needed. This approach has the potential to generate more practical and realistic purchasing and inventory optimization policies.
L60|Labour market power and the distorting effects of international trade|This article examines how trade shocks shape labour market imperfections that create market power in labour markets and prevent an efficient allocation of labour. I develop a framework for measuring such labour market distortions in monetary terms and document large degrees of those distortions in Germany's manufacturing sector. Import competition can only exert labour market disciplining effects when firms rather than workers have labour market power. Otherwise, export demand and import competition shocks tend to fortify existing distortions by amplifying labour market power structures. This diminishes the gains from trade compared to a model with perfectly competitive labour markets.
L60|Skills, entrepreneurship and new business models: Ways to rejuvenate the German industrial model|New business models are at the heart of the global competitive challenge. In several areas of manufacturing and closely related services industries, new market participants, business models and technologies lead to faster change in market conditions and the competitive environment. These developments pose new challenges for the successful German industrial system. Strategic treatment of innovation, a stronger focus on disruptive technologies or business models, organ-izational experimentation such as spin-outs to retain entrepreneurial employees, less intra-cor-porate bureaucracy in such ventures and the interaction with new business partners are key elements to master the evolving challenges. Entrepreneurship, new business models and inno-vation in rapidly changing markets should be fostered by focused approaches of management and general economic policies. This includes measures to facilitate to entrepreneurship educa-tion, an entrepreurial culture and corporate training. [...]
L60|Markups of Exporters and Importers: Evidence from Hungary|In this paper, we study the relationship between different proxies of firm‐level markups and trade status, using balance sheet information linked to detailed trade data from Hungary between 1995 and 2003. We find that importing is strongly positively correlated with markup measures, both across and within firms. We argue that this correlation can reflect three channels: self‐selection, higher physical productivity resulting from access to a larger variety of inputs, and quality upgrading based on high‐quality imported intermediate inputs. We present evidence for the relevance of the third channel by showing that importers’ markup premium is higher when inputs arrive from developed countries, and that importing is correlated with higher‐quality (price‐adjusted revenue) exports. We find no robust evidence for exporter premium when controlling for importing. We argue that the non‐existent exporter premium might result from the stronger competition in export markets relative to domestic markets.
L60|Specialization within global value chains: The role of additive transport costs|This paper studies the factors of comparative advantage within global value chains relying on a framework where comparative advantage is measured through the interaction of country and industry characteristics. We find that good institutions give a comparative advantage in the later stages of the production process, whereas good transport infrastructure gives an advantage in the early stages of production. We explain these results with a simple theoretical framework that shows how predicted patterns of specializations depend on whether trade costs are additive or multiplicative.
L60|"The ""China shock"" revisited: Insights from value added trade flows"|We exploit a decomposition of gross trade flows into their value added components to reassess the relationship between increased imports from China and manufacturing jobs in US local labour markets following the seminal paper of Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013, ADH). Decomposed trade flows enable us to address identification and measurement issues inherent to gross trade data. In particular, it allows us to remove US value added in Chinese exports from the exposure measure which is mechanically correlated with the dependent variable and overstates the volume of the trade shock. In addition, the decomposition permits to correct for double counting, to remove primary and services inputs in manufacturing exports, and to assign competition to the upstream industry that supplied the value added rather than the final exporting industry. This further reduces the volume of the shock and improves the accuracy of the import exposure measure. Consequently, we find considerable differences in the pattern of regions that are most affected by the trade shock and show that imports from China can explain less of the decline in US manufacturing than what gross trade data would suggest. We then separate the shock into a China-driven domestic reform and a thirdcountry-driven value chain component, and find in line with ADH that the smaller, but still negative labour market effects are indeed China driven. Finally, we observe that the negative effects identified in ADH are not present in the 2008-2014 period, as labour market adjustment has largely concluded. The long time needed for adjustment may have been prolonged by the evolution of China's comparative advantage.
L60|Enabling Factors in Firms Adoption of New Digital Technologies. An Empirical Inquiry on a Manufacturing Region|This paper provides an analysis on the diffusion of the last generation digital technologies (Industry 4.0) in the Veneto region, one of the main manufacturing territory in Italy. Our attention focuses on factors that enable firms to adopt these technologies, with attention to three main aspects: the human capital endowment, the international openness, and the financial structure. Empirical analysis is based on a sample of firms that operate in manufacturing, construction and business services. Our analysis shows a heterogeneous diffusion of Industry 4.0 technologies across different industries, allowing the identification of distinct technologies frontiers among sectors. The logit regression shows a positive relation between the adoption of digital technologies and the openness to international markets, as well as with a highly skilled and highly educated human capital. The digital users show better productivity indexes than other firms, but at the same time financial performances are less clear. Hence, the firms that adopt new digital technologies have a more balanced financial structure, but they do not show higher profitability ratios than non-users. This result depends on a longer run return on investment and in a different distributive policy inside the firm.
L60|Entrepreneurship and industrial clusters: evidence from China industrial census|Abstract This article studies the synergy effect of entrepreneurship on China’s industrial cluster. We propose an extension to Duranton and Overman’s (The Review of Economic Studies, 72(4), 1077–1106. https://doi.org/10.1111/0034-6527.00362 , 2005) method which enables us to delimit industrial cluster in space. A cross-sectional model is identified with historical measures of local entrepreneur potential in the spirit of Chinitz (The American Economic Review, 51(2), 279–289, 1961). Alternatively, we use lagged cluster and entrepreneurship variables to mitigate the endogeneity problem. We find that measures of entrepreneurship contribute significantly to the cluster formation, the cluster size, and the cluster strength. The causality remains strong even when we control for lagged cluster variables. Out of the factors proposed by the NEG theory, access to sea ports, light industry, localization economies, urban population density, and market potential are generally found to benefit cluster. Most of the results are robust to alternative measures of entrepreneurship and instrumental variable.
L60|Drivers of energy efficiency in German manufacturing: A firm-level stochastic frontier analysis|Increasing energy efficiency is one of the main goals in current German energy and climate policies. We study the determinants of energy efficiency in the German manufacturing sector based on official firm-level production census data. By means of a stochastic frontier analysis, we estimate the cost-minimizing energy demand function at the two-digit industry level using firm-level heterogeneity. Apart from the identification of the determinants of the energy demand function, we also analyze potential drivers of energy efficiency. Our results suggest that there is still potential to increase energy efficiency in most industries of the German manufacturing sector. Furthermore, we find that in most industries exporting and innovating firms as well as those investing in environmental protection measures are more energy efficient than their counterparts. In contrast, firms which are regulated by the European Union Emissions Trading System are mostly less energy efficient than non-regulated firms.
L60|Trade and Manufacturing Jobs in Germany|The German economy exhibits rising service and declining manufacturing employment, but this decline is much sharper in import-competing than export-oriented branches. We first document the individual-level job transitions behind those trends. They are not driven by manufacturing workers who smoothly switch to services. The observed shifts are entirely due to young entrants and returnees from non-employment. We then investigate if rising trade with China and Eastern Europe causally affected those labor flows. Exploiting variation across industries and regions, we find that globalization did not speed up the manufacturing decline in Germany. It even retained those jobs in the economy.
L60|What drives spatial clusters of entrepreneurship in China? Evidence from economic census data|Since Chinese government initiated economic reform in the late 1970s, entrepreneurship and private sectors have emerged gradually and played an increasingly important role in promoting economic growth. However, entrepreneurship is distributed unevenly in China. Using micro data from 2008 economic census and 2005 population census, this paper explains spatial clusters of entrepreneurship for both manufacturing and services. For both sectors, entrepreneurship (measured by new private firms) tends to emerge in places with more relevant upstream and downstream firms. Moreover, Chinitz's (1961) theories are also supported for manufacturing: small upstream and downstream firms seem to be more important for manufacturing entrepreneurship. For both sectors, entrepreneurship is positively related to city size, the share of young adults and the elderly population, and foreign direct investment. More migrants are also found to promote service entrepreneurship. Our paper is the first to consider both manufacturing and service entrepreneurship in China and should be of interest to both local and national policymakers who plan to encourage entrepreneurship.
L60|Networks and Firm Performance: A Case Study of Vietnamese Small and Medium Enterprises|Small and medium enterprises play an important role in developing and transition economies. Recently, more attention has been paid to the role of networks in improving firm performance. By using data from the DANIDA project on SME survey with more than 2,500 manufacturing firms in Vietnam, we examine the relationship between networks and firm performance, particularly focusing on small and medium businesses. Network data covers four dimensions of networking including withinsector‐ network, across‐sector‐network, informal and formal creditors, and politicians and civil servants. Multivariate panel regressions have been applied. The results suggest that firm performance is positively related to the existence and the size of networks with individuals in a different sector and networks connecting to politicians and civil servants.
L60|Do electricity prices matter? Plant-level evidence from German manufacturing|In many countries, the transition process towards a low-carbon economy has been associated with increasing electricity prices. Microeconometric evaluations of the causal impact of electricity price changes on plant-level outcomes are rare, though. By exploiting local randomization induced by thresholds in exemption rules, we estimate the local average treatment effects of electricity levy exemptions using a fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) design. The results indicate that exempted German manufacturing plants increase electricity use substantially and substitute it for fossil fuels, while we do not find evidence for short-run effects on gross output, exports and employment.

L60|The Impact of Employing Mismatched Workers on Firm Productivity, Wages and Profits|Educational mismatch in the form of over- and under-educated workers has long been studied in relation to labor market outcomes for individual workers. While its consequences for individual workers and society are dire, we have only anecdotal evidence of its consequences for firms' competitiveness. To bridge this gap, this paper studies the impact of mismatch on firm productivity, wages and profit. The results suggest an asymmetric effect from employing over- and under-educated workers. We find that while employing over-educated workers add to wage cost, there are no matching productivity gains, By contrast, the performance of under-educated workers more than compensates for their wage costs, leading to increased profits at the firm level. The net effect, therefore, in the form of gross operating surplus is significantly negative (positive) when firms employ over- (under-)educated workers. The results suggest that the positive effects primarily stem from under-educated young workers, whereas the losses can be traced to over-educated older workers.
L60|Temperature effects on productivity and factor reallocation: Evidence from a half million chinese manufacturing plants|This paper uses detailed production data from a half million Chinese manufacturing plants over 1998–2007 to estimate the effects of temperature on firm-level total factor productivity (TFP), factor inputs, and output. We detect an inverted U-shaped relationship between temperature and TFP and show that it primarily drives the temperature-output effect. Both labor- and capital- intensive firms exhibit sensitivity to high temperatures. By mid 21st century, if no additional adaptation were to occur, we project that climate change will reduce Chinese manufacturing output annually by 12%, equivalent to a loss of $39.5 billion in 2007 dollars. This implies substantial local and global economic consequences as the Chinese manufacturing sector produces 32% of national GDP and supplies 12% of global exports.
L60|Human capital externalities in Indonesian cities|Using Indonesian plant-level manufacturing data for 1996 and 2006, this study estimates the external benefits of human capital investment. The external benefits are identified from the relationship between plant-level wages and city-level human capital stock, after controlling for workers’ skill levels, plant fixed effects, and time-varying industry fixed effects. Our results suggest that the degree of human capital externalities depends on the size of the urban population, and that such externalities do not occur in cities that either too large or too small. In the case of the Indonesian manufacturing industry, evidence of human capital externalities is observed in cities with a population of between 500 thousand and 1,500 thousand.
L60|To The Threshold And Beyond: Size, Productivity And (Scale) Barriers To Export|DMaking use of a firm-level dataset for the universe of Italian exporting firms collected by ISTAT, we identify the minimum combinations of size and productivity that Italian manufacturing firms need to achieve (in their own industry) in order to access international markets. These “export thresholds” are estimated by applying for the first time in economics the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) methodology, so far widely used in other disciplines (e.g. medicine, machine learning, natural sciences). The results of the analysis allow us to provide, for each industry: (1) a mapping of the upper and lower-side of the distribution of firms with respect to the export threshold, stressing the size-productivity combination choices of exporting and non-exporting units; (2) the relative weight of productivity and size in determining the export threshold in a given industry; 3) the best lever of policy to be used in order to increase firms’ intensive margin (the share of exported turnover) as well as the extensive margin for the Italian economy (the share of exporting firms). The methodology proposed in this paper can also open the field to further important developments. In particular, our empirical model could be augmented to point out other determinants of the thresholds than size and productivity, especially those related to the industry structure or regulation. Such “exogenous” dimensions of the export thresholds would help better detect effective policy interventions to reduce barriers to trade
L60|The interconnections between services and goods trade at the firm-level|In this paper we study how international trade in goods and services interact at the firm level. Using a rich dataset on Belgian firms for the period 1995–2005, we show that: i) firms are much more likely to source services and goods inputs from the same origin country rather than from different ones; ii) joint imports are associated with higher firm productivity; iii) increases in barriers to imports of goods reduce firm-level imports of services from the same market, and conversely. We build upon a discrete-choice model of goods and services input sourcing that can reproduce these facts to guide our econometric strategy. We use our results to quantify the impact of reductions in goods and services barriers between the US and the EU. Our findings have important implications for the design of trade policy. They suggest that a liberalization of services trade can have direct and sizable effects on goods trade, and vice versa. Moreover, liberalizing goods and services trade jointly brings substantial complementarities.
L60|Advanced Manufacturing: A New Policy Challenge|In 2016 the political system experienced significant disruption in part due to a working class voting block suffering from a long decline in American manufacturing, which became particularly acute in the decade of the 2000s. Manufacturing employment fell by one-third in this period, 64,000 factories closed, manufacturing capital investment and output suffered, and the productivity rate dropped. The U.S. had been systematically shifting production abroad, and experts began to realize as the next decade began that the decline in its production capability was starting to affect its innovation capacity — which had long been viewed as its core economic strength.
L60|Logistics Services, Technics and Software in Bulgaria from the Perspective of the Manufacturing and Trading Enterprises and Their Competitive Strategy|Logistics outsourcing is an increasingly common practice among manufacturing and trading enterprises. Being customers of the logistics sector, their perceptions of the supplied logistics technics, software services in Bulgaria, as well as the used logistics services by them, are important for the development of the logistics sector and logistics in our country. On the basis of empirical data this study evaluates the availability, quality and price of the supplied logistics services, technics and software from the point of view of the manufacturing and trading enterprises, the extent of usage of the different logistics services, as well as the existing differences between enterprises concerning their type, size and strategy. The competitive advantages that are achieved through the usage of some services are outlined too. The methods of descriptive statistics and statistical hypothesis testing are applied for data analysis. The existence of differences between the studied enterprises concerning their type and strategy is determined through t-test. The impact of the enterprisesï¿½ size on the used services is estimated trough the nonï¿½parametric equivalent of one-way analysis of variance - the Kruskalï¿½Wallis test, and the relationships between the different dimensions of competitiveness and the used logistics serï¿½vices ï¿½ through Spearmanï¿½s rank correlation coefficients. The study finds out that it is necessary to improve the ratio between quality and price of most services and the capabilities of logistics companies in relation to providing value-added services, management of distribution/procurement for their customers and total logistics packages. Evidences are brought fourth that enterprises using a variety of logistics services, besides the traditional transportation and ware housing, achieve a higher level of competitiveness concerning its different dimensions, especially those ones that have mainly a differentiating character.
L60|Austria’s digital transition: The diffusion challenge|Austria’s transition to a digital economy and society is slower than in other high-income small open European economies. The rate and pace of utilisation of eight main ICT applications shows that Austrian firms follow peer country counterparts with a gap, which has widened in most areas in recent years. Two dynamics drive digital transitions and Austria has room for progress in both of them. First, the potential for digitalisation in all firms, and especially in the smaller ones (where gaps are largest) should be freed-up by upgrading the full range of ICT-generic, ICT-specific and ICT-complementary skills. Second, Austria needs to make its business environment more conducive to firm entry and exit. The rate of entry of new firms and their growth are crucial for the diffusion of new business models and ICT innovations but fall behind peer countries. The adoption of ICT innovations by households also follows a staggered path: young and highly educated Austrians adopt ICT applications in similar ways to their counterparts in peer countries, while middle and older age cohorts display noticeable gaps. This calls for policies to help lagging groups become more acquainted with innovations. A whole-of-government approach, including large-scale utilisation of e-government applications in enterprises and households, should help to embrace change and facilitate the flourishing of innovative businesses, work practices and lifestyles throughout Austria. This Working Paper relates to the 2017 OECD Economic Survey of Austria (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-austria.htm)
L60|Labour Market Polarization in Advanced Countries: Impact of Global Value Chains, Technology, Import Competition from China and Labour Market Institutions|This paper explores the effects of offshoring, technology and Chinese import competition on labor market polarization in European countries. We find that polarization occurs mostly as a result of polarization within individual industries, while the reallocation of employment away from less polarized industries towards more highly polarized industries also contributed to a lesser extent. In manufacturing, within-industry polarization is mostly associated with technological change, but we also find some tentative evidence that Chinese import competition contributed as well. In other private industries outside of manufacturing, technological change and offshoring are the most relevant forces affecting within-industry polarization. The process of between-industry polarization is driven by widespread deindustrialization in developed countries. We find that Chinese import competition contributed to the decline of employment in the less polarized manufacturing industries. Differences in labor market institutions only explain a limited amount of cross-country variation in the association of polarization and the three forces we consider.
L60|Anatomy of Austria’s trade in services|This study analyzes Austrian exports of business services as an indicator of non-price competitiveness in manufacturing before and after world trade collapsed in 2008/09. A unique company dataset was used for this purpose and broken down into individual product/market combinations. The trend analysis differentiates between export growth along the intensive margin (intensifying existing export relations) and along the extensive margin (establishing new export relations). The extensive margin, which signifies export diversification, is more important for the development of manufacturers’ service exports than that of the service sector. This applies in particular to manufacturers that are more technology intensive and it implies that Austrian manufacturers develop know-how to establish new foreign trade relations. After the global trade meltdown, however, manufacturers’ service exports seemed to have primarily helped maintain long-term trade relations, with the extensive margin losing significance. This indicates a worsening of the framework conditions (heightened protectionism) and weak development of foreign trade in goods having a negative impact on service exports.
L60|On Quality and Variety Bias in Aggregate Prices|How do product variety and quality affect the aggregate price bias? We develop a general equilibrium model that accounts for the joint interaction of product quality and variety. Our findings show that the aggregate price bias is procyclical and the contribution of product variety is persistent whereas the contribution of product quality becomes countercyclical in the medium to long run. We show that accounting for product quality and variety has critical implications on the measure of cyclical fluctuations. Measurements of cyclical fluctuations derived using the consumption deflator, which abstracts from changes in product quality and variety, underestimate the variables' true volatility.
L60|Determinants of Net Exports in Polish and Czech Manufacturing: A Sectoral Approach with Error Correction Model|Growth model in CEE countries has based on a massive inflow of direct foreign investments, especially in manufacturing, from the onset of the transformation. This resulted in a substantial share of manufacturing goods in total exports and a high ranking position of some CEE countries among the most industrialized economies in the world. The main objective of this paper is to compare the determinants of the international competitiveness, measured by the net exports of the manufacturing sectors in the Czech and Polish economies, by using the database of 13 manufacturing sub-sectors in 1995-2011. The authors research the question of how much foreign and domestic demand, the level of labour costs, the level of sector innovation intensity, the level of sector openness to foreign markets as well as sectoral labour productivity influence the changes in trade balance. Our approach is based on employing an error correction model and SURE model to disaggregated sectoral manufacturing data. The results of the analysis conducted show substantial differences in the roles particular variables play in explaining the net exports in individual sectors. For the majority of Polish and Czech manufacturing sub-sectors, generation of positive trade balance is determined by relative demand growth. An increasing labour productivity influences heavily a positive trade balance of Polish goods in majority of sub-sectors, however, a key factor in Czech sub-sectors is decreasing unit labour costs. The results of the analysis indicate mostly a greater impact of the researched factors on net exports in long rather than short term and the better capacity of the Czech economy to correct deviations from the equilibrium.
L60|Relative Prices and Hysteresis: Evidence from US Manufacturing|A central tenet of economics is that prices matter. A corollary is that in a world with sunk costs, historical prices can affect current economic outcomes. There exists a large theoretical literature on exchange rate hysteresis, but recent empirical treatments are scarce. To fill the gap, I employ new measures of real exchange rates (RERs) to study the impact of large, temporary RER shocks on the US manufacturing sector. To identify a causal impact of RER movements on manufacturing, I test whether sectors more exposed to international trade respond differently when relative prices appreciate. I also compare the US experience to Canada’s in the mid-2000s, when high oil prices and a falling US dollar led to an equally sharp appreciation of the Canadian dollar. I find that temporary RER shocks have a surprisingly persistent impact on employment, output, and productivity in relatively more open manufacturing sectors, and that the magnitude of the shock in the early 2000s was large enough to have played a role in the onset of secular stagnation, lending support to the Bernanke Hypothesis.
L60|In with the Big, Out with the Small: Removing Small-Scale Reservations in India|An ongoing debate in employment policy is whether promoting small and medium enterprises creates jobs. We use the elimination of small-scale industry (SSI) promotion in India to address this question. For 60 years, SSI promotion in India focused on reserving certain products for manufacture by small and medium enterprises. We identify the consequences for employment growth, investment, output, productivity, and wages of dismantling India's SSI reservations. We exploit variation in the timing of de-reservation across products and also measure the long-run impact of national SSI policy changes using variation in pretreatment exposure at the district level. Districts more exposed to de-reservation experienced higher employment and output growth. Entrants into the de-reserved product spaces and incumbents that were previously constrained by the size restrictions drove the increase in growth. The results suggest that dismantling India's SSI policies encouraged overall employment growth.
L60|Resale Price Maintenance with Secret Contracts and Retail Service Externalities|We analyze a setting where a monopolist sells through retailers that set prices and provide valuable but non-contractible services to customers. We assume that contracts are private. We find that purely bilateral price restraints have no effect on the equilibrium outcome and that the standard Bertrand prices and service levels prevail. We also show that if manufacturers can commit to industry-wide resale prices, they can obtain higher prices and service levels but will generally not be able to achieve the fully integrated outcome. Using a specific linear demand system, we find that industry-wide price floors are harmful to consumers.
L60|How important are SOEs and MNEs in Vietnam’s economy?| This paper examines patterns and changes of shares of the state sector, including stateowned enterprises (SOEs) and other state entities, and foreign multinational enterprises (MNEs) in Vietnam since the mid-1990s. Because most Vietnamese are still self-employed or household workers with little or no connection to the state sector or MNEs, it is important to exclude the household sector from these comparisons. First, ownership shares vary markedly among economic activities. For example, economy-wide estimates indicate that MNEs and state sector have both been relatively small employers, but larger producers. MNEs have also become by far the largest exporters. Second, ownership shares and their trends vary substantially depending on the data source. Most conspicuously, SOE shares of nonhousehold enterprise employment and sales have decreased rapidly since 2000. On the other hand, economy-wide estimates of state shares in non-household employment and GDP declined much more slowly. Recent discrepancies between these estimates have become so large that they almost certainly result from errors in one or more data sources. There are also smaller discrepancies between corresponding, alternative estimates of MNE shares. The extent of privatization of SOEs and its economic effects are thus ambiguous in Vietnam, creating important concerns for academics and policy makers.
L60|Foreign Workers, Foreign Multinationals, and Wages after Controlling for Occupation and Sex in Malaysia’s Manufacturing Plants during the mid-1990s| This paper investigates the effects of foreign worker shares and MNE ownership on wages after controlling for worker sex and occupation in Malaysian manufacturing plants during 1994-1996, an important period during which use of foreign workers began to increase substantially. In a previous paper, I estimated similar wage equations separately for five occupation groups of both sexes in large heterogeneous samples of plants in many industries and more homogeneous samples of plants in seven industries. Results indicated that use of foreign workers generally had insignificant effects on plant wages for most occupation-sex-(and industry) combinations and that that MNE-local differentials were almost always insignificant in three industries and consistently significant in only one. Although separate estimation by sex and occupation has the strong advantage of accounting for worker characteristics relatively well, it has the disadvantages of complexity (10 results per sample) and being difficult to compare to more common approaches, which use sex and occupation as controls. The primary purpose of this paper is thus to see if using sex and occupation as independent variables generates results that differ from estimating wage equations separately for each sex-occupation cohort. Results suggest that the effects of foreign worker shares differ substantially among foreign worker occupations and among industries. Plants that have relatively large foreign manager shares tend to pay relatively high wages in most industries, but the effects of other foreign worker occupations are usually insignificant or inconsistent. Results that assume all foreign workers impart the same effects thus appear misleading, as do results assuming identical slope coefficients among industries. Similar to previous estimates, MNE-local wage differentials were consistently positive and significant in only two relatively small industries, chemicals and food, in marked contrast to previous results for 2000-2004, which did not account for the effects of foreign worker shares.
L60|United States Manufacturing Direct Investment and Trade: The Case of Canada and Mexico under NAFTA and Earlier Trade Liberalization Measures|This paper examines the apparent impact of the formation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and earlier relevant trade liberalization measures on U.S. manufacturing direct investment and trade vis-¨¤-vis Canada and Mexico. Employing a maximum likelihood regression approach that focuses on the relationship between U.S. manufacturing direct investment in Canada and Mexico and its manufacturing trade with each of these countries, as well as the real GDP of each country, serving as a ¡°gravity model¡± proxy variable, empirical results are presented for the period 1989-2013. The results suggest that the process of regional economic integration in North America, with its concomitant relaxation of trade barriers, has served to modify what one would otherwise expect on the basis of the conceptual frameworks and scenarios that have thus far been developed in the literature with regard to the relationship of foreign direct investment to international trade. With regard to the expected relevance of gravity-type influences on U.S. direct manufacturing investment in its two NAFTA partners, for Canada these influences appear to be confirmed, but not so for Mexico, owing to the close interconnection between U.S. manufacturing direct investment in Mexico and its Mexican manufacturing trade.
L60|Cyber attacks: preliminary evidence from the Bank of Italy's business surveys|This paper presents preliminary evidence on cyber risk in the Italian private sector based on the Bank of Italy’s annual surveys of Italian industrial and service firms. The information collected, albeit only covering the incidence of cyber attacks and some aspects of security governance, is the first of its kind for Italy. The results are striking: even though a mere 1.5 per cent of businesses do not deploy any cybersecurity measures, 30.3 per cent – corresponding to 35.6 per cent of total employees – report at least some damage from a cyber attack between September 2015 and September 2016. Once data are corrected to account for unwillingness to report or inability to detect attacks on the part of some respondents, these figures climb to 45.2 and 56 per cent respectively, with large, high-tech and internationally exposed businesses faring worse than average. The economy-wide risk level is likely to be higher still; the financial sector, healthcare, education and social care are excluded from the sample, but they are known from other sources to be particularly appealing to attackers. Further research is needed on the correlation between firm-level vulnerability and investment in cyber defence, and on the cost of cyber breaches.
L60|The price of cyber (in)security: evidence from the Italian private sector|This paper presents evidence on the economic dimension of cyber risk in the Italian private non-financial sector, based on Bank of Italy survey data. In 2016, the median amount spent on preventing cyber attacks was a modest €4,530, i.e. 15 per cent of a typical worker’s annual gross wages. A wide variation exists across sectors and size classes, reflecting differences in how appealing a target a firm is to attackers and firms’ awareness of threats: median values range from €3,120 for small firms to €19,080 in the ICT sector and €44,590 for large firms. The market for cyber defence in our reference universe is worth at least €570 million. Having been attacked in the past proves to be a strong incentive to invest in security. The majority of breached firms suffered damages worth less than €10,000; 0.1 per cent reported costs of at least €200,000. Neither the sampling design nor the questionnaire were geared towards the measurement of tail events: underestimation of large incidents is likely. More information is needed before the economy-wide cost can be estimated.
L60|Competition for Global Value Added: Export and Domestic Market Shares|We propose a new “global” market share indicator that complements the traditional export market share analysis by accounting for the foreign value added embodied in the production process and for the performance of national firms on their domestic market. We also consider all the income from activities used in the production to address the manufacturing final demand, namely all activities within the manufacturing value chain. Our results show that the role of services is growing in global value chains. Interestingly, considering our global indicator makes the dynamics of market shares converge among large economies, which can be explained by a de-correlation between national and export performances. This de-correlation appears to reflect greater specialization within global manufacturing value chains.
L60|Building a firm level dataset for the analysis of industrial dynamics and demography|"This paper illustrates the building procedure of a firm-level panel dataset that merges several sources of information concerning the various activities of business firms. The aim of this work is to achieve a detailed dataset able to shed light on firm demographics, in terms of survival, entry and exit processes, distinguishing between “voluntary"" and “involuntary"" exits. Moreover, the derived dataset allows to monitor the innovation activities of the firms and also to capture complementarities between two instruments of intellectual property rights (IPRs), namely granted patents and registered trademarks. We assess the validity of the proposed procedures resorting to the virtual universe of Italian limited liability companies as provided by Bureau van Dijk (BvD). The dataset covers more than 1 million companies operating in both manufacturing and service sectors and contain financial and economic information, as well as, among the others, the ownership structure and administrative procedures undergone by the firms, which may lead to firm exit. The main purpose of the paper is to provide a unified set of procedures to help the researcher dealing with the vast amount of information available on corporate firms and of ever increasing size. This will also facilitate the replication of empirical analyses, across researchers working on dataset with similar characteristics, although from different countries or data providers."
L60|The Market Value of R&D in Emerging Economies: Evidence from India|We revisit the relationship between market value and innovation in the context of manufacturing firms in a developing country, using data for Indian firms from 2001 through 2010. Surprisingly, we find that financial markets value the R&D investment of Indian firms the same or higher than it values such investment in developed economies such as the United States and European countries, suggesting some degree of underinvestment. The paper explores the use of a proxy for the option value of R&D and finds that this can account for a very small part of the R&D valuation (about 10 %). We also find that the market value–R&D relationship does not vary significantly across industry groups, although these results are rather imprecise.
L60|Does Foreign Trade Facilitation Improve Firms’ Export Performance? A Microeconomic Analysis of Chilean Manufacturing Plants|This paper constructs sector-level measures of trade facilitation in foreign countries to examine the effect of reducing the costs required to import abroad on export activity of Chilean plants. The results show that decreases in the number of documents required to import and in the number of days required to import in international markets significantly increase the probability of exporting of Chilean plants, while a decrease in the number of documents required to import increases plants’ export intensity. The estimates also show that the effect of improved foreign trade facilitation is larger in sectors with relatively low foreign tariffs.
L60|Input-Output Analysis of Deindustrialization and Outsourcing|The paper deals with the topic of deindustrialization as a process of a decreasing relative importance of manufacturing. While the decrease of manufacturing in major developed and developed economies is undeniable, the developing and newly industrialized economies are starting to experience this phenomenon as well. The results of the paper show that the so-called premature deindustrialization is mainly caused by outsourcing. Furthermore, the data suggest the existence of an upper limit of outsourcing for major developed economies. In these economies, the decrease of manufacturing is more likely caused by other relevant factors. Last but not least, a few transition economies face to a slightly decreasing value of outsourcing on a much lower level. This could be explained by a fragmentation of the entire value chain across the European Union. The empirical results are based on the Input-Output methodology, the observation period of fifteen years from 2000 to 2014 and a sample of 43 countries.
L60|Import competition from and offshoring to low-income countries: Implications for employment and wages at U.S. domestic manufacturers|Using confidential linked firm-level trade transactions and census data between 1997 and 2012, we provide new evidence on how American firms without foreign affiliates adjust employment and wages as they adapt to import competition from low-income countries. We provide stylized facts on the input sourcing strategies of these domestic firms, contrasting them with multinationals operating in the same industry. We then investigate how changes in firm input purchases from low-income countries as well as domestic market import penetration from these sources are correlated with changes in employment and wages at surviving domestic firms. Greater offshoring by domestic firms from low-income countries correlates with larger declines in manufacturing employment and in the average production workers’ wage. Given the negative association, however, the estimated magnitudes are small, even for a narrow measure of offshoring that includes only intermediate goods. Import penetration of U.S. markets from these sources is associated with relatively larger changes in employment for arm’s length importing firms, but has no significant correlation with employment changes at firms that do not trade. Given differences in the degree of both offshoring and import penetration, we find substantial variation across industries in the magnitude of changes associated with low-income country imports.
L60|Upstream, Downstream: Diffusion and Impacts of the Universal Product Code|We match archival data from the Uniform Code Council to establishments in the Longitudinal Business Database and Economic Census to study the diffusion and impacts of the Universal Product Code (UPC). We find evidence of network effects in the diffusion process. Matched-sample difference-in-difference estimates show that firm size and trademark registrations increase following UPC adoption by manufacturers. Industry-level import penetration also increases with domestic UPC adoption. Our findings suggest that barcodes, scanning, and related technologies helped stimulate variety-enhancing product innovation and encourage the growth of international retail supply chains.
L60|Firm Efficiency, Foreign Ownership and CEO Gender in Corrupt Environments|We study the effects of corruption on firm efficiency using a unique dataset of private firms from 14 Central and Eastern European countries from 2000 to 2013. We find that an environment characterized by a high level of corruption has an adverse effect on firm efficiency. This effect is stronger for firms with a lower propensity to behave corruptly, such as foreign-controlled firms and firms managed by female CEOs, while local firms and firms with male CEOs are not disadvantaged. We also find that an environment characterized by considerable heterogeneity in the perception of corruption is associated with an increase in firm efficiency. This effect is particularly strong for foreign-controlled firms from low corruption countries, while no effect is observed for firms managed by a female CEO.
L60|To bribe or not to bribe? Corruption uncertainty and corporate practices|Using a large sample of private firms over the period from 2001 to 2013, we study the effect of corruption uncertainty on corporate investments and cash holdings. We find that a higher uncertainty about the level of corruption is associated with lower corporate investments and lower cash holdings. These results are sensitive to the ownership structure of a firm. Firms with no foreign majority ownership appear to be more sensitive to corruption-induced uncertainty than majority-controlled foreign firms. They significantly decrease their investments and cash holdings. We hypothesize that they move their cash off-balance-sheet to create cash reserves as the uncertainty of when, whom, and how much to bribe increases.
L60|Modi's 'Make in India' Industrial Reform Policy and East Asian Flying-Geese Paradigm|The on-going ‘Make in India’ campaign aims at manufacturing revival. Its characteristics resemble East Asian industrial reform and growth policies based on the flying-geese model which highlights ‘step-by-step’ changes in a country’s specialisation pattern and global competitiveness accompanied by economic growth. Unlikely, ‘Make in India’ comprises heterogeneous measures ‘simultaneously’ supporting industries in different development stages from labour and capital-intensive to high-tech industries and modern services. Moreover issues like world-market uncertainty discouraging export activities; poverty-reduction-oriented labour-industry promotion vs overall productivity increase; and complementary role of IT services for industrial modernisation and growth, will shape the success of India’s diversified industrial policy.
L60|Growing Productivity without Growing Wages: The Micro-Level Anatomy of the Aggregate Labor Share Decline|"The aggregate labor share in U.S. manufacturing declined dramatically over the last three decades: Since the mid-1980’s, the compensation for labor declined from 63% to 42% of value added which is unseen in any other sector of the U.S. economy. The labor share of the typical U.S. manufacturing plants, in contrast, rose by 5%. We document that reallocation of production towards ""hyper-productive plants"" contributes two thirds of the decline while the remaining one third are caused by exit of high-labor share plants. Plants that account for the majority of production by the late 2000's arrive at a low labor share by gradually increasing value added by a factor of three while keeping employment and compensation unchanged. Other than this output response, these low-labor share plants look very similar to their peers along almost all other characteristics such as equipment investment, exposure to trade or whether they are located in right-to-work states. Labor share decline explanations that focus on the role of equipment-embodied technical change, unions or international trade only therefore seem limited. Based on novel empirical evidence, we consider alternative explanations."
L60|Deutsche Industrie: Zunehmende Investitionsneigung|Nach den aktuellen Ergebnissen des ifo Investitionstests wollen die Unternehmen des deutschen Verarbeitenden Gewerbes im Jahr 2017 ihre Investitionen um rund 5% erhöhen. Für das Jahr 2016 ergaben die Meldungen der Befragungsteilnehmer einen Anstieg von 3%. Erweiterungsinvestitionen und Investitionen in Ersatzbeschaffungen halten sich 2017 mit je einem Drittel als Motive der Investitionstätigkeit in etwa die Waage.
L60|Innovation And Productivity In Family Firms: Evidence From A Sample Of European Firms|This paper estimates the impact of R&D investments on the productivity of European family firms. For the period 2007-2009, we consider a Cobb-Douglas production function augmented by R&D intensity. Specifically, we address the questions of whether the R&D returns of family firms differ from that of non-family firms. Final outcomes suggest that, on average, non-family firms conducting R&D record a productivity gain of about 5-8 % compared to non-innovative firms. Additionally, the innovative family firms are about 6% lower compared to innovative non-family firms. Finally, the rate of return to R&D of family firms is lower than non-family firms.
L60|Análisis del comercio internacional colombiano y diversificación de exportaciones (2002-2015): Canadá, Estados Unidos y Unión Europea|En este documento se realiza una descripción de los indicadores relacionados con el comercio exterior colombiano durante el período 2002-2015. Particularmente, se presenta el perfil comercial, indicadores de concentración y/o diversificación del comercio (por sectores, rama de actividad, producto y socios comerciales) e indicadores de sofisticación de exportaciones. Así mismo, se desarrolla una sección orientada al potencial exportador con mercados específicos (Canadá, Estados Unidos y la Unión Europea). A nivel de sectores, los resultados muestran el predominio de las exportaciones mineras, las cuales alcanzaron en el año 2015 el 48,4%, mientras las exportaciones del sector agropecuario e industrial representaron en promedio el 56,6% durante el período de análisis. En cuando al grado de concentración y/o diversificación por ramas de actividad, para el año 2015 se concluye que la canasta exportadora se puede considerar moderadamente diversificada, en tanto que las importaciones se consideran diversificadas. En lo relacionado con el potencial exportador, se identifica alta complementariedad comercial en las ramas relacionadas con productos de molinería, vidrio, producción agrícola y pecuaria con los mercados de Canadá y la Unión Europea. Mientras en el comercio con Estados Unidos, se encuentra alta complementariedad comercial únicamente en ramas relacionadas con la actividad minera.

L60|La industria colombiana 1975-2014: inequidad entre trabajo y capital|Como parte de una investigación sobre transnacionalización del gran capital colombiano, se analiza la distribución funcional de la riqueza creada en la industria durante casi 40 años. Se destacan los cambios en la composición de su producción bruta, así como la concentración de la producción y la centralización del capital, fenómenos liderados por grupos financieros que datan del siglo pasado. También se indaga sobre la evolución de la productividad laboral y del empleo, y los eventuales efectos de los cambios tecnológicos en este sector. Se concluye que en la distribución del valor agregado industrial gana peso relativo el capital, con detrimento de la parte que corresponde al trabajo.
L60|Energy Consumption and Regional Economic Growth: The Case of Iranian Manufacturing Sector|The relationship between energy consumption and economic growth has undergone extensive investigation and the empirical evidences are mixed ranging from bi- and uni-directional causality to no causality. These conflicts may be due to the fact that countries have different energy consumption patterns and various sources of energy. This paper is the first study on causal relationships between industrial energy consumption and real regional economic growth based on the panel data for 31 provinces in Iran over the period 2004–2014. We employ the GMM-SYS approach for the estimation of the panel vector autoregression (PVAR) model. Afterwards, by doing an in-depth analysis of energy consumption data, the purpose of this paper is to contribute to the debate by examining the causality in various forms of energy consumption (Diesel fuel, Natural Gas, Gasoline, Kerosene, LPG&LNG, Petroleum and Electricity). We discover: (a) totally, there is bidirectional causality between industrial energy consumption and regional growth; (b) regional growth leads to Gasoline consumption; (c) Natural gas consumption leads to regional growth; (d) there exists no causal relationship between regional growth and Diesel fuel, Kerosene, LPG&LNG and Petroleum consumption; (e) there is also bidirectional causality between industrial electricity consumption and regional economic growth. Taken together, the results of this study involve valuable information for policy makers at regional level.
L60|Analysis of the “Dutch Disease” effect: The case of resource-rich ASEAN economies|This paper examines the applicability of the Dutch Disease hypothesis by using a vector auto-regression model, focusing on the five resource-rich and middle-income economies in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN): Malaysia and Indonesia as the forerunners, and Lao PDR, Myanmar and Vietnam as the latecomers at their development processes. The empirical study found that the latecomers of Lao PDR and Myanmar seemed to suffer from the Dutch Disease over the sample period; and the forerunners of Indonesia and Malaysia, on the other hand, appeared to have no Dutch Disease effect at least in the current period of 1995-2015, although Indonesia had experienced the Dutch Disease in the previous period of 1970-1995. The lessons from the forerunners’ experiences in order for the latecomers to escape from the Ditch Disease are to establish some funding system of allocating resource revenues for investment projects; to diversify domestic industries through improving business environments; and to improve institutional quality to reinforce resource governance.
L60|Automation Processes and Blockchain Systems|Blockchain Systems and Ubiquitous computing are changing the way we do business and lead our lives. One of the most important applications of Blockchain technology is in automation processes and Internet-of-Things (IoT). Machines have so far been limited in ability primarily because they have restricted capacity to exchange value. Any monetary exchange of value has to be supervised by humans or human-based centralised ledgers. Blockchain technology changes all that. It allows machines to have unique identities and hence a virtual presence. Blockchain technology even allows for automated verification by the network of machines itself. It permits machines to exchange value and introduce the element of discretion in the hands of Machines. This can form the basis for ultimately developing IoT going on to Artificial Intelligence. This paper deals with the various interplays of Blockchain with Automation processes. Firstly, the concept of cryptocurrencies (also referred to as cryptocoins in this paper) is explained. Then the concept of Regulated and Sovereign Backed Cryptocurrencies (RSBCs) is discussed. Later on, I explain how Blockchain systems are related to IoT. Then we discuss the concept of Smart Mining that will lead to advanced Blockchain activity and Machine intelligence. Finally, the paper concludes as to how Blockchain technology will impact automation processes.
L60|Drivers of industrialisation: intersectoral evidence from the Low Countries in the nineteenth century|In this paper, we trace the causes of regional industrial development in the nineteenth century Low Countries by disentangling the complex relationship between industrialisation, technological progress and human capital formation. We use sectoral differences in the application of technology and human capital as the central elements to explain the rise in employment in the manufacturing sector during the nineteenth century, and our findings suggest a re-interpretation of the deskilling debate. To account for differences among manufacturing sectors, we use population and industrial census data, subdivided according to their present-day manufacturing sector equivalents of the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC). Instrumental variable regression analysis revealed that employment in the manufacturing sector was influenced by so-called upper- tail knowledge and not by average educational levels, providing empirical proof of a so-called deskilling industrialisation process. However, we find notable differences between manufacturing sectors. The textiles and clothing sectors show few agglomeration effects and limited use of steam-powered engines, and average education levels cannot adequately explain regional industrialisation. In contrast, the location of the fast- growing and innovative machinery-manufacturing sector was more influenced by technology and the availability of human capital, particularly upper-tail knowledge captured by secondary school attendance rates.
L60|Does competition prevent industrial pollution? Evidence from a panel threshold model|The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of competition on industrial toxic pollution by using, for the first time, a panel threshold model which allows evaluations of the main drivers of toxic releases under two different market regimes. The empirical analysis is based on a micro‐level panel dataset over the five‐year period 1987–2012. We show that this relationship is statistically significant and robust above and below the threshold, even after accounting for alternative specifications of market concentration. Specifically, we unmask an inverted V‐shaped relationship between market concentration and industrial pollution. We argue that the increasing non‐parametric regression line up to a certain concentration (threshold) level indicates a negative effect on facilities' emissions levels, whereas a decreasing line indicates a positive effect. This relationship provides new insights into environmental policy design towards abatement of industrial releases and sustainability. Finally, our empirical model remains robust under different specifications properly accounted for possible endogeneity.
L60|International Competitiveness of Czech Manufacturing - A Sectoral Approach with Error Correction Model|The main objective of this paper is to find the determinants of the international competitiveness of the manufacturing sectors of the Czech economy, using the database of 13 manufacturing subsectors in 1995-2011, with the aid of ECM model. The authors research the question of how much foreign and domestic demand, the level of labour costs, the level of sector innovation intensity, the level of sector openness to foreign markets as well as sectoral labour productivity influence the changes in their trade balance. The results of the analysis conducted show substantial differences in the roles particular variables play in explaining the net exports in individual sectors. The results of the analysis indicate mostly a greater impact of the researched factors on net exports in long rather than short term.
L60|Dopady vlastnické struktury, firemních charakteristik a krize na efektivitu českých podniků<BR>[Impact of Ownership Type, Firm Characteristics and Crisis on Efficiency of the Czech Firms]|We analyze how efficiency of firms in the Czech Republic is affected by their size, age, competition, capital structure, ownership types, and global financial crisis. We employ the stochastic frontier approach, use a large and detailed dataset, and cover time span 2001-2012. While effects of firm characteristics are small, the effects of ownership are economically substantial. We show that majority owners are most contributive with respect to firm’s efficiency when compared to other categories we analyze. Minority owners with legally grounded power are able to impose significant efficiency improvement. The effect of the foreign ownership is strongest when foreign owners control firms with less than majority of voting power. Minority owners sharing the control do not seem to contribute to efficiency. The impact of crisis is not balanced but can be regarded as marginally positive in general. The firms’ characteristics change only a little. In contrast, worsening impact of the crisis is evidenced for controlling ownership categories. Minority owners exhibit a limited disciplining effect to improve efficiency after the crisis, though.
L60|Uncovering Productivity Puzzles in Thailand: Lessons from Microdata|The Asian financial crisis in 1997 has an impact on Thailand's productivity both in the short run and in the long run. The post-crisis productivity growth rate dropped to merely 1% per year in comparison to the pre-crisis level at 2% per year. Thus, a better understanding about the factors determining Thailand's aggregate productivity is a key to raising Thailand's output in the long run. Recent literature has identified resource misallocation as an important factor to explain the difference in the productivity levels between developed and developing economies. This paper uses the plant-level data to estimate the allocative efficiency and to identify the source of resource misallocation in the Thai manufacturing sector. The results suggest that the size-dependent policies could contribute to the factor misallocation and that market concentration, foreign investment, and financial deepening could help alleviate the misallocation problem at the sector level. However, R&D activities intensifies resource misallocation that calls for well-defined policies to promote knowledge spillover within industry and to reduce the frontier-laggard gap. Dynamic resource reallocation helps shore up TFP growth over the business cycle that emphasizing a set of policy to reinforce the mechanism of creative destruction.
L60|Identification of Clusters - An Actor based Approach|This paper provides two things. First, it gives an overview on the existing top-down methods for the identification of clusters (Section II). Second, it presents a new method that has been recently introduced by Scholl and Brenner (2016) in a basic version. However, the existing version of this approach is limited and does not take full advantage of its potential. The approach is further developed here and its characteristics and the procedure of its use are presented and discussed in detail (Section III).
L60|Growing Productivity without Growing Wages: The Micro-Level Anatomy of the Aggregate Labor Share Decline|The aggregate labor share in U.S. manufacturing declined dramatically over the last three decades: Since the mid-1980’s, the compensation for labor declined from 67% to 47% of value added which is unseen in any other sector of the U.S. economy. The labor share of the typical U.S. manufacturing plants, in contrast, rose by over 5 percentage points. We reconcile these two facts by documenting (1) an important reallocation of production towards “hyper-productive plants” and (2) a downward adjustment of the labor share of those same plants over time. These two related forces account for almost all the change in the trend of aggregate labor share in the manufacturing sector, with only a small role for exit of high-labor-share plants. Relative to their peers, plants that account for the majority of production by the late 2000's arrive at a low labor share by gradually increasing value added by a factor of three while keeping employment and compensation unchanged.
L60|The Renewal of Production at the Product Line Level in Finnish Manufacturing|Abstract We characterize increases and decreases in plant-product -level output sales in the Finnish manufacturing sector during years 2006 to 2015. We show that during the recession of 2008 to 2009, the intensity of variation in plant-product -level sales diminished, and it took several years until the intensity of variation reached its pre-recession level. However in 2015 the intensity of variation was largest since 2006. We also decompose the changes in the plant-product -level output sales into changes in volume and changes in price.
L60|Why Geographic Dispersion Before Its Time: Industrial Policy and Economic Geography in the People’s Republic of China|We investigate the trends and determinants of geographic concentration and industrial specialization in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) using interprovincial panel data for the period from 1999 to 2010. It shows that, after 2005, both geographic concentration and industrial specialization began to decrease, resulting in an increased similarity of provincial industrial structure. Industrial policies of provincial governments cause geographic dispersion and inverse specialization. The result is robust when using instrumental variables to deal with possible reverse causality and omitted variable problems. The mechanism behind this is that central government industrial policy, which tends to last for several years, is an important reference document for each provincial planner. This causes the less-developed regions to deviate from their comparative advantages, resulting in a combination of insufficient geographic concentration and inverse specialization in the PRC.
L60|Default Risk, Productivity, and the Environment: Theory and Evidence from U.S. Manufacturing|This paper develops a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms to analyze the effect of default risk on production-generated pollution emissions. The model analytically divides the effect of default risk into three distinct effects: the market-size, technology-upgrading, and selection effect. Conceptually, an increase in default risk raises equilibrium borrowing costs, thereby precluding investment in a technology upgrade among a subset of firms (technology-upgrading effect). As a consequence, the economy consists of more numerous (market-size effect) but less productive and more pollution-intensive firms (selection effect). Because the effects are confounding in nature, the effect of default risk on aggregate pollution emissions and emissions intensity is an empirical question. To answer this question, this paper estimates the model’s key parameters using a unique dataset with establishment-level credit scores and a composite measure of pollution emissions for a panel of manufacturing firms in the United States. Using a two-step procedure where default risk is estimated in the first stage, the results indicate that the estimated elasticity of emissions intensity and productivity with respect to default risk is 0.89 and -0.16, respectively. Next, I use the theoretical model to leverage the coefficient estimates to estimate the effect of economy wide default risk on aggregate pollution emissions, demonstrating that default risk increases aggregate emissions and emissions intensity, primarily as a consequence of the technology-upgrading effect. Finally, this paper demonstrates that historical changes in economy-wide default risk can generate economically significant changes in pollution emissions.
L60|SME Technological Progress and Cooperation in Chinese Taipei: Implications to Selected APEC Economies|Chinese Taipei became one of the most successful economies in Asia after the WWII, and the country was one of the four Asian tigers together with the Republic of Korea, Chinese Hong Kong and Singapore. Their economic achievement was mainly originated from the development of SMEs which government policies were effectively implemented and brought strong im-pacts on technological progress. SMEs were able to obtain technologies through research and development, and technology transfer from developed countries with various cooperation programs. However, APEC economies notably Viet Nam, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines have achieved economic development and SME technological promotion, but they are not comparable with Chinese Taipei. This paper analyses Chinese Taipei govern-ment policies on SMEs, technological progress, and technology cooperation with developed countries. These areas are compared with other four APEC economies. It brings some suggestions how APEC can enhance SME tech-nology cooperation with other countries.
L60|The employment impact of private and public actions for energy efficiency: Evidence from European industries|This paper aims at investigating the main effects on EU employment dynamics related to private and public actions for energy efficiency. The econometric analysis relies on a sector-based panel dataset for 15 EU countries over the time span 1995–2009. The empirical analysis shows that after accounting for the role played by sectoral output growth, investment and innovation activities, sectoral energy efficiency gains display a negative effect on employment growth, in particular in energy intensive industries. On the contrary, we find that public actions towards energy efficiency may produce positive effects on employment dynamics. In particular, the higher incidence of taxation on energy costs, the effort towards energy efficiency gains realized in the public sector industries and the implementation of a comprehensive policy mix for energy efficiency at the country level, are factors positively influencing employment growth. This evidence highlights the complexity of the nexus between energy efficiency and employment dynamics, suggesting that superior employment performances can be achieved when complementarity effects between productivity enhancing activities and energy efficiency actions are realized.
L60|Italy’S Participation In International Supply And Production Networks Using Value Added Trade Data|In the last decades, the extension of the supply and production networks at global level has deeply modified the manufacturing production paradigm. This paper analyses the evolution of these networks, taking advantage of the informative potential of the Word Input-Output Database (WIOD) and of the methodology proposed by Wang et al. (2013) to look at this issue “through the lenses of value added”. More specifically, the paper focuses on Italy and its main trade partners and on two relevant industries (Machinery and Leather, leather products and footwear) and offers a comprehensive analysis of: (i) the export structure, to define the role of countries within the global networks; (ii) the main suppliers of foreign value added in exported goods and (iii) the productive inks of Italy with its major exporting markets, replacing the traditional customers-suppliers analysis with a more detailed wisdom that brings to light the productive integration among countries.
L60|Shutdown Decision of Firms Based on Variable Costs and Demand|The forest products industry in Alabama, the second largest manufacturing sector of the state, has been experiencing a recession in production, number of establishments and employees since the mid-1990s. This study investigates the determinants of this decline in the industry, using a county-level panel dataset that spans the period between 1996 and 2012. Four sub-sectors were analyzed separately, including the logging, wood, paper, and furniture manufacturing sectors. Results suggest that increases in average variable cost, rather than decreases in demand, were more strongly associated with the recession as measured by the number of operating establishments. Decomposition analysis indicates that the cost of materials, rather than labor, contributes more to the decline in the number of forest sector establishments in the state. This could be because increases in labor costs, such as wage increases, are accompanied by increases in labor productivity.
L60|Firm Characteristics and Total Factor Productivity: Evidence from Indian Manufacturing Firms|Measurement of the productivity of firms is an important research issue in productivity literature. Over the years, various methods have been developed to measure firm productivity across the globe. But there is no unanimity on the use of methods, and research on the identification of factors which determine productivity has been neglected. In view of these gaps, this study aims to measure total factor productivity (TFP) and tries to identify firm-specific factors which determine productivity of Indian manufacturing companies. The study is based on data of 616 firms from 1998â€“99 to 2012â€“13. To measure TFP, the Levinsohnâ€“Petrin (L-P) method has been employed, and the fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) method has been used to identify factors that affect TFP. The results reveal that embodied and disembodied technology plays a crucial role in the determination of productivity overall in manufacturing and other sub-industries. Similarly, the size of firms and intensity of raw material imports are also important for the determination of productivity across the sub-industries. JEL Classification: C14, C33, D24, L60
L60|Firm Employment Resilience and FDI: Evidence from Italy|Making use of an original data set we investigate the employment dynamics of a panel of Italian manufacturing firms over 2002-2010, and check whether, during the onset of the financial crisis (2008-2009), foreign multinational firms (FM) operating in Italy show a different employment adjustment with respect to domestic multinationals (DM) and to non multinational firms (NM). This paper is the first to test this issue for Italy and follows the benchmarking literature on other countries. We carry out an extensive descriptive analysis relative to firm characteristics and to employment growth over the period disaggregated by the three firms types, also taking into account subsamples of firms with different size and geographical location. We also estimate a GMM System dynamic panel model allowing the global crisis to impact differently on firms employment. A strong evidence of heterogeneity in terms of productivity, wages and financial indicators and of regional location is observed across the three firm types. Besides, the crisis did affect employment in firms according to their multinational status while also hitting firms differently according to other characteristics such as size, location and sectors. By looking at the descriptive analysis, over the crisis, employment changes were negative for the overall sample (-0.50) but increasing in dm and in fm (2.05 per cent). However, the econometric findings, which control at the same time for several factors affecting employment (firm ownership but also other firm and industry variables in addition to regional location), show a different picture: foreign multinationals are systematically more likely to experiment employment growth reductions than domestic multinationals and national enterprises in the North Centre area of the country thus contributing to the employment contraction during the crisis. Our results are not consistent with the idea that foreign investment are less affected by an economic crisis and that they may act as stabilisers in an economy.
L60|The 4th Industrial Revolution and R&D Policy|In this 4th Industrial Revolution, we are facing a range of new technologies that combine the physical, digital and biological worlds. These new technologies will impact all disciplines, economics and industries, and even challenge our ideas about what it means to be human. These technologies have great potential to continue to connect billions more people to the web, drastically improve the efficiency of business and organizations and help regenerate the natural environment through better asset management, potentially even undoing all the damage previous industrial revolution have caused. (Bernard Marr, 2016). And, More than 70% of South Koreans fear that the advent of the 4th industrial revolution will threaten their jobs. In this paper I studied about 4th Industrial Revolution. Especially I surveyed about between Industrial Revolution and R&D policy of Science & Technology.
L60|Additive manufacturing technology adoption: an empirical analysis of general and supply chain-related determinants|Abstract Despite experiencing immense growth in the past decade, additive manufacturing (AM) technologies—colloquially known as 3D-printing—are still rarely used in industrial fabrication. Being at the interface between technology, innovation, behavioral science and operations management research, this paper identifies multifaceted factors that determine the decision to adopt AM technologies for the production of industrial parts. A review of the relevant literature revealed eight potential factors. These can be classified into four interdisciplinary categories: technology-related factors, firm-related-factors, market structure-related factors, and supply chain-related factors. Special focus is placed on the impact of supply chain-related issues, because there are indicatives that these aspects have an influence on the decision to adopt AM technologies since AM may offer distinct opportunities for both, the supply- and demand-side of a firm’s operations. No work in the field of manufacturing technology adoption has examined the role of such inter-organizational factors before. The results of an empirical study among 195 firms indicate that demand-side benefits and compatibility are the main determinants of AM technology adoption. This suggests that not only intra- but also inter-organizational factors should be considered when investigating the adoption of technological innovations. Furthermore, it is carved out that the adoption of AM technologies has an interdisciplinary nature.

L60|A Reverse Directional Distance Function to Reconcile Between Competing Efficiency Goals: An Application to Indian Manufacturing|In analysis of technical efficiency in production, either the maximum proportional increase in all outputs or a minimal proportional scaling down of all inputs is generally selected as the criterion. In the recent literature, the Directional Distance Function combines the two objectives by increasing output and reducing input simultaneously to the extent possible. This paper introduces a Reverse Directional Distance Function as one possible approach to resolve the conflict between incompatible goals through a minimal adjustment applicable to both of the two objectives. In our empirical analysis we apply the proposed method to Indian manufacturing where increasing the output and conserving energy use are both highly important objectives. A comparison of the feasible targets obtained through the conventional and the Reverse Directional Distance Functions yields an estimated tradeoff between output increase and CO2 reduction (due to energy conservation) along the frontier.
L60|The determinants of coagglomeration: Evidence from functional employment patterns|Locations differ horizontally in the industry mix they host and vertically in the value-chain functions they perform. Since industry pairs should coagglomerate the functions that interact intensively across industries, analyzing horizontal and vertical patterns can improve our understanding of agglomeration mechanisms. We find that different functions within the same industry pairs display substantially different coagglomeration patterns. While production coagglomerates at longer distances, management and research coagglomerates at short distances. These patterns are consistent with our findings that buyer-supplier links and local labor pools are important for production, whereas they matter less for management and research that rely on shared knowledge. Our results provide support for agglomeration theories and show that extant estimates of average effects based on total employment mask substantial heterogeneity.
L60|Sub-Saharan Africa's Manufacturing Sector: Building Complexity|As Africa's working age population continues to grow rapidly, the region needs to experience both economic growth and high levels of job creation before it can realize the demographic dividend. This paper uses economic complexity analytics to provide product-level insights into sub-Saharan Africa's development path in comparison with that of the Eastern and Southern Asian regions. Specific emphasis is placed on the evolution of the manufacturing sector within these regions. The analysis from this study shows a sub-Saharan African (SSA) productive structure that is disconnected and characterized by products with low levels of economic complexity. The study further shows that the productive structure in SSA is inherently characterized by lower levels of economic complexity, which informed the notion of limited productive capabilities. This stands in contrast to the East and South Asian productive structure, which is connected and complex. This result implies that while the sheer scale and diversity of the manufacturing sector in Asia allows for the generation of a large number and diversity of employment opportunities that of the African manufacturing sector is marginal in nature and points to limited employment opportunities.
L60|To Bribe or not to Bribe? Corruption Uncertainty and Corporate Practices|Using a large sample of private firms over the period from 2001 to 2013, we study the effect of corruption uncertainty on corporate investments and cash holdings. We find that a higher uncertainty about the level of corruption is associated with lower corporate investments and lower cash holdings. These results are sensitive to the ownership structure of a firm. Firms with no foreign majority ownership appear to be more sensitive to corruption-induced uncertainty than majority-controlled foreign firms. They significantly decrease their investments and cash holdings. We hypothesize that they move their cash off-balance-sheet to create cash reserves as the uncertainty of when, whom, and how much to bribe increases.
L60|State Of Manufacturing In South Africa|The level of unemployment, poverty and inequality in South Africa is high in relation to the rest of the world. To overcome these three challenges, more and better jobs need to be created. A key source for these types of jobs can be found in the labour intensive manufacturing sector. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the performance of the South African manufacturing sector. We find that compared to other sectors of the economy, the manufacturing sector has performed poorly, both in terms of GDP growth and job creation. While all manufacturing sub-sectors showed GDP growth, that growth was marginal. Furthermore, although some manufacturing sub-sectors showed job growth, the rate of job losses in other manufacturing sub-sectors was far greater, resulting in overall job losses. We argue that the poor performance of the manufacturing sector can be attributed to increased competition from south-east Asia, and South Africa’s skills shortage. This research was commissioned by the Manufacturing, Engineering and Related Services SETA (merSETA). The authors wish to acknowledge merSETA’s contribution as funder, to the research and work herein.
L60|Servicification of Firms and Trade Policy Implications|In the OECD countries, the decline of manufacturing and its employment implications have long been matters of concern. Recently, policymakers in several countries have set out to achieve reindustrialization. The servicification of firms is related to these concerns and aspirations. However, servicification and particularly its role in trade policy have received limited attention. I review micro-level evidence and discuss implications. I find that imported, domestic and exported services are all important to contemporary firm competitiveness and participation in international value chains. Therefore, historic policymaking divides between trade in manufactures and services, between export and import interests, and among modes of supply are becoming less relevant. I conclude by suggesting potential steps forward.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L60|The Impact of National Private Investment on Manufacturing in Egypt|This paper aims to present national private investment development phases and its contribution in manufacturing sector in Egypt. Moreover it devoted to examine the effect of national private investment on Egyptian manufacturing. Vector autoregressive analysis was adopted based on yearly data for the period (1990-2015). Time series stationarity are checked by augmented Dicky–Fuller test, and co- integration existence tested by Johansen co-integration test. The vector error correction model utilized to check the existence of long run relationship between the manufactured product as a dependent variable and the national private investment as explanatory variable. Finally this paper concluded that, however national private investment contribute high share to manufacturing sector, the empirical analysis results obtained negative impact of this type of investment on manufacturing sector in short and long run
L60|Incremental innovation and competitive pressure in the presence of discrete innovation|Technical progress consists of improvements made upon the existing technology (incremental innovation) and innovative activities aiming at entirely new technology (discrete innovation). Incremental innovation is often of limited relevance to the new technology invented by successful discrete innovation. Previous theoretical studies have indicated that higher competitive pressure measured by product substitutability increases incremental innovation. In contrast, we find that intensified competition can decrease incremental innovation. A firm's market share upon its failure in discrete innovation decreases as competition intensifies. This effect decreases firms’ incentives for incremental innovation because the innovation outcome can be applied to a smaller amount of units.
L60|Age-productivity profiles of entrants and exits: evidence from Canadian manufacturing|Using the Longitudinal Annual Survey of Manufacturers for Canada, this paper aims to better understand the productivity dynamics of entrants and exits as well as the factors associated with their productivity performance. It shows that entrants and exits are lower in labour productivity relative to continuing plants partly because they are smaller in size, less capital intensive, and less associated with exporting, being foreign-controlled and belonging to multi-plant firm structure. It also finds that after controlling for those factors, surviving entrants are less productive when they enter and that they improve their productivity over time to become as productive as continuing plants by around year five after entry. Exits, on the other hand, are found to be less productive than continuing plants after controlling for those factors, and the gap becomes larger as they get closer to exit.
L60|Local Crowding Out in China|In China, between 2006 and 2013 local public debt crowded out the investment of private firms by tightening their funding constraints, while leaving state-owned firms’ investment unaffected. We establish this result using a purpose-built dataset for Chinese local public debt. Private firms invest less in cities with more public debt, the reduction in investment being larger for firms located farther from banks in other cities or more dependent on external funding. Moreover, in cities where public debt is high, private firms’ investment is more sensitive to internal cash .ow, also when cash-flow sensitivity is estimated jointly with the probability of being credit-constrained.
L60|Trade Policy and Structural Reforms at the Zero Lower Bound: Lessons Learned and Suggestions for Europe|Calls for market reforms to help improve economic performance have become a mantra in European policy discussions. In the recent years, fears of a new wave of protectionism reopened the debate on the macroeconomic effects of raising tariff and non-tariff barriers. In this policy paper, we evaluate the consequences of such policy options for economies in a liquidity trap - i.e. at times of major slack and binding constraints on monetary policy easing (such as when the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates is binding). First, we analyse the consequences of protectionism through the lens of a benchmark business cycle model. We show that raising trade barriers has contractionary effects both domestically and abroad. Such detrimental effects are larger in a liquidity trap. We conclude that Europe should not engage in protectionism, even in response to an increase in the level of tariffs imposed by a major trading partner (such as the U.S.). We then review recent trends in product and labor market regulation across the European Union members. Using results from the academic literature, we argue that market reforms in Europe are unlikely to induce significant deflationary effects, suggesting that the inability of monetary policy to deliver interest rate cuts might not be a relevant obstacle to reform. While coordinated structural reforms across the EU members would maximise short- and long-term gains, legal considerations of the implementation of reforms across countries pose challenges to the harmonisation process.
L60|Heterogeneous exporters: quantitative differences and qualitative similarities|We combine two detailed datasets on Colombian manufacturing firms and document several stylized facts on exporter heterogeneity of total factor productivity (TFP) and export-market orientation, refining some previously known facts and unveiling some new others. We first show that the exporter productivity premium is remarkably robust across the methodologies used to recover TFP. We then document that the most productive exporters are those that export (1) a higher share of their total production, (2) to a larger number of countries, (3) to destinations less frequently reached by other exporters, (4) a larger number of products, and (5) with greater frequency and stability. In contrast, (6) the type of destination country or (7) the type of exported product has no significant effect on exporter productivity differences. These facts are robust to alternative definitions and specifications and can provide useful guidelines for policy makers.
L60|Misallocation and Manufacturing TFP in Korea, 1982-2007|The authors apply the analysis of Hsieh and Klenow (2009) to assess the degree of resource misallocation in the Republic of Korea manufacturing sector from 1982 to 2007. They find improvement in the aggregate allocative efficiency during the first decade and a strong reversal after 1992. This pattern reflects the dynamics of the within-industry distortion measures for most industries and is consistent with the evolving systematic relationship between the age/value added of establishments and their measured idiosyncratic distortions over the sample period. Their finding suggests that the observed dispersion in revenue productivity should not be dismissed as mere artifacts of misspecification or measurement errors.
L60|Markup heterogeneity, export status ans the establishment of the euro|We investigate the effects of the establishment of the euro on the markups of French manufacturing firms. Merging firm-level census data with customs data, we estimate time-varying firm-specific markups and distinguish between eurozone exporters from other firms between 1995 and 2007. We find that the establishment of the euro has had a pronounced pro-competitive impact by reducing firm markups by 14 percentage points. By reducing export costs, the euro represented an opportunity for eurozone exporters to increase their margins relative to other firms. Quantile regressions show that the euro has led to a reduction in the variance of markups.
L60|Productivity and Wage Premiums: Evidence from Vietnamese Ordinary and Processing Exporters|We propose some new stylized facts on Vietnamese exporters that emphasize firm heterogeneity in trade regimes and firm ownership. We show first that the distribution of firms export intensities is U-shaped with more than half of Vietnamese exporters exporting more than 50% of their output. This contrasts with the export patterns in industrialized countries but is similar to the export intensity distribution for other emerging economies with strong participation in global value chains. Second, we show that export premia, evaluated in terms of both productivity and wage indexes, are positive only for Vietnamese exporters involved primarily in ordinary trade, and that processing exporters exhibit lower productivity indexes and pay lower wages than their non-exporting counterparts. This pattern is more pronounced among the group of foreign-owned firms in Vietnam compared to the group of domestic firms and is in line with previous ndings for China.
L60|Public Debt and Private Firm Funding: Evidence from Chinese Cities|In China, local public debt issuance between 2006 and 2013 crowded out investment by private manufacturing firms by tightening their funding constraints, while it did not affect state-owned and foreign firms. Using novel data for local public debt issuance, we establish this result in three ways. First, local public debt is inversely correlated with the city-level investment ratio of domestic private manufacturing firms. Instrumental variable regressions indicate that this link is causal. Second, local public debt has a larger negative effect on investment by private firms in industries more dependent on external funding. Finally, in cities with high government debt, firm-level investment is more sensitive to internal funding, also when this sensitivity is estimated jointly with the firm?s likelihood of being credit-constrained. Altogether, these results suggest that, by curtailing private investment, the massive public debt issuance associated with the post-2008 fiscal stimulus sapped long-term growth prospects in China.
L60|Product Switching and the Business Cycle|"This paper explores the role of product adding and dropping within manufacturing firms over the business cycle. While a substantial body of work has explored the importance of the extensive margins of firm entry and exit in employment and output flows, only recently has research begun to examine the adjustment across products within firms and its importance for firm and aggregate output and employment flows. Using a novel, annual firm-product data set covering all Japanese manufacturing firms with more than four employees from 1992 to 2006, we provide the first evidence on annual changes in product adding and dropping by continuing firms over the business cycle. We find very high rates of product adding and dropping by continuing firms between the last year of the recession and the first year of the subsequent expansion and offer an explanation and supporting evidence based on a ""trapped factors"" model of firm behavior."
L60|Medium-Sized Foreign-Owned German Enterprises Heavily Involved in R&D|In Germany, the share of private investment in research and development (R&D) by foreign-owned companies from the beginning of the millennium to 2011 remained virtually unchanged at around one-quarter. From 2011 to 2013, this share fell slightly, and for the first time since the mid-1990s also the absolute amount decreased. Growth in domestic firms, however, was so high that there was an increase in the overall R&D of firms in Germany.

L60|Mittelgroße auslandskontrollierte Unternehmen beteiligen sich stark an FuE in Deutschland|In Germany, the share of private investment in research and development (R&D) by foreign-owned companies from the beginning of the millennium to 2011 remained virtually unchanged at around one-quarter. From 2011 to 2013, this share fell slightly, and for the first time since the mid-1990s also the absolute amount decreased. Growth in domestic firms, however, was so high that there was an increase in the overall R&D of firms in Germany. The decline in investment by foreign companies is likely to reflect strategic decisions in some major enterprises; medium-sized foreign companies have in fact expanded their R&D activities. In the present study, no evidence was found that Germany has become less attractive as a location for research. In Deutschland lag der Anteil auslandskontrollierter Unternehmen an den privaten Investitionen für Forschung und Entwicklung (FuE) seit dem Beginn des Jahrtausends bis 2011 nahezu unverändert bei etwa einem Viertel. In den Jahren 2011 bis 2013 ist dieser Anteil leicht gesunken. Der Zuwachs in den einheimischen Unternehmen war jedoch so groß, dass die gesamte FuE der Unternehmen in Deutschland zunahm. Der Rückgang bei den ausländischen Unternehmen dürfte auf strategische Entscheidungen bei einigen Großunternehmen zurückzuführen sein, mittelgroße ausländische Unternehmen haben ihre FuE-Aktivitäten sogar ausgebaut. In der Analyse finden sich keine Hinweise darauf, dass Deutschland als Forschungsstandort unattraktiver geworden ist.

L60|The link between R&D, innovation and productivity: Are micro firms different?|We analyze the link between R&D, innovation, and productivity in MSMEs with a special focus on micro firms with fewer than 10 employees; usually constituting the majority of firms in industrialized economies. Using the German KfW SME-panel, we examine to what extent micro firms are different from other firms in terms of innovativeness. We find that while firms engage in innovative activities with smaller probability, the smaller they are, for those firms that do make such investment, R&D intensity is larger the smaller firms are. For all MSMEs, the predicted R&D intensity is positively correlated with the probability of reporting innovation, with a larger effect size for product than for process innovations. Moreover, micro firms benefit in a comparable way from innovation processes as larger firms, as they are similarly able to increase their labor productivity. Overall, the link between R&D, innovation, and productivity in micro firms does not largely differ from their larger counterparts.
L60|Non-structural and Structural Models in Productivity Analysis: Study of the British Isles during the 2007-2009 Financial Crisis|The paper reviews and provides an extension of the benefits and drawbacks of the non-structural Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) paradigm, as well as other number index-based procedures that we will utilize in the analysis. We then compare SFA with two structural models: the Pakes McGuire Model (PMM) (Pakes, Gowrisankaran and McGuire 1993) and the Midrigan and Xu Model (MXM) (Midrigan and Xu 2014). All three methods are used to estimate changes in firm-level productivity in the British Isles before and after the 2007-2009 financial crisis under the canonical single production assumption. The empirical results indicate that overall productivity was not impacted to any substantial degree by the financial crisis, according to both SFA and the PMM. However, the productivity loss estimated by MXM due to financial friction from the recession was substantial.
L60|Private Equity and its Role in the Development of the Indian Manufacturing Sector|Manufacturing sector accounts for only 16% of gross domestic product (GDP) in India, while in China it is around one third of its GDP. Also the share of Indian manufacturing in the worldwide markets is dismal at 1.4%, while China it is now 13% from just 2.9% in 1990s. India also aspires to have such growth in its manufacturing sector. Growth of manufacturing sector is vital due to its multiplier effect on economy and employment. Every job created in the manufacturing sector creates two-three additional jobs in related activities. The aim of the Indian National Manufacturing Policy (2011) is to create to 100 million jobs and increase the share of manufacturing in GDP to 25% by 2022. Private equity (PE) as fi nancial intermediaries improves the allocation of resources from the investors and also provides various types of managerial assistance to industry enabling make them to be more competitive. This paper emphasizes the role that can be played by PE in the development of Indian manufacturing sector. Also the paper highlights the various types of assistance and problems in PE
L60|Cambios estructurales en la industria brasileña (1995-2009)|El objetivo de este artículo consiste en analizar los cambios estructurales en la industria brasileña entre 1995 y 2009, teniendo en cuenta sus relaciones intersectoriales. Para ello se utiliza el análisis de insumo-producto basado en el método de descomposición estructural y el cálculo de los índices de eslabonamiento. Los resultados muestran que la expansión de la demanda final desempeña un papel importante en el crecimiento de la industria en el ámbito del empleo, el valor agregado y el valor bruto de producción. Se destaca el crecimiento de la industria intensiva en recursos naturales. Por otra parte, se constata el debilitamiento de la demanda intersectorial, especialmente en los sectores intensivos en escala y con tecnología diferenciada.
L60|Deindustrialization? A global perspective|Recent studies show that, within countries, manufacturing labor productivity growth has outstripped aggregate labor productivity growth, putting significant downwards pressure on national manufacturing employment shares. We compile the first (nearly) global database of national manufacturing employment and output levels over time, and use it to document two facts seemingly at odds with these results: (1) the manufacturing sector’s share of global employment did not fall between 1970 and 2010; and (2) manufacturing and aggregate labor productivity at the global level grew at similar rates. We show that these trends occurred because rapid within-country manufacturing productivity growth was counterbalanced by a shift of manufacturing jobs towards lower productivity economies.
L60|Energy efficiency in Swedish industry|This paper assesses energy efficiency in Swedish industry. Using unique firm-level panel data covering the years 2001–2008, the efficiency estimates are obtained for firms in 14 industrial sectors by using data envelopment analysis (DEA). The analysis accounts for multi-output technologies where undesirable outputs are produced alongside with the desirable output. The results show that there was potential to improve energy efficiency in all the sectors and relatively large energy inefficiencies existed in small energy-use industries in the sample period. Also, we assess how the EU ETS, the carbon dioxide (CO2) tax and the energy tax affect energy efficiency by conducting a second-stage regression analysis. To obtain consistent estimates for the regression model, we apply a modified, input-oriented version of the double bootstrap procedure of Simar and Wilson (2007). The results of the regression analysis reveal that the EU ETS and the CO2 tax did not have significant influences on energy efficiency in the sample period. However, the energy tax had a positive relation with the energy efficiency.
L60|Product innovation, firm renewal and family governance|Product innovation has been recognized as a primary means of corporate renewal as it demands the creation and expansion of organizational competences over time. Among the factors driving product introduction is governance structure. Where shareholders value control over the firm, new product introductions may be avoided if unrelated to the legacy product portfolio and therefore risky. As a consequence, company control goals may favour products within the existing competency domain, and that in turn may impede firm technological competency renewal. Because of their conservatism and desire for control, studying family firms new product strategies may demonstrate how governance conditions driving product selection relate to competency renewal. This study of 220 Italian firms shows family governance to inhibit the kinds of new product introductions that renew competencies, especially in successor generations. Although it does not suppress new product introduction per se, family management limits the products that renew technological capabilities, while increasing the offerings that help to open new foreign markets.
L60|Productivity, resource endowment and trade performance of the wood product sector|This paper analyzes the determinants of international trade of wood products, considering three main groups: woodworking products, pulp and paper and wooden furniture. We extend the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (HOV) framework in order to take into account the forest resource endowment as well as industrial performance factors. Empirical tests are based on data on European countries between 1995 and 2007. The HOV hypothesis is partially confirmed in that the forest resource endowment is a significant determinant for explaining differences in net trade of two products (pulp and paper and furniture) but not for woodworking products. In addition, empirical tests also show the limits of the HOV model for explaining international trade of wood products. Indeed, factors reflecting industrial performance of wood sectors, including total factor productivity and average labor cost, have a significant role in determining differences in net trade of wood products.
L60|The effects of import competition on worker health|Occupational health is an important determinant of workers' welfare. Existing mechanisms and evidence from the international trade and occupational safety literatures combine to predict that import competition impacts work place injuries, especially at small firms that are most affected by foreign imports. We examine this prediction with novel data on injuries at US manufacturers using Chinese import growth in 1996–2007 as a shock to competition. The data show that injury rates in the competing US industries increase over the short to medium run, particularly at smaller establishments. Back-of-the-envelope calculations show that injury risk increases by 13% at the smallest establishments, the equivalent of a 1% to 2% reduction in workers' wages.
L60|Importing, exporting, and firm-level employment volatility|In this paper, we use detailed trade and transactions data for the U.S. manufacturing sector to document a new set of stylized facts on the theoretically ambiguous relationship between the volatility of employment growth and the trade exposure of a firm. We find that, on average, firms that export are less volatile than non-traders, while importers are more volatile. The substantial variation we document across trading firms, in terms of the duration of time and the intensity with which they trade, the number and type of products they trade, and in terms of the number and characteristics of their trading partners, plays an integral role in explaining the robust association between trading and employment volatility. For trading firms, the frequency of trade is negatively associated with employment volatility. Importers with a higher share of imported inputs (especially manufactured imports) and those that source from more countries and from countries with lower per-capita income experience higher levels of volatility. A higher share of exports, fewer number of export destinations and, export destinations that are further away, and with lower average incomes are associated with higher levels of volatility for exporters.
L60|Market structure and exchange rate pass-through|We study firm-level pricing behavior through the lens of exchange rate pass-through and provide new evidence on how firm-level market shares and price complementarities affect pass-through decisions. Using U.S. import price micro data, we identify two facts: First, exactly the firms that react the most with their prices to changes in their own costs are also the ones that react the least to changing prices of competing importers. Second, the response of import prices to exchange rate changes is U-shaped in our proxy for market share while it is hump-shaped in response to the prices of competing importers. We show that both facts are consistent with a model based on Dornbusch (1987) that generates variable markups through a nested-CES demand system. Finally, based on the model, we find that direct cost pass-through and price complementarities among importers play approximately equally important roles in determining pass-through but also partly offset each other. This suggests that equilibrium feedback effects in import pricing are large. Omission of either channel in an empirical analysis results in a failure to explain how market structure affects price-setting in industry equilibrium.
L60|The effect of competition on toxic pollution releases|We examine how competition affects toxic industrial releases, using five years of data from thousands of facilities across hundreds of industries. Our main result indicates that competition reduces toxic releases at the facility level. On average, each percentage-point reduction in the Herfindahl Index (HHI) results in a nearly two-percent reduction in a facility׳s toxic releases. At the same time, we find no evidence that competition increases aggregate pollution. Further analysis sheds some light on the mechanisms through which firms reduce pollution releases due to increased competition. In particular, we find suggestive evidence that this relationship is due to both reduced output and increases in abatement. We find no evidence that our result is driven by: consumer aversion to pollution, regulations changing with competition, or technologies introduced by new firms. Taken together, our results indicate that competition may be good, at least for public health in areas near polluting facilities, and fail to provide support for the hypothesis that competition leads to more socially undesirable behavior.
L60|Infrastructure, information & communication technology and firms’ productive performance of the Indian manufacturing|The Make in India program aims at building best-in-class manufacturing set up in the country. However, public infrastructure is considered to be one of the biggest obstacles for the growth of manufacturing in the country. In this context, this paper examines the role of infrastructure and information & communication technology (ICT) on total factor productivity (TFP) and technical efficiency (TE) of the Indian manufacturing sector for the period 1994–2010. We use advanced estimation techniques to overcome problems of non-stationarity, omitted variables, endogeneity and reverse causality by applying fully modified OLS, panel cointegration and System GMM. Estimation results suggest that the impact of infrastructure and ICT is rather strong. Importantly, industries, such as Transport Equipment, Textile, Chemicals, Metal & Metal Products, which are more exposed to foreign competition, are found to be more sensitive to infrastructure endowments. In the light of these findings, policy implications are brought out.
L60|Estimating workers’ bargaining power and firms’ markup in India: Implications of reforms and labour regulations|This paper simultaneously estimates workers’ bargaining power (WBP) and firm’s markup (FMU) in Indian manufacturing industries, using state-wise three-digit industry-level panel data for the period 1980–2007. It also examines the association of WBP and FMU with industrial deregulation, trade liberalisation and labour regulations. Results of the econometric analysis suggest that WBP is negatively associated with both industrial deregulations and trade liberalisation, but there is no significant association of FMU with these reforms. Further, pro-worker amendments to selected provisions of Industrial Disputes Act 1947, but not all, seem to enhance WBP to some extent. In light of these findings, policy implications are brought out.
L60|Agglomeration within an urban area|This paper utilizes a newly created index for colocalization to estimate the determinants of industrial agglomeration within a single urban area. Our new index directly incorporates the location of individual establishments while controlling for the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) in order to create this measure of spatial similarity between two industries. We estimate that proximity to transportation infrastructure and consumers as well as knowledge spillovers largely explain patterns of agglomeration. We find a smaller role for input–output linkages and consumption externalities for retail and consumer service industries.
L60|Regional business climate and interstate manufacturing relocation decisions|In this study, we use the National Establishment Time Series (NETS) database to study relocation by manufacturers based on differences in the business climate between the origin and destination states. We model interstate relocations for manufacturers in aggregate and for three subgroups characterized by their industry-level research and development (R&D) intensity. The analysis suggests that very few manufacturing firms relocate across state lines in any given year and the vast majority of those that do are small in size and move to adjoining states. Our results also reveal that interstate migration by manufacturing establishments varies with their R&D intensity. Whereas a number of factors considered in this study are statistically significant, marginal effects at the mean are infinitesimal. This implies that states attempting to encourage manufacturing firms to relocate from other states via traditional perspectives on business climate are unlikely to be successful.
L60|Industrial energy demand and energy efficiency – Evidence from Sweden|This paper estimates firm level energy demand and energy efficiency for 14 sectors in Swedish manufacturing using stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). We derive sector level energy demand frontiers that account for firm specific heterogeneity. Results show that there is potential to improve energy efficiency for fuel and electricity use in all sectors; energy intensity is not an appropriate proxy for energy efficiency; the EU ETS had a modest or no effect on Swedish firms’ efficient use of energy during the first trading phase and the beginning of the second, indicating that the carbon permit price was too low to generate the necessary incentives for energy efficiency investments.
L60|ICT intermediates and productivity spillovers—Evidence from German and US manufacturing sectors|Recent pre-crisis growth accounting exercises attribute productivity growth accelerations to investments in information and communication technologies (ICT). Stylized facts about a growing US–EU productivity gap are confirmed for Germany, particularly showing no substantially economy-wide ICT effects for German sectors. Tracing the effect from ICT during 1991–2005, this study takes a different view by expanding the value-added concept to gross output including different types of intermediate inputs. The findings suggest that imported intermediate inputs played a more dominating role in Germany, particularly imported non-ICT and ICT materials. In the US, main drivers were domestically-produced non-ICT services and ICT materials, even though imported ICT materials were on the upraise post 1995. Moreover, German TFP growth experienced increasing returns to scale from domestically-produced ICT materials, while US TFP growth originated from imported ICT materials. It will be argued that these different productivity effects stem from different functions of ICT in the production process, which originated in the ICT-production sectors and were passed on to downstream sectors.
L60|Spillovers in Space: Does Geography Matter?|We simultaneously assess the contributions to productivity of three sources of research and development spillovers: geographic, technology and product-market proximity. To do this, we construct a new measure of geographic proximity that is based on the distribution of a firm's inventor locations rather than its headquarters, and we report both parametric and semiparametric estimates of our geographic- distance functions. We find that: i) Geographic space matters even after conditioning on horizontal and technological spillovers; ii) Technological proximity matters; iii) Product-market proximity is less important; iv) Locations of researchers are more important than headquarters but both have explanatory power; and v) Geographic markets are very local.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L60|Do Mayoritarian Electoral Rules Favour Larger Industries in the Economy| Electoral rules translate votes into seats on different basis. Politicians respond differently to alternative electoral rules, and consequently, economic performance is expected to vary across rules. This paper empirically investigates whether electoral rules have an effect –and if so, under which circumstances–on the economic performance of industries. Applying panel data techniques to an extensive dataset covering 61 manufacturing industries from 58 democracies over 1990-2010, we find that industry size –measured by the number of workers to total population– grinds industry economic growth. However, we find very robust evidence that large industries grow less slowly under majoritarian rules than under proportional representation and mixed systems. Based on previous theories suggesting that majoritarian rules are more likely to target narrow-interest groups, we conjecture a multilateral political linkage among officed-oriented politicians, industries and voters which might explain the differential effect of electoral rules on the economic performance of industries.
