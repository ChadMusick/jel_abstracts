F38|Macroprudential and monetary policy: Loan-level evidence from reserve requirements|We analyze the impact of reserve requirements on the supply of credit to the real sector. For identification, we exploit a tightening of reserve requirements in Uruguay during a global capital inflows boom, where the change affected more foreign liabilities, in conjunction with its credit register that follows all bank loans granted to non-financial firms. Following a difference-in-differences approach, we compare lending to the same firm before and after the policy change among banks differently affected by the policy. The results show that the tightening of the reserve requirements for banks lead to a reduction of the supply of credit to firms. Importantly, the stronger quantitative results are for the tightening of reserve requirements to bank liabilities stemming from non-residents. Moreover, more affected banks increase their exposure into riskier firms, and larger banks mitigate the tightening effects. Finally, the firm-level analysis reveals that the cut in credit supply in the loan-level analysis is binding for firms. The results have implications for global monetary and financial stability policies.
F38|A Macroprudential Theory of Foreign Reserve Accumulation|This paper proposes a theory of foreign reserves as macroprudential policy. We study an open economy model of financial crises, in which pecuniary externalities lead to overborrowing, and show that by accumulating international reserves, the government can achieve the constrained-efficient allocation. The optimal reserve accumulation policy leans against the wind and significantly reduces the exposure to financial crises. The theory is consistent with the joint dynamics of private and official capital flows, both over time and in the cross section, and can quantitatively account for the recent upward trend in international reserves.
F38|Post-Crisis Changes in the Pattern of Capital Flows - The Case of Korea|This paper investigates pattern changes in international capital flows after the Global Financial Crisis using the Korean case. It follows capital flows of Korea during the last couple of decades to characterize three significant changes after the crisis. First, after the introduction of macroprudential policies, the bank external borrowing was curbed while the bank external lending started an increasing trend. Second, the resident’s outward portfolio investments outpaced foreign portfolio investments on domestic assets after the crisis. The net outflow is closely associated with changes in return differentials between domestic and foreign assets. Third, the continued current account surpluses were saved as private assets held abroad, while it was saved as FX reserves before the crisis. The precautionary role of reserves is now complemented by currency swap arrangements with major countries. Simple VAR results confirm the increased resilience of the bank’s foreign borrowing to external shocks, and the increased association of net portfolio inflows with the interest rate differential after the crisis.
F38|Determinants of International Consumption Risk Sharing in Developing Countries|Complete financial markets allow countries to share their consumption risks internationally, thereby creating welfare gains through lower volatility of aggregate consumption. This paper empirically looks at international consumption risk sharing and its determinants in a panel of 120 countries from 1970 to 2014. Contrary to some previous studies, I show that financial liberalization and financial integration has a significantly positive impact on international consumption risk sharing in poorer developing countries, whereas in emerging market countries only capital account openness has an impact. Moreover, there is some evidence that high income inequality or a high share of low income individuals reduces consumption smoothing in less developed countries. Lack of financial reforms, a lower degree of financial integration and higher inequality can thus partly explain why the degree of risk sharing is lower in developing countries than in advanced economies.
F38|Gains from Policy Cooperation in Capital Controls and Financial Market Incompleteness|We examine how the degree of financial market incompleteness affects welfare gains from policy cooperation in capital controls. When financial markets are incomplete, international risk sharing is disturbed. However, the optimal global policy significantly reverses the welfare deterioration due to inefficient risk-sharing. We find that when financial markets are more incomplete, the welfare gap between the optimal global policy and the Nash equilibrium increases, and the welfare gains from policy cooperation in capital controls then become larger.
F38|The broad policy toolkit for financial stability: Foundations, fences, and fire doors|The post financial crisis period has been associated with increased countercyclical use of various financial policies, including residency-based measures. This paper analyses in a single analytical framework the relative effectiveness of three types of financial policies – macroprudential (foundations), currency-based (fences), and residency-based measures (fire doors). The findings in this paper are based on a granular quarterly database of adjustments in these policies that covers both advanced and emerging economies from 2000 to 2015. The results show that residency-based measures on bonds and credit reduce capital inflows but provide limited support for a credit-mitigation role. While no evidence emerges that macroprudential measures alter capital inflows, most appear effective in reducing credit growth. Currency-based measures may reduce both inflows and credit growth (particularly FX reserve requirements and FX lending regulations). These results indicate that the impact of policies needs to be analysed at a granular level and that policy makers should adopt an integrated view of the financial policy toolkit.
F38|Monetary policy in sudden stop-prone economies|In a model featuring sudden stops and pecuniary externalities, I show that the ability to use capital controls has radical implications for the conduct of monetary policy. Absent capital controls, following an inflation targeting regime is nearly optimal. However, if the central bank lacks commitment, it will follow a monetary policy that is excessively procyclical and not desirable from an ex ante welfare prospective: it increases overall indebtedness as well as the frequency of financial crisis and reduces social welfare relative to an inflation targeting regime. Access to capital controls can correct this monetary policy bias. With capital controls, relative to an inflation targeting regime, the time-consistent regime reduces both the frequency and magnitude of crises, and increases social welfare. This paper rationalizes the procyclicality of the monetary policy observed in many emerging market economies.
F38|Optimal Regulation of P2P Lending for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises|Globally, the regulation of P2P lending has evolved significantly in recent years, with mostly beneficial effects on the diversification of funding for individuals and corporations. Regulatory responses have varied greatly between countries, and the characteristics of the markets that have emerged vary as a result. We describe and evaluate the range of P2P lending systems on offer to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in several countries, considering different regulatory regimes. In some countries, there are problematic incentives for platforms that rate credit and originate loans without holding the risk of these loans. In addition, when investor returns are guaranteed by platforms, investors have no incentive to distinguish among risk categories. In several countries, notably the People’s Republic of China, P2P platforms have engaged in fraudulent behavior and Ponzi-like schemes. On the other hand, stringent regulation in the United States has excessively impeded new entrants from providing competition to established platforms. Regulators should be mindful of these risks and others, while also seeking to capitalize on the benefits that the sector offers for providing new funding opportunities to SMEs. In our view, the United Kingdom can be suggested as an effective model to follow because of its tailor-made and flexible regulation.
F38|Macroprudential and Monetary Policy: Loan-Level Evidence from Reserve Requirements|We analyze the impact of reserve requirements on the supply of credit to the real sector. For identification, we exploit a tightening of reserve requirements in Uruguay during a global capital inflows boom, where the change affected more foreign liabilities, in conjunction with its credit register that follows all bank loans granted to non-financial firms. Following a difference-in-differences approach, we compare lending to the same firm before and after the policy change among banks differently affected by the policy. The results show that the tightening of the reserve requirements for banks lead to a reduction of the supply of credit to firms. Importantly, the stronger quantitative results are for the tightening of reserve requirements to bank liabilities stemming from non-residents. Moreover, more affected banks increase their exposure into riskier firms, and larger banks mitigate the tightening effects. Finally, the firm-level analysis reveals that the cut in credit supply in the loan-level analysis is binding for firms. The results have implications for global monetary and financial stability policies.
F38|Financial Openness, Bank Capital Flows, and the Effectiveness of Macroprudential Policies|We study the effectiveness of macroprudential policies in mitigating credit growth in open economies. Empirically we find that macroprudential policies contain domestic credit growth but are less effective in financially more integrated economies due to greater cross-border bank borrowing. We develop a small open economy DSGE model with cross-border bank financing to interpret the empirical findings and quantitatively evaluate the macroeconomic and welfare implications of macroprudential policies. Consistent with the empirical evidence, our model shows that banks contract credits and increase the fraction of foreign financing in response to macroprudential policy tightening. This liability composition shift significantly under-mines the stabilizing effect and welfare gains of macroprudential policies, so they become less effective in financially more open economies. Our results also suggest it is desirable to implement more restrictive macroprudential regulations when capital moves more freely.
F38|Capital controls spillovers|I built a three-country business cycle model with one AE and two EMEs to analyze the spillover effects arising from capital controls. I find that, following a push-factor shock from the AE, if one EME tightens capital controls, the other EME experiences an additional wave of foreign investments. In addition, the spillover effects are economically meaningful and can be sizable under specific conditions. Moreover, my findings point out that, in the presence of international financial frictions, moderate capital controls may be useful to EMEs to affect the interest rate at which they trade international bonds. Finally, based on my results, coordination among EMEs in setting capital controls seems to deliver relatively small welfare gains compared with the Nash equilibrium.
F38|Funding Liquidity without Banks: Evidence from a Shock to the Cost of Very Short-Term Debt|In 2011, Colombia instituted a tax on repayment of bank loans, thereby increasing the cost of short-term bank credit more than long-term credit. Firms responded by cutting their short-term loans for liquidity management purposes and increasing their use of cash and trade credit. In industries where trade credit is more accessible (based on U.S. Compustat firms), we find substitution into accounts payable and little effect on cash and investment. Where trade credit is less available, firms increase cash and cut investment. Thus, trade credit offers a substitute source of liquidity that can insulate some firms from bank liquidity shocks.
F38|Financial stress in lender countries and capital outflows from emerging market economies|We investigate if financial stress in countries where international banks are headquartered is a major driver of banking outflows from emerging market economies (EMEs). We find that when financial stress measured by sovereign or bank CDS spread or corporate bond spread increases, international banks decrease their lending to EMEs, which acts as a major driver of capital outflows from EMEs. In particular, financial stress in lender countries is a more important driver than the local financial conditions and macroeconomic fundamentals of EMEs. Such results generally hold even after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) period, but to a lesser extent. When we divide the total amount of international lending into subcomponents, cross-border lending to EMEs is more susceptible to financial stress in lender countries than is local lending, and that local lending in foreign currency is more stable than is cross-border lending. Our findings suggest that it is desirable for EME policymakers to promote diversification of lender countries and induce more borrowing from local subsidiaries than cross-border lenders.
F38|Why exports adjust: missing imported inputs or lack of credit?|This paper examines the role of imported intermediate inputs and credit constraints on exports adjustment. For identification, we study an episode of capital controls on outflows that exogenously restricted firms’ ability to pay for imports and the large-scale credit crunch that followed the imposition of controls in Greece in June 2015. Exploiting within-firm variation across sectors, we find that lack of imported inputs explains the drop in exports at the intensive margin, while lack of long-term credit is associated with adjustments at the extensive margin. Multinationals overcome liquidity constraints because of access to parents’ internal funds, but not import constraints because of stronger linkages for specialized inputs abroad. Our findings point to a novel result: the importance of both channels – real and finance – in jointly determining trade adjustment, and the different implications for the margins of trade
F38|Financial development and FDI flows: evidence from advanced economies|Foreign direct investment (FDI) has grown dramatically as a major form of international capital transfer over the past decades. This rapid growth in cross border investment has to a large part been due to the reduction in trade and investment barriers, the harmonization and mutual recognition of regulation and the removal of domestic impediments through reform and privatization (see OECD, 2001). Amongst the numerous FDI determinants studied in the literature, the development and depth of the financial sector has gained importance during the last decade. According to the Paradox of Finance hypothesis, despite the fact that Multinational Corporations (MNCs) are not locally financially constrained their affiliates interact significantly with the domestic financial system. Hence, a deep and efficient financial system should act as a pull factor for FDI flows. Using up-to-date FDI data for advanced and emerging economies, this research explores the role of previously unavailable financial variables in attracting FDI flows. The results show that fostering an efficient financial sector with diversified funding sources for enterprises contributes to increased participation by Multinational Corporations in the host economy. This insightful policy implication for advanced economies is that the restructuring of the financial system can contribute to economic recovery through the FDI channel as well. Finally, the results highlight the importance for the full implementation of the Banking Union and the Capital Markets Union in the EU.
F38|Central Bank Reputation and Inflation-Unemployment Performance: Empirical Evidence from an Executive Survey of 62 Countries|Although there is a well-established theoretical literature that links central bank (CB) reputation with inflation performance following Barro and Gordon, there is little empirical work testing the relationship rigorously. This paper empirically tests the impact of reputation on inflation-unemployment performance using a novel set of data on CB reputation--an annual local business manager survey on central bank policy covering 62 countries during 1995-2016. This paper finds that CB reputation is a significant determinant of inflation: the results of an FE panel and Arellano-Bond difference GMM model show that high-reputation CBs have achieved better inflation performances over the past 20 years with lower levels of inflation than others, holding the output gap and unemployment rate constant. This result remains robust to various control variables including money growth, past inflation levels, exchange rates, and financial crisis dummies. This paper also finds that high CB reputation is associated with a tight anchoring of inflation expectations to inflation targets in inflation-targeting countries. The effects of reputation on the volatility of inflation and unemployment rates are found to be not robust. This paper offers evidence of the opposite-direction causality as well that goes from high inflation to decreased CB reputation.
F38|Cross-Border Bank Flows through Foreign Branches: Evidence from Korea|Global banks play an important role in international monetary transmission by allocating funds across the world through their foreign affiliates. Using monthly data on individual foreign bank branches in Korea from 2004 to 2018, this paper investigates the effects of foreign monetary policies and Korean macroprudential policy on the cross-border capital flows between global banks' headquarters and their Korean branches. I find that foreign branches reduce borrowing from their headquarters by 2.4% of their assets after a one percentage point hike in the home-country policy rates. The effect is more significant for the branches with higher loan-to-asset ratios as their asset maturities are longer. Korea introduced leverage caps on banks' FX derivative positions in 2010, and has been adjusting the cap depending on the macroeconomic situation. I find that lowering the cap makes foreign branches increase capital by receiving long-term capital from headquarters. The branches with higher bond-to-asset ratios respond more as they trade heavily in FX derivatives.
F38|How Should Capital Be Taxed? Theory and Evidence from Sweden|This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the role of capital taxation in advanced economies with a focus on the Swedish experience. We synthesize the existing theoretical literature, present facts about the capital stock and its distribution, review current capital tax practices and empirical findings regarding their effects on economic activity. The paper also examines the political feasibility of capital taxation by presenting results from a unique attitude survey targeted to a large representative sample of the Swedish population. Finally, we tie together our findings and discuss their implications for tax policy.
F38|Cheap talk? Financial sanctions and non-financial activity|Sanctions restrict cross-border interactions and, therefore, not only put political and economic pressure on the target country, but they also adversely affect the sender country. This paper examines the effect of financial sanctions on the country imposing them. In particular, we analyze the business responses of German non-financial entities to the imposition of sanctions on 23 countries over the period from 1999 through 2014. Examining highly disaggregated, monthly data from the German balance of payments statistics, we find four main results. First, German financial activities with sanctioned countries are sizably reduced after the imposition of sanctions, with strong reductions in the scope of cross-border activities (i.e., the extensive margin with fewer firms and fewer asset categories) and less statistically robust results for total financial flows (sum of inflows and outflows) which is consistent with the concept of 'smart sanctions'. Second, firms doing business with sanctioned countries tend to be disproportionately large, making them largely immune to the reduction in business opportunities with individual partners. Third, firms affected by sanctions expand their activities with non-sanctioned countries, some of which display close trade ties to the sanctioned country. Fourth, we find no effect of sanctions on aggregate variables of firm performance such as employment or total sales. Overall, we conclude that the economic costs of financial sanctions to the sender country are limited.
F38|Macroprudential policy and income inequality|Based on newly available data, we examine the relationship between macroprudential policies (MaPs) and the Gini coefficient of both market income inequality, i.e. the Gini coefficient of income inequality before redistributive policies, and net income inequality, i.e. inequality after redistribution. We run panel regressions for 69 countries over the period 2000–2013. Our results show a positive association of the use of some MaPs with both market and net income inequality. In particular, we find that concentration limits, macroprudential reserve requirements and interbank exposure limits have a positive relationship with market income inequality, while loan-to-value (LTV) limits have a positive association with net inequality. The results for other measures are relatively sensitive to specification.
F38|A quantitative analysis of the size of IMF resources|In this report, three methodological approaches are applied to assess the size of the International Monetary Fund: benchmarking Fund resources against a number of relevant global economic and financial indicators; an extrapolation of past and current IMF programme characteristics; and a shock scenario analysis. Overall, while the results of the different approaches depend on the assumptions and the timeframe considered, the quantitative analysis indicates that a prudent approach would call for maintaining Fund total resources at their current levels. Yet, the quantitative analysis of the size of the Fund made in this report should be seen only as one element to assess the adequacy of Fund resources. It does not take into account qualitative considerations, such as the increased resilience of the global economy and the efforts made to strengthen regulation and supervision since the financial crisis, which should complement the quantitative analysis to complete the analytical basis for decision makers. Moreover, the final decision on the appropriate size of Fund resources will need to include political judgement. Therefore, this report does not provide recommendations on the appropriate level of IMF resources after the expiration of borrowed resources. JEL Classification: F3, F32, F38, F42, F65, G28
F38|Global Banking Network and Regional Financial Contagion|This paper investigates and tests the role of regional exposures in financial contagion from advanced to emerging market economies through the global banking network using data on cross-border bilateral bank claims and liability positions. We first examine whether an economy can become more susceptible to capital outflows, regardless of its own bank exposures, if economies in the same region are heavily exposed to crisis countries. Second, we test whether the same region lenders tend to reduce exposures to the emerging market borrowers less than do different region lenders during crises. Using bilateral data from the Bank for International Settlements international banking statistics, we obtain evidence for both hypotheses. First, we find that direct exposures of a country’s own and the overall region’s banking sectors to crisis-affected countries are systematically related to bank capital outflows during the global financial crisis. Also, some of our empirical results indicate that an emerging economy’s financial vulnerability can be influenced by its region’s indirect exposures to crisis countries. Second, a further analysis suggests more favorable behavior of the same region lender toward emerging economies during crisis.
F38|Alternate instruments to manage the capital flow conundrum: A Study of selected Asian economies|Gross capital inflows and outflows to and from emerging market economies (EMEs) have witnessed a significant increase since early 2000s. This rapid increase in these flows accompanied by sharp rise in volatility has amplified the complexity of macroeconomic management in EMEs. While capital inflows provide additional financing for productive investment and offer avenues for risk diversification, unbridled flows could exacerbate financial and macroeconomic instability. In this paper, we focus on the experience of 6 large emerging Asian economies (EAEs) in dealing with capital flows. Using quarterly data, we identify the waves of capital flows experienced by these economies and the efficacy of the alternative policy measures taken by these economies in response to such flows. The policy measures encompass negotiating the trilemma, intervention in the foreign exchange market, and imposition of capital flow management measures. The efficacy of these responses have been varied across countries implying that a judicious mix of these measures, along with improvement in financial and institutional development is required to effectively counter the vagaries of capital flows.
F38|Do Local Currency Bond Markets Enhance Financial Stability?|It is widely believed that local currency bond markets (LCBMs) can promote financial stability in developing countries. For instance, they can help mitigate the currency and maturity mismatch that contributed to the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis of 1997–1998. In this paper, we empirically test such conventional wisdom on the stabilizing effect of LCBMs. To do so, we analyze and compare the financial vulnerability of developing countries during two episodes of financial stress—global financial crisis and taper tantrum. During the two episodes, we find a negative association between the growth of LCBMs and the degree of currency depreciation in emerging economies. Similar association is found of bank loans but not for the stock market.
F38|Optimal Capital Account Liberalization in China|China maintains tight controls over its capital account. Its prevailing regime also features financial repression, under which banks are often required to extend a fraction of funds to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) at below-market interest rates. We incorporate these features into a general equilibrium model. We find that capital account liberalization under financial repression incurs a tradeoff between aggregate productivity and intertemporal allocative efficiency. Along a transition path with a declining SOE share, the second-best policy calls for a rapid removal of financial repression, but gradual liberalization of the capital account.
F38|Trilemma, dilemma and global players|This paper investigates the debate between the Mundellian trilemma and the dilemma. Overall, the global financial cycle magnifies the binding effect of financial openness on monetary policy autonomy, and reduces the effectiveness of the floating exchange rate regime in isolating the domestic economy against financial pressures. I provide empirical evidence that the trilemma does not morph into a dilemma. Furthermore, the sensitivity to the global financial cycle depends more on the presence of global investors and global players than on the fluctuations of these financial forces.
F38|Alternate instruments to manage the capital flow conundrum: A study of selected Asian economies|Capital inflows to and outflows from emerging market economies (EME) have increased significantly since 2000. This rapid increase, accompanied by a sharp rise in volatility, has amplified the complexity of macroeconomic management in EME. While foreign capital provides additional financing for productive investment and offers avenues for risk diversification, unbridled flows exacerbate financial and macroeconomic instability. In this paper, we focus on the experience of six emerging Asian economies (EAE) in dealing with capital flows. Using quarterly data, we identify the waves of capital flows experienced by these EAE and the efficacy of the various policy measures taken. The policy choices include negotiating the trilemma (i.e. balancing the need for monetary policy autonomy, exchange rate flexibility and capital account openness), as per the demands of the macroeconomic situation. The paper also analyses the extent to which intervention in the foreign exchange market and imposition of short‐term capital flow management measures have aided countries to negotiate the trilemma. The efficacy of these responses have been varied across countries, implying that a judicious mix of these measures, along with improvement in financial and institutional development, is required to effectively counter the vagaries of capital flows.

F38|Monitoring Bank Failures in a Data-Rich Environment| This paper develops a monitoring and forecasting model for the aggregate monthly number of commercial bank failures in the U.S. We extract key sectoral predictors from the large set of macroeconomic variables proposed by McCracken and Ng (2016) and incorporate them in a hurdle negative binomial model to predict the number of monthly commercial bank failures. We uncover a strong and robust relationship between the predictor synthesizing housing industry variables and bank failures. This relationship suggests the existence of a link between developments in the housing sector and the vulnerability of commercial banks to non-performing loans increases and asset deterioration. We assess different specifications
F38|Monetary Policy in Sudden Stop-Prone Economies|In a model featuring sudden stops and pecuniary externalities, I show that the ability to use capital controls has radical implications for the conduct of monetary policy. Absent capital controls, following an inflation targeting regime is nearly optimal. However, if the central bank lacks commitment, it will follow a monetary policy that is excessively procyclical and not desirable from an ex ante welfare prospective: it increases overall indebtedness as well as the frequency of financial crisis and reduces social welfare relative to an inflation targeting regime. Access to capital controls can correct this monetary policy bias. With capital controls, relative to an inflation targeting regime, the time-consistent regime reduces both the frequency and magnitude of crises, and increases social welfare. This paper rationalizes the procyclicality of the monetary policy observed in many emerging market economies.
F38|Positive and Normative Implications of Liability Dollarization for Sudden Stops Models of Macroprudential Policy|"""Liability dollarization,'' namely intermediation of capital inflows in units of tradables into domestic loans in units of aggregate consumption, adds three important effects driven by real-exchange-rate fluctuations that alter standard models of Sudden Stops significantly: Changes on the debt repayment burden, on the price of new debt, and on a risk-taking incentive (i.e. a negative premium on domestic debt). Under perfect foresight, the first effect makes Sudden Stops milder and multiple equilibria harder to obtain. The three effects add an ``intermediation externality'' to the macroprudential externality of standard models, which is present even without credit constraints. Optimal policy under commitment can be decentralized equally by taxing domestic credit or capital inflows, and hence capital controls as a separate instrument are not justified. This optimal policy is time-inconsistent and follows a complex, non-linear schedule. Quantitatively, an optimized pair of constant taxes on domestic debt and capital inflows makes crises slightly less likely and yields a small welfare gain, but other pairs reduce welfare sharply. For high effective debt taxes, capital controls and domestic debt taxes are again equivalent, and for low ones welfare is higher with higher taxes on domestic debt than on capital inflows."
F38|Bank Loan Loss Provisions, Investor Protection and the Macroeconomy|This study investigates the non-discretionary determinants of bank loan loss provisions in Africa after controlling for macroeconomic fluctuation, financial development and investor protection. We find that non-performing loans, loan-to-asset ratio and loan growth are significant non-discretionary drivers of bank provisions in the African region. We observe that bank provision is a positive function of non-performing loans up to a threshold beyond which bank provisions will no longer increase as non-performing loans increases. Also, bank loan-to-asset ratio is a significant driver of bank provisions when African banks have higher loan-to-asset ratios. Also, larger banks in financially developed African countries have fewer loan loss provisions while increase in bank lending leads to fewer bank provisions in countries with strong investor protection. Finally, higher bank lending is associated with higher bank provisions during economic boom. The findings have implications.
F38|Modern financial repression in the euro area crisis: making high public debt sustainable?|The sharp rise in public debt-to-GDP ratios in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008 posed serious challenges for fiscal policy in the euro area countries and culminated for some member states in a sovereign debt crisis. This note examines the public policy responses to the euro area crisis through the lens of financial repression with a particular focus on how they contributed to easing government budget constraints. Financial repression is defined in this context as the government’s strategy – supported by monetary and financial policies – to gain privileged access to capital markets at preferential credit conditions and divert resources to the state with the aim to secure and, if necessary, enforce public debt sustainability. Following a narrative approach, this note finds that public debt management and resolution, European financial legislation, EMU crisis support and ECB monetary policy have significantly contributed to relieving sovereign liquidity and solvency stress and generated fiscal space through non-standard means. The respective authorities have in fact applied the tools of financial repression to restore stability after the euro area crisis.
F38|An FDI-driven approach to measuring the scale and economic impact of BEPS|This paper explores the link between foreign direct investment (FDI) and the BEPS (base erosion and profit shifting) practices of multinationals (MNEs). It puts the spotlight on the outsize role of offshore investment hubs as major players in global corporate investment, a role that is largely due to MNEs’ tax planning, although other factors contribute. The paper shows that tax avoidance practices enabled by FDI through offshore hubs are responsible for significant leakage of development financing resources. In policy terms, these findings call for enhanced cooperation and synergies between international tax and investment policymaking.
F38|Global Banking Network and Regional Financial Contagion|This paper investigates and tests the role of regional exposures in financial contagion from advanced to emerging market economies through the global banking network using data on cross-border bilateral bank claims and liability positions.

Secondly, it tests whether the same region lenders tend to reduce exposures to the emerging market borrowers less than do different region lenders during crises.

F38|Sraffa’s Silenced Revival of the Classical Economists and of Marx|The standpoint of the old classical economists as well as of Marx “has been submerged and forgotten since the advent of the ‘marginal’ method” – to borrow Sraffa’s own words. The neoclassical (or ‘marginal’) paradigm, in fact, triumphantly dominated over the twentieth century (and is still dominating even now). A serious step towards the rehabilitation of the paradigm of the old classical economists was made by Sraffa (1951) with his remarkable ‘Introduction’ to Ricardo’s Principles, his seminal 1960 book Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities (PCMC) followed a few years later, as a logical completion of his long-standing work. The paper here proposed argues that Sraffa’s 1960 contribution has so far been mainly interpreted and used as a highly powered tool for destroying the foundations of neoclassical theory from a logical point of view, with the confident belief that attacking the logical side of the theory would have been sufficient to bring about its definite dismissal, which, instead, did not happen. As a consequence of all this, the revival of the classical economists and of Marx – which is one of the most characterizing feature of Sraffa’s 1960 contribution – was automatically silenced and this very fact precluded Sraffa’s theoretical framework from being used in a constructive way as a real alternative ‘vision’ to that proposed by the neoclassical market-centered paradigm. The aim of the paper is to underscore the crucial importance of Sraffa’s revival referred to above, by emphasizing its usefulness in providing a genuine alternative perspective and a radically different representation of the economy, compared with that provided by neoclassical theory. An attempt will be made to show the main features of the Sraffian framework in providing such an alternative ‘vision’ which, it will be argued, is now much needed, not least for suggesting far more sensible alternative economic policies than those so far pursued in the ceaseless turmoil of present day world economies.
F38|Where does “dirty” money go? A gravity analysis|The applied literature on illicit (“dirty”) money flows looks at the gravity equation as a natural strategy to control for characteristics of both “source” and “destination” countries. Unfortunately, the existing empirical literature on dirty money flows lacks solid theoretical underpinnings. We contribute to this literature in several ways: i) we exploit the theory of portfolio investment flows to estimate robust parameters (by applying both LSDV PPML techniques) on financial flows on a global scale ii) we derive a global picture of anomalous (i.e. unpredicted) money flows over time; ii) we identify possible correlations between these anomalous flows and “dirty money” determinants. Our results show that theoretical based gravity models provide a more robust way to look at “dirty” money flows than their ad hoc counterparts and open the ground to key policy implications: i) instead of spending time and effort tracing the exact path of “dirty” money flows, a global map of anomalous financial activities can be built by exploiting official statistics; ii) rather than focusing only on “off-shore financial centers”, we could assess the attractiveness to dirty money flows of each destination to a given origin by exploiting bilateral flows and the characteristics of their dyadic relationship.
F38|International tax cooperation and sovereign debt crisis resolution: reforming global governance to ensure no one is left behind|The paper focuses on two crucial issues that hinder the fiscal sovereignty of developing countries: the reduced level of international tax cooperation, and the lack of appropriate procedures for sovereign debt crisis resolution. The low level of international tax cooperation enables a ‘race to the bottom’ in tax rates among countries, tax avoidance through profit-shifting activities by companies and tax evasion by individuals and companies, based on the existence of non-cooperative jurisdictions. In the last five years, the international community has made some improvements in this field, but the situation remains far from satisfactory. On the other hand, the current procedure for sovereign debt resolution, through negotiations at the Paris Club with the support of the IMF, is not only unfair, but also inefficient. The paper explores alternatives in both fields. Appropriate responses to these international problems would have to show benefits in terms of efficiency and welfare at the global level, and establish fundamentals for countries to take full advantage of their resources, which is a necessary condition for funding policies that will not leave (or push) any nation or social sector behind.
F38|Cheap Talk? Financial Sanctions and Non-Financial Activity|Sanctions restrict cross-border interactions and, therefore, not only put political and economic pressure on the target country, but they also adversely affect the sender country. This paper examines the effect of financial sanctions on the country imposing them. In particular, we analyze the business responses of German non-financial entities to the imposition of sanctions on 23 countries over the period from 1999 through 2014. Examining highly disaggregated, monthly data from the German balance of payments statistics, we find four main results. First, German financial activities with sanctioned countries are sizably reduced after the imposition of sanctions, with strong reductions in the scope of cross-border activities (i.e., the extensive margin) and less robust results for total financial flows which is consistent with the concept of ‘smart sanctions’. Second, firms doing business with sanctioned countries tend to be disproportionately large, making them largely immune to the reduction in business opportunities with selected partners. Third, firms affected by sanctions expand their activities with non-sanctioned countries, some of which display close trade ties to the sanctioned country. Fourth, we find no effect of sanctions on broader measures of firm performance such as employment or total sales. Overall, we conclude that the economic costs of financial sanctions to the sender country are limited.

F38|Effects of capital controls on foreign exchange liquidity|The literature on capital controls has focused on their use as tools to manage capital and improve macroeconomic and financial stability. However, there is a lack of analysis of their effect on foreign exchange (FX) market liquidity. In particular, technological and regulatory changes in FX markets over the past decade have had an influence on the effect of capital controls on alternative indicators of FX liquidity. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical model showing that, if capital controls are modelled as entry costs, then fewer investors will enter an economy. This will reduce the market's ability to accommodate large order flows without a significant change in the exchange rate (a market depth measure of liquidity). On the other hand, if capital controls are modelled as transaction costs, they can reduce the effective spread (a cost-based measure of liquidity). Using a panel of 20 emerging market economies and a novel measure of capital account restrictiveness, we provide empirical evidence showing that capital controls can reduce cost-based measures of FX market liquidity. The results imply that capital controls are effective in reducing the implicit cost component of FX market liquidity but can also have a negative structural effect on the FX market by making it more vulnerable to order flow imbalances.
F38|Foreign Banks and International Transmission of Monetary Policy: Evidence from the Syndicated Loan Market|This paper uses loan-level data from 124 countries over 1995â€“2015 to examine the transmission of monetary policy through the cross-border syndicated loan market. The results show that the expansion of monetary policy increases cross-border credit supply especially to weaker firms. However, greater foreign bank presence in the borrower country appears to reduce the potentially destabilizing impact of lower policy interest rates on cross-border lending, as it attenuates increases in loan volume and maturity while magnifying increases in collateralization and covenant use. The mitigating effect of foreign banking presence in the borrowing country on the transmission of monetary policy is robust to controlling for borrower-country economic and financial development, and a range of borrower and lender country policies and institutions, including the strength of bank regulation and supervision, exchange rate flexibility, and restrictions on capital flows. The findings qualify the characterization of international banks as sources of credit instability, and suggest that foreign bank entry can improve the stability of cross-border credit in the face of international monetary policy shocks.
F38|Tax Havens, Accounting Experts, and Fee-Setting Rules|Tax havens differ in the specific tax planning arrangements multinational firms can use to reduce their tax liabilities. Given the complexity and cost associated with identifying the most effective tax haven to use, an accounting firm can act as an intermediary between tax havens and multinational corporations. We analyze a model with horizontally differentiated multinationals and tax havens to study the role accounting firm intermediation has on tax haven prices, multinational tax planning choices, accounting firm profits, and tax revenues. In equilibrium, uniform accounting firm fees generate higher accounting firm profit, less tax avoidance, and higher tax revenues than either full price discrimination or haven-specific fees.
F38|Fiscal unions redux|Abstract Before the advent of sophisticated international financial markets, a widely accepted belief was that within a monetary union, a union-wide authority orchestrating fiscal transfers between countries is necessary to provide adequate insurance against country-specific economic fluctuations. A natural question is then: Do sophisticated international financial markets obviate the need for such an active union-wide authority? We argue that they do. Specifically, we show that in a benchmark economy with no international financial markets, an activist union-wide authority is necessary to achieve desirable outcomes. With sophisticated international financial markets, however, such an authority is unnecessary if its only goal is to provide cross-country insurance. Since restricting the set of policy instruments available to member countries does not create a fiscal externality across them, this result holds in a wide variety of settings. Finally, we establish that an activist union-wide authority concerned just with providing insurance to member countries is optimal only when individual countries are either unable or unwilling to pursue desirable policies.
F38|Israel’s Triumph over Inflation: The Long and Winding Road|The paper gives an economic-history perspective of the long struggle with inflation. It covers the early acceleration to three-digit levels, lasting 8 years; The stabilization program, based on political backing triggered sharp fall in inflationary expectation, and consequently to sharp inflation reduction to two-digit levels; The convergence to the advanced countries’ levels during the “great Moderation”; and Israel’s resistance to the deflation-depression forces that the 2008 crisis created. The emphasis is on the forces of globalization and the building of institutions, political, regulatory, financial, budget design, and monetary, which helped stabilize prices and output.
F38|Foreign banks and international transmission of monetary policy : evidence from the syndicated loan market|This paper uses loan-level data from 124 countries over 1995?2015 to examine the transmission of monetary policy through the cross-border syndicated loan market. The results show that the expansion of monetary policy increases cross-border credit supply especially to weaker firms. However, greater foreign bank presence in the borrower country appears to reduce the potentially destabilizing impact of lower policy interest rates on cross-border lending, as it attenuates increases in loan volume and maturity while magnifying increases in collateralization and covenant use. The mitigating effect of foreign banking presence in the borrowing country on the transmission of monetary policy is robust to controlling for borrower-country economic and financial development, and a range of borrower and lender country policies and institutions, including the strength of bank regulation and supervision, exchange rate flexibility, and restrictions on capital flows. The findings qualify the characterization of international banks as sources of credit instability, and suggest that foreign bank entry can improve the stability of cross-border credit in the face of international monetary policy shocks.
F38|Global Banking: Recent Developments and Insights from Research|Following recent crises, cross-border capital flows have declined considerably, and many advanced countries’ banks are retrenching. At the same time, banks from emerging and developing countries continue to expand abroad, and banking has become more regional. Research highlights that long-term debt flows are less volatile and that foreign banks with larger presence, more domestic funding, and closer relationships provide more finance and share risks better. While ongoing changes in global banking influence its overall benefits, the crises also revealed the need for a consistent framework for supervising and resolving globally active banks, with the European Banking Union an important model.
F38|Precaution Versus Mercantilism: Reserve Accumulation, Capital Controls, and the Real Exchange Rate|We document a new international stylized fact describing the relationship between real exchange rates and external asset holdings. Economists have long argued that the real exchange rate is associated with the net international investment position, appreciating as external wealth increases. This mechanism has been seen as central for international payments equilibrium and relative price adjustments. However, we argue that the effect of external assets held by the public sector—reserve accumulation—on real exchange rates may be quite different from that of privately held external assets, and that capital controls are a critical factor behind this difference. For 1975–2007, controlling for GDP per capita and the terms of trade, we find that a one percentage point increase in external assets relative to GDP (net of reserves) is related to an 0.24 percent real exchange rate appreciation. On the contrary, a one percentage point increase in reserve accumulation relative to GDP has virtually no effect on the real exchange rate in financially open countries (low capital controls), and is related to a 1.65 percent real exchange rate depreciation in financially closed countries (high capital controls). Results are stronger in developing countries and in more recent periods. Gross rather than net positions matter and we present a new theoretical model to account for the stylized fact. The framework encompasses so-called precautionary and mercantilist motives for reserve accumulation, and also explains how the optimal capital account policy—the mix of reserve accumulation and capital controls—is determined. Further empirical support arises from evidence that reserve accumulation is associated with a trade surplus, along with higher GDP and TFP growth in countries with high capital controls, findings that are consistent with the mechanisms of our model.
F38|Tax evasion in new disguise? Examining tax havens' international bank deposits|Recent efforts to reduce international tax evasion focus on information exchange with tax havens. Using bilateral bank data for 1397 countrypairs in a balanced quarterly panel from 2003:I to 2017:IV, we first show that information-on-request treaties with tax havens reduce bank deposits in tax havens by 27.5%. Second, also deposits from tax havens in high tax countries decline after such treaties are signed, giving authorities a second angle to detect tax evasion. Both reactions dissipate overt time and treaties signed after 2010 trigger no further reactions. These results cannot be explained by deposit shifting alone and we find no evidence of transitioning into legality. Third, recent policy initiatives based on the automatic exchange of bank information lead to very similar initial reactions as earlier treaties, consistent with adjustments on the part of tax evaders. This suggests that tax evaders adapt to established information exchange treaties by using new disguises to hide their true income, and react again to new measures. These results cast doubt on the effectiveness of current forms of information exchange to tackle international tax evasion.
F38|Exchange rate undervaluation and R&D activity|We examine how real exchange rate undervaluation policy affects research and development (R&D) activity. Using a panel data set comprising 49 developed and developing countries covering 1996–2011, we show that undervaluing the exchange rate retards technological innovation. Such a negative impact is particularly prominent for developed countries. This paper provides new insights into the real effects of undervaluation policy on the economy. An implication of our work is that countries implementing exchange rate undervaluation policy should be mindful of its potential negative effects on research and development activity.
F38|Curbing the growth of stock trading? Order-to-trade ratios and financial transaction taxes|The growth of financial markets provokes regular debate, particularly in Europe, and in the aftermath of the global crisis a number of reforms have been proposed. In particular, two regulatory measures have been put forward: order-to-trade ratios and transaction taxes. This paper aims to quantify the impact of such initiatives. To do so, I consider market liquidity and volatility in the Italian Stock Exchange (Borsa Italiana) over the 2011–2013 period, which provides a unique opportunity for empirical assessment: first, a penalty for high order-to-trade ratios (OTR) was implemented in April 2012; second, a transaction tax on securities (STT) was introduced in March 2013 on Italian large and mid-caps; third, this tax was extended to derivatives in September 2013 (FTT). I identify causality via a difference-in-difference approach (with German firms and Italian small caps, when appropriate, as control groups) and a regression discontinuity design. I find that neither the OTR nor the STT/FTT had a meaningful impact on market liquidity or volatility. There was however a substantial drop in OTC trading.
F38|Domestic and External Sovereign Debt|Why do countries tend to repay their domestic and external debt, even though the legal enforcement of the sovereign debt contract is limited? Contrary to conventional wisdom, we argue that temporary market exclusion after default is costly. When the domestic financial market is characterized by a scarcity of private saving instruments, a government can partition its debt market into domestic and external segments, by restricting capital flows, to exploit its market power. The government's market power mitigates the problem of limited commitment, by making default a more costly option. Consequently, it extends the government's external debt capacity. We replicate the domestic and external sovereign debt for non-advanced economies, by unveiling their link to financial repression.
F38|The End of the Bretton Woods International Monetary System|This paper examines two episodes of international economic policy coordination: the efforts to modify the Bretton Woods international monetary system in the 1960s and early 1970s and to reform the system after the closing of the US official gold window on August 15, 1971. The paper examines the diagnoses of the problem in each episode, the treatments applied, and the results in the short run and longer run. In the short run, both episodes were failures. The international monetary system that emerged in the mid-1970s, while less systemic than some would like, has nevertheless stood the test of time, although proposals for its reform continue to be discussed.
F38|Bitcoin Reveals Exchange Rate Manipulation and Detects Capital Controls|Many countries manipulate the value of their currency or use some form of capital control, yet the data usually used to detect these manipulations are low frequency, expensive, lagged, and potentially mismeasured. I demonstrate that the price data of the internationally traded cryptocurrency Bitcoin can approximate unocial exchange rates which, in turn, can be used to detect both the existence and the magnitude of the distortion caused by capital controls and exchange rate manipulations. However, I document that bitcoin exchange rates contain problematic bitcoin-market-speci c elements and must be adjusted before being used for this purpose. As bitcoin exchange rates exist at a daily frequency, they reveal transitory interventions that would otherwise go undetected. This result also serves as veri cation that Bitcoin is used to circumvent capital controls and manipulated exchange rates.
F38|Capital Control, Exchange Rate Regime, and Monetary Policy: Indeterminacy and Bifurcation|Will capital controls enhance macro economy stability? How will the results be influenced by the exchange rate regime and monetary policy reaction? Are the consequences of policy decisions involving capital controls easily predictable, or more complicated than may have been anticipated? We will answer the above questions by investigating the macroeconomic dynamics of a small open economy. In recent years, these matters have become particularly important to emerging market economies, which have often adopted capital controls. We especially investigate two dynamical characteristics: indeterminacy and bifurcation. Four cases are explored, based on different exchange rate regimes and monetary policy rules. With capital controls in place, we find that indeterminacy depends upon how inflation and output gap coordinate with each other in their feedback to interest rate setting in the Taylor rule. When forward-looking, both passive and positive monetary policy feedback can lead to indeterminacy. Compared with flexible exchange rates, fixed exchange rate regimes produce more complex indeterminacy conditions, depending upon the stickiness of prices and the elasticity of substitution between labor and consumption. We find Hopf bifurcation under capital control with fixed exchange rates and current-looking monetary policy. To determine empirical relevance, we test indeterminacy empirically using Bayesian estimation. Fixed exchange rate regimes with capital controls produce larger posterior probability of the indeterminate region than a flexible exchange rate regime. Fixed exchange rate regimes with current-looking monetary policy lead to several kinds of bifurcation under capital controls. We provide monetary policy suggestions on achieving macroeconomic stability through financial regulation.
F38|Capital Controls, Macroprudential Regulation,and the Bank Balance Sheet Channel|We incorporate a banking sector with balance sheet frictions into a model of a small open economy and compare the effectiveness of capital controls and macroprudential regulation. We show that the welfare-improving effect of capital controls is larger than that of macroprudential regulation if the degree of financial friction between domestic banks and foreign investors is high, while the welfare-improving effect of macroprudential regulation is larger than that of capital controls if the degree of financial friction is low. We also show that the welfare ranking of the two policies depends on whether an economy suffers from liability dollarization.
F38|The Role Of Capital Controls In Mediating Global Shocks|This paper studies the role of capital controls in the transmission of global commodity price shocks in explaining the variation of domestic business cycles in 89 countries for the period 1995â€“2013. The results suggest that countries that are relatively open or closed have lower variance in output, consumption and investments explained by global shocks than those countries that have partially liberalised capital markets. On the contrary, relatively closed and open economies have a much higher share of the trade balance to output ratio volatility explained than partially liberalised countries. This pattern is independent of the level of economic development or geographical region. The results show that a partial liberalisation of the capital account might make countries more vulnerable to world shocks, than opening and closing the capital account completely.
F38|Macro-economic Management in an Electronic Credit/Financial System|Modern technology provides the basis of an efficient low-cost electronic payments as an alternative to the current system where fiat money is the medium of exchange. This paper explores possible macro-economic implication, showing how such a financial system might enhance government’s ability to control the level of aggregate demand. As in other arenas, in second-best situations with uncertainty, systems where there is an attempt to directly control quantities directly may perform better (e.g. have less volatility) than those using prices and other indirect control mechanisms. The paper identifies conditions under which in a system of electronic money, macroeconomic variability is lower when the level and direction of credit creation is directly controlled, through appropriately designed credit auctions, than in a system of indirect control of, say, investment via the interest rate. This is especially important since much macro-economic instability is associated with instability in credit creation and in the fraction allocated to newly produced goods and services. The paper also explains how, in an open economy, in a system of electronic money, credit auctions combined with trade chits might enable the control of net exports, again enhancing macro-stability. Finally, we explain how under a system of electronic money, the rents that are currently associated with credit creation and that arise from bank franchises—that constitute a form of appropriation of the returns from trust in the government and its ability and willingness to bail-out banks in the event of a crisis or bank run—could be appropriated by the government to a greater degree than at present.
F38|On the global financial market integration “swoosh” and the trilemma|We propose a measure of financial market integration based on a factor model of equity returns computed back to the first era of financial globalization for 17 countries. Global financial integration follows a “swoosh” shape – high pre-1913, higher post-1990, low in the interwar period – rather than other shapes hypothesized in earlier literature. We find no evidence of financial globalization reversing since the Great Recession, as claimed in other recent studies. We use our measure to revisit the debate on whether the classic monetary policy trilemma has recently morphed into a dilemma and find no evidence for such change.
F38|Financial Markets and Fiscal Unions|Do sophisticated international financial markets obviate the need for an active union-wide authority to orchestrate fiscal transfers between countries to provide adequate insurance against country-specific economic fluctuations? We argue that they do. Specifically, we show that in a benchmark economy with no international financial markets, an activist union-wide authority is necessary to achieve desirable outcomes. With sophisticated financial markets, however, such an authority is unnecessary if its only goal is to provide cross-country insurance. Since restricting the set of policy instruments available to member countries does not create a fiscal externality across them, this result holds in a wide variety of settings. Finally, we establish that an activist union-wide authority concerned just with providing insurance across member countries is optimal only when individual countries are either unable or unwilling to pursue desirable policies.

F38|The Rise, the Fall, and the Resurrection of Iceland|This paper documents how the Icelandic banking system grew from 100 percent of GDP in 1998 to 9 times GDP in 2008 when it failed. We base the analysis on data from the banks that was made public when the Icelandic parliament lifted among others bank secrecy laws to investigate the run up to the financial crisis. We document how the banks were funded, and where the money went with a comprehensive analysis of their lending. We also analyze policies implemented after the crash, including emergency legislation, capital control, alleviation of balance of payment risks and preservation of the financial stability. We estimate the output costs of the crisis, which was about average relative to the 147 banking crisis documented Laeven and Valencia (2012) and the 100 banking crisis documented by Reinhart and Rogoff (2014). Our computation of the governments direct costs, reveals that the recently concluded negotiation with foreign creditors may leave the Icelandic government in net surplus as a consequence of the crisis, although there is still some uncertainty about the ultimate cost and our benchmark estimate is a cost corresponding to 5 percent of GDP. We summarize several lessons from the episode.
F38|Financial Spillovers and Macroprudential Policies|We estimate the impact of the extensity of macroprudential policies on the correlation of the policy interest rates between the center economies (CEs, i.e., the U.S., Japan, and the Euro area), and the peripheral economies (PHs). We find a more extensive implementation of macroprudential policies would lead PHs to (re)gain monetary independence from the CEs when the CEs implement expansionary monetary policy; when PHs run current account deficit; when they hold lower levels of international reserves; when their financial markets are relatively closed; when they are experiencing an increase in net portfolio flows; and when they are experiencing credit expansion.
F38|Regulating capital flows to emerging markets: An externality view|We show that capital flows to emerging market economies create externalities that differ by an order of magnitude depending on the state-contingent payoff profile of the flows. Those with pro-cyclical payoffs, such as foreign currency debt, generate substantial negative pecuniary externalities because they lead to large repayments and contractionary exchange rate depreciations during financial crises. Conversely, capital flows with an insurance component, such as FDI or equity, are largely benign. We construct an externality pricing kernel and use sufficient statistics and DSGE model simulations to quantify the externalities that materialized during past financial crises. We find stark differences depending on the payoff profile, justifying taxes of up to 3% for dollar debt but close to zero for FDI. These findings contrast with the existing literature, which has suggested that policymakers should focus on reducing over-borrowing rather than changing the composition of external liabilities.
F38|Have currency-based capital flow management measures curbed international banking flows?|This paper analyses the impact of a specific type of banking regulation on operations in foreign currency, defined as currency-based capital flow management measures (CB-CFMs), on cross-border banking flows in a sample of 18 countries over the period 2005 to 2013. The results show that the introduction and tightening of these measures in the post-crisis period contributed to a reduction of the external debt of banks, controlling for capital flow management measures, domestic macro-prudential regulation, and a large set of push and pull factors. The examination of external debt by maturity and instruments suggests that these measures are more effective in curbing short-term debt and interbank borrowing, which are also the components that contracted more sharply in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis. Further analysis could look at the benefits these measures bring in terms of financial stability, and evaluate the costs of capital account openness against the risks that CB-CFMs aim to address.
F38|Bank de-risking impacts on finance and development. The case of Romania|The study aims to investigate the causes, external manifestations and impacts of de-risking phenomenon, increasingly rendered visible in the last years on international financial markets, under the circumstances of the post-crisis global economic developments. The paper reveals that this phenomenon is still little discussed and understood by academics and institutional organizations, consequently, being ignored any theoretical foundation or arguments for the possible guidance, between one or other direction, of policies, norms and regulatory practices in order to monitor and address the slippages with adverse effects. In the paper, the stage of actual knowledge of this phenomenon, as concerns the different forms in which comes out, the main causes and factors of influence, the adverse impact observed and possible counteracting measures is presented. The analysis of the extent to which Romania is affected by de-risking, more visible by reducting the number of clients and financial transactions, halving the non-performing loans of the banking system, having also an important social dimension, in the light of the low level of financial inclusion. The paper presents some reference points for decoding this phenomenon, proposing new directions for more in-depth scientific researches, focusing on the identification of specific solutions based on customized analysis, including for Romania’s case, considering the trade-off options, such as stability versus prudentiality in risk taking and risk management, profitability versus social responsibility under uncertainty conditions, banking system interests versus interests of regulatory and supervisory institutions, monetary policies versus government policy and strategies.

F38|The Impact of Various Economic Factors in accessing Finance within the Business Sector: Cases from UK Financial Services Companies|This paper investigates the impact of various economic factors such as inflation, interest rate, financial crises, and government regulations on the access to finance in the business sector specifically considering the financial experts' perspective operating in the UK financial services companies. The study examines the relationship between variables of interest in post recession period. Total five out of top fifty British Financial Services' Companies were selected through convenience sampling. Additionally, 38 respondents were selected through purposive sampling, based on their knowledge, level of management, and experiences in the sector. The findings showed that interest rate, government regulations, and financial crises have significant relationship in accessing financial resource. Interestingly, 83% remain neutral about the relationship between inflation and raising funds.
F38|Corruption, political stability and illicit financial outflows in Sub-Saharan Africa|This paper examines the effect of corruption control and political stability on illicit financial outflows in Sub-Saharan Africa. We use a balanced panel data from the World Bank, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and Global Financial Integrity on Sub-Saharan African countries covering the period 2005-2014. Our regression estimates reveal that a unit increase in political stability and corruption control reduce illicit financial outflow due to misinvoicing in merchandise trade by an average of US$ 20.5 million and US$ 44.3 million respectively. The results also show that high trade rating, financial sector rating and exchange rates reduce illicit financial outflows while an increase in foreign direct investment and inflation increase illicit financial outflow. We recommend that governments in Sub-Saharan Africa countries must ensure that institutions responsible for fighting corruption and enhancing stable governance are well empowered and given the needed resources to work effectively to reduce corruption to the barest minimum.
F38|Capital controls and foreign currency denomination|This paper studies the effectiveness of capital controls with foreign currency denomination and its welfare implications. To do this, we develop a general equilibrium model with financial frictions and banking, in which assets and liabilities are denominated in both domestic and foreign currencies. We propose a non-pecuniary capital-control policy that limits the gap between foreign-currency denominated loans and deposits to the amount of foreign funds that bankers can borrow from the international credit market. We show that capital controls have a critical impact on the dynamics of assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currency. This critical impact works through the capital control constraint on quantitative nancial variables directly, not through the spreads. The non-pecuniary capital controls help to stabilize the nancial sector and, hence, reduces the negative spillovers to the real economy. A more restrictive capital-control policy signicantly attenuates the welfare effect of the foreign monetary policy and exchange rate shocks.
F38|A Contagion through Exposure to Foreign Banks during the Global Financial Crisis|Although the global financial crisis of 2008 took root in the advanced countries, its shocks spread through the emerging economies, reflecting the increasingly interconnected global financial system. This paper develops an empirical methodology to test the contagion effect at the country level using bilateral data on bank claims between countries. It measures the direct and indirect exposures of emerging economies to crisis countries and tests whether these matter for capital outflows from emerging economies. The paper measures these exposures to the crisis-affected countries by using bilateral foreign claims sourced from Bank for International Settlements (i) consolidated banking statistics foreign claims on immediate counterparty and ultimate risk bases and (ii) locational banking statistics cross-border total claims. Findings show that emerging market economies more exposed directly or indirectly to banks in the crisis-affected countries suffered more capital outflows during the global financial crisis.
F38|National Tax Regulation, International Standards and the GATS: Argentina—Financial Services|Can a WTO Member discriminate against foreign suppliers of services located in jurisdictions that refuse to share information with a government to permit it to determine if its nationals engage in tax evasion? Does it matter if the Member uses standards developed by an international body as the criterion for deciding whether to impose measures? In Argentina—Financial Services the WTO Appellate Body held that services from jurisdictions that share financial tax information may be different from services provided by jurisdictions that do not cooperate in supplying such information. It overruled a Panel finding that measures to increase taxes on financial transactions with non-cooperative jurisdictions were discriminatory. We argue that the AB reached the right conclusion but that an important opportunity was missed to clarify what WTO Members are permitted to do to enforce their domestic regulatory regimes, and how international standards could have a bearing on this question. By giving consideration to arguments that the likeness of services and service suppliers may be a function of prevailing domestic regulatory regimes, the AB increased the scope for confusion and future litigation.
F38|Capital Controls and Foreign Currency Denomination|This paper studies the effectiveness of capital controls with foreign currency denomination on business cycle fluctuations and the implications for welfare. To do this, we develop a general equilibrium model with financial frictions and banking, in which assets and liabilities are denominated in both domestic and foreign currencies. We propose a non-pecuniary, capital-control policy that limits the gap between foreign-currency denominated loans and deposits to the amount of foreign funds that bankers can borrow from the international credit market. We show that capital controls have a significant impact on the dynamics of assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currency. The non-pecuniary capital controls help to stabilize the financial sector, thereby reducing the negative spillovers to the real economy. A more restrictive capital-control policy significantly weakens the welfare effect of the foreign monetary policy and exchange rate shocks.
F38|Global Shocks and Risk to Financial Stability in Asia| Asian emerging market economies have recovered relatively well from the Great Recession of 2008-09. Emerging Asia has been quite successful in maintaining both macroeconomic and financial stability in a turbulent global environment. Policy frameworks and governance structures have been adapted based on lessons learned from the Asian Financial Crisis. In general, policy makers have not been shy to adopt an eclectic approach to achieving monetary and financial stability using more than a single policy instrument to reach their objectives. Interventions in the foreign exchange markets are used in many jurisdictions to limit currency volatility while short-term interest rates are aimed at attaining macroeconomic stability, interpreted mainly but not exclusively, as price stability, and macroprudential policies have been employed in attempts to reduce the risk of financial stability. The use of multiple instruments to reach multiple goals is not without risk, however. At a minimum, it requires coordination among the entities that are responsible for each instrument, which in turn necessitates proper governance both within the central bank and between the central bank and other agencies that may be involved. Including a wider set of objectives than price stability in the tasks assigned to central banks also raises questions about the ability of the central bank to reach these objectives while avoiding the pitfalls associated with trying to do so.
F38|Macroprudential policy and foreign interest rate shocks: A comparison of different instruments and regulatory regimes|This paper presents a generic small open economy real business cycle model with banking and foreign borrowing. We incorporate capital requirements, reserve requirements, and loan-to-value (LTV) regulation into this framework, and subject the model to a positive foreign interest rate shock that raises the country risk premium and reduces the supply of foreign funds. The results show that these macroprudential instruments can attenuate the impact of such a shock, and that this attenuation property increases with the strictness of the regulatory regime. Capital requirements and LTV regulation deliver the largest attenuation benefits and are shown to be close substitutes. That being said, capital requirements are shown to be more effective at leaning against the financial cycle whereas LTV regulation is more effective at stimulating the financial cycle. The analysis indicates that capital and reserve requirements can interact such that reserve requirements are most effective when used to supplement existing capital requirement or LTV measures. We find that financial and macroeconomic stability objectives are aligned following a positive foreign interest rate shock such that a macroprudential response to such shocks can be to the benefit of both objectives. Lastly, our results show that capital requirements and LTV regulation exhibit decreasing returns to scale.
F38|Strategic Responses to International Tax Competition: Fiscal (De) Centralization versus Partial Tax Harmonization| This paper analyzes a countryâ€™s optimal fiscal strategy among centralization, decentralization, and partial tax harmonization. Countries are asymmetric in productivity levels and characterized by multi-level government such that there is both horizontal and vertical tax competition. The main result from the analysis is that partial tax harmonization is more difficult to achieve in fiscally decentralized economies with high levels of productivity and low labor taxation. This result is confirmed by recent data from the OECD and explains the observed difficulties in achieving capital tax harmonization in the European Union. JEL Classification Numbers: F15, F38, H20, H87 Key Words: Centralization; Decentralization; Fiscal Competition; Partial Tax Harmonization.
F38|International Coordination of Macroprudential Policies with Capital Flows and Financial Asymmetries|We consider a two-country macro model in which countries have limited ability to issue state-contingent contracts in international markets. Both countries have incentives to stabilize their economy by using macroprudential policy (limiting leverage or capital inflows), but the emerging economy depends on the advanced economy to bear global risk. Lack of coordination hurts developing economies but benefits advanced economies. Financially developed economies are unwilling to intermediate global risk, which means bearing systemic risk, preferring financial stability over credit flows. Advanced economies prefer tighter macroprudential policies than would occur with coordination, giving them greater bargaining power when negotiating international agreements.
F38|Corruption, political stability and illicit financial outflows in Sub-Saharan Africa|This paper examines the effect of corruption control and political stability on illicit financial outflows in Sub-Saharan Africa. We use a balanced panel data from the World Bank, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and Global Financial Integrity on Sub-Saharan African countries covering the period 2005-2014. Our regression estimates reveal that a unit increase in political stability and corruption control reduce illicit financial outflow due to misinvoicing in merchandise trade by an average of US$ 20.5 million and US$ 44.3 million respectively. The results also show that high trade rating, financial sector rating and exchange rates reduce illicit financial outflows while an increase in foreign direct investment and inflation increase illicit financial outflow. We recommend that governments in Sub-Saharan Africa countries must ensure that institutions responsible for fighting corruption and enhancing stable governance are well empowered and given the needed resources to work effectively to reduce corruption to the barest minimum.
F38|Dirty money coming home: Capital flows into and out of tax havens|We use recently released bilateral locational banking statistics of the BIS to show the full circle of international tax evasion via tax havens. White-washed money from tax havens is withdrawn from banks in non-havens if an information treaty is signed. This complements the stylized fact of such a reaction on outbound flows into tax havens. We find different time lags and other plausible structures in these reactions and a puzzling decline of the effect of treaties on capital flows over time.
F38|Cross-border transmission of emergency liquidity|We show that emergency liquidity provision by the Federal Reserve transmitted to non-U.S. banking markets. Based on manually collected holding company structures of international banks, we can identify banks in Germany with access to U.S. facilities via internal capital markets. Using proprietary interest rate data reported to the German central bank, we compare lending and borrowing rates of banks with and without such access. U.S. liquidity shocks cause a significant decrease in the short-term funding costs of German banks with access. Short-term loan rates charged to German corporates also decline, albeit with lags between two and four months. These spillover effects of U.S. monetary policy are confined to short-term rates.
F38|Vietnam’s Banking Sector Development over Three Decades of Economic Renovation: Achievements, Challenges, and Policy Solutions|Over the three decades of economic renovation, Vietnam banking sector has been reformed in market-oriented directions and in compliance with international financial standards. The context of deeper financial integration requires a more efficient, resilient and competitive banking sector in the country. For this purposes, in the years to come, the following regulatory measures should be taken into consideration: (1) strengthening the autonomy and capability for the SBV; (2) continuing process of financial restructuring and liberalization to further improve the competitive market behavior; (3) promoting prudent risk management and supervision; (4) cooperating proactively, actively with other countries to cope with common financial risks at regional level; and (5) building a more concrete framework and appropriate roadmap to improve the convertibility of the national currency (Vietnam Dong).
F38|Optimal policy rules at home, crisis and quantitative easing abroad|This paper examines the international transmission of financial shocks which originate in, and are partially offset by, quantitative easing in a large financially-stressed country. Using a two-country model, we evaluate the adjustment in the non-stressed home country, following recurring negative shocks to productivity and banking-sector balance-sheet/terminal wealth ratios. We first examine the application of QE policies in the stressed foreign country. Coupling quantitative easing with crisis events abroad magnifies the financial instability transmitted to the rest of the world. Our results show that the non-stressed home country can make effective use of tax-rate rules for consumption, or taxes to stabilize financial-sector net worth in times of prolonged crisis abroad.
F38|Export Tax and Tariff Evasion: Evidence of Misinvoicing in China-New Zealand Trade|The trade between New Zealand and China has grown rapidly after the signing of their free trade agreement, but it is difficult to gauge the exact growth in trade due to gross inconsistencies in the trade data provided by the two countries. We investigate the roles that tax and tariff evasion play in systematically explaining this discrepancy. We find that exports and imports are heavily underreported at the Chinese border to avoid having to pay China's value-added tax and import tariffs. We also find some evidence of underreporting of imports at the New Zealand border to avoid import tariffs.
F38|International financial flows in the new normal: Key patterns (and why we should care)|"This paper documents recent trends in international financial flows, based on a newly assembled dataset covering 40 advanced and emerging countries. It highlights four stylized facts: first, the ""Great Retrenchment"" that took place during the crisis has proved very persistent; second, this fall can predominantly be related to advanced economies, especially in Western Europe; third, net flows have fallen substantially relative to the years preceding the crisis; and fourth, profound changes have occurred in the composition of international financial flows in ways which should help to strengthen resilience and deliver genuine cross-border risk-sharing. This paper then turns to possible explanations for and likely implications of these changes, with regard to international financial stability issues."
F38|La intervención cambiaria y los flujos de capital: evidencia empírica para Brasil, Colombia, Chile y México, 2001-2013|Este artículo investiga las inconsistencias de los supuestos en los que se basa el nuevo consenso macroeconómico, y posteriormente plantea un marco teórico alternativo para comprender el funcionamiento de la intervención cambiaria y del efecto de compensación de los flujos de capital en las economías emergentes de América Latina. Con base en la evidencia empírica para Brasil,Colombia, Chile y México, en el periodo 2001-IV a 2013-III, se infiere que la intervención esterilizada en el mercado de cambios ha cumplido su propósito de estabilizar el tipo de cambio nominal, pero con tres graves consecuencias: pérdida de competitividad, alto endeudamiento público y lento crecimiento económico.******This article examines inconsistencies in the assumptions on which the new macroeconomic consensus is based, before going on to propose an alternative theoretical framework for understanding how exchange rate interventions work, and the compensatory effect of capital flows in the emerging markets of Latin America. Basing its analysis on data from Brazil, Colombia, Chile and Mexico for the period between 2001-4 and 2013-3, it is inferred that sterilizedintervention in the foreign exchange markets has been successful in stabilizing the nominal exchange rate, but with three serious consequences: loss of competitiveness, high levels of public indebtedness and slow economic growth.
F38|Chinese ODI and the Need to Reform Australiaâ€™s Foreign Investment Regime|Foreign direct investment (FDI) plays an important role in the Australian economy through the provision of capital additional to that which can be mobilised domestically, new know-how and technology, and greater linkages to international markets and value chains. Its benefits derive from the increased competition for, and thus the increased value of, assets in Australia, the increased increment of incomes to Australian labour and other inputs used in additional production, increased national product, and increased taxes and other charges that accrue to governments at all levels. By creating a global market for Australian assets, FDI provides Australians with a stronger incentive to invest and grow their own assets. Australia has long had a strong policy consensus around the importance of continuing to attract high levels of foreign investment. This is because Australia is a small economy with a low savings base, and foreign capital is essential to fund the investment necessary to support Australiaâ€™s advanced patterns of growth, income and consumption. FDI also has a number of potential advantages over foreign â€˜portfolioâ€™ investment (involving equity stakes below 10 per cent) : it has the capacity to generate significant productivity dividends through the transfer of foreign management, technology and knowledge; it encourages local reinvestment of foreign earnings; it endows foreign investors with a long-term stake in the Australian economy; and it increases the competitiveness, efficiency and valuations of Australian enterprises.
F38|Suggestions to Improve Australiaâ€™s Foreign Investment Review Framework : Submission to the Inquiry by the Senate Economics References Committee|Australiaâ€™s economic development since the time of European settlement has been predicated on capital investment from overseas. A relatively small, young population inhabiting a vast continent rich in resources and opportunity would not have prospered without external capital to build mines, factories, ports, roads and infrastructure. Direct investment also brings new technology, access to new markets, and new ways of doing business. Policies that prevent foreign investors bidding for Australian assets also prevent Australians from realising the full international value of their assets.

F38|Dealing with large and volatile capital flows and the role of the IMF|The last decade has been characterised by the pronounced volatility of capital flows. While cross-border capital flows can have many benefits for both advanced and emerging market economies, they may also carry risks, which require appropriate policy responses. Disentangling the push from the pull factors driving capital flows is key to designing appropriate policies to deal with them. Strong institutions, sound fundamentals and a large domestic investor base tend to shield economies from adverse global conditions and attract less volatile types of capital. However, when the policy space for using traditional macroeconomic policies is limited, countries may also turn to macroprudential and capital flow management policies in a pragmatic manner. The IMF can play an important role in helping countries to deal with capital flows, through its surveillance and lending policy and through international cooperation.

F38|The Effect of International Financial Reporting Standars on the Real Earnings Management and Internal Control Structure as a Moderating Variable|Earnings management has become a widely known phenomenon towards managing reported earning in order to fulfill targets. Scott (1997) defines earnings management as a management choice upon accounting policy, or a real activity that affects earnings as such that multiple objectives of the specific earnings reporting can be obtained. The perspective of financial statement contends that a manager uses earnings management to match financial analyst’s forecast with the objective of avoiding perception and negative reaction, which in turn brings impact on stock price. This study aimed to examine the effect of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)-based accounting standard on the real earnings management (REM) moderated by internal control structure. Samples for the study were manufacture companies listed in the Indonesian Stock Exchange 2010-2014. The study found that adoption of the IFRS-based accounting standard had a positive effect on the REM and good corporate governance proxied by internal control structure weaken the positive effect of the IFRS-based accounting standard adoption on the REM.
F38|Economic Evaluation of Nigerian Marginal Oil and Gas Field using Financial Simulation Analysis|Marginal oil and gas field could contribute immensely to wealth creation, employment generation and confidence in local oil firms if properly exploited by the indigenous firms. Despite the laudable marginal field initiative by the government, indigenous players still face challenges in exploiting these fields in Nigeria. This study evaluates the fiscal regime and the economic factors that could be hindering oil field development among the indigenous oil firms. The result of the financial cash flow modelling found that the marginal oil field’s project is viable with post-tax net present value (NPV) and expected monetary value above $29 million. The petroleum profit tax, royalty and crude oil price have more impacts on the field’s NPV. The study suggests a periodic assessment of the fiscal regime and appropriate policy by the government to encourage the local players in developing the marginal oil field.
F38|The impact of political risk on return, volatility and discontinuity: Evidence from the international stock and foreign exchange markets|The paper examines the impact of political risk on stock and foreign exchange markets in a comprehensive sample of sixty-six countries and twenty political risk indicators mostly covering the financial crisis and recovery periods from May 2001 to April 2014. The impact is assessed on return, volatility and jumps series of monthly frequency. Evidence reveals that Europe is mostly at higher risks generated from economic crisis; whereas, political risks explain the high volatility and discontinuity in international stock and foreign exchange markets in other regions.
F38|The risk in capital controls|This paper investigates the effect of capital controls in banking outflow funds on financial risk in the Athens Stock Exchange. The study uses daily returns for two sub-periods before and after the capital controls, ranging from 31 March 2011 to 31 March 2016. We focus on the peaks over threshold method to calculate the risk measures. We propose a bootstrap approach to compare risk measures in two sub-periods. The bootstrap results indicate that there is an underestimation of financial risk after the capital controls.
F38|OTC derivatives: Impacts of regulatory changes in the non-financial sector|In the aftermath of the 2007–2008 global financial crisis, a series of measures have been proposed to regulate the OTC derivatives market. The motivation is to increase the disclosure of OTC transactions aiming to decrease the probability of crisis. The main objective of this paper is to investigate how regulatory changes in the OTC derivatives market affect the non-financial sector. The Brazilian FX derivatives market provides a natural experiment for this issue: in 2011, the Brazilian government taxed short positions in FX derivatives to reduce the carry trade, which was causing the local currency to appreciate. Although Chamon and Garcia (2013, Capital control in Brazil: effective? International Monetary Fund, manuscript) find that this policy helped reduce the incentives for carry trade strategies, it could have unintended consequences on other markets. For example, if banks pass through the extra cost to clients, this taxation may affect the FX hedges of non-financial firms. This paper investigates whether, and if so how much, the increase in the cost of OTC derivatives is transferred to the non-financial sector. The results indicate that this cost more than doubled for companies exposed to devaluation of the local currency (for instance, importers). Although a thorough welfare analysis is beyond the scope of this paper, the findings suggest that this cost increase may be a concern to the extent that it could prevent EME firms from hedging their FX positions, as the NDF quotation of some EMEs is high due to the interest rate differentials.
F38|Macroprudential oversight, risk communication and visualization|This paper discusses the role of risk communication in macroprudential oversight and of visualization in risk communication. Beyond the increase in data availability and precision, the transition from firm-centric to system-wide supervision imposes vast data needs. Moreover, in addition to internal communication as in any organization, broad and effective external communication of timely information related to systemic risks is a key mandate of macroprudential supervisors. This further stresses the importance of simple representations of complex data. The present paper focuses on the background and theory of information visualization and visual analytics, as well as techniques within these fields, as potential means for risk communication. We define the task of visualization in risk communication, discuss the structure of macroprudential data, and review visualization techniques applied to systemic risk. We conclude that two essential, yet rare, features for supporting the analysis of big data and communication of risks are analytical visualizations and interactive interfaces. For visualizing the so-called macroprudential data cube, we provide the VisRisk platform with three modules: plots, maps and networks. While VisRisk is herein illustrated with five web-based interactive visualizations of systemic risk indicators and models, the platform enables and is open to the visualization of any data from the macroprudential data cube.
F38|Fiscal policy in debt constrained economies|We study optimal fiscal policy in a small open economy (SOE) with sovereign and private default risk and limited commitment to tax plans. The SOE's government uses linear taxation to fund exogenous expenditures and uses public debt to inter-temporally allocate tax distortions. We characterize a class of environments in which the tax on labor goes to zero in the long run, while the tax on capital income may be non-zero, reversing the standard prediction of the Ramsey tax literature. The zero labor tax is an optimal long run outcome if the economy is subject to sovereign debt constraints and the domestic households are impatient relative to the international interest rate. The front loading of tax distortions allows the economy to build a large (aggregate) debt position in the presence of limited commitment. We show that a similar result holds in a closed economy with imperfect inter-generational altruism, providing a link with the closed-economy literature that has explored disagreement between the government and its citizens regarding inter-temporal tradeoffs.
F38|Exchange market pressure in OECD and emerging economies: Domestic vs. external factors and capital flows in the old and new normal|We study the ways domestic and external global factors (such as risk appetite, global liquidity, U.S. monetary policy, and commodity prices) affected the exchange market pressure before and after the global financial crisis, as well as the role of these factors during the Federal Reserve's tapering episode. Utilizing a comprehensive database on capital controls, we investigate whether control measures have a significant impact on mitigating exchange market pressure associated with capital flows [net and gross]. Using quarterly data over the 2000–2014 period and a dynamic panel model estimation, we find that external factors played a significant role in driving exchange market pressure for both OECD countries and emerging market countries, with a larger impact on the latter. While the effect of net capital flows on exchange market pressure is muted, short-term gross portfolio inflows and outflows comprise important factors that account for exchange market pressure. Short-term portfolio flows and long-term foreign direct investment flows have a significant impact on exchange market pressure for emerging market economies and no significant effect for OECD countries. Capital controls seem to significantly reduce the exchange market pressure, although the economic size of this impact is highly dependent on the institutional quality.
F38|Capital controls, competitive depreciation, and the technological frontier|This paper considers the internal and external welfare effects of international capital controls and real exchange rate undervaluation in a multi-country setting. I present a dynamic open-economy macro model with an endogenously determined rate of interest on internationally traded assets. All countries produce tradable and nontradable goods using technology that converges over time to a global frontier. The model quantifies the welfare effects of the unilateral implementation of capital controls that depreciate the real exchange rate in economies both already at and converging to the technological frontier. For developing economies, I demonstrate that such government interventions may constitute “beggar-thy-neighbor” policies.
F38|Freeing Greece from capital controls: Were the restrictions enforced in time?|Recent developments in Greece have caused for the implementation of banking capital controls on the outflow of funds, a policy decision not uncommon, especially in emerging markets. However, the issues of the Greek economy, which seem to stem from the public sector but have been passed on to the banking sector, pose a unique challenge to researchers. In this paper, we employ VBanking, an object-oriented model for banking simulations to examine whether capital controls in Greece were enforced at the appropriate time. Additionally, we propose that the banking sector will not purge this regulation soon. Finally, we demonstrate the destructive effects of capital controls both on the financial system and on the real economy. We present the empirical results of our work, which suggest that the Greek authorities’ response to the deterioration of the banking sector was lagged.
F38|Liquidity traps, capital flows|Motivated by debates surrounding international capital flows during the Great Recession, we conduct a positive and normative analysis of capital flows when a region of the global economy experiences a liquidity trap. Capital flows reduce inefficient output fluctuations in this region by inducing exchange rate movements that reallocate expenditure towards the goods it produces. Restricting capital mobility hampers such an adjustment. From a global perspective, constrained efficiency entails subsidizing capital flows to address an aggregate demand externality associated with exchange rate movements. Absent cooperation, however, dynamic terms-of-trade manipulation motives drive countries to inefficiently restrict capital flows, impeding aggregate demand stabilization.
F38|A New Dilemma: Capital Controls and Monetary Policy in Sudden Stop Economies|The dangers of high capital flow volatility and sudden stops have led economists to promote the use of capital controls as an addition to monetary policy in emerging market economies. This paper studies the benefits of capital controls and monetary policy in an open economy with financial frictions, nominal rigidities, and sudden stops. We focus on a time-consistent policy equilibrium. We find that during a crisis, an optimal monetary policy should sharply diverge from price stability. Without commitment, policymakers will also tax capital inflows in a crisis. But this is not optimal from an ex-ante social welfare perspective. An outcome without capital inflow taxes, using optimal monetary policy alone to respond to crises, is superior in welfare terms, but not time-consistent. If policy commitment were in place, capital inflows would be subsidized during crises. We also show that an optimal policy will never involve macro-prudential capital inflow taxes as a precaution against the risk of future crises (whether or not commitment is available).
F38|Quadrilemma not Trilemma: Fiscal Policy Matters|This paper examines the interactions between fiscal policy and the open economy macroeconomic policy trilemma in a small open economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. I show that the trilemma policy regime choices require fiscal accommodation. Otherwise, when future budget fail to stabilize government liabilities, fiscal imbalance generates exchange rate depreciation, regardless of monetary and capital account policy regimes. In this active fiscal policy regime, fiscal and monetary policy interact to determine the magnitude of exchange rate depreciation, while monetary policy and capital controls manage the timing of the depreciation.
F38|Capital controls as a credit policy tool in a small open economy|We develop a sticky price, small open economy model with financial frictions à la [Gertler, Mark, and Peter Karadi. 2011. “A Model of Unconventional Monetary Policy.” Journal of Monetary Economics 58 (1): 17–34.], in combination with liability dollarization. An agency problem between domestic financial intermediaries and foreign investors of emerging economies introduces financial frictions in the form of time-varying endogenous balance sheet constraints on the domestic financial intermediaries. We consider a shock that tightens the balance sheet constraint and show that capital controls, the effects of which are rigorously examined as a policy tool for the emerging economies, can be a credit policy tool to mitigate the negative shock.
F38|Capital Controls and Financial Frictions in a Small Open Economy|Abstract We develop a small open economy model with financial frictions between domestic banks and foreign investors, and examine the welfare-improving effect of capital controls. We show that capital controls are effective in addressing the amplification effect due to financial frictions. As the degree of financial frictions increases, the welfare-improving effect of capital controls becomes larger and a more aggressive policy rule is appropriate. Comparing two economies, one with and one without “liability dollarization,” we also find that the welfare-improving effect of capital controls is larger in the presence of “liability dollarization,” and the difference between the effects becomes larger as the degree of financial frictions increases.
F38|Optimal capital controls and real exchange rate policies: A pecuniary externality perspective|A new literature studies the use of capital controls to prevent financial crises. Within this new framework, we show that when exchange rate policy is costless, there is no need for capital controls. However, if exchange rate policy entails efficiency costs, capital controls become part of the optimal policy mix. When exchange rate policy is costly, the optimal mix combines prudential capital controls in tranquil times with policies that limit exchange rate depreciation in crisis times. The optimal mix yields more borrowing, fewer and less severe financial crises, and much higher welfare than with capital controls alone.
F38|A Model of the International Monetary System|We propose a simple model of the international monetary system. We study the world supply and demand for reserve assets denominated in different currencies under a variety of scenarios: a hegemon versus a multipolar world; abundant versus scarce reserve assets; and a gold exchange standard versus a floating rate system. We rationalize the Triffin dilemma, which posits the fundamental instability of the system, as well as the common prediction regarding the natural and beneficial emergence of a multipolar world, the Nurkse warning that a multipolar world is more unstable than a hegemon world, and the Keynesian argument that a scarcity of reserve assets under a gold standard or at the zero lower bound is recessionary. Our analysis is both positive and normative.
F38|The Politics Of Fdi Expropriation|I examine the role of political instability and fractionalization as potential explanations for the lack of capital flows from rich countries to poor countries (i.e., the Lucas Paradox). Using panel data from 1984 to 2014, I document that (i) developed countries exhibit larger inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI), (ii) countries subject to high investment risk (IR) receive low FDI inflows, and (iii) IR is higher in fractionalized and politically unstable economies. These findings suggest a negative relationship between political instability and FDI through the IR channel. I inspect the theoretical mechanism using a dynamic political economy model of redistribution, wherein policymakers can expropriate resources from foreign investors. The proceeds are used to finance groupâ€ specific transfers to domestic workers but hinder economic growth by discouraging FDI. I show that the political equilibrium exhibits overexpropriation and underinvestment.
F38|A New Financial Order in Asia: Will a RMB bloc emerge?|The objective of this paper is three-fold. First, the monetary and exchange rate regimes of the Asian countries are described and analyzed. The degrees of flexibility in exchange rates and capital controls vary across countries. Some countries have adopted a flexible inflation targeting framework, while others have pursued exchange rate targeting. The paper presents a new result of a tradeoff between price stability and exchange rate stability in the hyperbolic relationship of Asian countries. Second, a framework that analyzes and quantifies the degree of currency internationalization is proposed and applied to the RMB. In every indicator, the RMB’s weight in private-sector international finance has grown in the last several years, both in the private and public sectors. In the settlement role of currency, the RMB is ranked 8th in the BIS survey and 7th in SWIFT usage. This paper exploits data of a recent period when the RMB became de-pegged from the USD and show some of the emerging Asian currencies co-moving with the RMB, more so than the USD. In the official sector, RMB is also increasing its weight. The Chinese central bank has extended the currency-swap agreements with 30-some countries, so that the RMB can be used for trade finance and liquidity assistance. The RMB is adopted as a composition currency of the Special Drawing Rights (SDR), effective in October 2016, with 10.92 percent, ranking number 3, surpassing the JPY and GBP. Finally, potential impending changes in the Asian monetary and exchange rate regimes in Asia are discussed. Projecting the growth of the Chinese economy into the future, the weight of the RMB in the financial markets will increase globally as well as in Asia.
F38|Motivations for Capital Controls and Their Effectiveness|We assess the motivations for changing capital controls and their effectiveness in India, a country with extensive and long-standing controls. We focus on the controls on foreign borrowing that can, in principle, be motivated by macroprudential concerns. We construct a fine-grained data set on capital control actions on foreign borrowing in India. Using event study methodology, we assess the factors that influence these capital control actions, the main factor being the exchange rate. Capital controls are tightened after appreciation, and eased after depreciation, of the exchange rate. Macroprudential concerns, measured by variables that capture systemic risk buildups, do not seem to be a factor shaping the use of capital controls. To assess the impact of controls, we use both event study and propensity score matching methodologies. Event study methodology suggests no impact of capital controls on most variables evaluated, but reveals limited evidence that capital controls relieve currency pressures in the short term. However, even this limited evidence disappears once selection bias is controlled for.
F38|The Incompatibility Triangle|"Launch of the euro in the late 90s, can be interpreted as a first step towards the monetary system outlined by Mundell. Economists have noted the incompatibility of fixed exchange regime, perfect mobility of capital and the independence of monetary policy, the so-called triangle of incompatibility, which was highlighted by Robert Mundell since 1968. Tommaso Padoa - Schioppa continued his research on the harmonization and convergence required to economic policies in “Financial Europe"". The author shows that the triangle is the freedom of movement of capital, the exchange rate stability and the autonomy of national monetary policies. The triangle of incompatibility stems from the fact that they can be combined in their entirety, but only two. The autonomy of monetary policy is the freedom of states to choose the appropriate monetary policy and take appropriate measures in case of recessions."
F38|"Tax Havens - The ""Black Hole"" of the International Finance"|Tax evasion is a high interest topic, frequently approached both now and in the past because itis a very common phenomenon in all countries (either developed or emerging) and is particularlyimportant. Tax evasion determines the occurrenceof aset of creative accounting practices used inthe context of what is considered to be right and what goes beyond the ethical limits. The article presents, in general, tax evasion both theoretically and practically, examines thevarious ways in which evasion is interpreted by the laws and regulations adopted in the fiscalfield,the ways that lead businessmen to perform and fraudulently register operations. Also, we aimat characterising thestates that help the economic operators and the individuals, by means of taxhavens and implicitly offshore companies, in order to avoid the payment of certain taxes that arehigher than in the home country.
F38|Capital Control Measures: A New Dataset|Abstract This paper presents a new data set of capital controls by inflows and outflows for 10 asset categories in 100 countries during 1995–2013. Building on the data in Schindler (2009) and other data sets based on the analysis of the IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER), this data set covers additional asset categories, more countries, and a longer time period. The paper discusses in detail the construction of the data and characterizes them with respect to the prevalence and correlation of controls across asset categories and between inflow and outflow controls, the aggregation of the separate categories into broader indicators, the experience of some particular countries, and the comparison of these data with others indices of capital controls.
F38|Capital Openness and Income Inequality: A Cross-Country Study and The Role of CCT in Latin America|Recently, capital controls have made a comeback as both policymakers and academia have questioned the net benefits of liberalization and economic growth, especially after the 2008 Great Recession. While that literature has largely concluded that capital account liberalization may have detrimental effects on growth and accentuate financial instability in emerging markets, relatively little literature has examined the impacts of capital account liberalization on income inequality. Thus, this paper investigates the extent to which liberalization is beneficial for countries, conditional on institutional strength and financial depth. We specifically explore the differential impacts of capital account liberalization on income inequality during periods of economic expansion and contraction. The main findings suggest that the net impact of financial liberalization on income inequality is ambiguous during periods of economic expansion but detrimental during contractions. However, we also find that capital account openness needs not to be detrimental on income inequality if institutions are strong or - as it is the case in Latin America -if social safety nets are available.
F38|Examining Taxation of Fiat Money and Bitcoins Vis-A-Vis Regulated Cryptocurrencies|In this paper, we examine the Taxation aspects of Fiat money and Bitcoins vis-a-vis Regulated Cryptocurrencies. We start off by briefly explaining the concept of cryptocurrencies (also referred to as cryptocoins in this paper). We then discuss the concept of Regulated and Sovereign Backed Cryptocurrencies (RSBCs). Then we envisage a scenario where cryptocoins are the main medium of exchange. The taxation aspects of Paper money, Bitcoins and RSBCs are then deliberated with the pros and cons of taxation for each currency format. The currency that can support an Automated Tax Regime is also debated. Finally, the paper concludes by arranging in ascending order, the currencies which are easily amenable to and compliant with taxation policies and laws.
F38|Capital Inflow Surges and Consequences|While capital flows to emerging markets bring numerous benefits, they are also known to create macroeconomic imbalances (economic overheating, currency overvaluation) and increase financial vulnerabilities (domestic credit growth, bank leverage, foreign currency-denominated lending). But are all inflows the same? In this paper, we examine whether the source of the inflow—residents repatriating foreign assets or nonresidents investing in the country—or the type of inflow (foreign direct investment, portfolio, other investment) makes any difference to the consequences of the capital flow. Our results, based on a sample of 53 emerging markets over 1980–2013, show that when it comes to the source of the inflow, the macroeconomic and financial-stability consequences of flows driven by residents (asset flows) and nonresidents (liability flows) are broadly similar in economic terms. Formal statistical tests, however, suggest that liability flows are more prone to causing economic overheating and domestic credit expansion than asset flows. On the types of inflows, we find that compared to direct investment, portfolio debt and other investment flows are associated with larger macroeconomic imbalances and financial vulnerabilities. We conclude that policy should try to mitigate the untoward consequences of inflows, and shift their composition from risky to safer forms of liabilities.
F38|Research regarding the Taxes Withholding and Automatie Information Exchange in the context of Business Globalization|The authorization of EU states to levy withholding taxes on capital income within the EU has been challenged by several authors considering the framework and guidelines of European Law.1 Not least, the political commitment to the automatic exchange of information (AoEI) of bank account and fiscal data of all important industrial countries and financial centers worldwide has been arousing the debate toabolish withholding taxes. Representatives of the German government exemplarily have already claimed for a system without withholding taxes. This essay presents a critical mapping for the several information exchange regimes and discus­ ses, whether withholding taxes on private capital income arestill reasonable.
F38|Opportunities of Modern Understandings on Human Capital|The study is focused on the key factor in the structure of any organization â€“ the human capital. The objective is to present the thesis of the author that it is possible to optimize the process of formation of human capital through consolidated administration of certain management and control concepts. The tasks are connected with accumulation of evidence that the concept of the audit of human resources can be and should be developed.
F38|Partial tax harmonization through infrastructure coordination| In this article we analyze the role that infrastructure coordination plays to in achieving partial tax harmonization in a coalition of asymmetric jurisdictions. We find that infrastructure coordination with di¤erent investment levels can facilitate partial tax harmonization between asymmetric jurisdictions when asymmetries are not too large. Furthermore, agreeing on a common investment level can be even more e¤ective in facilitating partial tax harmonization between asymmetric jurisdictions. Our results explain the harmonization of corporate tax rates observed in the EU between 1995 and 2006 where there was simultaneous convergence of public infrastructure investments facilitated via EU structural funds.

F38|You’re banned! The effect of sanctions on German cross-border financial flows|Summary This paper examines the effect of financial sanctions on cross-border capital flows. While sanctions can be expected to hinder international transactions, thereby putting political and economic pressure on a target country, we study the patterns of adjustment in bilateral financial relationships after the imposition of sanctions along various dimensions. Our analysis is based on highly disaggregated, monthly data from the German balance of payments statistics for the period from 2005 through 2014. During this time, Germany imposed financial sanctions on 20 countries; two of these sanctions have been lifted. Applying a differences-in-differences approach, we find two key results. First, financial sanctions have a strong and immediate negative effect on direct financial flows with the sanctioned country, with cross-border flows reduced in either direction. Second, sanctions imposed by the European Union alone, and therefore only enforced by their member countries instead of the United Nations, are evaded as flows with major trading partners of sanctioned countries increase. We conclude that financial sanctions do matter for capital flows.
F38|Trillion dollar estimate: Illicit financial flows from developing countries|Recent estimates suggest that developing countries lose about 1 trillion US dollars each year due to illicit financial flows. This paper reviews the empirical methodology that underlies those estimates. Various critical aspects of the analytical approach are highlighted, focusing in particular on deficiencies in the use of mirror trade statistics to quantify the extent of capital outflows due to trade misinvoicing. Serious issues in the empirical analysis include, among others, arbitrary assumptions, mixed methodologies and skewed sampling. As a result, it is argued that the quantitative results obtained from those exercises have no substantive meaning. The trillion-dollar estimate of illicit financial flows from developing countries, therefore, lacks evidence and is uncorroborated.
F38|International Financial Flows in the New Normal: Key Patterns (and Why We Should Care)|This policy brief documents recent trends in international financial flows, based on a newly assembled dataset covering 40 advanced and emerging countries. Specifically, we compare the period since 2012 with the pre-crisis period and highlight four key stylized facts. First, the “Great Retrenchment” that took place during the crisis has proved very persistent, and world financial flows are now down to half their pre-crisis levels. Second, this fall can predominantly be related to advanced economies, especially those in Western Europe, while emerging markets, except Eastern European countries, have been less severely affected until recently. Third, the global patterns of net flows have also recorded significant changes. Overall, net flows have fallen substantially relative to the years preceding the sudden stop, which is to some extent an expression of the changes registered in the current account. Fourth, not all types of flows have shown the same degree of resilience, resulting in a profound change in the composition of international financial flows: while banking flows, which used to account for the largest share of the total before 2008, have collapsed, FDI flows have been barely affected and now represent roughly 45% of global flows. Portfolio flows stand between these two extremes, and within them equity flows have proved more robust than debt flows, which should help to strengthen resilience and deliver genuine cross-border risk-sharing. Having highlighted these stylized facts, this policy brief turns to possible explanations for and likely implications of these changes, regarding international financial stability issues.
F38|The possible trinity: Optimal interest rate, exchange rate, and taxes on capital flows in a DSGE model for a small open economy|A traditional way of thinking about the exchange rate (XR) regime and capital account openness has been framed in terms of the 'impossible trinity' or 'trilemma', in which policymakers can only have 2 of 3 possible outcomes: open capital markets, monetary independence and pegged XRs. This paper is an extension of Escude (A DSGE Model for a SOE with Systematic Interest and Foreign Exchange Policies in Which Policymakers Exploit the Risk Premium for Stabilization Purposes, 2013), which focused on interest rate and XR policies, since it introduces the third vertex of the 'trinity' in the form of taxes on private foreign debt. These affect the risk-adjusted uncovered interest parity equation and hence influence the SOE's international financial flows. A useful way to illustrate the range of policy alternatives is to associate them with the faces of a triangle. Each of 3 possible government intervention policies taken individually (in the domestic currency bond market, in the FX market, and in the foreign currency bonds market) corresponds to one of the vertices of the triangle, each of the 3 possible pairs of intervention policies corresponds to one of its 3 edges, and the 3 simultaneous intervention policies taken jointly correspond to its interior. This paper shows that this interior, or 'possible trinity' is quite generally not only possible but optimal, since the CB obtains a lower loss when it implements a policy with all three interventions.
F38|Penser les politiques macroprudentielles au niveau global|While the concept of macroprudential policy has been extensively discussed, the issue of its coordination at the global level has barely been touched upon. Coordination is however key to warrant its effectiveness, maintain sound and fair competitive conditions between financial institutions or jurisdictions and avoid redundancies or conflicts of objectives between the different decision-making levels: national, regional, and global. This paper first presents the main rationales to think about macroprudential policies at the global level and second considers possible avenues to do so. Classification JEL: F38, F42, G28.
F38|Les spillovers globaux de la liquidité|During the “global financial crisis”, the interactions, at a global level, between domestic financial systems appeared to be much more complex and crucial than thought previously. The meaning of the macroeconomic and microeconomic determinants of the gross financial flows or the precise nature of the liquidity “spillovers” call for a renewal of our view of the international monetary and financial system. This paper attempts to give an overview of these interactions by addressing successively the following three questions. What are their origins? What are the extent and diversity of their effects? How can the authorities react to these spillovers? Classification JEL: F32, F38, F41, F42.
F38|Quel régime monétaire pour les émergents après la normalisation ?|For emerging economies, the expected return to conventional monetary policies in the US, which will result in a rise in US interest rates and in a decrease in global liquidity, raises the question of the choice of the monetary regime for those countries that permits to ensure stable growth without financial instability in the post-crisis period. Monetary regime stands for the combination of monetary policy rules, of financial stability objectives and of the choice of exchange rate regime. After studying the monetary regime of the emerging countries in a context of unconventional monetary policies since the crisis, we focus on international spillovers caused by US monetary policy, before analyzing the different dilemmas or trilemmas between which central bankers from emerging countries will arbitrate to implement their monetary regime after the normalization.

F38|International Credit Flows and Pecuniary Externalities|"This paper develops a dynamic two-country neoclassical stochastic growth model with incomplete markets. Short-term credit flows can be excessive and reverse suddenly. The equilibrium outcome is constrained inefficient due to pecuniary externalities. First, an undercapitalized country borrows too much since each firm does not internalize that an increase in production capacity undermines their output price, worsening their terms of trade. From an ex ante perspective each firm undermines the natural ""terms of trade hedge"". Second, sudden stops and fire sales lead to sharp price drops of illiquid capital. Capital controls or domestic macro-prudential measures that limit short-term borrowing can improve welfare. (JEL F32, F43, G15, O41)"

F38|Las reservas internacionales en Colombia: ¿Regla de acumulación, o política discrecional?|Las reservas internacionales constituyen una herramienta de política monetaria de vital importancia, especialmente en países como Colombia con alta dependencia de la exportación de commodities con precios volátiles, y a inversión extranjera directa que se vería desfavorecida bajo crisis de balanza de pagos. Sin embargo la acumulación de recursos públicos presenta costos de oportunidad considerables, y en ese sentido se requiere evaluar que tan adecuado es el tamaño del stock de reservas. El presente documento analiza el atesoramiento histórico de reservas en Colombia desde 1960 hasta la actualidad, usando para ello dos metodologías: las reservas óptimas y las reservas adecuadas. Se concluye que Colombia ha seguido los estándares internacionales en pequeños intervalos históricos. La discrecionalidad ha liderado en los periodos de bonanzas y de crisis, además de los últimos 10 años donde los indicadores muestran una sobre acumulación monetaria.
F38|The implications for trade and FDI flows from liberalisation of China's capital account|We model the partial liberalisation of the capital account by China using a dynamic CGE model of the world economy. Our results indicate that a reduced capital controls on FDI would lead to a significant increase in FDI capital in China and a significant reduction in the cost of capital in China relative to the rest of the world. Further, we observe an increase in capital stocks in all regions, which benefits all regions in terms of GDP and GNP. The economies of China (1.7%), East Asia (1.3%) and Australia/New Zealand (0.5%) grow most strongly. The rental price of capital falls significantly in these regions, which lowers domestic costs and they experience a real depreciation of the exchange rate and thus increased exports relative to other regions. We also observe an across-the-board increase in the saving rate driven by the rise in the price of consumption relative to investment (saving) in all regions.
F38|A Model of the Twin DS: Optimal Default and Devaluation|This paper characterizes jointly optimal default and exchange-rate policy. The theoretical environment is a small open economy with downward nominal wage rigidity as in Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2013) and limited enforcement of international debt contracts as in Eaton and Gersovitz (1981). It is shown that under optimal policy default is accompanied by large devaluations. At the same time, under fixed exchange rates, optimal default takes place in the context of large involuntary unemployment. Fixed-exchange-rate economies are found to be able to support less external debt than economies with optimally floating rates. In addition, the following three analytical results are presented: 1) Real economies with limited enforcement of international debt contracts in the tradition of Eaton and Gersovitz (1981) can be decentralized using capital controls; 2) Real economies in the tradition of Eaton and Gersovitz can be interpreted as the centralized version of models with downward nominal wage rigidity, optimal capital controls, and a full-employment exchange-rate policy; and 3) Full-employment is optimal in an economy with downward nominal wage rigidity, limited enforcement of debt contracts, and optimal capital controls.
F38|Macroprudential oversight, risk communication and visualization|This paper discusses the role of risk communication in macroprudential oversight and of visualization in risk communication. Beyond the soar in data availability and precision, the transition from firm-centric to system-wide supervision imposes vast data needs. Moreover, except for internal communication as in any organization, broad and effective external communication of timely information related to systemic risks is a key mandate of macroprudential supervisors, further stressing the importance of simple representations of complex data. This paper focuses on the background and theory of information visualization and visual analytics, as well as techniques within these fields, as potential means for risk communication. We define the task of visualization in risk communication, discuss the structure of macroprudential data, and review visualization techniques applied to systemic risk. We conclude that two essential, yet rare, features for supporting the analysis of big data and communication of risks are analytical visualizations and interactive interfaces. For visualizing the so-called macroprudential data cube, we provide the VisRisk platform with three modules: plots, maps and networks. While VisRisk is herein illustrated with five web-based interactive visualizations of systemic risk indicators and models, the platform enables and is open to the visualization of any data from the macroprudential data cube.
F38|Convertibility restriction in China’s foreign exchange market and its impact on forward pricing|In contrast to the well established markets such as the dollar-euro market, recent CIP deviations observed in the onshore dollar-RMB forward market were primarily caused by conversion restrictions in the spot market rather than by changes in credit risk and/or liquidity constraint. This paper proposes a theoretical framework by which the Chinese authorities impose conversion restrictions in the spot market in an attempt to achieve capital flow balance, but face the tradeoff between achieving such balance and disturbing current account transactions. Consequently, the level of conversion restriction should increase with the amount of capital account transactions and decrease with the amount of current account transactions. Such conversion restriction in turn places a binding constraint on forward traders’ ability to cover their forward positions, resulting in the observed CIP deviation. More particularly, the model predicts that the onshore forward rate will equal a weighted average of the CIP-implied forward rate and the market’s expectation of the future spot rate, were the weighting is determined by the level of conversion restriction. As a secondary result, the model also implies that offshore non-deliverable forwards reflect the market’s expectation of the future spot rate. Our empirical results are consistent with these predictions.

F38|Taxing Wealth: Past, Present, Future - Workshop Proceedings|"In times of fiscal consolidation and strong macroeconomic adjustment needs in some EU Member States, the debate on wealth taxation gained momentum, both in the academic and in the policy debate. In this context, the aim of the workshop, held by DG ECFIN on 13 November 2014, was to discuss theoretical and policy issues associated with wealth taxation, including the broad principles and the concrete design challenges of an optimal wealth tax. Different types of wealth taxation have been scrutinised including transmission taxes, housing taxes and the taxation of financial assets. The challenges they may raise have been discussed also with respect to recent experience in particular Member States. The workshop was organised in two sessions: ""Taxation of wealth: state of play and rationale"" and ""Taxing wealth: specific instruments and challenges"". The proceedings offer a detailed summary of the most recent research related to various aspects of wealth taxation and carried out by academics and international organisations' representatives."
F38|Money and Physical Capital Relationship: McKinnon’s Complementarity Hypothesis on Turkey’s Economy|A complementary relationship between money and physical capital, emphasis on liberalization, financial liberalization theory and increased real interest rates will lead to a surge in money demand and investment. In this research paper, the validity of this hypothesis, which is also known as McKinnon's complementarity hypothesis, in terms of financial liberalization policy has been tested empirically to examine the performance, money demand, interest rate and investment size in order to attempt to designate the respective relationship in Turkey. In this study, over the period of 1999Q1-2014Q4 in Turkey, the relationship between money and physical capital for available data is investigated through the BOUND and ARDL test methods. Empirical analysis of the findings suggests that Turkey's economy is based on a limited complementary relationship between money and physical capital.

F38|Fiscal Policy in Debt Constrained Economies|We study optimal fiscal policy in a small open economy (SOE) with sovereign and private default risk and limited commitment to tax plans. The SOE's government uses linear taxation to fund exogenous expenditures and uses public debt to inter-temporally allocate tax distortions. We characterize a class of environments in which the tax on labor goes to zero in the long run, while the tax on capital income may be non-zero, reversing the standard prediction of the Ramsey tax literature. The zero labor tax is an optimal long run outcome if the economy is subject to sovereign debt constraints and the domestic households are impatient relative to the international interest rate. The front loading of tax distortions allows the economy to build a large (aggregate) debt position in the presence of limited commitment. We show that a similar result holds in a closed economy with imperfect inter-generational altruism, providing a link with the closed-economy literature that has explored disagreement between the government and its citizens regarding inter-temporal tradeoffs.
F38|Inequality Indebtedness and Financial Crises|This work is an empirical contribution that investigates the presence of a relationship among income inequality, household indebtedness and the erup- tion of systemic banking crises (namely the I-I-C nexus). We test this hy- pothesis on a panel of 31 countries over the period 1980-2012 within four different scenarios. We find strong evidence of a statistically significant asso- ciation between income inequality and systemic banking crises via household indebtedness (the I-I-C nexus) regardless of the specification and the estima- tion technique chosen. However, we find no evidence of a feedback effect of a systemic banking crisis on income inequality, at least in the short run. We also find that economies characterized by highly liberalized financial mar- kets are more prone to experience such a nexus. These results suggest that reforming the architecture of financial regulation and supervision is still an important issues. However, it is a necessary but not sufficient condition in order to ensure financial stability.
