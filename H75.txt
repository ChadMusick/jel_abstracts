H75|Vaccination recommendations and timeliness - The German measles case|High vaccination rates have a social protection function in addition to individual prevention of infections and diseases. To reach herd immunity thresholds and to protect risk groups, the timeliness of immunization is an important goal for vaccination policy. There is currently no causal evidence of age-appropriate immunization for childhood vaccinations. This research investigates how changing the recommended timeliness of vaccination in childhood affects vaccination status, leaving the number of doses during the primary vaccination unchanged. I analyze an adaption in 2001 that shifts the timeliness two and a half years earlier within the second year of life. Using representative German survey data based on vaccination cards, I investigate a timeliness adaption of the measles primary vaccination in 2001, which changed the scheduled age of the second dose among young children aged 2 to 7 years, and use variation of the implementation across states. For adjusted timeliness of the second measles vaccination, the data imply a significant shift into earlier ages after the policy for the treatment group. In the short run, a difference-in-difference strategy implies causal evidence of the up-to-date vaccination probability at the end of the 7th year of life. Additionally, the adaption induced a significant timeliness effect on the up-to-date level of the first measles dose at the end of the second year of life. This effect can be seen as evidence that individuals, in this case parents, respond to nonbinding vaccination recommendation policies and that timing of vaccination is an important factor for reaching vaccination policy aims.
H75|Low-performing student responses to state merit scholarships|State merit scholarships may affect academic outcomes for low-performing college students, yet low-performers are generally overlooked in existing literature. New Mexico’s lottery scholarship provides tuition-free college to residents meeting a uniquely “low-bar” eligibility criteria. Using administrative data, a discontinuity in eligibility rules identifies local average treatment effects on degree completion and course taking behavior for students with below-average college grades. Results suggest a reduction in time-to-degree corresponding to the scholarship’s funding cap, with no overall change in degree completion. Despite modest eligibility requirements related to credit completion, the scholarship increased credit completion among low-achieving students. Some students appear to manipulate scholarship eligibility by taking fewer courses or strategically dropping courses during a qualifying semester in order to secure aid. A bounding exercise suggests partial manipulation of eligibility rules results in selection bias which underestimates the true effect of the scholarship on time to degree and credit completion.

H75|Do Direct Elections Matter? Quasi-experimental Evidence from Germany|We estimate the causal effect of direct elections on the economic performance of politicians. Candidates running in direct elections to head local governments in the German state of Brandenburg need an absolute majority, and votes for the winner must represent at least 15% of eligible voters. If the quorum is not reached, direct elections are suspended, and local councils appoint the head of government. We examine election outcomes around the quorum, where the form of government is arguably exogenous. Event study results show that the public employment service becomes somewhat more effective under directly elected politicians. However, directly elected politicians do not seem to attract more businesses or expedite administrative acts.
H75|Sovereign debt: election concerns and the democratic disadvantage|We re-examine the concept of ‘democratic advantage’ in sovereign debt ratings when optimal repayment policies are time-inconsistent. If democratically elected politicians are unable to make credible commitments, then default rates are inefficiently high, so democracy potentially confers a credit market disadvantage. Institutions that are shielded from political pressure may ameliorate the disadvantage by adopting a more farsighted perspective. Using a numerical measure of institutional farsightedness obtained from the Global Insight Business Risk and Conditions database, we find that the observed relationship between credit ratings and democratic status is strongly conditional on farsightedness. With myopic institutions, democracy is associated with worsened credit ratings on average by about three investment grades. With farsighted institutions there is, if anything, a democratic advantage.
H75|Electoral Competition and Corruption: Theory and Evidence from India|In developing countries with weak enforcement, there is implicitly a large reliance on re-election incentives to reduce corruption. In this paper we extend existing models of post-election accountability with pure moral hazard to incorporate heterogeneous voters. In contrast to this existing literature, we show that electoral discipline is a weak instrument for improving accountability in a majoritarian voting system. More specifically, our model predicts that not only does corruption increase with competition under some conditions, but that the only type of corruption that is responsive to electoral competition is one where voters lose private benefits from the corruption, while corruption in public goods is not responsive. Consistent with these hypotheses, novel panel data on village level audits of one of India’s largest rural public works program suggest a U-shaped relationship between electoral competition and corruption, and responsiveness of corruption only in the private benefits of the program to competition. Our findings highlight the importance of credible penalties and the need for policy interventions that reduce pilferage in the public component of welfare programs, which entail larger welfare losses to citizens.
H75|The Role of Electoral Incentives for Policy Innovation: Evidence from the U.S. Welfare Reform|We investigate whether the decision to experiment with novel policies is influenced by electoral incentives. Our empirical setting is the U.S. welfare reform in 1996, which marked the most dramatic shift in social policy since the New Deal. We find that electoral incentives matter: governors with strong electoral support are less likely to experiment with policies than governors with little electoral support. Yet, governors who cannot be reelected experiment more than governors striving for reelection. The importance of electoral incentives is robust to controlling for governor ideology, voter preferences for redistribution, the influence of the legislature, or for learning among states. A comparison of the role of governor ideology and electoral incentives reveals that both contribute about equally to policy experimentation.
H75|Does fiscal decentralization affect regional disparities in health? Quasi-experimental evidence from Italy|Recent theories on fiscal decentralization support the view that sub-national governments who finance a larger share of their spending with taxes raised locally by themselves are more accountable towards their citizens. Whilst evidence on improvements in spending efficiency is relatively common, little is known about the effects on inequalities amongst the population. In this paper we exploit a reform aimed at increasing regional tax autonomy in Italy to provide quasi-experimental evidence on the impact of fiscal decentralization on health disparities between- and within-regions. Our findings, robust to a number of robustness checks, support the view that fiscal decentralization does not impact on between-regional inequalities but can help to reduce inequalities within regions. However, this last effect depends on the degree of economic development: richer regions are better than poorer ones in containing inequalities.
H75|Individual labor market effects of local public expenditures on sports|By merging administrative data on public finances of all municipalities in Germany with individual data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, we explore whether local public expenditures on sports facilities influences individual labor market outcomes. Our identification strategy follows a selection-on-observables approach and exploits the panel structure of the data covering 12 years between 2001 and 2012. The results of our matching estimations suggest that both women and men living in municipalities with high expenditure levels benefit, exhibiting approximately 7 percent of additional household net income on average. However, this income effect is fully captured by earning gains for men rather than women living in the household. Additional analysis suggests, that these gender differences, which can also be observed in terms of working time, hourly wage and employment status, appear plausible since women in the age cohort under consideration are less likely than men to engage in sports in general and in any of the publicly funded sports facilities in particular. Moreover, improved well-being and health are possible mechanisms that determine how the positive labor market effects for men may unfold.
H75|Digital Waste? Unintended Consequences of Health Information Technology|We exploit a large-scale natural experiment – the rollout of a nationwide electronic prescribing system in Finland – to study how digitization of prescriptions affects pharmaceutical use and health outcomes. We use comprehensive administrative data from patients treated with benzodiazepines, which are globally popular, effective but addictive psychotropic medications. We find no impact on benzodiazepine use on average, but among younger patients e-prescribing increases repeat prescription use. Younger patients' health outcomes do not improve but adverse outcomes, such as prescription drug abuse disorders and suicide attempts, increase dramatically. Improving access to medication through easier ordering may thus increase medication overuse.

Réflexions sur le recours des collectivités territoriales aux marchés de partenariats public-privé|This article describes the use of public-private partnerships by local governments since their creation in France in 2004. We argue that the municipalities' objectives and constraints explain the development of such contracts. We also study the reason of their current neglect. We conclude that the recent lack of interest for public-private partnerships is also due to the diversification of the contractual tools made available to municipalities.

H75|Fading Legacies: Human Capital in the Aftermath of the Partitions of Poland|This paper studies the longevity of historical legacies in the context of the formation of human capital. The Partitions of Poland (1772-1918) represent a natural experiment that instilled Poland with three different legacies of education, resulting in sharp differences in human capital among the Polish population. I construct a large, unique dataset that reflects the state of schooling and human capital in the partition territories from 1911 to 1961. Using a spatial regression discontinuity design, I find that primary school enrollment differs by as much as 80 percentage points between the partitions before WWI. However, this legacy disappears within the following two decades of Polish independence, as all former partitions achieve universal enrollment. Differences in educational infrastructure and gender access to schooling simultaneously disappear after WWI. The level of literacy converges likewise across the former partitions, driven by a high intergenerational mobility in education. After WWII, the former partitions are not distinguishable from each other in terms of education anymore.
H75|Kommunal medfinansiering og kampen for at forebygge indlæggelser: Viden om effekt / Municipal co-financing of regional health services and the fight to prevent hospital admissions: Knowledge about effects|Municipal co-payment is an arrangement where municipalities pay a variable amount to the regions whenever municipal citizens utilize regional health services, e.g. hospital services og GPs. The 5 Danish regions provide somatic and mental health services while municipalities mainly provide home nursing, home help, health visitors, rehabilitation, and child and youth dental services. Municipalities cannot employ physicians who actively treat patients. Municipal co-payment was introduced in 2007 in connection with the structural reform of municipalities and counties. The main idea was that economic incentives in the form of potential savings on co-payment would lead municipalities to look for alternatives to (some) regional health services. The municipalities have developed, among other things, acute beds (usually in conjunction with nursing homes) staffed by experienced home nurses that GPs can refer patients to instead of hospitalizing them, acute nursing teams that provide services in the homes of citizens, follow-home-service where home nurses follow discharged hospital patients to their homes (occasionally together with a GP) and evaluate care needs – in the hope of avoiding rehospitalizations. To the extent that these arrangements have been evaluated they are discussed in this paper. None have shown clear-cut indications of preventing or postponing hospitalizations. The paper services two aims: A literature review of above reports and an econometric analysis of panel data for 2007-2016/17. The econometric analysis did not show any significant effects on hospital admissions.
H75|The Causal Impact of Removing Children from Abusive and Neglectful Homes|This paper measures impacts of removing children from families investigated for abuse or neglect. We use removal tendencies of child protection investigators as an instrument. We focus on young children investigated before age 6 and find that removal significantly increases test scores and reduces grade repetition for girls. There are no detectable impacts for boys. This pattern of results does not appear to be driven by heterogeneity in pre-removal characteristics, foster placements, or the type of schools attended after removal. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that development of abused and neglected girls is more responsive to home removal.
H75|De Facto or De Jure? Ethnic Differences in Quit Responses to Legal Protections of Medical Marijuana Dispensaries|This paper studies the impact of legal medical marijuana markets on the decision to quit marijuana use, distinguishing between de jure legalization, in which dispensaries are legally protected, and de facto legalization, where dispensaries operate in the absence of laws protecting them. Geographic and temporal variation in the presence of de facto and de jure legalized markets serve to identify their impact on quitting. Although we find little robust evidence that quitting by females is impacted by either the presence or protection of retail medical marijuana dispensaries, our results reveal significant, and ethnically differentiated responses by males. Minority males are found to delay quitting in response to legal protection of dispensaries, while white males delay quitting in response to operating dispensaries. This behavior is consistent with racial and ethnic differences in the risks of arrest for simple marijuana offences, particularly for black males.

H75|Expertise and Independence on Governing Boards: Evidence from School Districts|In this paper, we study the roles of expertise and independence on governing boards in the context of education. In particular, we examine the causal influence of professional educators elected to local school boards on education production. Educators may bring valuable human capital to school district leadership, thereby improving student learning. Alternatively, the independence of educators may be distorted by interest groups. The key empirical challenge is that school board composition is endogenously determined through the electoral process. To overcome this, we develop and implement a novel research design that exploits California's randomized assignment of the order that candidates appear on election ballots. The insight of our empirical strategy is that ballot order effects generate quasi-random variation in the elected school board's composition. This approach is made possible by a unique dataset that combines election information about California school board candidates with district-level data on education inputs and outcomes. The results reveal that educators on the school board causally increase teacher salaries and reduce district enrollment in charter schools relative to other board members. We do not find accompanying effects on student test scores. We interpret these findings as consistent with educators on school boards shifting bargaining in favor of teachers' unions.
H75|Understanding Access Barriers to Public Services: Lessons from a Randomized Domestic Violence Intervention|We study the effect of reducing barriers to accessing non-police services on the demand for police services in cases of police-reported domestic violence. Variation comes from a large randomized controlled trial designed to assist victims in accessing non-police services and we link information from local and national police administrative records and a survey of victims to form a unique dataset for the evaluation. The intervention led to a 18% decrease in the demand for police services, as measured by the provision of a statement by victims. Despite a strong correlation between statements and criminal sanctions against perpetrators, we do not find a corresponding effect of the intervention on perpetrator arrest, charges, or sentencing. This suggests that treated victims who do not provide a statement do so because their potential statement was relatively less effective for pursuing criminal sanctions. Consistent with this result, we find treatment group statements are significantly less likely to be withdrawn than are control group statements.
H75|Do Pension Benefits Accelerate Cognitive Decline? Evidence from Rural China|Higher life expectancy and rapidly aging populations have led to the introduction of pension programs in developing countries in the last two decades. Using the introduction of a new public policy in China, we estimate the effects of pension benefits on individual cognition, measured by episodic memory and intact mental status, among individuals ages 60 and above. We find large and significant negative effects of the provision of pension benefits on cognitive functioning among the elderly. We find the largest effect of the program on delayed recall, a measure implicated in neurobiological research as an important predictor of the onset of dementia. We show that the program leads to more negative impacts among the female sample. Our findings support the mental retirement hypothesis that decreased mental activity results in atrophy of cognitive skills. We show that retirement plays a significant role in explaining cognitive decline at older ages.
H75|Did the ACA Medicaid Expansion Save Lives?|We estimate the effect of the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion on county-level mortality in the first four years following expansion. We find a reduction in all-cause mortality in ages 20 to 64 equaling 11.36 deaths per 100,000 individuals, a 3.6 percent decrease. This estimate is largely driven by reductions in causes of death likely to be influenced by access to health care, and equates to one life saved per 310 newly covered individuals. A cost-benefit analysis shows that the improvement in welfare due to mortality responses may offset the entire net-of-transfers expenditure associated with the expansion.
H75|Delayed graduation and university dropout: A review of theoretical approaches|This paper surveys the theoretical approaches used in the literature to study the phenomenon of delayed graduation and university dropout. The classical human capital model does not contemplate failure, which the amended human capital model does. Delayed graduation and university dropout are two stages of the same decision repeated over the years to step aside or leave when the net returns to education expected ex ante are negative. Failure can also be taken as a signal of the real skills of individuals who do not succeed to gain a higher level of education, The job search approach underlines the role of positive/negative local labor market conditions as a factor able to explain choices of investment in human capital. Within the bargaining approach, the decision to delay graduation or dropout from university is related to bargaining within the family between parents and children: the former give their children better consumption opportunities in return for their presence at home. Although the amended human capital model is certainly the most compelling one, the other approaches help framing factors which are neglected in the human capital model, forming a well-structured body of knowledge to better understand the phenomenon under scrutiny, while also suggesting a set of policy tools to better control it.
H75|Social Policy in Mexico and Argentina|This paper is a comparison between two programs implemented to combat poverty in Latin America: Prospera (Prosper) in Mexico and AsignaciÃ³n Universal por Hijo (Universal Assignment for Child) in Argentina. The first section offers a review of the emergence of the welfare state, examining economic and urban development in both countries and the underlying trends of social policy instruments. The analysis is based on the political nature of social problems and the actions undertaken to confront them. The paper offers a theoretical perspective, often questioning the very foundation of the social policy that serves as the main framework for the social programs, in order to present the policies' scope, successes, and disadvantages with reference to social equity and the well-being of their participants.
H75|Welfare Effects of a Non-Contributory Old Age Pension: Experimental Evidence for Ekiti State, Nigeria|Many countries in the developing world have implemented non-contributory old-age pensions. Evidence of the impact of such policies on the elderly in Sub-Saharan Africa is scarce, however. In this paper, we provide the first evidence from a randomized evaluation of an unconditional, non-contributory pension scheme targeted at the elderly in Ekiti State, Nigeria. Our findings show that treated beneficiaries self-reported better quality of life, more stable mental health, and better general health. We also provide evidence of spillover effects on labor outcomes and on household expenditure patterns as well as support for demand- side interventions aimed at improving the welfare of elderly poor citizens and other household members.
H75|Women’s preferences for social spending: theory and evidence from Spanish political representatives|This paper analyzes how the preferences of political representatives for social spending differ across gender groups, and what the effects of gender differences are for the equilibrium policies. We use a unique survey data from the CIS in Spain, comprising a sample of 350 male and 230 female political representatives of national chambers (Congress and Senate) and regional parliaments. Our findings suggest that, in general, female representatives have a stronger preference for social spending than male representatives. Interestingly, these gender differences arise within members of the right-wing party (of PP), whereas left-wing representatives (of PSOE) males and females, are more homogenous. In a comparison between national versus regional representatives, we find that within representatives of national chambers, women over men show on average, an additional probability of 25 percent points of self-reporting preferences for additional spending in education and pensions. However, within representative members of regional parliaments, gender differences in preferences are not statistically significant. We also provide a theoretical model, which serves us to understand the effects of gender party composition on the equilibrium policies. Our model reveals that gender quotas benefit right-wing parties. Intuitively, women provide moderation to rightist parties, which in turn produces electoral advantage.
H75|The Causal Impact of Removing Children from Abusive and Neglectful Homes|This paper uses administrative data to measure causal impacts of removing children from families investigated for abuse or neglect. We use the removal tendency of quasi-experimentally assigned child protective service investigators as an instrument for whether authorities removed and placed children into foster care. Our main analysis estimates impacts on educational outcomes by gender and age at the time of an investigation. We find that removal significantly increases standardized test scores for young girls. There are no detectable impacts on the test scores of girls removed at older ages or boys of any age. For older children, we also find few significant impacts of removal on the likelihood of having a juvenile conviction, graduating from high school, enrolling in a postsecondary institution, or having a teenage birth. We investigate potential mechanisms driving heterogeneous impacts by gender and age. Our results do not appear to be driven by heterogeneous effects on foster care placement, school mobility and quality, or participation in special education programs. For girls, we find that removal significantly increases the likelihood of post-investigation criminal charges or incarceration for parents and caretakers who are the perpetrators of abuse or neglect.
H75|Retirement Choices by State and Local Public Sector Employees: The Role of Eligibility and Financial Incentives|I analyze the effects of state public pension parameters on the retirement of public employees. Using a panel data set of public sector workers from 12 waves of the Health and Retirement Study, I model the probability of retirement as a function of pension wealth at early and normal retirement eligibility and Social Security coverage in the public sector job. I find that becoming eligible for early retirement, or receiving an early-out offer, significantly increases the probability of retiring. I do not find any effect of retirement wealth levels; instead the findings are consistent with the literature on default options in defined contribution plans. These findings suggest that state legislative action to affect retirement decisions and reduce future pension costs may be most effective operating through plan eligibility rules and early-out incentives.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H75|Measuring Opportunity in U.S. Higher Education|In identifying whether universities provide opportunities for low-income students, there is a measurement challenge: different institutions face students with different incomes and preparation. We show how a hypothetical university's “relevant pool”–the students from whom it could plausibly draw–affects popular measures: the Pell share, Bottom Quintile share, and Intergenerational Mobility. Using a proof by contradiction, we demonstrate that universities ranked highly on the popular measures can actually serve disproportionately few low-income students. We also show the reverse: universities slated for penalties on the popular measures can actually serve disproportionately many low-income students. Furthermore, the Intergenerational Mobility measure penalizes universities that face relatively equal income distributions, which are probably good for low-income students, and rewards universities that face very unequal income distributions. In short, by confounding differences in university effort with differences in circumstances, the popular measures could distort university decision making and produce unintended consequences. We demonstrate that, with well-thought-out data analysis, it is possible to create benchmarks that actually measure what they are intended to measure. In particular, we present a measure that overcomes the deficiencies of the popular measures and is informative about all, not just low-income, students.
H75|De Facto or De Jure? Ethnic Differences in Quit Responses to Legal Protections of Medical Marijuana Dispensaries|This paper studies the impact of legal medical marijuana markets on the decision to quit marijuana use.

Geographic and temporal variation in the presence of de facto and de jure legalized markets serve to identify their impact on quitting. Although we find little robust evidence that quitting by females is impacted by either the presence or protection of retail medical marijuana dispensaries, our results reveal significant and ethnically differentiated responses by males.

H75|Political Parties Do Matter in U.S. Cities ... For Their Unfunded Pensions|This paper studies the biggest fiscal challenge currently facing many U.S. cities, namely public-sector pension obligations. Employing a regression discontinuity design (RDD), it tests whether the mayor’s party impacts a city’s public-sector pensions. Pension benefits are shown to grow faster under Democratic-party mayors, while contribution payments simultaneously fall behind. Previous research showed that parties do not matter in U.S. cities for a wide range of fiscal expenditure types, purportedly because voters impose fiscal discipline. This paper shows that parties can matter when expenditures benefit a narrow interest group and are difficult to observe for tax payers.
H75|Can Successful Schools Replicate? Scaling Up Boston’s Charter School Sector|Can schools that boost student outcomes reproduce their success at new campuses? We study a policy reform that allowed effective charter schools in Boston, Massachusetts to replicate their school models at new locations. Estimates based on randomized admission lotteries show that replication charter schools generate large achievement gains on par with those produced by their parent campuses. The average effectiveness of Boston’s charter middle school sector increased after the reform despite a doubling of charter market share. An exploration of mechanisms shows that Boston charter schools reduce the returns to teacher experience and compress the distribution of teacher effectiveness, suggesting the highly standardized practices in place at charter schools may facilitate replicability.
H75|Federalizing Benefits: The Introduction of Supplemental Security Income and the Size of the Safety Net|In 1974, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) federalized cash welfare programs for the aged, blind, and disabled, imposing a national minimum benefit. Because of pre-existing variation in generosity, SSI differentially raised payment levels in states below its benefit floor, but had no effect in states that paid above it. We show that SSI increased disability participation in states with the lowest pre-SSI benefits, but shrank non-disability cash transfer programs. For every four new SSI recipients, three came from other welfare programs. Each dollar of per capita SSI income increased total per capita transfer income by just over 50 cents.
H75|Private vs. Public Provision of Social Insurance: Evidence from Medicaid|Public health insurance benefits in the U.S. are increasingly provided by private firms, despite mixed evidence on welfare effects. We investigate the impact of privatization in Medicaid by exploiting the staggered introduction of county-level mandates in Texas that required disabled beneficiaries to switch from public to private plans. Compared to the public program, which used blunt rationing to control costs, we find privatization led to improvements in healthcare—including increased consumption of high-value drug treatments and fewer avoidable hospitalizations—but also higher Medicaid spending. We conclude that private provision can be beneficial when constraints in the public setting limit efficiency.
H75|The Impacts of Physician Payments on Patient Access, Use, and Health|We examine how the amount a physician is paid influences who they are willing to see. Exploiting large, exogenous changes in Medicaid reimbursement rates, we find that increasing payments for new patient office visits reduces reports of providers turning away beneficiaries: closing the gap in payments between Medicaid and private insurers would reduce more than two-thirds of disparities in access among adults and would eliminate disparities among children. These improvements in access lead to more office visits, better self-reported health, and reduced school absenteeism. Our results demonstrate that financial incentives for physicians drive access to care and have important implications for patient health.
H75|College Remediation Goes Back to High School: Evidence from a Statewide Program in Tennessee|Many U.S. students arrive on college campus lacking the skills expected for college-level work. As state leaders seek to increase postsecondary enrollment and completion, public colleges have sought to lessen the delays created by remedial course requirements. Tennessee has taken a novel approach by allowing students to complete their remediation requirements in high school. Using both a difference-in-differences and a regression discontinuity design, we evaluate the program’s impact on college enrollment and credit accumulation, finding that the program boosted enrollment in college-level math during the first year of college and allowed students to earn a modest 4.5 additional college credits by their second year. We also report the first causal evidence on remediation's impact on students' math skills, finding that the program did not improve students’ math achievement, nor boost students’ chances of passing college math. Our findings cast doubt on the effectiveness of the current model of remediation—whether in high school or college—in improving students’ math skills. They also suggest that the time cost of remediation—whether pre-requisite or co-requisite remediation—is not the primary barrier causing low degree completion for students with weak math preparation.
H75|How Well Do Doctors Know Their Patients? Evidence from a Mandatory Access Prescription Drug Monitoring Program|Many opioid control policies target the prescribing behavior of health care providers. In this paper, we study the first comprehensive state-level policy requiring providers to access patients' opioid history before making prescribing decisions. We compare prescribers in Kentucky, which implemented this policy in 2012, to those in a control state, Indiana. Our main difference-in-differences analysis uses the universe of prescriptions filled in the two states to assess how the information provided affected prescribing behavior. As many as forty percent of low-volume opioid prescribers stopped prescribing opioids altogether after the policy was implemented. Among other providers, the major margin of response was to prescribe opioids to approximately sixteen percent fewer patients. While providers disproportionately discontinued treating patients whose opioid histories showed the use of multiple providers, there were also economically-meaningful reductions for patients without multiple providers and single-use acute patients.
H75|Oakland’s Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Tax: Impacts on Prices, Purchases and Consumption by Adults and Children|Several cities in the U.S. have implemented taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in an attempt to improve public health and raise revenue. On July 1, 2017, Oakland California introduced a tax of one cent per ounce on SSBs. In this paper, we estimate the impact of the tax on retail prices, product availability, purchases, and child and adult consumption of taxed beverages in Oakland, as well as of potential substitute beverages. We collected data from Oakland stores and their customers and a matched group of stores in surrounding counties and their customers. We collected information in the months prior to the implementation of the tax and again a year later on: (1) prices, (2) purchase information from customers exiting the stores, and (3) a follow-up household survey of adults and child beverage purchases and consumption. We use a difference-in-differences identification strategy to estimate the impact of the tax on prices, purchases, and consumption of taxed beverages. We find that roughly 60 percent of the tax was passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. There was a slight decrease in the volume of SSBs purchased per shopping trip in Oakland and a small increase in purchases at stores outside of the city, and we find some evidence of increased shopping by Oakland residents at stores outside of the city. We do not find evidence of substantial changes in the overall consumption of SSBs or of added sugars consumed through beverages for either adults or children after the tax.
H75|Cross-country evidence on the impact of decentralisation and school autonomy on educational performance|How do administrative and fiscal decentralisation relate to education system performance? The question is answered by exploiting a panel with several different measures of fiscal decentralisation: a measure of administrative decentralisation, as well as a measure of school autonomy (using six waves of PISA). These measures are related to educational outcomes, measured by PISA score country averages. The panel includes year fixed effects and multiple country covariates. Overall, a positive relationship is found linking administrative and fiscal decentralisation with performance, as measured by PISA tests. School autonomy is also positively related with educational outcomes, strengthening the estimated effects of administrative and fiscal decentralisation.
H75|The impact of decentralisation on the performance of health care systems: A non-linear relationship|This paper examines the relationship between the degree of administrative decentralisation across levels of government in health care decision-making and health care spending, life expectancy as well as hospital costs. This empirical analysis builds on previous analytical research carried out by the OECD (Lorenzoni, Murtin et al., 2018; Lorenzoni and Marino, 2017), both of which established new methodological tools to analyse health sector performance. The present analysis extends this framework to examine the impact of centralisation versus decentralisation of responsibilities across levels of government, making use of newly collected data on governance and expenditure assignment, as well as non-linear empirical specifications.
H75|Decentralisation and performance measurement systems in health care|Based on an OECD survey, this paper presents quantitative and qualitative data on the decentralisation of health systems, focusing on how they vary according to different institutional characteristics and what types of performance measurement systems are used in the health sector. Decision-making in health care tends to rest largely with the central government, which has considerable power across many aspects of the delivery of health services. However, sub-national governments have more control over decisions regarding the inputs, outputs and monitoring of health care services. The majority of OECD countries tends to rely on centralised performance measurement systems, especially to monitor the performance of hospital providers, focusing more on improving performance rather than reducing service costs. Less likely to be monitored under a specific performance framework are providers of ancillary services, retailers and other providers of medical goods, and providers of preventive care.
H75|The impact of civil society and governance on poverty: Are there differences between the North and East Africa region?|This article attempts to study the impact of civil society and governance on poverty. In this work, we have tried to answer the following questions: what is the effect of civil society and governance on poverty in the region of North and East Africa? In this framework, the basic assumption was the existence of a direct and indirect effect of civil society and the quality of governance in reducing poverty. The study of this hypothesis was formulated in a static model applied to data available on the region of North and East Africa between 1996-2016. The results of our regressions show that civil society, has a positive effect in reducing poverty in East Africa, but negative in North Africa and the political and legal indicators, has a positive effect on poverty in the East African countries and administrative indicators, has a positive effect in North Africa. This result implies that civil society and governance quality factors play an important role in reducing poverty in East Africa as North Africa. The relationship between civil society, governance and poverty varies according to the stage of development. But notes significant differences between the region of North Africa and East. This supports our contention that civil society and governance has more impact on poverty in the East African region, the poorest than in the rich region of North Africa. For example, the relationship between civil society and poverty is positive and significant for East Africa, is negative and significant in North Africa. The relationship between governance (policy and legal indicators) and poverty is positive and significant for East Africa, but in North Africa only administrative indicators have a positive effect on poverty. This supports our claim that governance has more impact on poverty than civil society.
H75|Gasto Público Social, Gobernanza y Desarrollo Humano: Una Aplicación con Datos Municipales de Bolivia: 1994-2008<BR>[Social Public Expenditure, Governance and Human Development: An Application with Municipal Data of Bolivia: 1994-2008]|In this opportunity, we analyze the relationship among public social spending, governance and human development based on cross-sectional sample of data from more than 300 municipalities of Bolivia. Considering the municipal statistical information, we estimate a multiple linear regression model with instrumental variables, using least squares in two stages. We have instrumentalized the public social expenditure variable through an efficiency government index (governance). In the first stage, we have found that government efficiency explains the differences in total social public expenditure per capita executed between 1997 and 2005. In the second stage, we find a positive effect of total social public expenditure per capita executed between 1997 and 2005 on human development, measured in 2005. Therefore, estimates reveal that higher levels of social public spending tend to generate a higher level of human development in municipalities where government efficiency is higher. In quantitative terms, the results reveal that, keeping the rest of the variables constant and considering the importance of government efficiency, if the total social public expenditure per capita executed during 1997 to 2005 had increased by Bs 100 per capita, then human development measured in 2005, it would have increased by 6.6%.
H75|Justifying the Impact of Economic Deprivation, Maternal Status and Health infrastructure on Under-Five Child Mortality in Pakistan: An Empirical Analysis|During the 1980’s child survival first time attached with biological and social factors for its determination (Mosley and Chen, 1984). Socioeconomic factors need some proximate factor to impact child survival, at that time policymakers believe that socioeconomic factors indirect impact on child survival. But maternal factors, environmental contamination, nutrient deficiency and injury have direct impact on child survival. This study has tried to justify the fact that economic deprivation, health, infrastructure and maternal status impact under-five child mortality in Pakistan over the period of 1980 to 2017. For checking the stationarity of the data, Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root test is applied. Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model has been used for examining the co-integration among the variables of the model. Granger causality test has been applied to explore the causal relationship among the variables. The estimated results show that there is a long run relationship among the variables of the model. The results of Granger causality test highlight that there is unidirectional causality is running from independent variables to the dependent variable. The findings suggest that for reducing under-five child mortality, the government of Pakistan should improve the maternal status and health infrastructure whereas economic deprivation should be minimized.
H75|How Much are Good Schools Worth? Evidence from School Acquisitions in Beijing|We utilize government sanctioned school acquisitions in Beijing to estimate individuals' willingness to pay for good schools. The spatial and temporal variation in these acquisitions allows us to estimate a hedonic pricing model in the difference-in-difference framework. We find that, when a regular school is acquired by a good school, the average housing price in its designated catchment area increases by seven percent, relative to other regular schools that are not acquired. We also find heterogeneous price effects for different types of acquisitions. In particular, the price premium is larger for fully integrated acquisitions than for partially integrated ones, and larger for vertical acquisitions than for horizontal ones.
H75|Ireland's peculiar microfinance revolution, c. 1836-1845|In the decade before the famine, Ireland experienced a boom in Microfinance Institutions (MFIs). This paper analyses the motivations of MFI proponents and practitioners, and finds evidence linking the boom in MFIs with the introduction of the poor law in 1838. Many contemporary writers saw microfinance as a complex tax avoidance/reduction scheme that could lessen the burden on rate payers by helping the poor help themselves. The link between MFIs and the poor law is confirmed by an econometric analysis of MFIs at the level of the poor law union.
H75|Understanding Access Barriers to Public Services: Lessons from a Randomized Domestic Violence Intervention|We study the effect of reducing barriers to accessing non-police services on the demand for police services in cases of police-reported domestic violence. Variation comes from a large randomized controlled trial designed to assist victims in accessing non-police services and we link information from local and national police administrative records and a survey of victims to form a unique dataset for the evaluation. The intervention led to a 18% decrease in the demand for police services, as measured by the provision of a statement by victims. Despite a strong correlation between statements and criminal sanctions against perpetrators, we do not find a corresponding effect of the intervention on perpetrator arrest, charges, or sentencing. This suggests that treated victims who do not provide a statement do so because their potential statement was relatively less effective for pursuing criminal sanctions. Consistent with this result, we find treatment group statements are significantly less likely to be withdrawn than are control group statements.
H75|Long-lasting effects of relative age at school|We investigate the long lasting effects on behaviour of relative age at school. We conduct an online incentivised survey with a sample of 1007 adults, who were born at most two months before or after the school entry cut-off date in four Australian states. We find those who were among the oldest in the classroom throughout their school years display higher self-con fidence, are more willing to enter in some form of competition, declare taking more risk in a range of domains in their life and are more trusting of other people, compared to those who were among the youngest.
H75|Do local public expenditures on sports facilities affect sports participation in Germany?|This paper analyzes the effect of local public expenditures on sports facilities on sports participation in Germany. To this end, we construct a new database containing public expenditures at the municipality level and link this information with individual level data. We form locally weighted averages of expenditures based on geographic distances since people also benefit from expenditures of neighboring municipalities. We analyze how effects of sports facility expenditures change with different expenditures levels (“dose-response relationship”) and find no effect of local public expenditures on sports facilities on the probability to practice sports. These findings are robust across different age groups and municipality sizes.
H75|Individual Labor Market Effects of Local Public Expenditures on Sports|By merging administrative data on public finances of all municipalities in Germany with individual data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, we explore whether local public expenditures on sports facilities influences individual labor market outcomes. Our identification strategy follows a selection-on-observables approach and exploits the panel structure of the data covering 12 years between 2001 and 2012. The results of our matching estimations suggest that both women and men living in municipalities with high expenditure levels benefit, exhibiting approximately 7 percent of additional household net income on average. However, this income effect is fully captured by earning gains for men rather than women living in the household. Additional analysis suggests, that these gender differences, which can also be observed in terms of working time, hourly wage and employment status, appear plausible since women in the age cohort under consideration are less likely than men to engage in sports in general and in any of the publicly funded sports facilities in particular. Moreover, improved well-being and health are possible mechanisms that determine how the positive labor market effects for men may unfold.
H75|The legacy of history or the outcome of reforms? Primary education and literacy in Liberal Italy (1871-1911)|This paper shows how historical institutions, inherited from pre-unification regional states, cast a long shadow on the evolution of literacy across the provinces of Liberal Italy (1871-1911). Although increasing local inputs into public primary schooling were associated with higher literacy, pre-unification schooling is found to be a crucial predictor of literacy in the period under study. New provincial estimates of school efficiency based on Data Envelopment Analysis suggest that pre-unification education and parental literacy were also important determinants of the success in converting schooling into literacy
H75|European Social Fund’s lifelong learning and regional development: a case study|The aim of this paper is to evaluate the first impacts of the European Social Fund (hereafter ESF) lifelong learning interventions on the regional development. As is well known, lifelong learning is defined as the all purposeful learning activity, undertaken throughout life, on an ongoing basis, with the aim of improving knowledge, skills, and competence within a personal, civic, social and/or employment-related perspective (CEC, 2000). Beyond the benefits, lifelong learning represents an advantage for the regional economy that could be measured in terms of both estimation of direct impact on domestic demand and evaluation of impacts on the performance of the local economies. The combination of these two kinds of effects generates a positive impact on a wider scale: a higher and skilled workforce attracts more investment, contributing to improve the well-being of a local economy. The case study is the Veneto region. The applied methodologies used in the case study are both a survey and an econometric model. In the first case, the utilized method approaches the topic from a microeconomic perspective, while in the second case the approach is purely macroeconomic.
H75|Impact of Early Childcare on Immigrant Children’s Educational Performance|This paper investigates the impact of attending early childcare on second generation immigrant children's cognitive outcomes. Our analysis draws on administrative data on the entire population of students in fifth grade collected by the Italian Institute for the Evaluation of the Educational System (INVALSI) for school years 2014/2015 to 2016/2017 matched to unique administrative records on the early childcare public available slots at the municipal level. Our identification strategy exploits cross-sectional and time series variation in the provision of early childcare service across Italian municipalities as an instrument for individual early childcare attendance. Our results point out that the effect of early childcare attendance differs between native and immigrant children. Although we find no effects for Italian children, our estimates show a positive and significant effect on literacy test scores for immigrant children of low educated mothers, which suggests that early childcare may be particularly relevant for immigrant children from a disadvantaged background.
H75|Laboratory Federalism with Public Funds Sharing|The theory of laboratory federalism hypothesizes that, in a decentralized multi-jurisdictional system, policies follow an evolutionary learning process with innova-tion and imitation. This paper studies the role of public funds sharing in such a setting. As a guiding framework we consider a model of decentralized, rich-to-poor redistribution with labor mobility. Uncorrected learning dynamics here lead to a drastic erosion of the welfare state. Suitably designed public funds sharing can correct this failure and may even restore e?ciency. Surprisingly, the necessary properties of the sharing scheme for e?ciency in the learning model are the same as those that make decentralized Nash play e?cient (and vice versa).Public funds sharing, thus, is a powerful corrective device in ?scally decentralizedsettings for a variety of behavioral modes of government interaction.
H75|Do-It-Yourself medicine? The impact of light cannabis liberalization on prescription drugs|This paper provides the first analysis of â€œDo-it-Yourself Medicineâ€ concerning marijuana consumption by studying the effects of the unintended liberalization of light cannabis that took place in Italy in 2016 on prescription drugs sales. Using a unique and high-frequency dataset on monthly sales of drugs and the location of light cannabis retailers and adopting a staggered DiD research design, we find that the local market accessibility of light cannabis led to a reduction in dispensed packets of opioids, anxiolytics, sedatives, anti-migraines, antiepileptics, anti-depressives and anti-psychotics. This calls for an effective regulation of the market and a proper evaluation of the use of light cannabis for medical purposes.

H75|Short-Run Health Consequences of Retirement and Pension Benefits: Evidence from China|This paper examines the impact of the New Rural Pension Scheme (NRPS) in China. Exploiting the staggered implementation of an NRPS policy expansion that began in 2009, we use a difference-in-difference approach to study the effects of the introduction of pension benefits on the health status, health behaviors, and healthcare utilization of rural Chinese adults age 60 and above. The results point to three main conclusions. First, in addition to improvements in self-reported health, older adults with access to the pension program experienced significant improvements in several important measures of health, including mobility, self-care, usual activities, and vision. Second, regarding the functional domains of mobility and self-care, we found that the females in the study group led in improvements over their male counterparts. Third, in our search for the mechanisms that drive positive retirement program results, we find evidence that changes in individual health behaviors, such as a reduction in drinking and smoking, and improved sleep habits, play an important role. Our findings point to the potential benefits of retirement programs resulting from social spillover effects. In addition, these programs may lessen the morbidity burden among the retired population.
H75|What Is the Value Added by Using Causal Machine Learning Methods in a Welfare Experiment Evaluation?|Recent studies have proposed causal machine learning (CML) methods to estimate conditional average treatment effects (CATEs). In this study, I investigate whether CML methods add value compared to conventional CATE estimators by re-evaluating Connecticut's Jobs First welfare experiment. This experiment entails a mix of positive and negative work incentives. Previous studies show that it is hard to tackle the effect heterogeneity of Jobs First by means of CATEs. I report evidence that CML methods can provide support for the theoretical labor supply predictions. Furthermore, I document reasons why some conventional CATE estimators fail and discuss the limitations of CML methods.

H75|Delayed Graduation and University Dropout: A Review of Theoretical Approaches|This paper surveys the theoretical approaches used in the literature to study the phenomenon of delayed graduation and university dropout. The classical human capital model does not contemplate failure, which the amended human capital model does. Delayed graduation and university dropout are two stages of the same decision repeated over the years to step aside or leave when the net returns to education expected ex ante are negative. Failure can also be taken as a signal of the real skills of individuals who do not succeed to gain a higher level of education. The job search approach underlines the role of positive/negative local labor market conditions as a factor able to explain choices of investment in human capital. Within the bargaining approach, the decision to delay graduation or dropout from university is related to bargaining within the family between parents and children: the former give their children better consumption opportunities in return for their presence at home. Although the amended human capital model is certainly the most compelling one, the other approaches help framing factors which are neglected in the human capital model, forming a well-structured body of knowledge to better understand the phenomenon under scrutiny, while also suggesting a set of policy tools to better control it.
H75|Associations of childhood health and financial situation with quality of life after retirement: Regional variation across Europe|Many studies have shown that childhood circumstances can have long term consequences that persist until old age. To better understand the transmission of early life circumstances, this paper analyses the effects of health and financial situation during childhood on quality of life after retirement as well as the mediating role of later life health, educational level, and income in this association. Moreover, this study is the first to compare these pathways across European regions. The analyses are based on data of 13,092 retirees aged > 60 and
H75|Does Public Pre-K Have Unintended Consequences on the Child Care Market for Infants and Toddlers?|I estimate the impact of public pre-kindergarten for 4-year-olds on the provision of private child care for younger children by considering New York City's 2014 Universal Pre-K expansion. Private child care facilities often care for children from infancy or toddlerhood through pre-K. A public option for older children could therefore affect availability, prices, or quality of care for younger children. This effect could be positive or negative depending on the structure of the child care market, the design of the public pre-K program, and parent preferences. I use a panel dataset covering all licensed child care facilities in New York City and a difference-in-differences strategy that compares changes over time for neighborhoods with more versus fewer new public pre-K sites. I estimate that the public pre-K program reduced the capacity for children younger than 2 years old at private child care centers by 2,700 seats. The entire decrease in capacity occurs in areas with high poverty, and this decline was not o set by an increase in provision in the home day care market. In complementary analysis, I find a within- center increase in public complaints and inspection violations for day care centers that are closer to new public pre-K sites, suggesting a decrease in quality due to the increased competition from public pre-K. A back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that for every seven 4-year-olds who shifted from day care centers to public pre-K, there was a reduction of one day care center seat for children under the age of 2.
H75|Matching with Waiting Times: The German Entry-Level Labor Market for Lawyers|"We study the allocation of German lawyers to regional courts for legal trainee-ships. Because of excess demand in some regions lawyers often have to wait before being allocated. The currently used \""Berlin\"" mechanism is not weakly Pareto efficient, does not eliminate justified envy and does not respect improvements. We introduce a mechanism based on the matching with contracts literature, using waiting time as the contractual term. The resulting mechanism is strategy-proof, weakly Pareto efficient, eliminates justified envy and respects improvements. We extend our proposed mechanism to allow for a more flexible allocation of positions over time."
H75|Does Ignorance of Economic Returns and Costs Explain the Educational Aspiration Gap? Evidence from Representative Survey Experiments|The gap in university enrollment by parental education is large and persistent in many countries. In our representative survey, 74 percent of German university graduates, but only 36 percent of those without a university degree favor a university education for their children. The latter are more likely to underestimate returns and overestimate costs of university. Experimental provision of return and cost information significantly increases educational aspirations. However, it does not close the aspiration gap as university graduates respond even more strongly to the information treatment. Persistent effects in a follow-up survey indicate that participants indeed process and remember the information. Differences in economic preference parameters also cannot account for the educational aspiration gap. Our results cast doubt that ignorance of economic returns and costs explains educational inequality in Germany.
H75|Natural Disasters, Public Spending, and Creative Destruction: A Case Study of the Philippines|Typhoons, floods, and other weather-related shocks can inflict suffering on local populations and create life-threatening conditions for the poor. Yet, natural disasters also present a development opportunity to upgrade capital stock, adopt new technologies, enhance the risk-resiliency of existing systems, and raise standards of living. This is akin to the “creative destruction” hypothesis coined by economist Joseph Schumpeter in 1943 to describe the process where innovation, learning, and growth promote advanced technologies as conventional technologies become outmoded. To test the hypothesis in the context of natural disasters, we look at the case of the Philippines—among the most vulnerable countries in the world to such disasters, especially typhoons. Using synthetic panel data regressions, we show that typhoon-affected households are more likely to fall into lower income levels, although disasters can also promote economic growth. Augmenting the household data with municipal fiscal data, we show some evidence of the creative destruction effect: Municipal governments in the Philippines helped mitigate the poverty impact by allocating more fiscal resources to build local resilience while also utilizing additional funds poured in by the national government for rehabilitation and reconstruction.
H75|Does a Discount Rate Rule Ensure a Pension Plan Can Pay Promised Benefits without Excessive Asset Accumulation?|The choice of discount rate makes a substantial difference to the magnitude of the assets required to ensure a pension plan is fully funded. Finance theory suggests that the discount rate should equal the default-free rate, but pension plan administrators argue for a rate equal to the long run return on plan assets. We evaluate the ability of a fully funded pension plan to meet its promised benefit payments when the plan's liabilities are determined using different discount rate-setting rules. To account for the uncertainty of the return to plan assets and future benefit payments, we employ Monte Carlo techniques and estimates using U.S. data. Due to the volatility of pension fund asset returns and payouts, to generate a high probability of meeting promised pension payments, a plan must use a discount rate that leads, on average, to the accumulation of significant assets in excess of those required to cover promised benefits. The better performing rules are a function of economic variables, such as the return on government bonds or the inflation rate. Two rules that yield a relatively high probability that pension obligations can be met, combined with the relatively low accumulation of excess assets, set the discount rate equal to a proxy for the corporate bond yield or an inflation forecast plus 3 percent. These rates are greater than the default free rate, but lower than the return on the plan portfolio.
H75|Discussion on the quality of European higher education systems using cluster analysis|The enormous increase in the number of students of higher education and transition from elite to mass and universal higher education are worldwide trends in recent years and further expansion is expected in the coming years. This situation, however, raises the need for higher expenditure on higher education and many countries have to deal with under-financing of their higher education. Involving or increasing student participation in funding is currently under discussion. From the point of view of financing are distinguished three basic higher education financing models in OECD countries which are characterized by none, smaller, or larger student co-financing. The aim of this paper is to choose appropriate indicators for describing quality of European higher education systems and with using cluster analysis to display similar higher education systems and discuss their funding. Findings of this paper indicate that models of higher education systems with multi-source funding achieve higher quality. However, there are other influences that affect the quality of higher education systems - contextual indicators, such as economic, demographic, or historical development.
H75|Aid diversion and the impact of Development Assistance for Health in a decentralized health system|The effects of foreign aid on a decentralised health system are analysed in a theoretical framework where the donor has imperfect information about the local health needs while the central and local governments do not engage in self-interested efforts upon receiving aid. I discuss the implications of conditionality of aid on local health expenditures, intergovernmental transfers and social welfare. I then examine these consequences in a health system with two levels of care when the donor restricts aid on Primary Health Care.
H75|Spending the night?. Provider incentives, capacity constraints and patient outcomes|Healthcare providers’ response to payment incentives may have consequences for both fiscal spending and patient health. This paper studies the effects of a change in the payment scheme for hospitals in Norway. In 2010, payments for patients discharged on the day of admission were substantially decreased, while payments for stays lasting longer than one day were increased. This gave hospitals incentives to shift patients from one-day stays to two-day stays, or to decrease the admission of one-day stays. I study hospital responses by exploiting the variable size of price changes across diagnoses in a difference-in-differences framework. I find no evidence that hospitals respond to price changes, and capacity constraints do not appear to explain this finding. Results imply that the current payment policy yields little scope for policymakers to affect the healthcare spending and treatment choices.
H75|Demography and Provisions for Retirement: The Pension Composition, an Equilibrium Approach|Pensions may be provided for in a modern society by several methods, viz., voluntary individual savings, mandatory fully funded occupational pension systems, and mandatory social security financed by pay-as-you-go. The specific mixture of the three systems we will call the pension composition. We assume that individual workers decide about their own individual savings, that the fully funded occupational system is decided upon by the age cohort of the median worker and that social security is decided upon by the median voter. For a given demography and interest rate the joint result of those decisions is a Pareto- equilibrium. Nowadays most of capital supply stems from individual and institutionalised pension savings. For ease of exposition we will assume that individual and collective pension savings are the only source of capital supply. When capital supply equals demand from industry there is equilibrium on the capital market with a corresponding equilibrium interest rate. In this paper we assume a demography with hundred age brackets and we investigate how changes in the birth and survival rates affect the pension composition and the capital market equilibrium. Our conclusion is that the demographic effects are considerable not only for the resulting pension composition, but also for macro-economic variables as the wage rate, the interest rate and the capital-income ratio. It follows that the pension composition in general and social security in particular is determined by the demography and cannot be used as long-term political instrument. We find that this is relevant for the present century, where birth and mortality rates in most western countries are steeply declining.
H75|An Apple a Day? Adult Food Stamp Eligibility and Health Care Utilization Among Immigrants|In this study, we document the effect of Food Stamp access on adult health care utilization. While Food Stamps is one of the largest safety net programs in the U.S. today, the universal nature of the program across geographic areas and over time limits the potential for quasi-experimental analysis. To circumvent this, we use variation in documented immigrants' eligibility for Food Stamps across states and over time due to welfare reform in 1996. Our estimates indicate that access to Food Stamps reduced the likelihood of an adult visiting a physician more than twice in one year, but had no significant effect on the likelihood of having any physician visits. This result does not appear to be due to changes in physical or mental health, or due to individuals with common chronic health conditions, leaving open the possibility that changes in nutrition or resources may reduce the need for physician visits. Additionally, we find that for single women, Food Stamps increased the affordability of specialty health care, which may have further reduced the need for physician visits. These findings have important implications for cost-benefit analyses of the Food Stamp program, as reductions in health care utilization due to Food Stamps may offset some of the program's impact on the overall government budget due to the existence of government-provided health insurance programs such as Medicaid.
H75|The Effects of Political Competition on the Generosity of Public-Sector Pension Plans|In politically competitive jurisdictions, there can be strong electoral incentives to increase the generosity of public pensions and simultaneously, to not fund them fully, in order to keep taxes low. I examine the relationship between political competition and generosity of public pensions using a panel dataset for 3,000 municipal plans from Pennsylvania for the period 2003–2013. I find that as the level of political competition in a municipality increases, pension plans become more generous but this relationship holds true only for plans run by municipal governments. A one standard deviation increase in the level of political competition is associated with an increase in the generosity of municipal plans by about 3 percent ($426–507/retiree/year) with no effect on plans run by municipal authorities. The effects of political competition are driven by municipalities that have a higher proportion of uninformed voters and are absent for defined contribution plans.
H75|Marital Property Laws and Women’s Labour Supply|In this paper, we study whether and if so how changes in the marital property law following the amendment of the Civil Code of Quebec to improve economic equality between spouses impacted household labour supply and individuals' marital decisions. We exploit detailed information on individuals' labour market and marital status from the Labour Force Survey to analyze short-term changes in labour supply and marital decisions before and after the reforms in Quebec relative to other provinces, which did not experience the changes in the marital property law over that time period. Investigating the labour supply and marital decisions' responses to a policy changing the distribution of resources between men and women may assist welfare agencies in the design of family reforms and more generally, help further reduce women's entry into poverty. Furthermore, analyzing whether the Quebec marital property law changed the demographic mix of couples may further inform policymaker about possible ways to improve gender equality.
H75|Light cannabis and organized crime: Evidence from (unintended) liberalization in Italy|This paper explores the unintended liberalization of light cannabis that occurred in Italy in December 2016 by means of a legislative gap in order to assess its effect on the illegal supply of marijuana. Although liberalization interested the entire Italian territory, in the short run, the level of intensity varied according to the pre-liberalization market configuration of grow shops, i.e., retailers that sold industrial cannabis-related products. We exploit this variation using a differences-in-differences (DID) design with a unique dataset on monthly confiscations of drugs at the province level during 2016–2018, which is matched with data on the geographical location of shops and socio-demographic variables. We find that the liberalization of light cannabis led to a reduction of up to 14% in marijuana confiscations per each pre-existing grow shop and a significant decrease in both other cannabis-derived drugs and in the number of people arrested for drug-related offences. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that forgone revenue for criminal organizations amount to at least 90–170 million euros per year. These results support the argument that the supply of illegal drugs is displaced by the entry of official and legal retailers.
H75|The Subsidy to Infrastructure as an Asset Class|We investigate the characteristics of infrastructure as an asset class from an investment perspective of a limited partner. While non U.S. institutional investors gain exposure to infrastructure assets through a mix of direct investments and private fund vehicles, U.S. investors predominantly invest in infrastructure through private funds. We find that the stream of cash flows delivered by private infrastructure funds to institutional investors is very similar to that delivered by other types of private equity, as reflected by the frequency and amounts of net cash flows. U.S. public pension funds perform worse than other institutional investors in their infrastructure fund investments, although they are exposed to underlying deals with very similar project stage, concession terms, ownership structure, industry, and geographical location. By selecting funds that invest in projects with poor financial performance, U.S. public pension funds have created an implicit subsidy to infrastructure as an asset class, which we estimate within the range of $730 million to $3.16 billion per year depending on the benchmark.
H75|Wo Pflegebedürftige häufig Sozialhilfe in Anspruch nehmen: Hilfe zur Pflege in den einzelnen Regionen|Die Anzahl der Pflegebedürftigen, die auf Hilfe zur Pflege angewiesen sind, steigt immer weiter. Auch wenn dies nicht zwangsläufig bedeutet, dass Pflegebedürftigkeit zunehmend in die Bedürftigkeit führt - denn insgesamt steigt auch die Zahl der Pflegebedürftigen - ist dies doch eine weitere Herausforderung, der die Politik begegnen muss. Betroffen sind hier vor allem auch die Träger der Sozialhilfe, die nicht auf Bundesebene angesiedelt sind: Je nach Bundesland sind unterschiedliche Träger für die Hilfe zur Pflege verantwortlich - Kreise (und damit mittelbar die Kommunen) und kreisfreie Städte, höhere Kommunalverbände wie beispielsweise die Landschaftsverbände, teilweise die Länder direkt. Allerdings ist diese Herausforderung keineswegs bundesweit gleich dringlich. Erstens variieren die Ausgaben für die Hilfe zur Pflege je nach Bundesland erheblich - und das nicht nur absolut, sondern auch pro Empfänger der Hilfe zur Pflege. Zweitens unterscheiden sich die Zahlen der Empfänger der Hilfe zur Pflege auch innerhalb der Bundesländer zwischen den einzelnen Kreisen und kreisfreien Städten - sowohl gemessen an der jeweiligen Bevölkerung als auch im Verhältnis zu den jeweiligen Pflegefallzahlen vor Ort. Angesichts dieser regional divergierenden Inanspruchnahme der Hilfe zur Pflege ist daher nicht nur der Bund, sondern in zunehmendem Maß auch die Kommunalpolitik gefragt, um gemäß der Bedingungen vor Ort die passenden Strategien zu entwickeln. Denn die Bundespolitik kann nur einheitliche Rahmenbedingungen festlegen, die je nach kommunaler Problemlage spezifischen Lösungen aber lassen sich nur durch Engagement der Beteiligten in den Regionen finden.
H75|"Stellungnahme zu einer öffentlichen Anhörung des Ausschusses für Gesundheit: zu dem Antrag ""Eigenanteile in Pflegeheimen senken - Menschen mit Pflegebedarf finanziell entlasten"" (BT-Drucksache 19/960)"|"Immer mehr Menschen nehmen die Sozialhilfeleistung ""Hilfe zur Pflege"" in Anspruch. Allerdings bedeutet das nicht automatisch, dass Pflegebedürftigkeit heute häufiger in die Bedürftigkeit führt als noch vor zehn Jahren. Denn auch die Pflegefallzahlen insgesamt sind in den letzten Jahren immer weiter gestiegen. Setzt man die Anzahl der Empfänger von Hilfe zur Pflege und die der Pflegebedürftigen insgesamt ins Verhältnis, zeigt sich, dass der Anteil der Hilfeempfänger an den Pflegebedürftigen fast konstant geblieben ist - ein Aufwärtstrend hat nicht stattgefunden. Das gilt nicht nur im bundesweiten Durchschnitt, sondern auch für die einzelnen Bundesländer - allerdings mit deutlichen regionalen Unterschieden: Waren in Hamburg in 2015 knapp ein Viertel der Pflegebedürftigen auf diese staatliche Unterstützung angewiesen, haben in Brandenburg im selben Jahr nur rund 7 Prozent diese Sozialleistung erhalten. Erkennbar ist bisher nur, dass im bundesweiten Durchschnitt insbesondere Pflegebedürftige, die in Pflegeheimen versorgt werden, Hilfe zur Pflege beziehen: So erhalten zwar ungefähr ein Drittel aller Pflegebedürftigen in Pflegeheimen ""Hilfe zur Pflege"", von einer generellen, drastischen Zunahme in den letzten Jahren kann aber auch hier nicht die Rede sein. Auch hier zeigen sich allerdings regionale Unterschiede: Insbesondere in den Stadtstaaten Berlin (45 Prozent), Hamburg (55 Prozent) und Bremen (66 Prozent), aber auch in den Flächenländern Sachsen (66 Prozent) und Schleswig-Holstein (68 Prozent) leben anteilig weniger Empfänger von Hilfe zur Pflege in Einrichtungen als im bundesweiten Durchschnitt - in Berlin werden sogar mehr Empfänger außerhalb von Einrichtungen gepflegt. Auch diese bundeslandspezifischen Anteile sind seit 2009 weitestgehend konstant geblieben und schwanken um die hier ausgewiesenen Werte. So gibt es durchaus regionale Unterschiede, aber keine deutlichen Hinweise, dass sich in bestimmten Bundesländern Probleme in der Vergangenheit massiv verschärft haben. Das heißt jedoch nicht, dass dies auch für die Zukunft gilt. Entscheidend sind hier nicht nur Faktoren wie die künftige Einkommens- und Vermögenssituation der Haushalte und ihre familiäre Situation, sondern auch die Höhe der Pflegekosten, die durch den Fachkräftemangel weiter steigen können. Aus diesem Grund ist die Politik gefordert, mindestens für Planungssicherheit zu sorgen und die Leistungen der Pflegepflichtversicherung zu stabilisieren. Denn nur so ist private Vorsorge möglich. Ob eine Pflicht zur ergänzenden Vorsorge für den Pflegefall nötig ist, kann nach dem gegenwärtigen Forschungsstand nicht eindeutig beantwortet werden. Dazu ist bisher zu wenig darüber bekannt, wie genau Menschen für den Pflegefall vorsorgen. Möglicherweise reicht eine deutliche und offene Kommunikation aus, um private Vorsorge zusätzlich zu erleichtern. Möglicherweise sind auch neue, freiwillige Formen im Bereich einer ergänzenden Vorsorge hilfreich."
H75|Die Entwicklung der Pflegefallzahlen in den Bundesländern: Eine Simulation bis 2035|Die Bundesregierung hat angekündigt, die Bedingungen in der Pflege weiter verbessern zu wollen. Allerdings hat der Bund keineswegs die alleinige Gestaltungshoheit im Bereich der Pflege. Insbesondere das Angebot an Pflegeheimplätzen und an ambulanter Pflege vor Ort wird maßgeblich durch das Handeln anderer staatlicher Ebenen beeinflusst. Länder und Kommunen haben grundsätzlich heute schon die Möglichkeit, einiges für die Situation in der Altenpflege zu tun und die Weichen für die Zukunft zu stellen. Dass deutschlandweit mit steigenden Pflegefallzahlen allein aufgrund des demografischen Wandels gerechnet werden muss, zeigt eine Simulation. Bei unverändertem Gesundheitszustand nimmt die Zahl der Pflegebedürftigen bis 2035 auf über vier Millionen zu. Selbst wenn sich die Pflegebedürftigkeit mit zunehmender Lebenserwartung in höhere Lebensalter verschiebt, müsste noch mit knapp 3,9 Millionen Pflegebedürftigen gerechnet werden. Insgesamt sind diese Ergebnisse eher als Untergrenze zu interpretieren, da hier die aktuellen Entwicklungen, die sich durch die Einführung der Pflegegrade ergeben, noch nicht eingerechnet sind. Die Simulationsrechnungen verdeutlichen zudem, dass eine wirkliche Entspannung der Lage in keinem Bundesland zu erwarten ist, alle Bundesländer müssen sich auf einen Zuwachs der Zahl der Pflegebedürftigen einstellen. Allerdings sind die Bundesländer unter anderem aufgrund ihrer spezifischen Bevölkerungsentwicklung unterschiedlich stark betroffen: Während der Anteil der Pflegebedürftigen an der Gesamtbevölkerung im wachsenden Berlin mit 3,5 Prozent konstant bleibt, steigt er in allen anderen Ländern weiter. Dieser Anstieg ist aber wiederum in den ostdeutschen Bundesländern Brandenburg und Sachsen-Anhalt mit 2 Prozentpunkten beziehungsweise Mecklenburg-Vorpommern und Thüringen mit sogar über 2 Prozentpunkten zwi-schen 2015 und 2035 vergleichsweise am stärksten. Für diese ostdeutschen Bundesländer liegt der Anteil der Pflegebedürftigen an der Gesamtbevölkerung in 2035 mit 7,3 Prozent (Mecklenburg-Vorpommern) beziehungsweise 6,8 Prozent (Brandenburg und Thüringen) und 6,7 Prozent (Sachsen-Anhalt) deutschlandweit am höchsten - in Hamburg (3,8 Prozent), Bayern (3,9 Prozent) und Baden-Württemberg (4,3 Prozent) hingegen am niedrigsten. Deshalb ist schon heute darüber nachzudenken, wie dieser Anstieg an Pflegefallzahlen bewältigt werden kann. In der Pflicht sind dabei neben dem Bund auch die Bundesländer zusammen mit ihren Kommunen, um den jeweiligen regionalen Herausforderungen in diesem Bereich zu begegnen.
H75|Inequality of educational opportunities and the role of learning intensity: Evidence from a quasi-experiment in Germany|Over the 2000s, many federal states in Germany shortened the duration of secondary school by one year while keeping the curriculum unchanged. Exploiting quasi-experimental variation due to the staggered introduction of this reform allows me to identify the causal effect of increased learning intensity on Inequality of Educational Opportunity (IEOp), the share in educational outcome variance explained by predetermined circumstances beyond a student's control. The reform-induced increase in learning intensity had no short-term effect on IEOp. In the medium term, however, IEOp increased as differences in parental resources gained importance through support opportunities like private tuition adapting to the intensified educational process. The effect is stronger for mathematics/science than for reading, implying the existence of subject-dependent curricular flexibilities. My findings point to the importance of accounting for distributional consequences when evaluating reforms aimed at increasing the efficiency of educational systems and to the role of learning intensity for explaining changes in educational opportunities influencing social mobility.
H75|The Italian healthcare system: the difficult balance between budget sustainability and the quality of services in Regions subject to Financial Recovery Plan|In this work we analyse the developments that necessitated the adoption of Financial Recovery Plans (Piani di Rientro) for the healthcare systems of some Italian regions and how these plans evolved over time. We look at the measures adopted by the eight Italian regions that were obliged to adopt a Financial Recovery Plan as well as their implications for healthcare infrastructures. We examine service quality and waiting times as well as patient mobility in the eight regions, including by comparison with Italy’s other regions. Our results show that the plans achieved mixed economic results: they were effective in nudging Piedmont, Sicily and Campania towards a balanced budget, but Lazio, Molise and Calabria still suffer from deficits, even substantial ones. The improvement in service quality was even more mixed. While quality did improve in all the regions that adopted a plan, only Piedmont was able to guarantee the national minimum standard of service quality over time, while Calabria and Campania were never able to meet this standard.
H75|¿Quiénes son los docentes en Colombia? Características generales y brechas regionales|Este documento presenta una descripción detallada de los docentes del sector oficial en Colombia, haciendo especial énfasis en las marcadas brechas regionales. El análisis se basa en registros oficiales del Ministerio de Educación Nacional, que incluyen información detallada de todos los docentes oficiales del país. Además, se miden las habilidades académicas de los docentes a través de los puntajes que estos obtuvieron en las pruebas SABER 11, cuando eran estudiantes de bachillerato. Los resultados indican que, así como hay importantes diferencias entre instituciones educativas urbanas y rurales, aquellas ubicadas en municipios pequeños (no certificados) y regiones periféricas también enfrentan grandes dificultades para atraer y retener buenos docentes. Esto se ve reflejado tanto en la menor formación y las bajas habilidades académicas de los docentes como en la alta provisionalidad de la planta. Estas características están, a su vez, fuertemente correlacionadas con el desempeño de los alumnos en todos los niveles. **** ABSTRACT: This paper presents a comprehensive description of public school teachers in Colombia, with a particular emphasis on regional gaps. Our analysis is based on administrative records from the Ministry of Education, which contain detailed information on all public school teachers in the country. Additionally, we match teachers' records to the high school national exit exam (SABER 11) to obtain a measure of their academic skills. Results indicate that, while urbanrural gaps are important, they are not the only sources of regional inequality. Schools located in small (uncertified) municipalities and peripheral regions also face great difficulties to attract and retain highly skilled teachers. This is reflected in the teachers' educational attainment and test scores, and also in the share of provisional appointments. These characteristics are, in turn, strongly correlated with students' performance at all levels.
H75|Resource Transfers to Local Governments: Political Manipulation and Household Responses in West Bengal|We study how political support of household heads respond to receipt of different private and public good benefits delivered by local governments, and whether upper level governments respond strategically by manipulating program budgets to lower level government in West Bengal, India. We exploit redistricting of electoral boundaries by a non-partisan Election Commission, a plausibly exogenous shock to political competition. Consistent with a model of politically motivated allocation, private recurring benefit programs contracted (resp. expanded) in villages redistricted to more competitive constituencies when bottom and upper tier governments were controlled by opposing (resp. same) parties. The resulting changes in household benefit flows help predict household political support, which in turn rationalize the inter-village targeting patterns. The results illustrate the tendency for political parties to manipulate transfers across constituencies in the absence of formula-based grants to local governments, and more generally for political incentives to focus on delivery of short-term private benefits rather than one-time benefits or public goods consistent with theories of political clientelism.

H75|Medical marijuana laws and mental health in the United States|The consequences of legal access to medical marijuana for individual welfare are a matter of controversy. We contribute to the ongoing discussion by evaluating the impact of the staggered introduction and extension of medical marijuana laws across US states on self-reported mental health. Our main analysis is based on BRFSS survey data from more than six million respondents between 1993 and 2015. On average, we find that medical marijuana laws lead to a reduction in the self-reported number of days with mental health problems. Reductions are largest for individuals with high propensities to consume marijuana for medical purposes and people who are likely to suffer from chronic pain. Moreover, the introduction of prescription drug monitoring programs lead to a reduction in bad mental health days only in states that allow medical marijuana.
H75|Fiscal and Education Spillovers from Charter School Expansion|The fiscal and educational consequences of charter expansion for non-charter students are central issues in the debate over charter schools. Do charter schools drain resources and high-achieving peers from non-charter schools? This paper answers these questions using an empirical strategy that exploits a 2011 reform that lifted caps on charter schools for underperforming districts in Massachusetts. We use complementary synthetic control instrumental variables (IV-SC) and differences-in-differences instrumental variables (IV-DiD) estimators. The results suggest greater charter attendance increases per-pupil expenditures in traditional public schools and induces them to shift expenditure from support services to instruction and salaries. At the same time, charter expansion has a small positive effect on non-charter students' achievement.
H75|The Political Cycle of Road Traffic Accidents|Road traffic accidents often mean lost productivity and medical expenditures. We explain trends in traffic accidents as a function of the political cycle using municipal data from Italy. We show that during municipal election years, the accident rate increases by 2.2%, with a 2.5% increase in the injury rate but no effect on the fatality rate. The effects are stronger in the two quarters prior the quarter in which the election is held, when the electoral campaign is intense, and in the second quarter after the election, when the elected mayor takes office. We argue that this is the result of a decrease in ticket rates during election years, as the expenditures on traffic police increase. Our results are robustly driven by the municipal political cycle defined in different ways, and their magnitude and direction are not explained by spillover effects between municipalities. Proximity to a national police station reduces the impact of local elections on injury rates.
H75|Patient vs. Provider Incentives in Long Term Care|How do patient and provider incentives affect mode and cost of long-term care? Our analysis of 1 million nursing home stays yields three main insights. First, Medicaid-covered residents prolong their stays instead of transitioning to community-based care due to limited cost-sharing. Second, nursing homes shorten Medicaid stays when capacity binds to admit more profitable out-of-pocket payers. Third, providers react more elastically to financial incentives than patients, so moving to episode-based provider reimbursement is more effective in shortening Medicaid stays than increasing resident cost-sharing. Moreover, we do not find evidence for health improvements due to longer stays for marginal Medicaid beneficiaries.
H75|Praxiserfahrungen mit den Befreiungsvorschriften des Kleinanlegerschutzgesetzes|Dieser Forschungsbericht untersucht die Auswirkungen der im Sommer 2015 eingeführten Befreiungsvorschriften des Kleinanlegerschutzgesetzes. Durch eine stärkere Regulierung soll das Kleinanlegerschutzgesetz für mehr Transparenz für Anlegerinnen und Anleger auf dem grauen Kapitalmarkt sorgen. Das Gesetz beinhaltet jedoch auch Ausnahmeregelungen. Diese entbinden sowohl Unternehmen, die sich über Crowdinvesting-Plattform finanzieren, als auch soziale, gemeinnützige und kirchliche Projekte von der Pflicht einer Prospekterstellung bei dem Angebot von Vermögensanlagen. Grundlage der Untersuchung dieser Ausnahmeregelungen ist die Crowdinvesting-Datenbank, eine Befragung unter sozialen und gemeinnützigen Organisation sowie Expertengespräche. Zusammenfassend lassen sich rund ein Jahr nach Einführung des Kleinanlegerschutzgesetzes keine starken Effekte für den Markt für Schwarmfinanzierungen in Deutschland erkennen. Die von uns analysierten Daten zeigen auch, dass sich das Anlageverhalten durch die neu eingeführte Pflicht zur Selbstauskunft über das Einkommen und Vermögen der Investierenden nicht verändert hat. Allerdings haben sich die bei Schwarmfinanzierungen verwendeten Vermögensanlagen in den letzten Jahren weg von stillen Beteiligungen und hin zu partiarischen Darlehen und Nachrangdarlehen entwickelt. Im Bereich sozialer und gemeinnütziger Projekte finden die geschaffenen Ausnahmeregelungen so gut wie keine Anwendung, da andere Regelungen eine wesentlich einfachere Entbindung von der Prospektpflicht ermöglichen.
H75|Décentralisation, compétences partagées, compétences exclusives : Proposition méthodologique appliquée à l’école obligatoire|Dans la plupart des pays décentralisés ou fédéralistes, la question de la répartition des compétences « exclusives » ou « partagées » ne reçoit le plus souvent pas une réponse satisfaisante parce qu’elle est mal posée. Partage ou exclusivité sont confus parce que les contenus des attributions respectives à chaque (niveau de) gouvernement ne sont pas délimités avec suffisamment de précision. Il en résulte des situations d’excès ou de disette dans la production d’un service mal délimité. On peut résoudre ce problème en désagrégeant la fonction de production d’une compétence à partager, en identifiant les composants de cette fonction de production et en attribuant de manière exclusive la responsabilité de chaque composant à un seul niveau de gouvernement, tout en maintenant la cohérence globale de l’offre. On a alors bel et bien un partage de compétence, prise dans sa globalité, mais une exclusivité d’action sur ses composantes, chaque élément constitutif (ou intrant) d’une compétence étant attribué de manière unique à un seul niveau de gouvernement. C’est la démarche proposée dans cette contribution en utilisant une méthode fondée sur une matrice de décentralisation, en prenant l’exemple de la scolarité obligatoire.
H75|Un modelo para evaluar el sistema pensional colombiano|Este documento presenta el Modelo Pensional de Asofondos (MPA) y sus principales resultados. Inicialmente, se hace una revisión de las variables demográficas, macroeconómicas y del sistema pensional que utiliza el modelo y cada uno de los supuestos que se hacen sobre estas. Posteriormente, se explica en detalle cada una de las fases que componen el modelo, para terminar con las simulaciones de las variables más relevantes del sistema pensional colombiano en caso de no cambiar la normativa vigente. Con esto se encuentra que, dada la actual normatividad y regulación, solo el 27% de la población en edad de jubilación tendrá una pensión en 2055. De ese porcentaje el 85% correspondería a pensiones por el Régimen de Ahorro Individual con Solidaridad (RAIS), incluyendo las obtenidas por Fondo de Garantía de Pensión Mínima (FGPM), y el 15% restante correspondería al Régimen de Prima Media (RPM). Sería deseable que otras instituciones, públicas y privadas, documenten sus modelos de evaluación y predicción de las políticas de protección social en el país.

H75|Caracterización y estimación del mercado ilegal de juegos de suerte y azar en Colombia. Informe final|Este es el informe final que integra las fases cuantitativa y cualitativa del estudio. Se presenta la caracterización del mercado legal, la aproximación al tamaño del mercado total e ilegal de juegos de suerte y azar y la descripción de las fuentes de información y la metodología utilizada. En la caracterización del mercado legal se describe la estructura de mercado, el empleo generado, los ingresos brutos por tipo de juego y el recaudo tributario por derechos de explotación. Igualmente, se realiza la caracterización de la ilegalidad discriminada por modalidad de juego y por región. Incluye además una comparación con otros 4 mercados de JSA. Por último, en el documento se desarrollan secciones en las que se describe la relación de la ilegalidad en los JSA con otras prácticas delictivas y se realiza una aproximación al contrabando de METs y sus partes o accesorios. Como anexo, se presenta el estudio de la evolución histórica de los JSA en Colombia. Este trabajo está dividido en 3 partes, en la primera se realizó un trabajo de campo con 54 entrevistas a profundidad con actores del mercado legal e ilegal de juegos de azar a nivel nacional y territorial. Segundo, se estimó la magnitud del mercado ilegal a partir del cálculo del mercado total para chance, loterías, Súper Astro, apuestas deportivas y máquinas electrónicas tragamonedas (METs), y para las ciudades de Bogotá, Medellín, Cali, Cartagena, Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Cúcuta e Ibagué. Tercero, se caracterizó el mercado ilegal y se midieron las rentas potenciales para la salud y para las finanzas nacionales y departamentales.
H75|Electoral cycle bias in the media coverage of corruption news|We investigate the existence of an ‘electoral cycle bias’ in the timing of media coverage of news with high political salience. In particular, we analyze how the electoral cycles at the regional level influence the coverage of news about corruption scandals in the Italian Regional Health Systems by two important national newspapers having opposite ideology, La Repubblica (left-wing oriented) and Il Giornale (right-wing oriented). Our findings show that Il Giornalesignificantly increases the number of articles about corruption scandals involving left-wing politicians since eight weeks before the elections, while it reduces the number of those about episodes of corruption without any political connection. On the contrary, La Repubblica increases the number of articles about episodes involving right-wing politicians only between four to eight weeks before the elections and it decreases those about no political episodes just the week right before them.
H75|The Return Expectations of Institutional Investors|Institutional investors rely on past performance in setting future return expectations, and these extrapolative expectations affect their target asset allocations. Drawing on newly-required disclosures for U.S. public pension funds, a group that manages approximately $4 trillion of assets, we find that cross-sectional variation in past returns contributes substantial power for explaining real portfolio expected returns and expected risk premia in individual asset classes. Pension fund past performance affects real return assumptions across all risky asset classes, including in public equity where the relative performance of institutional investors is not persistent. In private equity, the extrapolation of past performance is driven by stale investments. State and local governments that are more fiscally stressed by higher unfunded pension liabilities assume higher portfolio returns, both through higher inflation assumptions and higher real returns, but this factor does not attenuate the extrapolative effects. Expected risk premia in public equity, private equity, and real assets are all correlated with funds' target asset allocation. Realized past returns affect the target asset allocation through an extrapolation channel.
H75|The stimulative effect of an unconditional block grant on the decentralized provision of care|Understanding the impact of central government grants on decentralized healthcare provision is of crucial importance for the design of grant systems, yet empirical evidence on the prevalence of flypaper effects in this domain is rare. We study the decentralization of home care in the Netherlands and exploit the gradual introduction of formula-based equalization to identify the effect of exogenous changes in an unconditional block grant on local expenditure and utilization. A one euro increase in central government grants raises local expenditure by twenty to fifty cents. Adjustments occur through the number of hours as well as through substitution between basic and more advanced types of assistance. These findings suggest that conditioning of grants is not required for the central government to retain a moderate degree of control over the decentralized provision of care.

H75|New Challenges of Globalization in Pension Systems|After many years in which the social problems have been treated as an attribute of each state’s internal politics, the beginning of the third millennium marks the onset of a concentrated effort to reform the social security systems in most of the world’s states. For pension systems, the greatest common challenge is the attenuation of the demographic pressure, whose effect – on medium and long period of time – consists in the depreciation of financial sustainability of public systems and in accentuating the discrepancy between the benefits received from the public system and retired workers necessary of financial resources. In the context of European Union’s state members, the legislation on the people’s liberty and mobility domain implies the creation of a social security basic (minimal) system, which also regards aspects of pension benefits extraterritoriality. Meanwhile, the free circulation of services principle generates new problems regarding state border supervision. The last economical-financial crisis proved that, although the diversity principle allows each state member to decide on the pension system most agreeable, a certain series of common guidelines cannot be eluded, like the ones regarding investment regulation, the risk-based approach of supervising or the coordination of tax systems.
H75|When does money stick in education? Evidence from a kinked grant rule| We study the effects of intergovernmental grants on school spending within the Finnish system of high school education funding. The system allocates lump-sum intergovernmental grants to local education organizers using a kinked grant rule. Utilizing the quasi-experimental variation in grants given by the rule, we identify the effects of grants on municipal high school education expenditures. Our results indicate that grants stimulate spending while local tax rates or revenues do not seem to be responsive to grants, thus suggesting the presence of a typical flypaper effect. However, we also consider the possibility that grant responses might be heterogeneous among municipalities. Based on our heterogeneity results, the grant response is positively associated with the share of high school age population, while the higher share of elderly is related to a lower propensity to spend on education out of grant funding. This result is in line with the idea of intergenerational conflict in education spending preferences often presented in education finance literature.
H75|State disinvestment in higher education: the impact on public research universities' patent applications|While state appropriations are the largest revenue source of the U.S. public university systems, they have declined significantly over the past several decades. Surprisingly, there is little empirical work on the effect of state appropriation cuts on the research productivity of public universities. Helping fill that gap, this paper is the first to examine the role that state appropriations play in public universities’ patent production. The results suggest that state appropriation cuts have a negative impact on the number of approved patent applications from public research universities. Lower state appropriations are shown to lead to a reduction in research expenditures, especially wages and salaries paid to research staff.
H75|Valuing the Urban Hukou in China: Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design in Housing Price| This paper explores the demand side of hukou (household registration) acquisition in China by estimating the market valuation of urban hukou. According to the provisions in Jinan City’s “Acquiring Hukou by Purchasing Houses” policy, this paper uses houses slightly larger than the minimum required floor area as the treatment group, and houses slightly smaller than the minimum required floor area as the control group to perform regression discontinuity design. Empirical results show that residents’ willingness to pay for urban hukou in Jinan City was between approximately 90,000 and 126,000 yuan (RMB) in 2017. Our finding is robust to both parametric and nonparametric estimates and different model specifications. We also perform falsification tests by assuming a false policy introduction date and placebo tests based on rental data. Our analysis also offers insights for reform of the hukou system and designs for the provision of public services or welfare.
H75|Choice and Competition in the Welfare State: Home Care as the Ideal Quasi-market|We study a reform by which a standardized model of choice and competition was introduced in tax-financed home care in a majority of Swedish municipalities. The market for home care is of particular interest since it is close to the ideal quasi-market. For identification, we exploit the different timing of reform implementation across municipalities. We find that the introduction of free choice and free entry in home care increased perceived quality by about one quarter of a standard deviation without affecting costs. Since satisfaction is unrelated to the private market share, the underlying mechanism seems to be new choice opportunities rather than competition or an advantage of private providers.
H75|“Post-Truth” Schooling and Marketized Education: Explaining the Decline in Sweden’s School Quality|The Swedish school system suffers from profound problems with teacher recruitment and retention, knowledge decline, and grade inflation. Absenteeism is high, and psychiatric disorders have risen sharply among Swedish pupils in the last ten years. In this pioneering analysis of the consequences of combining institutionalized social constructivism with extensive marketization of education, we suggest that these problems regarding school quality are to no small extent a result of the Swedish school system’s unlikely combination of a postmodern view of truth and knowledge, the ensuing pedagogy of child-centered discovery, and market principles. Our study adds to the findings from previous attempts to study the effects of social-constructivist pedagogy in nonmarket contexts and yields the implication that caution is necessary for countries, notably the U.S., that have a tradition of social-constructivist practices in their education systems and are considering implementing or expanding market-based school reforms.
H75|Telemedicine and the Welfare State: The Swedish Experience|Sweden combines a vibrant market economy with a large public sector. This combination of public and private also characterizes the country’s comprehensive tax-financed welfare services. More than one-third of primary health care is today produced in the private sector. This substantial share has broad implications for how digitalization reshapes those welfare services. In this paper, we focus on how telemedicine is set to transform primary health care in Sweden, where doctors have been available via video calls on smartphone apps since 2016. The novel element in Swedish health care is that the doctors are available as a public welfare service but by private providers. With some exceptions, patients pay a small fee, but most of the cost is borne by the tax-payers. While the benefits of telemedicine are many – such as easier access to doctors and a reduction of non-essential travel – the downside for public finances is that the demand for care, and hence costs, may increase dramatically. As telemedicine becomes more popular, the tensions in regards to financing and regulation are already in evidence and look set to rise further. We outline steps that could better integrate telemedicine into the health care system.
H75|Infant Health Care and Long-Term Outcomes|This paper studies the long-term and life cycle consequences of increasing access to mother and child health care centers in the first year of life. Access to these centers increased completed years of schooling by 0.15 years and earnings by 2%. These effects were stronger for children from a low socioeconomic background and contribute to a 10% reduction in the intergenerational persistence in educational attainment. Better nutrition within the first year of life is a likely mechanism. In particular, we find positive effects on adult height, fewer health risks at age 40, and decreased infant mortality from diarrhea.
H75|Disease Control and Inequality Reduction: Evidence from a Tuberculosis Testing and Vaccination Campaign|This paper examines the economic impact of a tuberculosis control program launched in Norway in 1948. In the 1940s, Norway had one of the highest tuberculosis infection rates in Europe, affecting about 85 percent of the inhabitants. To lower the disease burden, the Norwegian government launched a large-scale tuberculosis testing and vaccination campaign that substantially reduced tuberculosis infection rates among children. We find that cohorts in school during and after the campaign in municipalities with high tuberculosis prevalence gained more in terms of education, earnings, longevity, and height following this public health intervention. Furthermore, the gains from the disease control program are not limited to the initially treated cohorts but also affect their children. The results also suggest that individuals from a low socioeconomic background benefited more from the intervention and we present new evidence that a narrowing of the gap in childhood health can lead to a reduction in socioeconomic inequalities in adulthood.
H75|Is changing the minimum legal drinking age an effective policy tool?|In year 1991 regional governments in Spain started a period of implementation of a law that rose the Minimum Legal Drinking Age from 16 to 18 years old. This process was fully completed in year 2015. To evaluate the effects of this change on consumption of legal drugs and its related morbidity outcomes, we construct a regional panel dataset on alcohol consumption and hospital entry registers and compare variation in several measures of prevalence between the treatment group (16-18 years old individuals) and the control group (20-22 years old individuals). Our findings show important differences by gender. Firstly, our main result regarding overall drinking prevalence show reductions ranging from -11.57% for the subsample including both genders to -14.31% for the subsample of males. Secondly, effects on males are driven mainly by reductions in beer with alcohol consumption (-8.98%). Thirdly, effects on wine and/or cava drinking prevalence range from -12.62% for the subsample including both genders to -9.65% for the subsample of females. No effects regarding overall smoking prevalence are found. Fourthly, we do not find evidence that these reductions in alcohol consumption are translated into hospitalizations related to alcohol overdose. To our knowledge, this is the first paper providing evidence on gender-based differences to policies aimed at reducing alcohol consumption. Our results have important policy implications for countries currently considering changes in the Minimum Legal Drinking Age.
H75|The Economic Effects of Providing Legal Status to DREAMers|This study quantifies the economic effects of two major immigration reforms aimed at legalizing undocumented individuals that entered the United States as children and completed high school: Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and the DREAM Act. The former offers only temporary legal status to eligible individuals; the latter provides a track to legal permanent residence. Our analysis is based on a general-equilibrium model that allows for shifts in participation between work, college and non-employment. The model is calibrated to account for productivity differences across workers of different skills and documentation status, and a rich pattern of complementarities across different types of workers. We estimate DACA increased GDP by almost 0.02% (about $3.5 billion), or $7,454 per legalized worker. Passing the DREAM Act would increase GDP by around 0.08% (or $15.2 billion), which amounts to an average of $15,371 for each legalized worker. The larger effects of the DREAM Act stem from the expected larger take-up and the increased incentive to attend college among DREAMers with a high school degree. We also find substantial wage increases for individuals obtaining legal status, particularly for individuals that increase their educational attainment. Because of the small size of the DREAMer population, legalization entails negligible effects on the wages of US-born workers.
H75|Are They Coming Back? The Mobility of University Students in Switzerland after Graduation|We analyze the internal mobility of university graduates in Switzerland. An empirically interesting question because not all the cantons have a university and therefore in some cantons students have to leave their home for studying but all the cantons have to bear the public costs for studying for their students irrespective of their study place. On average, approximately half of the students who had left their home canton in order to study, return to their home canton, and about half of those who do not return move onward from the canton where they studied to a third canton. Controlling for several factors explaining graduate mobility, we find that top performing students return less often than do low performers. As a consequence the home cantons, which cover the bulk of the costs also for the students that had left for studying in another canton, face a quantitative and qualitative disadvantage when losing mobile graduates.
H75|Does Ignorance of Economic Returns and Costs Explain the Educational Aspiration Gap? Evidence from Representative Survey Experiments|The gap in university enrollment by parental education is large and persistent in many countries. In our representative survey, 74 percent of German university graduates, but only 36 percent of those without a university degree favor a university education for their children. The latter are more likely to underestimate returns and overestimate costs of university. Experimental provision of return and cost information significantly increases educational aspirations. However, it does not close the aspiration gap as university graduates respond even more strongly to the information treatment. Persistent effects in a follow-up survey indicate that participants indeed process and remember the information. Differences in economic preference parameters also cannot account for the educational aspiration gap. Our results cast doubt that ignorance of economic returns and costs explains educational inequality in Germany.
H75|High on Crime? Exploring the Effects of Marijuana Dispensary Laws on Crime in California Counties|Regulated marijuana markets are more common today than outright prohibitions across the U.S. states. Advocates for policies that would legalize marijuana recreational markets frequently argue that such laws will eliminate crime associated with the black markets, which many argue is the only link between marijuana use and crime. Law enforcement, however, has consistently argued that marijuana medical dispensaries (regulated retail sale and a common method of medical marijuana distribution), create crime in neighborhoods with these store-fronts. This study offers new insight into the question by exploiting newly collected longitudinal data on local marijuana ordinances within California and thoroughly examining the extent to which counties that permit dispensaries experience changes in violent, property and marijuana use crimes using difference-in-difference methods. The results suggest no relationship between county laws that legally permit dispensaries and reported violent crime. We find a negative and significant relationship between dispensary allowances and property crime rates, although event studies indicate these effects may be a result of pre-existing trends. These results are consistent with some recent studies suggesting that dispensaries help reduce crime by reducing vacant buildings and putting more security in these areas. We also find a positive association between dispensary allowances and DUI arrests, suggesting marijuana use increases in conjunction with impaired driving in counties that adopt these ordinances, but these results are also not corroborated by an event study analysis.
H75|Abortion Laws and Women's Health|We examine the impact of progressive and regressive abortion legislation on women's health and survival in Mexico. Following a 2007 reform in the Federal District of Mexico which decriminalised and subsidised early-term elective abortion, multiple other Mexican states increased sanctions on illegal abortion. We observe that the original progressive policy resulted in a sharp decline in maternal morbidity, particularly maternal morbidity due to haemorrhage early in pregnancy. We observe small or null impacts on women's health from increasing sanctions on illegal abortion. We find some evidence to suggest that these impacts were also observed when considering maternal mortality, though effects are less precisely estimated.
H75|In-State College Enrollment and Later Life Location Decisions|State and local policymakers are very interested in how attending college in one’s home state affects the likelihood of living in that state after college. This paper uses cohort-level data from the American Community Survey, decennial censuses, and other sources to examine how birth-state college enrollment affects birth-state residence several years later. Ordinary least squares and instrumental variables estimates both suggest a statistically significant positive relationship. The preferred instrumental variable estimates suggest that a one percentage point increase in birth-state enrollment rates increases later life birth-state residence by roughly 0.33 percentage points. Implications for policy are discussed.
H75|Does the Old Age Pension Scheme Improve Household Welfare? Evidence from India|As India's population has been ageing due to declines in fertility and mortality rates, more policy emphasis has been placed on reducing poverty among the elderly. The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme (IGNOAPS) on both short and long-term household welfare indicators, such as consumption expenditure. Using the household longitudinal data based on the Indian Human Development Survey in 2004-05 and 2011-12, we have applied the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) to build a counterfactual group and have used the propensity-score weighted fixed effects model to eliminate time-invariant unobservable characteristics to estimate the effect of IGNOAPS on household welfare. The results show that IGNOAPS participation and the payments received generally reduced household poverty by increasing consumption expenditure, food and non-food expenditure. However, the results of Difference-in-Difference model imply that the poverty-reducing effect deteriorated in 2011-2012 after 2007 when a number of changes were made to programme specifications of IGNOAPS. This was likely due to the fact that some households which accessed IGNOAPS after 2007 reduced the labour supply significantly, while they did not change the level of consumption.
H75|Are Resettled Oustees from the Sardar Sarovar Dam Project Better off Today than their Former Neighbors who were not Ousted?|"The Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat is arguably the most controversial dam ever built in India, with over a 100,000 displaced people. Most ousted families in Gujarat were resettled in the late 1980s and early 1990s. All oustees were tribals—a term used in India to cover a list of tribes viewed as so backward and historically oppressed that the Indian Constitution in 1950 reserved a quota of seats in education, government jobs, and Parliamentary seats for them. The Gujarat government promised to offer each male adult in the ousted families above the age of 18 five acres of land regardless of their earlier forest holdings. Additional compensation was to be given for loss of houses and livestock. Despite the continuing opposition to the dam from influential NGOs, there is no systematic empirical study of its effects on the long-term wellbeing of the ousted families. Our study investigates: Are resettled oustees from the Sardar Sarovar Dam project better off in 2017, approximately three decades after resettlement, than their former neighbours who were not ousted? We carried out a survey of a randomly selected sample of outsted families (treatment group) and a randomly selected sample of their former neighbors who lived in high areas that would remain above water when the reservoir rises to its maximum height and therefore were allowed to stay (comparison group). We found that, despite implementation glitches, those displaced were far better off than their former forest neighbours in ownership of a range of assets including TVs, cellphones, vehicles, access to schools and hospitals, and agricultural markets. The gap in asset ownership and other outcomes between the treatment and comparison groups were often statistically larger if the heads of the household were illiterate compared to the gap if they were literate. This finding suggests that resettlement helped vulnerable groups more than the less vulnerable and that fears that resettlement will destroy the lives and life-styles of tribals have been grossly exaggerated. We also found that 54% of displaced folk wished to return to their old habitat, showing that nostalgia for ancestral land can matter more than onweship of assets and economic wellbeing. Nearby undisplaced forest dwellers were asked if they would like to be ""forcibly"" resettled with the full compensation package. Of two forest groups, 31% and 52% said yes. Clearly many, though not all, tribesfolk yearn to leave the forest."
H75|Reconciling Seemingly Contradictory Results from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment and the Massachusetts Health Reform|A headline result from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment is that emergency room (ER) utilization increased. A seemingly contradictory result from the Massachusetts health reform is that ER utilization decreased. I reconcile both results by identifying treatment effect heterogeneity within the Oregon experiment and then extrapolating it to Massachusetts. I find that even though Oregon compliers increased their ER utilization, they were sicker than Oregon never takers, who would have decreased their ER utilization. Massachusetts expanded coverage from a higher level to healthier individuals. Therefore, Massachusetts compliers are comparable to a subset of Oregon never takers, which can reconcile the results.
H75|Family Income and the Intergenerational Transmission of Voting Behavior: Evidence from an Income Intervention|Despite clear evidence of an income gradient in political participation, research has not been able to isolate the effects of income on voting from other household characteristics. We investigate how exogenous unconditional cash transfers affected voting in US elections across two generations from the same household. The results confirm that there is strong inter-generational correlation in voting across parents and their children. We also show—consistent with theory—that household receipt of unconditional cash transfers has heterogeneous effects on the civic participation of children coming from different socio-economic backgrounds. It increases children’s voting propensity in adulthood among those raised in initially poorer families. However, income transfers have no effect on parents, regardless of initial income levels. These results suggest that family circumstance during childhood—income in particular—plays a role in influencing levels of political participation in the United States. Further, in the absence of outside shocks, income differences are transmitted across generations and likely contribute to the intergenerational transmission of social and political inequality.
H75|School spirit: Legislator school ties and state funding for higher education|We explore a new mechanism to understand state funding for public colleges and universities by leveraging data on the educational experiences of state legislators, specifically if and where they received postsecondary education. Using novel, hand-collected data from 2002 through 2014, we provide comprehensive documentation – for the first time in the literature – on the educational backgrounds of state legislators. We find a statistically significant, positive association between the share of legislators who attended their states' public institutions and state funding for their entire public higher-education system. We also find a similar positive relationship between the share of state legislators who attended particular campuses of the state's public university system and funding for those campuses. This relationship is more pronounced among publicly educated legislators who represent legislative districts close to their alma mater's district, and becomes most consequential when the legislator's district contains his or her alma mater. We discuss the implications of our findings for academic studies on how politics and legislators' personal experiences influence support for higher education.
H75|The Subsidy to Infrastructure as an Asset Class|We investigate the characteristics of infrastructure as an asset class from an investment perspective of a limited partner. While non U.S. institutional investors gain exposure to infrastructure assets through a mix of direct investments and private fund vehicles, U.S. investors predominantly invest in infrastructure through private funds. We find that the stream of cash flows delivered by private infrastructure funds to institutional investors is very similar to that delivered by other types of private equity, as reflected by the frequency and amounts of net cash flows. U.S. public pension funds perform worse than other institutional investors in their infrastructure fund investments, although they are exposed to underlying deals with very similar project stage, concession terms, ownership structure, industry, and geographical location. By selecting funds that invest in projects with poor financial performance, U.S. public pension funds have created an implicit subsidy to infrastructure as an asset class, which we estimate within the range of $730 million to $3.16 billion per year depending on the benchmark.
H75|The Pass-Through of the Largest Tax on Sugar-Sweetened Beverages: The Case of Boulder, Colorado|We estimate the incidence of a relatively new type of excise tax, a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). We examine the largest such tax to date, which is two cents per ounce, in Boulder, CO. Using data that were hand-collected from stores and restaurants in both Boulder and two control communities, as well as internet data of restaurant menus, we find that the tax was largely, but not completely, passed through to consumers 5-7 weeks after implementation. Some retailers add the tax only at the register, indicating that estimates solely from posted prices would result in an underestimate of pass-through.
H75|The Impact of the Philadelphia Beverage Tax on Purchases and Consumption by Adults and Children|In this paper, the authors examine the effects of the beverage tax of 1.5 cents per ounce that was implemented in Philadelphia starting January 1, 2017.
H75|Fiscal and Education Spillovers from Charter School Expansion|The fiscal and educational consequences of charter expansion for non-charter students are central issues in the debate over charter schools. Do charter schools drain resources and high-achieving peers from non-charter schools? This paper answers these questions using an empirical strategy that exploits a 2011 reform that lifted caps on charter schools for underperforming districts in Massachusetts. We use complementary synthetic control instrumental variables (IV-SC) and differences-in-differences instrumental variables (IV-DiD) estimators. The results suggest greater charter attendance increases per-pupil expenditures in traditional public schools and induces them to shift expenditure from support services to instruction and salaries. At the same time, charter expansion has a small positive effect on non-charter students’ achievement.
H75|Patient vs. Provider Incentives in Long-Term Care|How do patient and provider incentives affect mode and cost of long-term care? Our analysis of 1 million nursing home stays yields three main insights. First, Medicaid-covered residents prolong their stays instead of transitioning to community-based care due to limited cost-sharing. Second, nursing homes shorten Medicaid stays when capacity binds to admit more profitable out-of-pocket payers. Third, providers react more elastically to financial incentives than patients, so moving to episode-based provider reimbursement is more effective in shortening Medicaid stays than increasing resident cost-sharing. Moreover, we do not find evidence for health improvements due to longer stays for marginal Medicaid beneficiaries.
H75|Social Security and Retirement Timing: Evidence from a National Sample of Teachers|This study documents an important role for Social Security income in workers' retirement timing. About 40 percent of public school teachers are not covered by Social Security. This provides an opportunity to analyze the causal impact of Social Security on retirement timing by comparing covered and non-covered teachers. Using individual-level data from the American Community Survey, we find robust evidence of higher rates of retirement among covered teachers at Social Security eligibility ages. This pattern is confirmed using an alternative regression model of participation in the teacher labor force. These estimates suggest that, should the federal government mandate full inclusion in Social Security for all public sector workers, the retirement timing patterns of newly covered teachers and other public sector workers would likely change.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H75|Integration of Migrants, Refugees and Asylum Seekers in Remote Areas with Declining Populations|This paper examines whether immigration can operate as a counter-process of depopulation and economic recession. Based on the comparative analysis of four case studies in Belluno (Italy), Klagenfurt-Villach (Austria), Dalarna (Sweden), and Haßberge (Germany), it analyses the key socio-economic factors explaining the successful integration of migrants, refugees, status holders and asylum seekers and examines under which conditions the arrival of newcomers can turn into a local development opportunity for these territories. The case studies feature four remote territories with the following common characteristics: they have undergone significant socio-economic transformations over the past decade, they face a population decline with an alarming outmigration of youth combined with an increasing ageing population, and central governments have channelled recent immigration and asylum seekers to peripheral areas to counterbalance negative demographic trends. Results show that integration paths undertaken by recipients differ significantly across the four territories. However, all case studies suggest that stable jobs and accommodations render remote and mountain localities attractive for refugees and status holders, who are usually more inclined to move to urban centres. Lastly, results from the case studies highlight the importance of designing individualised integration paths backed by social inclusion initiatives that can incite spontaneous collaborations and work relations with local inhabitants.
H75|Improving productivity and job quality of low-skilled workers in the United Kingdom|More than a quarter of adults in the United Kingdom have low basic skills, which has a negative impact on career prospects, job quality and productivity growth. Furthermore, unlike most other countries, young adults do not have stronger basic skills than the generation approaching retirement. The lack of skills development starts at young ages and continues in secondary education; despite a modest reduction in recent years, the educational attainment gap between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged students remains high. The low participation in lifelong learning of low-skilled individuals puts them at risk of falling behind in meeting the changing skill demands of the dynamic labour market. Ongoing reforms to the vocational education and training (VET) system and apprenticeship system should have a positive impact on low-skilled productivity, enabling students to gain the necessary basic skills and for workers to find quality jobs. Improving the targeting of active labour market policies, and ensuring that the ongoing increases in the national living wage are delivered in a sustainable way will also play an important role in improving job quality and reducing the high rate of youth neither employed or in education or training. Policy responses to the rise of non-standard work will also be essential in improving the job quality of the low-skilled.

H75|Policy failure and educational attainment in Indonesia|By the late 1980s, child completion of primary education was near universal in Indonesia. The country has since turned its attention to increasing access to secondary school. We examine the causal impact of two classic education policies on secondary school participation in Indonesia: compulsory schooling and spending mandates. We find that the country’s 1994 nine-year compulsory schooling initiative had no impact on child educational attainment. We also determine that Indonesia’s 2002 constitutionally-imposed education spending mandate has been ineffective in influencing secondary school enrolments. Both policies suffer from weak enforcement. Improved enforcement would be beneficial in the case of compulsory schooling. However, the major risk in the case of spending mandates is that government begins to enforce them more rigorously, as they are applied to additional sectors, thereby constraining the efficient delivery of education and other local public services.
H75|The impact of mayor-council coalitions on local government spending, service delivery, and corruption in Indonesia|This study examines the impact of majority coalitions on local government spending, service delivery, and corruption in Indonesia. The investigation finds that majority coalitions, i.e. those coalitions for which participating political parties control greater than half of council seats, cause a shift in local government spending towards health sector activities and induce improvements in citizen health service access—but only for a year or two, after which the positive effects disappear. The study shows that budget fraud starts to become problematic in the last two years of the coalition’s life. Majority coalition support for the local health spending and service agenda dissipates quickly as attention turns to corrupting the budget, via increased infrastructure outlays and associated rent-seeking. We hypothesize that budget fraud serves, in part, to finance subsequent rounds of local parliamentary and executive elections.
H75|Medicaid Benefit Generosity and Labor Market Outcomes: Evidence from Medicaid Adult Vision Benefits|Previous work suggests that Medicaid eligibility expansions may lead to declines in labor market activity. This paper explores the related, but novel question of whether variation in Medicaid benefit generosity alters employment outcomes. We consider adult vision benefits as a case study. Our findings suggest that vision benefits have a net positive effect on intensive margin measures including hours worked and occupational skill requirements, but no significant effect on the likelihood of being employed. These results indicate that Medicaid’s effect on labor market activity is sensitive to the set of covered services.
H75|Later Pension, Poorer Health? Evidence from the New State Pension Age in the UK|This paper examines the health impact of UK pension reforms that increased women’s State Pension age for up to six years since 2010. Exploiting an 11% increase in employment caused by the reforms, we show that rising the State Pension age reduces physical and mental health among women from routine-manual occupations. We show robust evidence that a larger increase in the State Pension age leads to larger negative health effects, resulting in a widening gap in health between women from different occupations. Our results are consistent with a 27% fall in individual incomes for women in routine-manual occupations.
H75|A Reevaluation of the Effects of State and Federal Dependent Coverage Mandates on Health Insurance Coverage|State governments have been passing laws mandating insurers to allow young adults to stay on their parents' health insurance plans past the age of 19 since the 1970s. These laws were intended to increase coverage, but research has been inconclusive on whether they were successful. We reconsider the issue with an improved approach featuring three key elements: a new, accurate dataset on state mandates; recognition that effects could differ greatly by age due to take up rate differences; and avoidance of endogenous characteristics when identifying mandate eligible young adults. We find the impact of the state mandates was concentrated among the 19 to 22 age group, for which dependent coverage increased sharply by about 6 percentage points. Overall coverage increased by almost 3 percentage points, with the difference explained by crowd out of public insurance. Crowd out of coverage through young adults own jobs was negligible. For those above age 22, we find little evidence of changes in coverage. We incorporate these insights into analysis of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) dependent coverage mandate, showing its effects were focused among those whom were previously ineligible for state mandates, or were eligible but older than 22. We argue the ACA's impact was broader because it had fewer eligibility conditions that implied parental dependence; young adults could be on their parents' insurance but still be relatively independent.
H75|Do the Elderly Support Public Educational Expenditure? An Empirical Analysis Focusing on the Characteristics of Spending|This paper investigates the preferences of the elderly with respect to local public educational expenditures at the kindergarten, primary school, junior high school and high school stages in Japan focusing on the characteristics of expenditures. We applied dynamic estimation method to the data of educational expenditures after the latter half of the 1990s, during which period the aging factor would have been likely to have had a negative relationship with educational expenditure. According to the estimation results, the elderly population would not support an increase in current expenditures composed mainly of personnel expenses at every educational stage but would support capital expenditures of junior high and high schools, which consists of construction costs mostly.
H75|Restricting seniority as a factor in public school district layoffs: Analyzing the impact of state legislation on graduation rates|Following the Great Recession, employment in the local education sector fell by about 364,000. This paper seeks to capture any effect of states' teacher layoff legislation on public high school graduation rates. I analyze whether state legislation that prohibits or limits the use of seniority in layoff decisions has an impact on graduation rates. I find that, all else held constant, such legislation increases the yearly growth of district graduation rates by 0.2 percentage points on average. This is economically significant, as the average yearly increase in the national graduation rate from 2010-11 to 2015-16 was 1 percentage point. When states prohibit or limit using seniority to determine a layoff order, districts must utilize other considerations such as teacher quality. In states with such legislation, teachers remaining following layoffs are likely more effective as opposed to ones in states that used seniority to determine the layoff order.
H75|A Cost-Effective and Environmentally Friendly Gaseous Waste Management|Dealing with radionuclides includes trapping the vapors and storing it for decay. However, these methods can involve considerable expense in infrastructure, manpower and monitoring. Legislation requires the presence of air filtration systems with detectors to monitor and control the release of radionuclides into the air in nuclear medicine centers. We describe a method for the treatment of gaseous waste that is economically feasible and environmentally friendly. This method complies with legislation and has the advantage of using the already existing resources in the radiopharmaceutical production facility.
H75|A nyugdíjrendszer helyzete és finanszírozhatósága<BR>[The situation and the financial viability of the pension system]|As a result of the demographic processes, one of the major challenges facing aging societies is to ensure long-term and sustainable funding for old-age care. The Hungarian pension system is basically stagnating, and the political competition focuses only on welfare corrections, shattering the real and increasingly threatening threats. In recent years, however, several detailed studies and analyses have been published, which, according to internationally accepted norms of economics, anticipate the gradual lack of the Hungarian pension system. The analysis covers the following topics: legal and institutional background, retirement demographics, real value of pensions, reforms and problems affecting the pension system (private pension funds, reduced retirement opportunities, raising age pension fund ceiling, one-person personal income), pension funding and institutional system.
H75|The Unexpected Effects of No Pass, No Drive Policies on High School Education|Since 1988, 27 states have introduced No Pass, No Drive laws, which tie a teenager’s ability to receive and maintain a driver’s license to various school-related outcomes -- most commonly, enrollment and attendance. Truancy-Based No Pass, No Drive policies target only attendance – teens that fail to meet a minimum attendance requirement lose their driver’s license. However, these policies allow students to drop out of school without facing this penalty. These policies increase the annual dropout rate by between 32 and 45 percent (1.4 to 2 percentage points). Enrollment-Based No Pass, No Drive policies, the largest group of policies, which target both enrollment and attendance, have negligible effects on dropout rates, but decrease the Averaged Freshman Graduation Rate (AFGR) by more than one percentage point. However, this lower graduation rate stems from students delaying their dropout decision by up to two years. As a result, these students are retained in the ninth and tenth grades, increasing ninth grade enrollment by 2.8 percent relative to eighth grade enrollment the year prior; this causes an artificial reduction in the graduation rate, rather than a reduction in the true likelihood that a student will graduate.
H75|Inclusive Growth and Macroeconomic Situations in South Asia: An Empirical Analysis|Inclusive growth is the main target of development economics, although developing countries have accelerated their overall economic growth but with less inclusiveness. This article has observed the impact of macroeconomic situation on inclusive growth in South Asia (Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh) over the period of 1991 to 2014. This article has used panel autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL), the unit root issue of the variables is checked with the help of Levin, Lin & Chu t*, ADF - Fisher Chi-square, Im, Pesaran and Shin W-stat and PP-Fisher Chi-square unit root tests. The results of the study show that per capita income and level of education are reducing inclusiveness in South Asia. The study points out that macroeconomic situations, population growth and female labor force are promoting inclusive growth. The study recommends that for higher inclusive growth, South Asian countries would enhance level education, per capita income, female share in labor markets and control population growth with stable macroeconomic situations.
H75|Political Representation and Effects of Municipal Mergers| We study the effects of municipal mergers using novel geocoded data on public sector jobs, housing transactions and local politiciansâ€™ place of residence. We find that total municipal expenditures evolve in the same way on average in merged municipalities as in the control group of hypothetical mergers that did not take place. These findings hide substantial heterogeneity within the mergers. Those municipalities that gained only weak political representation in the new post-merger council experience a substantial reduction in local public jobs in administration, and health and social care sectors relative to the municipalities in the same merger that were more strongly represented. This result implies that the mergers had an effect on the within merger spatial distribution of municipal services. However, we do not find conclusive evidence concerning welfare effects. This might be explained by a distance-quality trade-off related to these services.
H75|Developing Inclusive Communities: Challenges and Opportunities for Mixed-Income Housing|"Over the past decade, housing costs have risen faster than incomes. The need for affordable rental housing has well outpaced the number of available units as well as funding allocations at the federal level. Local regulation and land use policies that increase the cost of subsidized, mixed-income housing construction and preservation have contributed to the affordability problem. {{p}} To meet the affordable housing needs in U.S. communities, innovation, creativity, and ""out of the box"" thinking may be required, particularly as it relates to reducing the rapidly increasing costs of development. Another consideration is pursuing mixed-income development, as it is more financially sustainable than low-income housing. Mixed-income neighborhoods are also desirable as they can lead to substantially better outcomes for families because the higher disposable incomes of a broader economic mix of families attract additional private investment, amenities, and opportunities. {{p}} This discussion paper explores new ideas about how affordable housing in an economically integrated, mixed-income community setting could be developed and operated in an environment of declining government subsidies. Based on interviews with housing stakeholders in Atlanta, Georgia, Jacksonville, Florida, and Nashville, Tennessee, we have compiled ideas that could be scalable and replicable and could result in substantial cost savings without compromising mission, integrity, performance, or accountability. Specific suggestions include standardizing qualifying income targets and other standards imposed by funders and reducing building and permitting barriers to development, such as limited zoning for multifamily housing and regulations limiting wood frame construction. More generally, participants thought existing stakeholders could better address the underlying political environment by creating a unified constituency to advocate for more mixed-income communities. These ideas and lessons learned from the mixed-use, mixed-income revitalization experience may inform and assist cities in rebuilding or enhancing their urban core."
H75|Losing Public Health Insurance: TennCare Disenrollment and Personal Financial Distress|A main goal of health insurance is to smooth out the financial risk that comes with health shocks and health care. Nevertheless, there has been relatively sparse evidence on how health insurance affects financial outcomes. The few studies that exist focus on the effect of gaining health insurance. This paper explores the effect of losing public health insurance on measures of individual financial well-being. In 2005, the state of Tennessee dropped about 170,000 individuals from Medicaid, resulting in a plausibly exogenous shock to health insurance status. Both across- and within-county variation in the size of the disenrollment is linked with individual-level credit risk score and debt data to identify the effects. The results suggest that the disenrollment resulted in a 1.73 point decline in credit risk scores for the median individual in Tennessee. There is also evidence of increases in the amount and share of delinquent debt (90 days past due or more) and of increases in bankruptcy risk. These findings are mostly concentrated among individuals who were in relatively worse financial status before the disenrollment and suggest that there are significant negative consequences to current recipients that would need to be considered in the cost and benefit calculations around rollbacks of recent Medicaid expansions.
H75|Closing the Gap: The Impact of the Medicaid Primary Care Rate Increase on Access and Health|The difficulties that Medicaid beneficiaries face accessing medical care are often attributed to the program’s low reimbursement rates relative to other payers. There is little evidence, however, as to the actual effects of Medicaid payment rates for providers on access and health outcomes for beneficiaries. In this paper, we exploit time-series variation in Medicaid reimbursement rates primarily driven by the Medicaid fee bump—a provision of the Affordable Care Act mandating that states raise Medicaid payments to match Medicare rates for primary care visits for 2013 and 2014—to quantify the impact of physician payment on access to treatment. As Medicaid rates are set by states and vary considerably in generosity, the policy had large and heterogeneous impacts across states. We find that increasing Medicaid payments to primary care doctors is associated with improvements in access, better self-reported health, and fewer school days missed among beneficiaries.
H75|Exploring health outcomes by stochastic multi-objective acceptability analysis: an application to Italian regions|This paper introduces the Stochastic Multi-Objective Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) in order to investigate the evolution of mortality rates in the Italian regions over the period 1990-2013. We propose to explore the overall outcome of health care by a Composite Index (CI) of mortality based on the combination of standardized mortality rates for seventeen different diseases. From a methodological standpoint, we propose to overcome the arbitrary of the weighting process, by using the SMAA, which is a methodology that allows to rank regions considering the whole set of possible vectors of weights. Moreover, we explore the spatial segregation in health using the multidimensional generalization of the Gini index, and introducing the multidimensional generalization of ANOGI. The unprecedented use of SMAA in health sector allows to explore regional multidimensional paths beyond the order of importance given to the single dimensions. Our analysis shows that in the 24 years considered there has been no convergence path in terms of health care outcome in Italy, neither between nor within regions.
H75|Ready for Boarding? The Effects of a Boarding School for Disadvantaged Students|Boarding schools substitute school to home, but little is known on the effects this substitution produces on students. We present results of an experiment in which seats in a boarding school for disadvantaged students were randomly allocated. Boarders enjoy better studying conditions than control students. However, they start outperforming control students in mathematics only two years after admission, and this effect mostly comes from strong students. Boarders initially experience lower levels of well-being but then adjust. This suggests that substituting school to home is disruptive: only strong students benefit from the school, once they have adapted to their new environment.
H75|Give a fish or teach fishing? Partisan affiliation of U.S. governors and the poverty status of immigrants|This paper investigates how governors' partisan affiliation affects the poverty status of immigrants to the U.S. To this end, we compare the poverty outcomes of immigrants in states ruled by Democratic governors relative to the outcomes for those in states ruled by Republican governors. We employ a regression discontinuity design using the re-centered Democratic margin of victory as a running variable, to overcome the identification challenge posed by confounding factors. Consistent with the literature on partisan affiliation, we find that immigrants are more likely to get out of poverty in states with Democratic governors than states with Republican governors. Our results are submitted to a variety of robustness checks and sensitivity tests, to assess the validity of the identification strategy, and highlight conditional lame-duck effects. A formal mediation analysis reveals that the empirical results are mediated through better access to the labor market and possibly through higher wages and labor earnings for immigrants. Last but not least, we check for alternative hypotheses and potential detrimental effects for native populations.
H75|Using Machine Learning To Model Interaction Effects In Education: A Graphical Approach|Educational systems can be characterized by a complex structure: students, classes and teachers, schools and principals, and providers of education. The added value of schools is likely influenced by all these levels and, especially, by interactions between them. We illustrate the ability of Machine Learning (ML) methods (Regression Trees, Random Forests and Boosting) to model this complex ‘education production function’ using Hungarian data. We find that, in contrast to ML methods, classical regression approaches fail to identify relevant nonlinear interactions such as the role of school principals to accommodate district size policies. We visualize nonlinear interaction effects in a way that can be easily interpreted.
H75|Health effects of retirement. Evidence from Norwegian survey and register data|We investigate the relationship between retirement and health, using comprehensive measures from survey- and register data with detailed information on socioeconomic status. Using regression discontinuity at the statutory retirement age of 67, we study health in terms of depression, physical health and acute hospital admissions, with the latter observed for the entire Norwegian population. Our findings suggest that retirement leads to better physical health outcomes for individuals with low socioeconomic status, both for subjective- and objective outcomes, and to increased symptoms of depression for individuals with high socioeconomic status. Our findings highlight the importance of heterogeneity in the health effects.
H75|Health Effects of Retirement: Evidence from Survey and Register Data|Using a local randomized experiment that arises from the statutory retirement age in Norway, we study the effect of retirement on health across gender and socioeconomic status. We apply data from administrative registers covering the entire population and from survey data of a random sample to investigate the effects of retirement on acute hospital admissions, mortality, and a composite physical health score. Our results show that retirement has a positive effect on physical health, especially for individuals with low socioeconomic status. We find no retirement effects on acute hospitalizations or mortality in general. However, our results suggest that retirement leads to reduced likelihood of hospitalizations for individuals with low socioeconomic status. Finally, we show that the positive health effects are driven by reduced pain and reduced health limitations in conducting daily activities. Our findings highlight heterogeneity in the health effects across socioeconomic status and across subjective and objective measures of health.
H75|Hospital centralization and performance in Denmark - ten years on|Denmark implemented a major reform of the administrative and political structure in 2007 when the previous 13 counties were merged into five new regions and the number of municipalities was reduced from 271 to 98. A main objective was to create administrative units that were large enough to support a hospital structure with few acute hospitals in each region and to centralize specialized care in fewer hospitals. This paper analyses the reorganization of the somatic hospital sector in Denmark since 2007, discusses the mechanisms behind the changes and analyses hospital performance after the reform. The reform emphasized an improved acute service and high quality. The number of acute hospitals was reduced from about 40 to 21 hospitals with joint acute facilities. The restructuring and geographical placement of acute hospitals took place in a democratic process subject to central guidelines and requirements. Since the reform, hospital productivity has increased by more than 2 per cent per year and costs have been stable. While the overall indicators point to a successful reform, it has also been criticized that some people in remote areas feel “left behind” in the economic development and that hospital staff are under increased workload pressure. Concurrent with the centralization of hospitals municipalities strengthened their health service with an emphasis on prevention and health promotion.
H75|Was the First Public Health Campaign Successful? The Tuberculosis Movement and Its Effect on Mortality|The U.S. tuberculosis movement pioneered many of the strategies of modern public health campaigns. Dedicated to eradicating a specific disease, it was spearheaded by voluntary associations and supported by the sale of Christmas Seals. Although remarkable in its scope and intensity, the effectiveness of the tuberculosis (TB) movement has not been studied in a systematic fashion. Using newly digitized mortality data at the municipal level for the period 1900-1917, we explore the effectiveness of the measures championed by the TB movement. Our results suggest that the adoption of a municipal reporting requirement was associated with a 6 percent decrease in pulmonary TB mortality, while the opening of a state-run sanatorium was associated with an almost 4 percent decrease in pulmonary TB mortality. However, these and other anti-TB measures can explain, at most, only a small portion of the overall decline in pulmonary TB mortality observed during the period under study.
H75|Mobility Report Cards: The Role of Colleges in Intergenerational Mobility|We characterize intergenerational income mobility at each college in the United States using data for over 30 million college students from 1999-2013. We document four results. First, access to colleges varies greatly by parent income. For example, children whose parents are in the top 1% of the income distribution are 77 times more likely to attend an Ivy League college than those whose parents are in the bottom income quintile. Second, children from low- and high-income families have similar earnings outcomes conditional on the college they attend, indicating that low-income students are not mismatched at selective colleges. Third, rates of upward mobility – the fraction of students who come from families in the bottom income quintile and reach the top quintile – differ substantially across colleges because low-income access varies significantly across colleges with similar earnings outcomes. Rates of bottom-to-top quintile mobility are highest at certain mid-tier public universities, such as the City University of New York and California State colleges. Rates of upper-tail (bottom quintile to top 1%) mobility are highest at elite colleges, such as Ivy League universities. Fourth, the fraction of students from low-income families did not change substantially between 2000-2011 at elite private colleges, but fell sharply at colleges with the highest rates of bottom-to-top-quintile mobility. Although our descriptive analysis does not identify colleges' causal effects on students' outcomes, the publicly available statistics constructed here highlight colleges that deserve further study as potential engines of upward mobility.
H75|School Infrastructure Spending and Educational Outcomes in Northern Italy|We explore whether investment in public school infrastructure affects students’ achievement. We use data on extra funding to public high schools after the 2012 Northern Italy earthquake and apply a quasi-experimental design and an instrumental variable strategy. We find that spending on school infrastructure increases standardized test scores in mathematics and Italian language, and the effect is stronger for lower-achieving students and in mathematics.These results provide evidence in favor of a positive impact of capital spending in improving the learning environment and performances of high school students.
H75|Exploring the role of ICT-Enabled Social Innovation to support the modernisation of EU Social Protection Systems: findings and insights from analysis of case studies in fourteen Member States|This report presents the results of the analysis of selected case studies on how ICT-enabled social innovations promoting social investment can contribute to the modernisation of social protection systems in the EU. The case studies are drawn from 14 different Member States and address diverse social services and policy domains. Evidence from the analysis points to the strong potential of using new approaches based on ICT-enabled social innovation to support public authorities, at various governance levels, in their efforts to improve the effectiveness and impact of social services delivery mechanisms and outreach. The analysis makes a first attempt to assess the relationship between different typologies of ICT-enabled social innovation and the broader social protection system in which they are embedded. However, more research is needed to better understand the potential impact these initiatives could have on enhancing the adequacy and sustainability of welfare systems in the EU.
H75|JRC Insights - Social Policy Innovation Series - Innovating EU Social Protection Systems through ICTs. Findings from analysis of case studies in fourteen Member States|This issue presents results from the analysis of selected case studies on how ICT-enabled social innovations promoting social investment can contribute to the modernisation of social protection systems in the EU. The selected case studies are drawn from fourteen Member States and address diverse social services and policy domains. Findings from the research show that they have made a positive contribution to transforming existing social services models, with ICT-enabled social innovation playing a crucial role, either as an enabler or game changer. The analysis illustrates examples of how ICTs can provide solutions to those global societal challenges that are adding new complexities to the delivery of social services; in particular, ICTs can help building a â€˜client pathwayâ€™ approach, with services centred on the needs of the beneficiaries. At a more operational level, the simplification and automation of procedures increases access to services and fosters a direct relationship between service providers and users. Innovative policies encouraging the development of ICT solutions for the management of social protection systems and the delivery of social services should thus be promoted; to this end, specific incentive schemes to guarantee development, sustainability and transferability of those initiatives that generate social value by leveraging on ICTs shall be identified and fostered across the EU. At the same time, high levels of digitalization in the services delivery system must be balanced with alternative channels, to ensure that the less technologically savvy are not excluded. For this purpose, it is crucial to involve citizens and relevant stakeholders right from the early stages of social policy programming, and the creation of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and partnerships with third sector organisations should be encouraged.

H75|Where's the Teacher? How Teacher Workplace Segregation Impedes Teacher Allocation in India|Social or ethnic segregation can impede the equitable allocation of public resources in developing countries. We study an under-explored dimension; the allocation of public sector teachers in India. Using a register database for 2006-12, we construct indicators for the equality of teacher allocation and workplace segregation of teachers by gender and caste within districts. While pupil-teacher ratios have improved, the equality of teacher allocation has not. We show that allocation and segregation are connected; in districts with a higher degree of initial teacher segregation, a lower share of schools met pupil-teacher norms imposed by the Right to Education Act (2009).
H75|Does Universal Preschool Hit the Target? Program Access and Preschool Impacts|This paper studies the cost efficacy of universal over means-tested (targeted) programs, taking advantage of the rich diversity in state rules governing access to state-funded preschool in the U.S. Using age-eligibility rules for identification, I find that attending a state-funded universal preschool generates substantial immediate test score gains, particularly for poor children. Gains for poor children from attending targeted preschool are significantly smaller. These findings are robust to many specification checks, and cross-state differences in alternative care options, demographics, and other key features of the program environment cannot explain the difference in attendance impacts across program types. Impacts of universal public kindergarten and universal pre-K also look substantively similar within the same data, supporting an access interpretation. Benefit-cost ratios of universal programs are favorable despite their relatively high costs per poor child.
H75|Income Support Policies for the Working Poor|This paper asks what governments in the EU Member States and some US states are doing to support workers on low wages. Using model family simulations, we assess the policy measures currently in place to guarantee an adequate disposable income to working families, taking into account minimum wages, social security contributions, taxes and cash benefits. We show that despite increased efforts over the past decade, disposable incomes of certain types of minimum wage workers still fall well below the EU at-risk-of-poverty thresholds in many countries. Single earners with dependent children are especially at risk of poverty. We discuss the options for making progress.
H75|School Choice during a Period of Radical School Reform: Evidence from the Academy Programme|Education policy worldwide has sought to incentivize school improvement and facilitate pupil-school matching by introducing reforms that promote autonomy and choice. Understanding the way in which families choose schools during these periods of reform is crucial for evaluating the impact of such policies. We study the effects of a recent shock to the English school system – the academy programme – which gave existing state schools greater autonomy, but provided limited information on possible expected benefits. We use administrative data on school applications for three cohorts of students to estimate whether academy conversion changes schools' popularity. We find that families – particularly non-poor, White British ones – rank converted schools higher on average. We investigate the likely mechanisms that could give rise to our findings. The patterns we document suggest that families combine academy conversion with home-school distance and prior information on quality and popularity as a heuristic to inform school choice.
H75|The US Unemployment Insurance, a Federal-State Partnership: Relevance for Reflections at the European Level|This paper describes the US Unemployment Insurance (UI) in particular the federal-state partnership in governance, funding and policy making. It discusses “national interest” as defined by the Federal authorities in relation to UI: income support, economic and employment stabilization and reemployment. The corresponding policy objectives might not be (fully) shared by the states and tensions and policy conflicts emerge. The paper assesses the capacity of the UI system to deliver on those nationwide defined objectives in particular during and after the Great Recession. The UI system had considerable anticyclical impact reinforced by federal intervention. The paper discusses the federal tools to influence state schemes and how they encourage the acceptance of national standards through conditional funding. During the great recession this proved to be temporarily successful for access to and duration of benefits. The often announced shift to more pro-active programs was seemingly more difficult to achieve. Recent policy proposals including those by the outgoing Obama Administration and by the Republican Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, are reviewed. The paper concludes with reflections on the relevance of the US experience for European level unemployment benefit or welfare schemes. Given the strong position of the EU member states the US Federal-State partnership could be a more pertinent reference than the highly centralised UI systems in other federal states. The relation between federation wide standards and incentives for the reform of state systems, for sustainable financing and shifts to more pro-active policies might be of interest. Finally strengthening the anti-cyclical impact through federal intervention including funding mirrors debates on the role of automatic stabilisation mechanisms in the Euro Area.
H75|Defunding women’s health clinics exacerbates Hispanic disparity in preventive care|To prevent abortions, many states have cut funding for women’s health, reducing access, including to preventive care. Merging BRFSS data with clinic locations from a network of women’s health clinics, this paper estimates the relative impact of an increase in the driving distance to the nearest clinic on preventive care. For Hispanics women, a 100-mile increase decreases the rates of clinical breast exams by 23%, Pap tests by 16% and checkups by 14%. For non-Hispanics, there are no statistically significant results.
H75|The Effect of an Increase in Lead in the Water System on Fertility and Birth Outcomes: The Case of Flint, Michigan|Flint changed its public water source in April 2014, increasing lead exposure. The effects of lead in water on fertility and birth outcomes are not well established. Exploiting variation in the timing of births we find fertility rates decreased by 12%, fetal death rates increased by 58% (a selection effect from a culling of the least healthy fetuses), and overall health at birth decreased (from scarring), compared to other cities in Michigan. Given recent efforts to establish a registry of residents exposed, these results suggests women who miscarried, had a stillbirth or had a newborn with health complications should register.
H75|The Decentralization of Social Assistance and the Rise of Disability Insurance Enrolment|Abstract Fiscal decentralization, the decentralization of government expenditures to local governments, may enhance public sector efficiency. Vertical externalities, i.e. spillovers between local and central government, could however undo part of this advantage. In this paper we estimate spillovers from Social Assistance (SA), administered by municipalities, towards central government’s Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) scheme in The Netherlands. The latter scheme saw rapidly rising enrolment rates after financial responsibility for Social Assistance was transferred from central to local government. We find that the correlation between local SSDI enrolment and the local stock of SA benefits recipients has increased significantly in the years after decentralization. We show that an increased caseload shifting from Social Assistance to Disability Insurance is the only plausible explanation for this change. Our analysis shows that, following the decentralization of Social Assistance, at least one third of the SSDI inflow was diverted from SA. This caseload shifting increased more rapidly in municipalities experiencing deficits on their SA budgets than in municipalities running a surplus.
H75|Do Incentives for Municipalities Reduce the Welfare Caseload? Evaluation of a Welfare Reform in the Netherlands|Abstract Since 2004, most municipalities in the Netherlands receive lump sum payments from the state for the payment of social assistance allowances. As municipalities had no authority to change the eligibility rules for social assistance, the effects of the welfare reform are solely due to the efforts of municipalities to decrease the number of welfare recipients. Using variation in the timing of policy changes, this paper uses a difference-in-difference approach to assess the effectiveness of the incentive for municipalities. Based on individual panel data from administrative records, we show that the high-powered scheme led to a decline of the welfare caseload of 14% up till 2008. The reform has been most effective for those with the highest welfare dependency: single mothers and singles from non-western origin. In line with standard economic predictions, the reform does not give an incentive for cream skimming: the welfare caseload declined as well for easy to place recipients as for difficult to place recipients.
H75|The Impact of Minimum Quality Standard Regulations on Nursing Home Staffing, Quality, and Exit Decisions|Abstract The regulation of nursing homes in the U.S. often includes mandates that require a minimum nurse staffing level. In this paper, we exploit new minimum nurse staffing regulations by the states of New Mexico and Vermont that were implemented in the early 2000s to determine how nursing homes responded in terms of staffing, quality, and the decision to exit the market. Our identification strategy exploits the fact that some nursing homes had pre-regulatory staffing levels near the new requirement and did not need to change staffing levels. We compare these nursing homes to a group that faced binding constraints (low-staffed) and those that were significantly over the constraint (high-staffed). Low-staffed nursing homes increase staffing levels but also use less expensive nurse types to satisfy the new standard. High-staffed nursing homes decrease staffing and use fewer contracted staff. Overall, dispersion in staffing is reduced, but we find little effect by pre-regulatory staffing level on non-staffing measures of quality and the decision to exit the market.
H75|Vocational Schools as an Instrument of Interregional Competition – Empirical Evidence from German Counties|The German apprenticeship system is widely known throughout the world. We analyze expenditures on vocational schools on county level using data from 213 West-German counties between 2001 and 2006. We use spatial econometrics to test for spatial correlation in counties’ expenditure on vocational schools but find no evidence that vocational schools serve as instrument in inter-county competition. While the theoretical literature suggests that spending should be higher for apprentices from small firms, we find a negative relationship between the share of apprentices from small firms and the expenditures per pupil. Expenditures are found to increase in the share of Christian Democrats in the county council.
H75|Targeting with In-Kind Transfers: Evidence from Medicaid Home Care|Making a transfer in kind reduces its value to recipients but can improve targeting. We develop an approach to quantifying this trade-off and apply it to home care. Using randomized experiments by Medicaid, we find that in-kind provision significantly reduces the value of the transfer to recipients while targeting a small fraction of the eligible population that is sicker and has fewer informal caregivers than the average eligible. Under a wide range of assumptions within a standard model, the targeting benefit exceeds the distortion cost. This highlights an important cost of recent reforms toward more flexible benefits.
H75|Facilitating Carbon Offsets from Native Forests|This note aims to help firms looking to offset their Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Emissions reductions from native forestry sequestration are already recognised in the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and it is ‘shovel ready’ to generate native forest offsets. 10,000 Ha of post-1989 native forest land would sequester 65,000 tonnes of CO2-e annually on average over 50 years, and would be eligible to earn 65,000 NZUs per year under the ETS. Native forestry also has a wide range of associated environmental, cultural, social and economic co-benefits. It is certainly possible for more native afforestation to occur at present, and within the existing policy framework; however, challenges do still exist. These include: a lack of awareness; limited access to capital; the complexity of the ETS; policy uncertainty; and some specific policy settings. The New Zealand business community can play an important role in solving these problems. Businesses can help influence government policy and have the capital and capacity to play a facilitating role in the market.
H75|Wages, Wellbeing and Location: Slaving Away in Sydney or Cruising on the Gold Coast|We analyse the relationships between subjective wellbeing (SWB), wages and internal migration. Our study addresses whether people make (revealed preference) location decisions based on SWB and/or wage prospects. We present both a theoretical intertemporal location choice model and empirical analyses using the Australian longitudinal HILDA dataset. Our theory predicts considerable heterogeneity in location choices for individuals at different life stages depending on their individual characteristics, including their rate of time preference. We find a significant and sustained uplift in SWB for migrants, which holds across a range of sub-samples. By contrast, wage responses are muted albeit with heterogeneity across groups. Our theory and results show that migration decisions are considered within a life-cycle context. The estimated pronounced upturn in SWB for migrants substantiates the usefulness of SWB both as a concept for policy-makers to target and for researchers to incorporate in their studies.
H75|"The Distortionary Effects of Incentives in Government: Evidence from China's ""Death Ceiling"" Program"|"We study a 2004 program designed to motivate Chinese bureaucrats to reduce accidental deaths. Each province received a set of ""death ceilings"" that, if exceeded, would impede government officials' promotions. For each category of accidental deaths, we observe a sharp discontinuity in reported deaths at the ceiling, suggestive of manipulation. Provinces with safety incentives for municipal officials experienced larger declines in accidental deaths, suggesting complementarities between incentives at different levels of government. While realized accidental deaths predict the following year's ceiling, we observe no evidence that provinces manipulate deaths upward to avoid ratchet effects in the setting of death ceilings."
H75|The Returns to Nursing: Evidence from a Parental Leave Program|Nurses comprise the largest health profession. In this paper, we measure the effect of nurses on health care delivery and patient health outcomes across sectors. Our empirical strategy takes advantage of a parental leave program, which led to a sudden, unintended, and persistent 12% reduction in nurse employment. Our findings indicate detrimental effects on hospital care delivery as indicated by an increase in 30-day readmission rates and a distortion of technology utilization. The effects for nursing home care are more drastic. We estimate a persistent 13% increase in nursing home mortality among the elderly aged 85 and older. Our results also highlight an unintended negative consequence of parental leave programs borne by providers and patients.
H75|Is Local Public Sector Rent Extraction Higher in Progressive Cities or High Amenity Cities?|Public finance theories of the median voter’s preferences and local public sector rent extraction posit that liberal cities and high amenity cities will feature a larger, better paid local public sector. Compensating differentials theory predicts that real wages will be lower in beautiful states and localities. Using both Federal and California city level administrative micro data, I study public sector compensation across space. At the Federal level, California workers are only paid 9% more than observationally identical workers in Alabama. Given the high California home prices, such workers are paying for the California amenities. Within California, beach cities hire more workers but pay them less in real terms. Liberal cities both pay public sector workers more and employ more of them. Liberal cities have much larger per-capita pension liabilities.
H75|Does Universal Preschool Hit the Target? Program Access and Preschool Impacts|Despite substantial interest in preschool as a means of narrowing the achievement gap, little is known about how particular program attributes might influence the achievement gains of disadvantaged preschoolers. This paper uses survey data on a recent cohort to explore the mediating influence of one key program attribute – whether disadvantage itself is a criterion for preschool admission. Taking advantage of age-eligibility rules to construct an instrument for attendance, I find that universal state-funded prekindergarten (pre-K) programs generate substantial positive effects on the reading scores of low-income 4 year olds. State pre-K programs targeted toward disadvantaged children do not. Differences in other pre- K program requirements and population demographics cannot explain the larger positive impacts of universal programs. The alternatives to universal and targeted state pre-K programs also do not significantly differ. Together, these findings suggest that universal preschools offer a relatively high-quality learning experience for low-income children not reflected in typical quality metrics.
H75|Does choice increase information? Evidence from online school search behavior|We examine whether changes in the local school choice environment affect the amount of information parents collect about local school quality, using data on over 100 million searches from Greatschools.org. We link monthly data on search frequency in local “Search Units” to information on changes in local open enrollment options driven by No Child Left Behind (NCLB) sanctions as well as state school choice policies including open enrollment, tuition vouchers, charitable scholarship tax credits, and tuition tax credits. Our results indicate that NCLB-driven expansions in school choice have large, positive effects on the frequency of searches done for schools in that area. We find less evidence that state choice policies affect online search behavior, however search frequency also increases when charter school penetration in a given area rises. These estimates suggest that the information parents have about local schools is endogenous to the choice environment they face, and that parental information depends not just on the availability of data but also the incentive to seek and use it.
H75|The Impact of Price Caps and Spending Cuts on U.S. Postsecondary Attainment|Increasing the postsecondary attainment rate of college-age youth is an important economic priority in the U.S. and in other developed countries. Yet little is known about whether different forms of public subsidy can increase degree completion. In this paper, we compare the impact of the marginal taxpayer dollar on postsecondary attainment when it is spent on lowering tuition prices versus increasing the quality of the college experience. We do so by estimating the causal impact of changes in tuition and spending on enrollment and degree completion in U.S. public postsecondary institutions between 1990 and 2013. We estimate these impacts using a newly assembled data set of legislative tuition caps and freezes, combined with variation in exposure to state budget shocks that is driven by differences in historical reliance on state appropriations. We find large impacts of spending on enrollment and degree completion. In contrast, we find no impact of price changes. Our estimates suggest that spending increases are more effective per-dollar than price cuts as a means of increasing postsecondary attainment.
H75|Implications of Medicaid Financing Reform for State Government Budgets|"We analyze potential reforms to Medicaid financing through the lens of fiscal federalism. Because substantial dollars are at stake, both the economic and political sides of intergovernmental transfers have high relevance in this setting. We show that changes in Medicaid financing formulas can shift amounts exceeding several hundred dollars per capita from ""winning"" states to ""losing"" states. In some cases, these amounts exceed 10% of states' own-source revenues. States' balanced budget requirements imply that such changes would, if not phased in gradually, require significant budgetary adjustment over short time horizons. We next show that alternative Medicaid financing structures have significant implications for states' exposure to budgetary stress during recessions. During the Great Recession, an acyclical block-grant structure would have increased states' shortfalls by 2-3.5% of own-source revenues relative to either an explicitly countercyclical block grant or the current matching system. Finally, we assess the implications of several financing structures for the extent to which they subsidize states' decisions on both the ""extensive"" and ""intensive"" margins of coverage generosity over the short and long term."

H75|The Effect of Education and School Quality on Female Crime|This paper estimates the effects of educational attainment and school quality on crime among American women. Using changes in compulsory schooling laws as instruments and census data, we estimate significant effects of schooling attainment on the probability of incarceration. Using Uniform Crime Reports data, we estimate that increases in average state schooling levels reduce arrest rates for violent and property crime but not white collar crime. We find small and mixed direct effects of school quality on incarceration and arrests. We show that the effects of education on female crime are mostly related to changes in marital opportunities and family formation.
H75|Weak States: Causes and Consequences of the Sicilian Mafia|We document that the spread of the Mafia in Sicily at the end of the 19th century was in part shaped by the rise of socialist Peasant Fasci organizations. In an environment with weak state presence, this socialist threat triggered landholders, estate managers and local politicians to turn to the Mafia to resist and combat peasant demands. We show that the location of the Peasant Fasci is significantly affected by an exceptionally severe drought in 1893, and using information on rainfall, we establish the causal effect of the Peasant Fasci on the location of the Mafia in 1900. We provide extensive evidence that rainfall before and after this critical period has no effect on the spread of the Mafia or various economic and political outcomes. In the second part of the paper, we use the source of variation in the location of the Mafia in 1900 to estimate its medium-term and long-term effects. We find significant and quantitatively large negative impacts of the Mafia on literacy and various public goods in the 1910s and 20s. We also show a sizable impact of the Mafia on political competition, which could be one of the channels via which it affected local economic outcomes. We document negative effects of the Mafia on longer-term outcomes (in the 1960s, 70s and 80s) as well, but these are in general weaker and often only marginally significant. One exception is its persistent and strong impact on political competition.
H75|Decentralisation to promote Regional Development in Indonesia|In 1998 Indonesia embarked on an ambitious course of decentralisation. Over a period of a few years, facilitated by financial transfers from the central government, responsibility for many public services and administrative tasks were devolved to local authorities. This process is continuing. Regional development is now very much in the hands of the four sub-national tiers of government. However, the speed of the devolution means that much is being done without the required accompanying skills, technical capacities, resources and oversight. As a result, while good progress has been made nationally along a number dimensions, outcomes in health, education, infrastructure, corruption and the provision of other social services have not improved as quickly as was hoped, and the variance in results across the regions has been enormous. Rather than simply devolving more and more responsibilities to sub-national authorities, the central government needs to take a more strategic view of regional economic development. This includes monitoring the performance of sub-national governments, providing them with technical assistance where needed, encouraging them to emulate the best performers and in the short- to medium-term using grants to direct spending to priority areas. The inter-governmental transfer framework also would benefit from better oversight and a strategic vision. Moreover, the perverse incentives it embodies are driving rent-seeking and the fragmentation of local jurisdictions. In the longer term the objective should be tax autonomy and transfers based exclusively on block grants although this should be conditional on adequate oversight and administrative capacities within the sub-national authorities. Conflicting and overlapping laws and regulations across levels of government are also inhibiting regional development by obstructing private business development and investment. This Working Paper relates to the 2016 OECD Economic Survey of Indonesia (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-indonesia.htm).
H75|Old-age Frailty Patterns and Implications for Long-term Care Programmes|Abstract This paper examines patterns in old-age frailty within a multistate model that characterises the stochastic process of biological ageing. Using aggregate population-level U.S. mortality data, we study differences in frailty by gender and cohort. Our results show that, on average, women tend to be frailer than men at older ages with the male–female divergence growing considerably past age 80. We also find that average frailty levels have fluctuated over time with a distinct peak-and-trough pattern. These cohort trends in frailty and the subsequent dynamic forecasts of frailty among newer cohorts closely mirror how late-life disability has evolved among older Americans in recent decades, underscoring the important connection between frailty conditions and disability among older adults. The implications of these findings on spending for long-term care programmes within the broader health insurance system are discussed.
H75|The Role of Program Financing in the System of Higher Education|The development of education in any country or society is one of the most urgent issues. When we talk about the development of education, above all we must take into consideration governmental funding system. High education and research funding is priority in most developed countries. Georgia, as the region's geopolitical and geostrategic center a few years ago began formation of the liberal democratic value-based society. Over the last period in Georgia reforms in educations system is ongoing, that led to changes in governments funding policy system. However, the higher education system is still far from Western standards of teaching and learning processes. The most significant problem in the educational system is inefficient financial management. The article above discusses the mechanisms for financing higher education in Georgia, financial management of the educational system, basically problems in program funding and their solutions. methods of studying observation, analysis and synthesis, progression from abstract towards concrete, notional experiment and experience. With the help of the article we have attempted to analyze one of the sides of the problem: how the state supports priority higher educational institutions and what the connection between consumed resources and learning outcomes is. The research clearly showed that financing education has become a priority direction for Georgia. The reform of the financing system has eliminated corruption in the educational system, increased competitiveness among the higher educational institutions, provided preparation of human resources in the fundamental fields of science and education, socially indigent population were given opportunity to get education. However, the same research also showed that the preparation of specialists with competences relevant to the modern requirements cannot be accomplished by financing only certain (though priority) programs.
H75|Does municipal mergers internalize spatial spillover effects? Empirical evidence from Japanese municipalities|This paper investigates whether municipal mergers could internalize spatial spillover effects by comparing mergers before and after they occur, especially focusing on local public library services in Japan. A spatial spillover effect occurs when the benefit of a local public service spreads across not only its own administrative district but also into neighboring ones. A free rider problem among municipalities might be caused when a municipality makes a policy decision regarding how much it supplies to its own local public service under a decentralization system, recognizing the existence of a spatial spillover effect. Under such circumstances, spatial spillover effects might be internalized through municipal mergers. In Japan, the boundaries of administrative districts—including those of municipalities—have been determined based on traditional or historical reasons. However, large-scale municipal mergers took place in FY2004 and FY2005 due to serious fiscal deficits and a rapidly aging population. Consequently, the number of municipalities in Japan has decreased from 3,232 to 1,820. In light of these facts, we examine whether municipal mergers internalize spatial spillover effects, focusing on Japanese local public library services, by applying cross-sectional spatial autoregressive models. As a result, we found that there are spatial spillover effects in public library services both in FY2001 (before) and in FY2008 (after). We also found that the impact of such spillovers in FY2008 is smaller than that in FY2001. The results imply that municipal mergers could at least partially internalize spatial spillover effects among municipalities.
H75|Assignment of powers and number of states in Federal Philippines Discussion paper on federalizing Philippines|This paper argues that the number of states or regional units the Philippine should have when it will federalize the country must be limited to 5. This claim meets the Samuelsonian principle of welfare theorem where marginal social cost is equal to marginal social benefit. The paper also argues that the states or regional governments should have the limited to earn revenue through taxing powers which will be used to spend for government operations. In this manner, efficiency is achieved and control of the federal government on the affairs of the states and regional governments is limited primarily to transfers through equalization parameters.
H75|The effects of population ageing on public education in Japan : A reinterpretation using micro data|This study explored the effects of population ageing on public education using Japanese micro data. In recent years, Japan has become the fastest-ageing society among the major countries; the ageing of the population is expected to progress rapidly, such that in 2050, the population of those 65 years of age or older will be about 37% of the total population. Owing to such rapid ageing of the population in Japan, it is important to understand whether the elderly have any preferences regarding public education services. Therefore, through the elderly’s reasons for choosing a place of residence, we examined the difference in their preferences for education due to differences in family type and asset conditions. The results of the analysis, like those obtained by Poterba (1998) and Ohtake and Sano (2009), suggest the possibility that elderly people who no longer live with their families do not support education. However as suggested by Hilber and Mayer (2009), elderly people who have more real estate assets can obtain indirect benefits from education; thus, even if they no longer live with their families, such elderly people may support education.
H75|Application of the Multiregional Health Account for Germany - A financial equalization scheme to cope with lagging investments in German hospitals|Lagging investments in German hospitals have become a serious challenge in recent decades. The responsibility for investment financing lies with the German federal states, the “Bundeslaender”, due to the dualistic financing framework applying for German hospitals. Yet, hospital investments experience a field of tension between the availability of financial resources and necessary investments. A possible solution could be a financial equalization scheme for the health economy incorporating an earmarked fund for hospital investments. The rationale for such a system is that health economies of federal states do not represent single closed systems, but depend on interregional trade flows to supply patient treatment. The respective calculations in this paper are based on our recently compiled Multiregional Health Account for Germany. The model represents a satellite account of the health economy based on national accounts. Consequently, we are able to calculate spillover effects from patient treatment in federal states by conducting input-output analysis. Based on the results, we derive a sketch of a financial equalization scheme in order to ensure needs-based hospital infrastructure in German federal states.
H75|Intergenerational Education for Social Inclusion and Solidarity: The Case Study of the EU Funded Project “Connecting Generations”|This paper reflects on lessons learned from a validated model of international collaboration based on research and practice. During the European Year for Active Ageing (2012), a partnership of seven organizations from the European Union (EU) plus Turkey implemented the Lifelong Learning Programme partnership “Connecting Generations” which involved universities, non-governmental organizations, third age Universities and municipalities in collaboration with local communities. Reckoning that Europe has dramatically changed in its demographic composition and is facing brand new challenges regarding intergenerational and intercultural solidarity, each partner formulated and tested innovative and creative practices that could enhance better collaboration and mutual understanding between youth and senior citizens, toward a more inclusive Europe for all. Several innovative local practices have been experimented, attentively systematized and peer-valuated among the partners. On the basis of a shared theoretical framework coherent with EU and Europe and Training 2020 Strategy, an action-research approach was adopted throughout the project in order to understand common features that have been replicated and scaled up since today.
H75|Folk High School as an Educational Alternative for Older Adults|There is just one challenge for a twenty-first century person, and it is an omnipresent change. In order to exist successfully and effectively in such a reality, one should constantly develop and take part in an educational process (formal and informal). A huge number of places directing their educational offer to seniors and use this alternative education, which is, on the other hand, often thought to be directed to children. In the author’s opinion, a form of alternative education for adults and seniors is a folk high school in its contemporary version. That thesis is being discussed in this chapter.
H75|Pension Enhancements and the Retention of Public Employees|The authors use data from workers in the largest public-sector occupation in the United Statesâ€”teachingâ€”to examine the effect of pension enhancements on employee retention. Specifically, they study a 1999 enhancement to the benefit formula for public school teachers in St. Louis, Missouri, that resulted in an immediate and dramatic increase in their incentives to remain in covered employment. To identify the effect of the enhancement on teacher retention, the analysis leverages the fact that the strength of the incentive increase varied across the workforce depending on how far teachers were from retirement eligibility when it was enacted. The results indicate that the St. Louis enhancementâ€”which was structurally similar to enhancements that were enacted in other public pension plans across the United States in the late 1990s and early 2000sâ€”was not a cost-effective way to increase employee retention.
H75|Educational Initiatives and Mobilization for Primary Schools in SÃ£o Paulo, 1830-1889|"One of the most common explanations for the historical deficiencies of public primary education in Brazil has been the alleged indifference of families that lacked the resources to send their children to private schools. This article addresses this issue in a period, comprising most of the Empire, when the conditions for access to primary schools were especially unfavorable. Poverty, isolation, illiteracy, political centralization and bureaucracy inhibited local initiatives and created few incentives, if any, for families to get involved in primary schools. The article shows, however, that parents and residents organized themselves across the province of SÃ£o Paulo and submitted petitions to their local representatives and the provincial assembly requiring the installation of schools, since the first decades of the Empire. Town councils and, in the 1880s, education councils strengthened local demand for primary education. Under particularly adverse conditions, the evidence of mobilization for public schools gains a special significance and raises doubts about the views that, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, rejected the viability of local self-government due to the alleged inability of the ""people"" to intervene in the public sphere consistently."
H75|The impact of computer-based tutorials on high school math proficiency|Abstract The benefits of mathematical-related skills are well documented in the economics and education literature. Even in spite of such evidence, proficiency levels among US high school students remain persistently low. This is especially true for the State of Nevada. As a result, the Clark County School District (CCSD) made available to students a computer-aided math tutorial prior to taking the High School Proficiency Exam (HSPE) in mathematics. As such, we utilize a novel dataset and explore the impact of computer-aided learning on mathematics proficiency rates for 10th and 11th graders in the CCSD. Our results provide some evidence of increased proficiency in mathematics related to tutorial participation. This is especially true for minority students. However, causal claims are limited due to the inability to rule out a zero lower bound on the estimated average treatment effects.
H75|Perceived quality and formation of inter-regional networks of health care migration|In the paper we test the hypothesis if the perceived quality of the hospital servicesÂ (medical, assistance and hygienic) can be considered a drive factor of theÂ interregional health migration in the sense that it influence the predictedÂ probability of a ties formation between two regional healthcare systems. At thisÂ end several exponential random graph model are estimated introducing theÂ perceived quality as a node-level characteristic. The analysis show that theÂ perceived quality factor in the hospitals services is statistically significant andÂ positively related to the probability to observe ties between two Regions. ThatÂ homophily effect do not exist between Regions with the same regional healthcareÂ system but the effect appear at level of geographical area. Finally the access factorÂ do not influence this predicted probability, on the contrary, in some case theÂ estimated parameter of the access factor is negatively related to it. Yet, theÂ estimated parameter of the equipment factor is statistically significant andÂ positively related to the predicted probability to observe ties between two RegionsÂ in four type of networks on five considered. So, we can conclude that theÂ perceived quality factor in the hospital services is not the only drive factor forÂ the travel for health motivation between two Regions, but also the technologicalÂ level have a role, meanwhile the access is often negatively related at the predictÂ probability to observe a tie.JEL classification numbers: H75,I30,C15,D71Keywords: health migration, aggregate choices, network formation, perceivedÂ quality.
H75|School Infrastructure Spending and Educational Outcomes in Northern Italy|We explore whether investment in public school infrastructure affects students' achievement. We use data on extra funding to public high schools after the 2012 Northern Italy earthquake and apply a quasi-experimental design and an instrumental variable strategy. We find that spending on school infrastructure increases standardized test scores in mathematics and Italian language, and the effect is stronger for lower-achieving students and in mathematics. These results provide evidence in favor of a positive impact of capital spending in improving the learning environment and performances of high school students.
H75|Labor versus Capital in the Provision of Public Services: Estimating the Marginal Products of Inputs in the Production of Student Outcomes|Does the enormous variation in financial resources available to local schools affect student achievement? There is an intense debate over the inequality of opportunity in public schools due to differences in financial resources, but there is little empirical evidence that sheds light on this issue. The main purpose of this paper is to measure the impact of various types of school expenditures (i.e. operating, minor capital, and major capital expenditures) on the short- and long-term educational achievement of students. This paper also looks at various channels (i.e. class size, attendance, discipline, and teachers' compensation) through which each type of expenditure could affect the performance of students. I use a dynamic regression discontinuity design that relies upon the exogenous variation in public school funding in Ohio that is created by marginally approved or failed local referenda to fund school districts. I find that only one type of expenditure, the approval of additional operating expenditures, has a positive effect in the short-term on the math proficiency of students subject to Ohio high school graduation tests, i.e. about 0.033 standard deviations (0.27 percentage points) for every additional $1,000 extra per pupil operating expenditure. I also find that the subsequent increase in the average expenditure on instructional staff is the only channel that can explain this effect. I do not find any long-term effect for any type of school expenditures.
H75|The Affordable Care Act, Public Insurance Expansion and Opioid Overdose Mortality|This study examines the impact of expanded public insurance, resulting from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, on opioid related mortality. I utilize variation in states’ decisions to expand Medicaid and variation in the timing of expansion among expanding states to measure this impact. Opioid related mortality data are examined from 1999-2015 using the National Vital Statistics multiple cause of death files. My findings suggest that public insurance expansion led to reductions in opioid related overdose deaths for heroin and other narcotics by about 26% and increases in methadone related deaths by about 18%. My study builds on recent work that shows increases in prescriptions to treat opioid use disorder in expanding states relative to non-expanding states.
H75|Fiscal decentralization and the performance of higher education institutions: the case of Europe|This paper empirically evaluates the impact of fiscal decentralization on the performance of higher education systems. To test this relationship,we build up a panel dataset composed of European countries. Countrylevel performance is measured by an indicator using data from the Shanghai ranking. Using a dynamic panel approach, we find that a higher share of government spending coming from decentralized levels of governmentsleads to an improvement of the performance of research-intensive higher education institutions. This result is confirmed by the use of an instrumental variable approach. We argue that a more decentralized higher education system increases the ability to attract and retain top scholars.
H75|"Are Teacher Pensions ""Hazardous"" for Schools?"|I use a detailed panel of data and a unique modeling specification to explore how public schoolteachers respond to the incentives embedded in North Carolina’s retirement system. Like most public-sector retirement plans, North Carolina’s teacher pension implicitly encourages teachers to continue working until they are eligible for their pension benefits, and then leave soon afterward. I find that teachers with higher levels of quality, as measured by a teacher’s value-added to her students’ achievement test scores, are more responsive to the “pull” of teacher pensions. Younger teachers, those with higher salaries, and nonwhite teachers are also more likely to stay during the pension “pull.” All teachers show a strong response to the pension “push,” with about a quarter of teachers leaving every year once they become eligible for their pension. I depart from other models of teacher retirement by using a Cox proportional hazard model. Given that salaries are generally fixed by the state, I find that the number of years a teacher must work before she is eligible for her full pension benefit is the major driver of variation in pension wealth. This specification has the benefit of a flexible baseline hazard that can easily capture the sharp incentives driving a teacher’s retirement decision that are dependent on her proximity to retirement eligibility, and can flexibly account for differences driven by local labor market conditions. These analyses highlight important unintended effects that inform education policies going forward to ensure the retention of high-quality teachers in all types of schools.
H75|The Effects of Political Competition on the Funding of Public-Sector Pension Plans|In politically competitive jurisdictions, there can be strong electoral incentives to underfund public pensions in order to keep current taxes low. I examine this hypothesis using panel data for 2,000 municipal pension plans from Pennsylvania. The results suggest that as a municipality becomes more politically competitive, it tends to have pension plans that are less funded. The effects of political competition are driven by municipalities that have a higher proportion of less informed voters and are absent for pension plans offered by municipal authorities. The negative relationship between political competition and funding status is present for state pensions as well.
H75|Cui bono? - Die Bürgerversicherung und die Beihilfe|In der deutschen Gesundheitspolitik wird seit langem unter dem Stichwort Bürgerversicherung über die Einbeziehung aller Bürger in das System der Gesetzlichen Krankenversicherung diskutiert. Dabei wird meistens die Perspektive der GKV-Versicherten eingenommen, seltener diejenige der Versicherten der PKV. Es stellt sich jedoch insbesondere für die Gruppe der Beihilfeberechtigten die Frage, welche monetären Konsequenzen durch eine Bürgerversicherung für sie entstehen und in welcher Höhe daraus Kompensationszahlungen abgeleitet werden können. Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen: Selbst, wenn diese Kompensationen weniger als die Hälfte der Differenz der Versicherungsleistungen zwischen PKV/Beihilfe und einer Bürgerversicherung abdecken, hat der Business Case Bürgerversicherung für die Gebietskörperschaften zumindest kurzfristig negative fiskalischen Folgen. The health policy debate in Germany rotates around the question wheather Germany’s two pillar insurance system should be dissolved and replaced by universal coverage under the roof of the public system (so called „citizen insurance“/Bürgerversicherung). Most of the time, such a reform is argued from the perspective of the 90 percent of the German population which are already insured by a sickness funds. Rarely, the consequences of currently privately insurant are analysed. However, especially German civil servants are of great interest in this regard, as they are most times partly insured in the private scheme while the other part of their benefits are directly paid by the taxpayer. As the scheme for civil servants is more generous than the public scheme, the question of compensation arises when talking about the Bürgerversicherung reform. We show that if civil servants are only partly compensated by their employers (federal and state governments), the reform has a short-run negative fiscal impact.
H75|Das Hamburger Beihilfemodell - Ein Vergleich der internen Renditen von GKV und PKV|Zu Beginn ihrer Karriere verfügen Beamte über das Privileg zwischen einer Absicherung im System der gesetzlichen Krankenversicherungen (GKV) und den privaten Krankenversicherungen (PKV) wählen zu dürfen. Bislang entscheiden sich die meisten Beamten für letztere, auch weil sie in der GKV sowohl Arbeitnehmer- als auch Arbeitgeberbeitrag zahlen müssten, in der PKV dagegen eine Kostenbeteiligung im Rahmen der Beihilfe vorgesehen ist. Die Stadt Hamburg hat nun jedoch beschlossen, zukünftig Arbeitgeberzuschüsse zur GKV zu leisten, um damit eine „echte Wahlfreiheit“ herzustellen. Wir zeigen anhand eines Vergleichs der internen Renditen in beiden Systemen, dass sich das Kalkül für den Durchschnittsbeamten trotz dieser gefeierten Reform kaum verändern wird. Vielmehr wird es wahrscheinlich zu einer verstärkten adversen Selektion von hohen Gesundheitsrisiken zu Lasten der GKV kommen. At the beginning of their career civil servants in Germany can choose between the social health insurance system and a private plan combined with a direct reimbursement of the government up to 80 percent. Most civil servants chose the latter, also because they have to cover all contribution payments to the social system themselves, while normal employees get nearly 50 percent from their employers. The state of Hamburg decided to change the system by paying a share of the contributions if civil servants choose the social plan. Using a comparison of internal rates of return in both schemes, we show that this celebrated reform will not change the decision calculus for the average civil servant household and will probably thereby increase the adverse selection of high risk cases towards the social health insurance.
H75|The Effect of an Increase in Lead in the Water System on Fertility and Birth Outcomes: The Case of Flint, Michigan|Flint changed its public water source in April 2014, increasing lead exposure. The effects of lead in water on fertility and birth outcomes are not well established. Exploiting variation in the timing of births we find fertility rates decreased by 12%, fetal death rates increased by 58% (a selection effect from a culling of the least healthy fetuses), and overall health at birth decreased (from scarring), compared to other cities in Michigan. Given recent efforts to establish a registry of residents exposed, these results suggests women who miscarried, had a stillbirth or had a newborn with health complications should register.
H75|The fair surrender value of a tontine|A tontine provides a mortality driven, age-increasing payout structure through the pooling of mortality. Because a tontine does not entail any guarantees, the payout structure of a tontine is determined by the pooling of individual characteristics of tontinists. Therefore, the surrender decision of single tontinists directly affects the remaining members' payouts. Nevertheless, the opportunity to surrender is crucial to the success of a tontine from a regulatory as well as a policyholder perspective. Therefore, this paper derives the fair surrender value of a tontine, first on the basis of expected values, and then incorporates the increasing payout volatility to determine an equitable surrender value. Results show that the surrender decision requires a discount on the fair surrender value as security for the remaining members. The discount intensifies in decreasing tontine size and increasing risk aversion. However, tontinists are less willing to surrender for decreasing tontine size and increasing risk aversion, creating a natural protection against tontine runs stemming from short-term liquidity shocks. Furthermore we argue that a surrender decision based on private information requires a discount on the fair surrender value as well.
H75|More teachers, smarter students? Potential side effects of the German educational expansion|In this paper, I evaluate potential side effects of the educational expansion in Germany on the learning outcomes of today's students. The educational expansion was a demand shock in the labor market of teachers, which could have thus encouraged individuals with different teaching abilities to eventually become teachers. I find that replacing a non-affected teacher with an educational expansion teacher leads to a 2 percent reduction in students' test scores. Explorative analyses suggest that these teachers are more extrinsically rather than intrinsically motivated. The results highlight that monitoring and investing in quality is important for future extensions of public institutions.
