C43|Defining, measuring and ranking energy vulnerability|Vulnerability is reaching an increasing attention from both academia, international community and industry, being detected as a pillar of the development agenda. If the formal definition of overall vulnerability and resilience is still flawed in the economic literature, the measurement and mainstreaming of outlying characteristics and sound policies for energy vulnerability results almost uncovered, often overlapping with other energy issues. Energy vulnerability also results poorly enforced by regulatory, governmental, and legislative systems. After reviewing and furnishing a univocal ambient merging the multiple interpretations on such concepts, this work: i) defines energy vulnerability; ii) builds a composite indicator to measure energy vulnerability; and iii) analyzes and ranks OECD and non-OECD countries in terms of energy vulnerability. The regulatory framework, SDGs and the development agenda are examined, selected indicators from the WB’s WDI are analyzed. The indicator is weighted by a multivariate analysis and its robustness is checked through different techniques.
C43|Measuring economic and economic policy uncertainty, and their macroeconomic effects: the case of Spain|We provide additional evidence on the relationship between uncertainty and economic activity. For this purpose, we gather and construct a wide range of proxy indicators of economic and economic policy uncertainty from Spain. We distinguish between the relative merits of different types of measures based on: (i) the volatility of financial markets; (ii) economic analysts’ disagreement; (iii) economic policy uncertainty. We show that the first and the third block of measures are the most relevant to grasp the negative effects of unexpected changes in uncertainty on aggregate economic developments, as measured by real GDP. In addition, we find that economic policy uncertainty and financial uncertainty shocks produce visible negative effects on private consumption. The negative responses on capital goods investments are initially bigger in magnitude but vanish more quickly.
C43|A new economic policy uncertainty index for Spain|We explore how sensitive is the influential Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index (Baker et al., 2016) to certain key features of the construction methodology. Our results (for the case of Spain) both as regards the chronology of economic policy-related events as well as the effects of uncertainty shocks on the economy, show the relevance of fine-tuning two key methodological choices: (i) the richness of the keywords and expressions used, and (ii) the newspaper coverage. Thus, our results are not to be read only as regards the case under study (Spain), but rather convey a more general message.
C43|Aggregation and the Gravity Equation|One of the most successful empirical relationships in international trade is the gravity equation. A key decision for researchers in estimating this relationship is the level of aggregation, since the gravity equation is log linear, whereas aggregation involves summing the level rather than the log of trade. In this paper, we derive a Jensen's inequality correction term for nested constant elasticity of substitution preferences, such that a log-linear gravity equation holds exactly for each nest. We provide evidence that sectoral composition is quantitatively relevant for the aggregate effect of distance on international trade, particularly for more disaggregated definitions of sectors.
C43|Should We Care (More) About Data Aggregation? Evidence from the Democracy-Growth-Nexus|We compile data for 186 countries (1919 - 2016) and apply different aggregation methods to create new democracy indices. We observe that most of the available aggregation techniques produce indices that are often too favorable for autocratic regimes and too unfavorable for democratic regimes. The sole exception is a machine learning technique. Using a stylized model, we show that applying an index with implausibly low (high) scores for democracies (autocracies) in a regression analysis produces upward-biased OLS and 2SLS estimates. The results of an analysis of the effect of democracy on economic growth show that the distortions in the OLS and 2SLS estimates are substantial. Our findings imply that commonly used indices are not well suited for empirical purposes.
C43|GDP is a measure of output, not welfare. Or, HOS meets the SNA|What effect, if any, do changes in the terms of trade have on the level of output (GDP) or welfare? I examine this issue through two versions of a textbook, Hecksher-Ohlin-Samuelson (HOS), two-good model of a small, open economy. In the first version both goods are for final consumption. In the second, one good is an imported intermediate input into the other. In both versions, economic theory suggests that an improvement in the terms of trade raises welfare (consumption) but leaves aggregate output (GDP) unchanged. This follows from a continuous-time analysis using Divisia index numbers. I then show that a national income accountant applying the principles of the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA) would reach the same conclusions.
C43|Ethnic Geography: Measurement and Evidence|The effects of ethnic geography, i.e., the distribution of ethnic groups across space, on economic, political and social outcomes are not well understood. We develop a novel index of ethnic segregation that takes both ethnic and spatial distances between individuals into account. Importantly, we can decompose this index into indices of spatial dispersion, generalized ethnic fractionalization, and the alignment of spatial and ethnic distances. We use maps of traditional ethnic homelands, historical population density data, and language trees to compute these four indices for more than 150 countries. We apply these indices to study the relation between historical ethnic geography and current economic, political and social outcomes. Among other things, we document that countries with higher historical alignment, i.e., countries where ethnically diverse individuals lived far apart, have higher-quality government, higher incomes and higher levels of trust.
C43|Housing Rent Dynamics and Rent Regulation in St. Petersburg (1880-1917)| This article studies the evolution of housing rents in St. Petersburg between 1880 and 1917 covering an eventful period of Russian and world history. We collect and digitize over 5,000 rental advertisements from historic newspapers, which we use together with geo-coded addresses and detailed structural characteristics to construct a quality-adjusted rent price index in continuous time. We provide the first pre-war and pre-Soviet index based on market data for any Russian housing market. In 1915, one of the world’s earliest rent control and tenant protection policies was introduced as a response to soaring prices following the outbreak of World War I. We analyze the impact of this policy: while before the regulation rents were increasing at a similar rapid pace as other consumer prices, the policy reversed this trend. We find evidence for official compliance with the policy, document a rise in tenure duration and strongly increased rent affordability among workers after the introduction of the policy. We conclude that the immediate prelude to the October Revolution was indeed characterized by economic turmoil, but rent affordability and rising rents were no longer the prevailing problems.

C43|The Decompositions of Cost Variation|In this paper a number of meaningful and empirically implementable decom- positions of the cost variation (in difference and ratio form) are developed. The components distinguished are price level change, technical efficiency change, allocative efficiency change, technological change, scale of activity change, and price structure change. Given data from a (balanced) panel of produc- tion units, all the necessary ingredients for the computation of the various decompositions can be obtained by using linear programming techniques. An application is provided.
C43|Analyzing the Dynamic Relationship between Physical Infrastructure, Financial Development and Economic Growth in India|The paper investigates dynamic relationship between physical infrastructure, financial development and economic growth in the case of India, using an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and Toda-Yamamoto (T-Y) causality approach for the period 1980 to 2016. Physical infrastructure index and financial development index are con-structed using Principal Component Analysis method. Empirical results suggest that physical infrastructure has a positive effect on economic growth both in the long-run and short-run, whereas financial development, though significant, has a weak impact on eco-nomic growth. The causality test supports a bi-directional causal relationship between infrastructure development and economic growth, while it finds a unidirectional causa-tion running from economic growth to financial development. It also finds that gross in-vestment and employment have a positive, and inflation has an adverse effect on eco-nomic growth. As India is aiming for higher growth for a sustained period, our results suggest that there is a need for Government intervention in expanding the physical infra-structure and this, in turn, could lead to the growth of the financial sector in the country.
C43|On the Use of Spectral Value Decomposition for the Construction of Composite Indices|High dimensional composite index makes experts’ preferences in set-ting weights a hard task. In the literature, one of the approaches to derive weights from a data set is Principal Component or Factor Analysis that, although conceptually different, they are similar in results when FA is based on Spectral Value Decomposition and rotation is not performed. This works motivates theoretical reasons to derive the weights of the elementary indicators in a composite index when multiple components are retained in the analysis. By Monte Carlo simulation it offers, moreover, the best strategy to identify the number of components to retain.
C43|Owner-Occupied Housing, Inflation, and Monetary Policy| The treatment of owner-occupied housing (OOH) in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) affects inflation expectations, real interest rates, and hence market outcomes. After showing that none of the existing treatments of OOH are fit for purpose, we propose a new simplified user cost method with better properties. We then compare empirically eight treatments of OOH. Our preferred approach pushes up the CPI during housing booms. We relate our findings to the following macroeconomic debates: the disinflation puzzle, leaning against the wind, and the effectiveness of monetary policy in the presence of secular stagnation, the zero lower bound, and globalization.
C43|How does subway and ground transit proximity affect rental prices?|This study focuses on the ground transportation system and its impact on the rents in 30 of Russia’s largest cities. It also compares the effect with subway transit networks. The data set includes rent information from an all-Russia online advertisement website Avito and various measures of proximity to the public transit network stops (including subways for cities with them). The analysis is conducted using linear hedonic models. The results show that the ground transportation proximity is important for housing rent formation in both cities with and without subways, although the effect for subway stations is greater in comparison. Nevertheless, the benefits of a denser ground transportation system are high and stable, whereas the distance to the closest bus stop and the number within the walking distance are important solely for cities with a subway system and without it, respectively.
C43|Structural Transformation and Quality Ladders: Solving the “Theil's Cube”|We propose a decomposition of weighted Theil index of export concentration into the quantity- and quality-driven terms and calculate the proposed components for 5038 product groups and 120 countries. We link our findings to the debate on the role of quality upgrading in structural transformation. The results do not support the idea that climbing quality ladders (or quality upgrading within the actually exported products) is the best way to proceed with structural transformation: for most countries, the share of the quality-driven component of weighted Theil index doesn’t exceed 20 per cent
C43|Technology Assessment Of Iot Wireless Network Technologies For The Telecommunication Sector|Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are of particular interest for telecommunication companies that can significantly affect the interaction of economic agents. As a result of the growth in the number of connected devices, the introduction of cloud services and business applications it became possible to combine equipment, information systems and management systems into a single communication network which in turn gave impetus to the development of the Internet of Things. The basis for the development of the Internet of Things is modern data transmission technologies including IoT Wireless Networks. There are, currently, a number of wireless IoT technologies which have different characteristics. In this regard, it is of interest to identify the most promising technologies that will form the basis of the infrastructure for the development of the IoT ecosystem. This paper develops an assessment model for the application potential of IoT wireless network technologies for the telecommunication sector. LPWAN, 4G and Wi-Fi were identified as the most promising technologies. The majority of the assessment criteria are applicable to other telecommunication technologies.
C43|Not Everyone Is Engaged: An Innovative Approach to Measure Engagement Levels on the Labor Market|Individuals' level of engagement on the labor market is hypothesized to be of critical importance for labor market outcomes. Based on a recent labor market survey in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), this paper develops an innovative index to measure individuals' labor market engagement across three dimensions: preferences, intensity, and barriers. The index can also to be used to cluster individuals with similar engagement levels to target labor market interventions more effectively and may be used to roughly measure the effectiveness of labor market interventions across time, as it can calculate the score for out-of-sample individuals. The index is computed individually and in aggregate for six labor market groups: employed, unemployed, and out-of-the-labor force, each separately for men and women. The methodology includes: (i) identifying labor subgroups and engagement dimensions, (ii) identifying relevant variables within each group and dimension, (iii) constructing an index for each group and dimension that captures the relative status of an individual against his/her reference group, and (iv) synthesizing the different engagement dimensions into a single indicator. Findings confirm the strong heterogeneity of labor market engagement in the KSA and the usefulness of differentiating interventions for job searchers depending on which cluster they belong to.
C43|Explaining and measuring tolerant behavior|In recent studies, there has been a growing interest towards tolerance and its implications in the socio-economic system. This paper aims to contribute to this flourishing research area into two directions. First, we develop a theoretical framework to explain individual’s tolerant attitudes without necessarily resorting to altruistic preferences. Second, this paper addresses the issue of measuring tolerance when information about several dimensions of tolerance is available and data are of Likert's scale type. To show how our new measure of tolerance works in practice, we carry out a case study using an Italian recent survey asking the opinion of university students about different subjects, such as interreligious dialogue, women/religion relationship, religion/death relationship, multicultural society, and homosexuality. We, finally, highlight the key policy implications arising from our study.
C43|Anatomy of Regional Price Differentials: Evidence From Micro Price Data|Our paper uses micro price data collected from Germany’s Consumer Price Index to compile a highly disaggregated regional price index for the 402 counties and cities of Germany. We introduce a multi-stage version of the weighted Country-Product-Dummy method. The unique quality of our price data allows us to depart from previous spatial price comparisons and to compare only exactly identical products. We find that the price levels are spatially autocorrelated and largely driven by the cost of housing. The price level in the most expensive region is about 27 percent higher than in the cheapest region.
C43|Consistent Aggregation With Superlative and Other Price Indices|Various fields of economic analysis (e.g., growth and productivity) and economic policy (e.g., monetary and social policy) rely on accurate measures of price change. Unfortunately, the price index formulae that most price statisticians consider as particularly accurate – the superlative indices of Fisher, Törnqvist, and Walsh – are believed to violate the property of consistency in aggregation. This property, however, is indispensable for economic studies that attempt to disaggregate the overall result into the contributions of individual entities such as sectors of the economy or groups of products. The present paper introduces a thoroughly motivated formal definition of consistency in aggregation and proves that, contrary to general perception, the three superlative price indices can be considered as consistent in aggregation. Furthermore, many other price indices are shown to be consistent in aggregation. The theoretical findings are applied to the Swedish consumer price index.
C43|Measuring the Services of Durables and Owner Occupied Housing|This paper provides an update to the chapter on the treatment of durables in the Consumer Price Index Manual (2004). The most important durable is housing, which typically accounts for approximately 20% of total consumption services. A large fraction of total housing services consists of the services of Owner Occupied Housing (OOH). The main approaches to measuring the services of OOH are (i) the acquisitions approach; (ii) the rental equivalence approach and (iii) the user cost approach. Two other approaches are sometimes used: (iv) the opportunity cost approach and (v) the payments approach. A main purpose of this paper is to present the main approaches to the treatment of OOH and to discuss the benefits and costs of the alternative approaches. The paper also discusses the problems associated with forming imputations for the services of â€œordinaryâ€ consumer durable goods.
C43|Residential Property Price Indexes: Spatial Coordinates versus Neighbourhood Dummy Variables|The paper addresses the following question: can satisfactory residential property price indexes be constructed using hedonic regression techniques where location effects are modeled using local neighbourhood dummy variables or is it necessary to use spatial coordinates to model location effects. Hill and Scholz (2018) addressed this question and found, using their hedonic regression model, that it was not necessary to use spatial coordinates to obtain satisfactory property price indexes for Sydney. However, their hedonic regression model did not estimate separate land and structure price indexes for residential properties. In order to construct national balance sheet estimates, it is necessary to have separate land and structure price indexes. The present paper addresses the Hill and Scholz question in the context of providing satisfactory residential land price indexes. The spatial coordinate model used in the present paper is a modification of Colwellâ€™s (1998) spatial interpolation method. The modification can be viewed as a general nonparametric method for estimating a function of two variables.
C43|Quality Adjustment and Hedonics: A Unified Approach|The paper takes a consumer demand perspective to the problem of adjusting product prices for quality change. The various approaches to the problem of quality adjustment can be seen as special cases of the general framework. The special cases include the use of inflation adjusted carry forward and carry backward prices, the use of hedonic regressions and the estimation of Hicksian reservation prices.
C43|Estimating the Benefits of New Products: Some Approximations|A major challenge facing statistical agencies is the problem of adjusting price and quantity indexes for changes in the availability of commodities. This problem arises in the scanner data context as products in a commodity stratum appear and disappear in retail outlets. Hicks suggested a reservation price methodology for dealing with this problem in the context of the economic approach to index number theory. Feenstra and Hausman suggested specific methods for implementing the Hicksian approach. The present paper evaluates these approaches and suggests some alternative approaches to the estimation of reservation prices. The various approaches are implemented using some scanner data on frozen juice products that are available online.
C43|Experimental Economics and the New Commodities Problem|Brynjolfsson, Collis, Diewert, Eggers and Fox (2018) have used experimental economics to measure the welfare benefits of free commodities. In this paper, their methodological approach is adapted to measuring the benefits of new commodities which may or may not be free. Their approach leads to a new method for estimating Hicksian reservation prices. The new methodology in the present paper requires experimental estimates for household willingness to pay for new commodities or estimates for the compensation required for households to give up their use of a new commodity.

C43|GDP-B: Accounting for the Value of New and Free Goods in the Digital Economy|The welfare contributions of the digital economy, characterized by the proliferation of new and free goods, are not well-measured in our current national accounts. We derive explicit terms for the welfare contributions of these goods and introduce a new metric, GDP-B which quantifies their benefits, rather than costs. We apply this framework to several empirical examples including Facebook and smartphone cameras and estimate their valuations through incentive compatible choice experiments. For example, including the welfare gains from Facebook would have added between 0.05 and 0.11 percentage points to GDP-B growth per year in the US.
C43|Productivity Indexes and National Statistics: Theory, Methods and Challenges|This paper reviews the theory underlying the index number approaches used by National Statistical Offices in the construction of productivity indexes. It reviews approaches for measuring output, labour and capital, and highlights persistent and emerging measurement problems.
C43|Housing Rent Dynamics and Rent Regulation in St. Petersburg (1880-1917)|This article studies the evolution of housing rents in St. Petersburg between 1880 and 1917, covering an eventful period of Russian and world history. We collect and digitize over 5,000 rental advertisements from a local newspaper, which we use together with geo-coded addresses and detailed structural characteristics to construct a quality-adjusted rent price index in continuous time.

C43|Owner Occupied Housing in the CPI and its Impact on Monetary Policy during Housing Booms and Busts| The treatment of owner-occupied housing (OOH) is probably the most important unresolved issue in inflation measurement. How -- and whether -- it is included in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) affects inflation expectations, the measured level of real interest rates, and the behavior of governments, central banks and market participants. We show that none of the existing treatments of OOH are fit for purpose. Hence we propose a new simplified user cost method with better properties. Using a micro-level dataset, we then compare the empirical behavior of eight different treatments of OOH. Our preferred user cost approach pushes up the CPI during housing booms (by 2 percentage points or more). Our findings relate to the following important debates in macroeconomics: the behavior of the Phillips curve in the US during the global financial crisis, and the response of monetary policy to housing booms, secular stagnation, and globalization.
C43|Anatomy of regional price differentials: Evidence from micro price data|Over the last three decades the supply of economic statistics has vastly improved. Unfortunately, statistics on regional price levels (sub-national purchasing power parities) have been exempt from this positive trend, even though they are indispensable for meaningful spatial comparisons of regional output, income, wages, productivity, standards of living, and poverty. To improve the situation, our paper demonstrates that a highly disaggregated and reliable regional price index can be compiled from data that already exist. We use the micro price data that have been collected for Germany's Consumer Price Index in May 2016. For the computation we introduce a multi-stage version of the Country-Product-Dummy method. The unique quality of our price data set allows us to depart from previous spatial price comparisons and to compare only exactly identical products. We find that the price levels of the 402 counties and cities of Germany are largely driven by the cost of housing and to a much lesser degree by the prices of goods and services. The overall price level in the most expensive region, Munich, is about 27 percent higher than in the cheapest region. Our results also reveal strong spatial autocorrelation.
C43|A novel housing price misalignment indicator for Germany|From 2014 until present, housing prices in Germany have been rising faster than consumer prices in all quarters except one, raising concerns about an excessive over-heating of the housing market. To assess the vulnerability of the German housing market to a future realignment of prices or even a housing bust, this paper develops a housing price misalignment indicator that is composed of seven indicators, which are commonly associated with the fundamental value of residential property. An empirical application to the most recent data suggests that the German housing market exhibits an overvaluation of approximately 11%, where interest rate risk and a relatively advanced stage of the housing cycle are identified as the main factors fueling these imbalances, while a rather solid debt-servicing capacity mitigates these imbalances since end-2009.
C43|What drives total real unit energy costs globally? A novel LMDI decomposition approach|This paper presents a novel logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition framework that is tailor-made for unit cost indicators. It adds four new models to the existing LMDI model family. The main novelty of the new framework lies in the separation of quantity and price effects captured in unit cost indicators, while retaining the same desirable properties of traditional models. Four case studies apply the novel LMDI framework to the total real unit energy costs (total RUEC) indicator. Total RUEC represents the sum of direct energy costs (for energy products) and indirect energy costs (energy costs embedded in intermediate inputs and passed on along global value chains) as a fraction of value added. This yardstick allows for monitoring shifts in the burden of energy costs on industries. The first three case studies, based on the World Input-Output Database, cover the period between 1995 and 2009. For an up-to-date analysis, a fourth case study collects additional data for 2009-2016 from energy and economic statistics' institutions. Globally, up until 2009, rising costs for crude petroleum/natural gas and the rise of China in the global economy were the largest drivers of total RUEC. In general, increases of indirect energy costs were more substantial than were those of direct energy costs. The total RUEC of Chinese car manufacturers increased much more strongly than did that of American car manufacturers. After 2009 (until 2016), prices for crude petroleum/natural gas and value added generation were major decelerating factors of global direct RUEC, while increases in energy consumption had offsetting effects. This paper provides a suitable tool to scientists who want to build on unit cost indicators in their research in general and to all policy-oriented institutions concerned with monitoring and analysing the energy transition in particular.
C43|Divisia monetary aggregates for a heterogeneous euro area|We introduce a Divisia monetary aggregate for the euro area that accounts for the heterogeneity across member countries both, in terms of interest rates and the decomposition of monetary assets. In most of the euro area countries, the difference between the growth rates of the country-specific Divisia aggregate and its simple sum counterpart is particularly pronounced before recessions. The results obtained from a panel probit model confirm that the divergence between the Divisia and the simple sum aggregate has a significant predictive content for recessions in euro area countries.
C43|The economic importance of the Belgian ports : Flemish maritime ports, Liège port complex and the port of Brussels – Report 2017|This Working Paper analyses the economic importance of the Belgian ports largely based on annual accounts data for the year 2017. As the years prior to 2017 have been described in earlier papers in the same series, the emphasis lies on the ﬁgures for 2017 and the developments between 2016 and 2017 . After the stagnation in 2016, direct value added at the Belgian ports rose by 7.3% from € 18 052 million to € 19 368 million (current prices) or roughly 4.4% of Belgium’s GDP. All ports, with the exception of the Liège port complex, contributed to value added growth at the Belgian ports. The ports of Antwerp and Ghent were the most important players. The biggest contributing sectors to value added growth were the chemical industry and, to a lesser extent, cargo handling and the metalworking industry. In 2017, indirect value added was around 82% of direct value added. Direct value added increased significantly at the ports of Ghent, Brussels and Antwerp, by 13.4%, 16.0% and 6.1% respectively. The increase by more than 3% of direct value added at the ports of Zeebrugge and Ostend was also substantial. Direct value added fell by 2.4% at the Liège port complex. After the decline between 2012 and 2015, direct employment at the Belgian ports was up for the second year in a row. Between 2016 and 2017, the number of direct full-time equivalent jobs rose by 0.8%, from 115 401 to 116 311 or approximately 2.8% of Belgium’s total domestic employment. All ports, with the exception of Ostend and Brussels, contributed to employment growth at the Belgian ports. The ports of Antwerp and Ghent were the most important players. The biggest contributing sectors to employment growth were cargo handling and, to a lesser extent, the chemical industry. In 2017, indirect employment was around 120% of direct employment. Direct employment increased by around 1% at the ports of Antwerp, Ghent and Zeebrugge. Growth at the Liège port complex was more modest at 0.4%. The number of direct full-time equivalent jobs fell at the ports of Ostend and Brussels, by 1.2% and 4.2% respectively. The pattern of investment is closely linked to projects and is therefore highly volatile. After the decline between 2012 and 2014, direct investment at the Belgian ports was up for the third year in a row. Between 2016 and 2017, investment was up by 2.4%, from € 4 711 million to € 4 825 million. The port of Ghent and, to a lesser extent, the Liège port complex contributed to investment growth at the Belgian ports. The biggest contributing sectors to investment growth were the ‘port construction and dredging’ sector and, to a lesser extent, cargo handling, and the energy and chemical industries. Based on the figures of the traffic, the Flemish ports can be considered as real bridgeheads for trade with the UK. Developments regarding the modalities and consequences of the Brexit therefor should be followed with the greatest attention. Given the existing import and export volumes in terms of tonnage, it seems it will mostly be a challenge in Zeebrugge and to some extent for Antwerp. As a supplier to both China and the United States, Belgium is indirectly involved in trade between the two countries. If protectionism would close the United States off to exports from abroad, Belgian economy might get impacted one of the most in Europe.

C43|GDP is a measure of output, not welfare. Or, HOS meets the SNA|What effect, if any, do changes in the terms of trade have on the level of output (GDP) or welfare? I examine this issue through two versions of a textbook, Hecksher-Ohlin-Samuelson (HOS), two-good model of a small, open economy. In the first version both goods are for final consumption. In the second, one good is an imported intermediate input into the other. In both versions, economic theory suggests that an improvement in the terms of trade raises welfare (consumption) but leaves aggregate output (GDP) unchanged. This follows from a continuous-time analysis using Divisia index numbers. I then show that a national income accountant applying the principles of the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA) would reach the same conclusions.
C43|Measuring consumer inflation in a digital economy|The effect on the household consumption price index from possible sources of error in capturing digital products depends on the weight of the affected products. To calculate upper bounds for this effect, we apply weights based on the average structure of household consumption in OECD countries to a maximum plausible overstatement of price change for each affected or potentially affected product. The products account for about 35% of household expenditure in 2005, declining to 32% in 2015. The upper bound simulation effect on the growth rate of the consumption deflator is somewhat less than –0.6 percentage points in 2015 – large enough to improve the picture of GDP and productivity growth in advanced economies. However, this would not overturn the conclusion that productivity growth has slowed substantially compared over the past decades.
C43|Publication Performance and Number of Authors – Evidence for World Top Economists|In social sciences the measurement of performance is usually done giving the full credit of each paper to all its authors. Aiming to analyze the impact of the number of authors on the performance results, we propose an adjustment to the h-index that is flexible enough to allow the consideration of distinct co-authorship weighting schemes. We then evaluate the publication performance of the members of the departments of economics of the top 10 world universities (472 authors; 15,243 papers). Our results show that the number of authors per paper is rapidly increasing and that this dimension measurably affects the final ranking of authors even in a scientific area in which the average number of authors is lower than in physical and life sciences.
C43|The Ordinal Input for Cardinal Output Approach of Non-compensatory Composite Indicators: The PROMETHEE Scoring Method|Despite serious threats as to their soundness, the adoption of composite indicators is constantly growing alongside their popularity, especially when it comes to their adoption in policy-making exercises. This study presents a robust non-compensatory approach to construct composite indicators mainly based, at least with respect to the basic ideas, on the classic Borda scoring procedure. The non- compensatory indicators we are proposing can be seen as aggregation of ordinal non-compensatory preferences between considered units supplying a numerical cardinal comprehensive evaluation. For this reason we define our methodology, the ordinal input for cardinal output non-compensatory approach for composite indicators. To take into account hesitation, imprecision and ill-determination in defining preference relations with respect to the elementary indices, we adopt the PROMETHEE methods, whose net flow score can be seen as an extension to the fuzzy preferences of the Borda score. Moreover, we systematically deal with robustness of the results with respect to weighting and parameters such as indifference and preference thresholds, permitting to define preference relations of elementary indices. In this regard, we couple PROMETHEE methods with the recently proposed σ−μ approach, which permits to explore the whole domain of feasible preference parameters mentioned above, giving a synthetic representation of the distribution of the values assumed by the composite indicators in terms of mean, μ, and standard deviation, σ. μ and σ are also used to define a comprehensive overall composite indicator. Finally, we enrich the results of this analysis with a set of graphical visualizations based on principal component analysis applied to the PROMETHEE methods with the GAIA technique, providing better understanding of the outcomes of our approach. To illustrate its assets, we provide a case study of inclusive development evaluation, based on the data of the homonymous report produced by the World Economic Forum.
C43|Mengukur Perkembangan Sektor Keuangan di Indonesia dan Faktor – Faktor yang Mempengaruhi<BR>[Assessing the Measurement and Determinants of Financial Sector Development in Indonesia]|In a number of occasions during the bad times where financial markets are under pressure, Indonesia often suffers the most compared to neighbors or peer countries. It indicates that there is something fundamental as the driving factors and the depth of the Indonesian financial sector may be the major factor. This research aims to investigate how deep and develop the Indonesian financial sector using multiple indicators and metrics. This research also investigates the causal relationship between financial sector development and the economic growth whether the Indonesian financial sector is supply-leading or demand-following. Moreover, this research attempts to identify the determinants of the financial sector development in Indonesia. The results show that the development of the Indonesian financial sector has been focused on the access aspect, while the development of its depth as well as efficiency is still limited. The depth level by the end of 2018 was even still lower than the level in the mid-1990s. The research's results also show that the financial sector development in Indonesia is demand-following or it develops as the economy grows. Lastly, the results show that the financial sector development in Indonesia is affected by multi-aspect factors ranging from macroeconomic factors and institutions to the openness levels either trade openness or financial openness. On those many structural aspects, Indonesia is inferior compared with many countries, so it is not a coincidence that the Indonesian financial sector is less developed compared to the many countries.
C43|Local Circularity of Six Classic Price Indexes|In this paper we characterize local circularity for the Laspeyres, Paasche and Fisher price indexes. In the first two cases we begin by deriving a sufficient condition for achieving circularity that establishes that at least one of two proposed equalities must hold. We end up showing that the sufficient condition is also necessary. We continue with the Fisher price index that is the geometric mean of the two, and we find a sufficient circularity condition that is a direct consequence of the corresponding sufficient conditions for its two component indexes. However we also show that, unlike its Laspeyres and Paasche components, this sufficient circularity condition for the Fisher price index is not necessary. We reach different conclusions when we consider the circularity properties of the geometric Laspeyres, geometric Paasche and TÃ¶rnqvist price indexes, for which none of the proposed sufficient conditions is necessary. Throughout we distinguish local circularity, which all six price indexes satisfy, from global circularity, which none of the price indexes satisfies.
C43|Aggregation of Efficiency and Productivity: From Firm to Sector and Higher Levels|Here we consider various cases where researchers are interested in measuring aggregate efficiency or productivity levels or their changes for a group of decision making units. These could be entire industry composed of individual firms, banks, hospitals, or a region composed of sub-regions or countries, or particular sub-groups of these units within a group, e.g., sub-groups of public vs. private or regulated vs. non-regulated firms, banks or hospitals within the same industry, etc. Such analysis requires solutions to the aggregation problem some theoretically justified approaches that can connect individual measures to aggregate measures. Various solutions are offered in the literature and our goal is to try to coherently summarize at least some of them in this chapter. This material should be interesting not only for theorists but also (and perhaps more so) for applied researchers, as it provides exact formulas and intuitive explanations for various measures of group efficiency, group scale elasticity and group productivity indexes and refers to original papers for more details.
C43|Statistical Inference for Aggregation of Malmquist Productivity Indices|The Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) has gained popularity amongst studies on dynamic change of productivity of decision making units (DMUs). In practice, this index is frequently reported at aggregate levels (e.g., public and private rms) in the form of simple equally-weighted arithmetic or geometric means of individual MPIs. A number of studies have emphasized that it is necessary to account for the relative importance of individual DMUs in the aggregations of indices in general and of MPI in particular. While more suitable aggregations of MPIs have been introduced in the literature, their statistical properties have not been revealed yet, preventing applied researchers from making essential statistical inferences such as con dence intervals and hypothesis testing. In this paper, we will ll this gap by developing a full asymptotic theory for an appealing aggregation of MPIs. On the basis of this, some meaningful statistical inferences are proposed and their nite-sample performances are veri ed via extensive Monte Carlo experiments.
C43|Hicks Neutrality and Homotheticity in Technologies with Multiple Inputs and Multiple Outputs|We analyse two popular notions in production theory: the notion of Hicks neutral technical change and the notion of homothetic technology. Both of these notions are characterized by the radial expansions or contractions of the relevant isoquants, yet in different ways. In the case of multiple-input and multiple-output, an isoquant is characterized by either the input or output combinations. Thus, for each of these notions, there are two types of conditions: one is based on the input isoquants and the other is based on the output isoquants. We show that for each notion, these two conditions are equivalent under the ð ›¼-returns to scale technology. From this result, we also derive several implications for the properties of well-known productivity indexes, such as the Malmquist productivity index and the Hicks-Moorsteen productivity index.
C43|Reducing Informality Using Two-Sided Incentives: Theory and Experiment|We study the impact of two-sided incentives on the reduction of informality. We model those incentives using the notion of network externalities, which link the (formal or informal) merchant’s profits to the type of customers they serve (formal or informal). Our theoretical framework yields two straightforward testable implications: the merchant will find more profitable to become formal (or informal), as long as more of their customers are formal (or informal); and, formal and informal commercial sectors may coexist in equilibrium. We test these hypotheses using data from a field experiment, conducted with micro and small enterprises in Lima, Peru. Our subjects had to choose, in a repeated fashion, among three ‘platforms’, which proxy for being formal, informal, or performing a reservation activity. We then changed the relative size of the network of formal vis-á-vis informal customers, in order to calculate the consumer’s network externality. We find that the network externality is relatively large, a result that opens up the possibility to reduce commercial informality using two-sided incentives. Moreover, the platform choice between the formal and informal sectors is sensitive to risk preferences.
C43|Estimación del Consumo a partir de sus Componentes Principales en la Tabla Insumo-Producto|Una forma de entender el consumo privado es subdividir esta variable macroeconómica agregada en sus componentes y estudiar las partes. En este documento se estima el comportamiento de los componentes más importantes del consumo privado al cual se denomina componentes principales. Tomando como punto de inicio la información de la Tabla Insumo Producto para distintos años, se utiliza un conjunto de variables proxi para cada componente a partir de los cuales se obtiene una distribución del consumo por componente para cada año. Los componentes restantes forman parte de una serie denominada Otros, cuyo rol es de disciplinar los resultados mediante el registro de ciertas regularidades en su conducta. Esta metodología permite proyectar el consumo privado con un bajo error de proyección.
C43|Explaining and measuring tolerant behavior|In recent studies, there has been a growing interest towards tolerance and its implications in the socio-economic system. This paper aims to contribute to this flourishing research area into two directions. First, we develop a theoretical framework to explain individual’s tolerant attitudes without necessarily resorting to altruistic preferences. Second, this paper addresses the issue of measuring tolerance when information about several dimensions of tolerance is available and data are of Likert’s scale type. To show how our new measure of tolerance works in practice, we carry out a case study using an Italian recent survey asking the opinion of university students about different subjects, such as interreligious dialogue, women/religion relationship, religion/death relationship, multicultural society, and homosexuality. We, finally, highlight the key policy implications arising from our study.
C43|Anatomy of Regional Price Differentials: Evidence From Micro Price Data|Over the last three decades the supply of economic statistics has vastly improved. Unfortunately, statistics on regional price levels (sub- national purchasing power parities) have been exempt from this positive trend, even though they are indispensable for meaningful spatial comparisons of regional output, income, wages, productivity, standards of living, and poverty. To improve the situation, our paper demonstrates that a highly disaggregated and reliable regional price index can be compiled from data that already exist. We use the micro price data that have been collected for Germany’s Consumer Price Index in May 2016. For the computation we introduce a multi-stage version of the Country-Product-Dummy method. The unique quality of our price data set allows us to depart from previous spatial price comparisons and to compare only exactly identical products. We find that the price levels of the 402 counties and cities of Germany are largely driven by the cost of housing and to a much lesser degree by the prices of goods and services. The overall price level in the most expensive region, Munich, is about 27 percent higher than in the cheapest region. Our results also reveal strong spatial autocorrelation.
C43|Evaluating multilateral price indices in a dynamic item universe|Statistics Norway has a long history of using scanner data in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The early research – in Norway as well as internationally – was focused on supermarket data which consists largely of stable items. The attention has since gradually shifted towards the parts of consumption market that are characterized by high item churn, where the methodology initially introduced for supermarket data is no longer adequate. Several National Statistical Institutes (NSIs) including Statistics Norway have been researching on a more generic scanner data methodology. The overall goal is to implement an approach that incorporates expenditure shares at the most detailed level without suffering from chain drift, and that works well across different commodity groups including those with high item churn. A variety of methods and index formulas are currently being tested and implemented for CPIs in different parts of the world. We propose a systematic approach to the investigation process, which has recently been developed at Statistics Norway. This consists mainly of two parts: a Total Effect Framework (TEF), and a set of generic diagnostics. The TEF is defined by the necessary choices required and the elements that affect these choices and we review, synthesize and develop a set of generic diagnostics. Most indices employed in such diagnostics are not genuine candidates for real production, but they are designed and introduced to generate useful empirical evidences, on which a plausible final choice of index method can be based. We shall illustrate the generic diagnostics using scanner datasets mainly from the markets of sport equipment which have high item churn. To this end we summarize our own experiences and put forward some preliminary conclusions of a generic scanner data price index methodology.
C43|A New Index Score for the Assessment of Firm Financial Risks|There are several indicators and univariate ratios that measure the soundness of firms' balance sheets (Leverage, profitability, liquidity ratio, etc.). However, each indicator alone cannot measure the overall financial risk or the financial distress level of firms. In this study, we measure the financial strength of the real sector firms quoted in Borsa Istanbul (BIST) by producing a composite index score which is a combination of several different corporate finance ratios. In the first part, we will apply multiple discriminant analysis to the variables used in Altman Z-score (1968), which is the most prevalent composite index score measuring the firms’ financial risks in the literature. In the second part, a new index, named as MFA-score (Multivariate Firm Assessment Score) will be introduced by using the ratios that best explain the characteristics of the BIST companies. Both the tailored version of Altman Z-score and our new index score have a predictive power around 90 percent. Furthermore, MFA-score is capable of detecting the impact of macro-economic developments on firm balance sheets, which enables us to use MFA-score as an early warning indicator of financial distress for Turkish firms. Our analyses with MFA-score suggest that non-exporter firms and firms with FX open position have relatively weaker balance sheets.
C43|An Axiomatic Characterization of a Generalized Ecological Footprint|The purpose of this paper is to propose an axiomatic characterization of ecological footprint indices. Using an axiomatic approach, we de?ne a set of axioms to represent the properties considered appropriate to ecological footprint measures in general. It can be shown that there exists a generalized index which is unique up to a strictly increasing function of the world land area appropriated to satisfy human needs. As an implication, the well-known compound-based footprint index used by the Global Footprint Network can be characterized as a speci?cation of the generalized index, only if proportionality in world land area use is additionally assumed and the norm is arbitrarily ?xed, in terms of global hectares. Instead, we ?nd that the applied methodology of normalization and standardization in the aggregation procedure of footprint indices is completely dispensible. In this respect, the proposition of generalized and axiomatically characterized indices for the measurement of the ecological footprint of human activity may be considered as the main contribution of the paper.
C43|Money's causal role in exchange rate: Do divisia monetary aggregates explain more?|We investigate the power of Divisia monetary aggregates in predicting exchange rate variations for India, Israel, Poland, the UK, and the US in the years leading up to and following the 2007–08 recession, during which the interest rates for some major economies have been stuck at or near the zero lower bound (ZLB). Consequently, the interest rate has become uninformative regarding the stance of monetary policies. As an important innovation, our research adopts the Divisia monetary aggregate as an alternative to the policy indicator variable. We apply the bootstrap Granger causality method, which is robust to the presence of non-stationarity in our data. We also apply bootstrap rolling window estimates to account for the parameter non-constancy and structural breaks in our sample. We find a strong causality from Divisia money to exchange rates and further highlight the importance of Divisia at ZLB by capturing the time-varying link between these variables.
C43|Productivity growth, firm turnover and new varieties|In this paper, we reconcile two different strands of the literature: the literature on how new goods impact prices and the literature on productivity growth and firm turnover. The decomposition we propose generalises the framework currently used in the literature. Moreover, we extend the estimator for the demand elasticity, proposed by Feenstra (1994) and supplemented by Soderbery (2015). To illustrate the decomposition and estimator, we analyse the case of firm turnover in Norway. Our results indicate that net creation of new varieties from firm turnover contributes by about one half percentage point to annual aggregate productivity growth.
C43|The Digital Economy, New Products and Consumer Welfare|Benefits of the Digital Economy are evident in everyday life, but there are significant concerns that these benefits may not be appropriately reflected in official statistics. The measurement of the net benefits of new and disappearing products depends on what type of price index the statistical agency is using to deflate final demand aggregates. We examine this measurement problem when the agency uses any standard price index formula for its deflation of a value aggregate, such as GDP. We also apply the methodology to the problem of measuring the effects of product substitutions for disappearing items. Our exact expressions for biases inherent in different approaches provide a theoretical basis and framework for the emerging empirical literature on new goods and services, and for assessing the quality adjustment methodologies used in practice.
C43|Fiscal Rules for Sub-central Governments: Design and Impact|Against a background of mounting demands for spending on services provided by sub-central governments, this paper examines how fiscal rules can help to ensure that pressure on resources is minimised and available resources are used efficiently. Drawing on questionnaire responses and other sources, this paper gives a detailed picture of fiscal rules for sub-central governments in place among a number of OECD countries. The paper examines the rationales for using fiscal rules, the various impacts fiscal rules can have, the factors making for effective implementation and the interactions between the various types of rule. It then constructs a number of synthetic sub-indicators designed to assess the extent to which sub-central government fiscal frameworks exhibit favourable characteristics for the achievement of fiscal objectives. It concludes with the construction of a composite indicator based on the combined impacts in the different areas of fiscal policy. Règles budgétaires des collectivités territoriales : Leurs caractéristiques et leur impact Face à l’augmentation des dépenses au titre des services assurés par les collectivités territoriales, cette étude examine comment les règles budgétaires peuvent contribuer à atténuer les pressions sur les ressources et à garantir une utilisation efficiente des ressources disponibles. S’appuyant sur les réponses à des questionnaires et sur d’autres sources, elle présente une description détaillée des règles budgétaires applicables aux collectivités territoriales dans plusieurs pays de l’OCDE. Elle analyse les raisons qui motivent l’utilisation de règles budgétaires, les divers effets que ces règles peuvent avoir, les facteurs qui contribuent à l’efficacité de leur mise en œuvre et les interactions entre les divers types de règles. Un certain nombre d’indicateurs synthétiques sont ensuite élaborés dans le but de déterminer dans quelle mesure les règles budgétaires des collectivités territoriales présentent des caractéristiques favorisant la réalisation des objectifs de finances publiques. L’étude s’achève par la construction d’un indicateur composite des effets combinés dans les différents domaines de la politique budgétaire.
C43|Market mechanisms in public service provision|This paper compares and analyses the use of market mechanisms in core sub-central policy areas, namely education, health care, transport, social protection, and environment. Arrangements like tendering, outsourcing, user choice and competition, user fees and performance-related funding can help to improve quality of service provision or lower its cost. With around 32% of total public expenditure and often wide-ranging spending powers, sub-central governments (SCG) have considerable leeway for improving their services by relying on market mechanisms. The decentralised and often fragmented nature of sub-central government poses some special challenges to efficient arrangements, however, and may require central government support or stronger inter-jurisdictional co-operation. And while market mechanisms are being harnessed ever more broadly, limits to a more extensive use have become apparent, particularly in the potential trade-off between greater efficiency and equity objectives, or between efficiency and sub-central accountability..
C43|The spending power of sub-central governments: A pilot study|This pilot study presents indicators that assess sub-central government (SCG) spending power by policy area. Traditional indicators – such as the share of SCG in total government spending – are often misleading as they underestimate the impact of central government regulation on sub-central spending patterns. In order to gauge true spending power, a set of institutional indicators is established, based on a detailed assessment of institutional, regulatory and administrative control central government exerts over various SCG policy areas. Results tend to confirm the limited discretion of SCGs over their own budget. Education in particular – the main SCG budget item in most countries – is strongly shaped by central government regulation. Federal countries tend to grant more spending power to SCGs than unitary countries.
C43|What matters the most to people?: Evidence from the OECD Better Life Index users’ responses|The OECD Better Life Index is an interactive composite index that aggregates average measures of country’s well-being outcomes through weights defined by users. This paper studies these weights by analysing the responses given by close to 130 000 users since 2011 to date. The paper has three goals. First, to investigate the factors shaping users’ preferences over a set of 11 well-being dimensions. Second, to provide insights into users’ preferences for a large group of countries which differ in terms of culture and living conditions. Third, to test for the effects of users’ satisfaction with respect to a given well-being dimension on the weight they attach to it, across different population groups. Various empirical models are used to identify responses’ patterns and see whether they can be accounted for by respondents’ characteristics and their perceived well-being. The paper finds that health status, education and life satisfaction are the aspects that matter the most for BLI users in OECD countries. Men assign more importance to income than women, while women value community and work-life balance more than men. Health, safety, housing and civic engagement become more important with age, while life satisfaction, work-life balance, jobs, income and community are particularly important for youth. There are also clear regional patterns in the choices by BLI users; for instance education, jobs and civic engagement are particularly important in South America while personal safety and work-life balance matter a lot in Asia-Pacific. Analysis carried out on a subset of observations (i.e. BLI-users who completed an extended questionnaire) finds that, for several well-being dimensions (i.e. jobs, housing, community, health, education, civic engagement, personal safety, life satisfaction and work-life balance), there is a positive and linear relationship between individual preferences and self-reported satisfaction in the same dimension, with evidence of distinctly different patterns of association within the population in the case of income and education.
C43|The Democrat-Republican growth gap paradox|Economic performance has been historically better under Democrat presidents compared to Republican ones. This gap has not yet been fully explained appealing to better management or luck. In fact, the economic cycles under one group of administrations or the other are quite similar. Blinder and Watson (2016) provide the best attempt so far at solving the paradox, but can explain only half of the gap. Drawing from them, and using a different method to account for the initial conditions of each presidential term, we are able to show that the phase of the economic cycle at the different elections are correlated to the party of the president. We also find ample evidence suggesting that there is a subtle causality: when the unemployment is high, the probability of a person voting for a Democrat president increases, thus causing Democrats being elected more often at the end of a recession and the beginning of a recovery. This, and not the difference in competence dealing with the economic cycles, is enough to close the gap.
C43|The Financial Connectedness between Eurozone Core and Periphery: A Disaggregated View|This paper examines the financial stress interconnectedness among GIIPS economies and Germany. Based on market level financial stress indices, it examines the stress transmission process as well as the causal network relationships in banking sector, bond, money and stock markets. The period under investigation, 2001-2013, allows to test the effects of financial crisis of 2008 as well as the subsequent European sovereign crisis. Using two alternative techniques for connectedness analysis, our evidence suggests that the peripheral economies of Italy and Spain play a highly significant role in the stress transmission in all markets, especially in the cases of banks and equity markets. Moreover, we visualize our results using network analysis. Contrary to common wisdom, Portugal, Ireland, and mainly Greece, do not seem to have an important role in amplifying stress levels.
C43|σ-µ efficiency analysis: A new methodology for evaluating units through composite indices|We propose a new methodology to employ composite indicators for performance analysis of units of interest using Stochastic Multiattribute Acceptability Analysis. We start evaluating each unit by means of weighted sums of their elementary indicators in the whole set of admissible weights. For each unit, we compute the mean, µ, and the standard deviation, σ, of its evaluations. Clearly, the former has to be maximized, while the latter has to be minimized as it denotes instability in the evaluations with respect to the variability of weights. We consider a unit to be Pareto-Koopmans efficient with respect to µ and σ if there is no convex combination of µ and σ of the rest of the units with a value of µ that is not smaller, and a value of σ that is not greater, with at least one strict inequality. The set of all Pareto-Koopmans efficient units constitutes the first Pareto-Koopmans frontier. By removing this set and computing the efficiency frontier for the rest of the units, one could obtain the second Pareto-Koopmans frontier. Analogously, the third, fourth and so on Pareto-Koopmans frontiers can be defined. This permits to assign each unit to one of this sequence of Pareto-Koopmans frontiers. We measure the efficiency of each unit not only with respect to the first Pareto-Koopmans frontier, as in the classic Data Envelopment Analysis, but also with respect to the rest of the frontiers, thus enhancing the explicative power of the proposed approach. To illustrate its potential, we apply it to a case study of world happiness based on the data of the homonymous report, annually produced by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Solutions Network.
C43|The Effects of Temporal Aggregation on Search Engine Data|Using structured machine learning, this paper examines the effect that temporal aggregation has on big data from Google Analytics and Google Trends. Specifically, daily and weekly data from the Charleston Area Convention and Visitors Bureau (CACVB) website from January 2008 to March 2009 via Google Analytics and weekly, monthly, and quarterly data from Google Trends for seven economic variables from 2004 to 2011 are examined. Taking into account the different levels of aggregation, the CDFs and the estimated regression results are examined. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test rejects the null of equivalent data distributions in the vast majority of cases for the CACVB data, but this is not the case for the economic variable. Through data mining, this paper also finds that aggregation has the potential of affecting the level of integration and the regression results for both the CACVB data and the seven economic variables.
C43|A set of state space models at an high disaggregation level to forecast Italian Industrial Production|Normally econometric models that forecast Italian Industrial Production Index do not exploit pieces of information already available at time t+1 for its own main industry groupings. A new strategy is sketched here using state space models and aggregating the estimates to obtain improved results. The endogenous variables available at time t+1 are Consumption of Electricity, Compressed Natural Gas distributed on its own net, Production of Compressed Natural Gas, Registration of commercial vehicles for Italy, Germany, France and Spain. Unfortunately for the other main industry groupings there are not available variables not prone to high revisions. A new strategy exploiting univariate or bivariate state space models for these time series is used. The issue coming out from holidays taken during Tuesday or Friday will be tackled. How to handle in-sample forecast with different aggregating weights will be considered for the period before the first of January of 2010 where is impossible to use the same structure for the base year 2010.
C43|Africa on the maps of global values. Comparative analyses, based on recent World Values Survey data|This paper attempts to close a gap in the recent literature on African economic development: the place of Africa on the maps of global economic, political and social values. We develop new comparable indices of global value development from the latest set of World Values Survey data and determine Africa’s place on a new factor analytical index of Global Civil Society. Our statistical calculations were performed by the routine and standard SPSS statistical program (SPSS XXIV), available at many academic research centers around the world and relied on the so-called oblique rotation of the factors, underlying the correlation matrix. The SPSS routine chosen in this context was the so-called promax rotation of factors, which in many ways must be considered to be the best suited rotation of factors in the context of our research. Our analysis of the World Values Survey data derived the following factor analytical scales, well compatible with a large social scientific literature: 1. The non-violent and law-abiding society 2. Democracy movement 3. Climate of personal non-violence 4. Trust in institutions 5. Happiness, good health 6. No redistributive religious fundamentalism 7. Accepting the market 8. Feminism 9. Involvement in politics 10. Optimism and engagement 11. No welfare mentality, acceptancy of the Calvinist work ethics The spread in the performance of African countries with complete data is really amazing. While we are especially hopeful about the development of future democracy in Ghana, our article suggests pessimistic tendencies for Egypt and Algeria, and especially for Africa’s leading economy, South Africa. High Human Inequality, as measured by the UNDP’s Human Development Report’s Index of Human Inequality, further impairs the development of Human Security. One can maintain that the certain recent optimism, corresponding to economic and human rights data, emerging from Africa, is reflected also in our Index of the Development of Civil Society. There is at least some hope for Africa, on this front, too. JEL Classification Numbers: C43, F5, Z12, D73
C43|Monetary Services Aggregation under Uncertainty: A Behavioral Economics Extension Using Choquet Expectation|A central tenet of behavioral economics is that the axioms producing expected utility maximization by consumers are too strong to be descriptive of rational behavior. The existing theory of monetary services aggregation under risk assume expected utility maximization. We extend those results to uncertainty under weaker axiomatic assumptions by using Choquet expectations. Choquet integration reduces to Riemann integration as a special case under the stronger assumption of additive probability measure, not accepted in the literature on behavioral economics. Our theoretical results on monetary services aggregation are generalizations of prior results, nested as special cases of our results under stronger behavioral assumptions.
C43|The return of religious Antisemitism? The evidence from World Values Survey data|1) Background: This paper addresses the return of religious Antisemitism by a multivariate analysis of global opinion data from 28 countries. 2) Methods: For the lack of any available alternative we used the World Values Survey (WVS) Antisemitism study item: rejection of Jewish neighbors. It is closely correlated with the recent ADL-100 Index of Antisemitism for more than 100 countries. To test the combined effects of religion and background variables like gender, age, education, income and life satisfaction on Antisemitism, we applied the full range of multivariate analysis including promax factor analysis and multiple OLS regression. 3) Results: Although religion as such still seems to be connected with the phenomenon of Antisemitism, intervening variables such as restrictive attitudes on gender and the religion-state relationship play an important role. Western Evangelical and Oriental Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism are performing badly on this account, and there is also a clear global North-South divide for these phenomena. 4) Conclusions: Challenging patriarchic gender ideologies and fundamentalist conceptions of the relationship between religion and state, which are important drivers of Antisemitism, will be an important task in the future. Multiculturalism must be aware of prejudice, patriarchy and religious fundamentalism in the global South.
C43|Achieving Sustainable Development Goals in MENA countries: an Analytical and Econometric Approach|This paper assesses the achievements and disparties toward SDGs in MENA countries in two-stage performance analysis. First, we use a descriptive approach and then a composite indicator ‘SDG achievement index’ (SDGI) for the social develoment in the the region through Principle Component Analysis weighting. After that, the analysis examines the coherence between this index and income per capita. The descriptive analysis and the composite indicator confirm the existence of disparties between the countries of the region in all components of social development. Furthermore, the results reveal consistency between the SDGI and GDP per capita for some countries and inconsistency for others.
C43|Convexity, Disposability and Returns to Scale in Production Analysis|Adequate modelling of undesirable outputs is a key aspect for any performance analysis of economic systems. A nonparametric approach assuming jointly weak disposability of desirable and undesirable outputs inspired by Shephard (1974) has gained substantial popularity in addressing this issue. Recently, researchers were offered an alternative that is to use multiple scaling factors (rather than a single one as in the Shephardâ€™s (1974) approach) when imposing weak disposability in practice. In this paper we discover new properties and relationships between the two approaches, which in turn sheds some new light on the problem and offers reconciling solutions.
C43|Aggregation of Individual Efficiency Measures and Productivity Indices|Here we consider the problem of aggregation of efficiency and productivity indices. We will summarize some of the existing results and will derive new results for aggregation of Hicks-Moorsteen productivity indices.
C43|Some Mathematical and Historical Clarifications on Aggregation in Efficiency and Productivity Analysis and Connection to Economic Theory|In this note we clarify a few important aspects about aggregation in efficiency and productivity analysis. By doing so we also sketch a brief historical map on how the area of aggregation in efficiency and productivity analysis has been developing to where it is now and its connection to classic studies in economic theory.
C43|Defining a new graph inefficiency measure for the Proportional Directional Distance Function and introducing a new Malmquist productivity index|A natural multiplicative efficiency measure for the Constant Returns to Scale Proportional Directional Distance Function (pDDF) is derived, relating its associated linear program to that of the well-known output-oriented radial efficiency measurement model. Based on this relationship, a Malmquist index is introduced to show that, when it is based on the new efficiency measure associated with the pDDF, rather than on a radial efficiency measure associated with an oriented distance function, it becomes a Total Factor Productivity (TFP) index. This constitutes a new result, because heretofore the traditional Malmquist index has not been considered a TFP index. Additionally, a new decomposition of the Malmquist index is proposed that expresses productivity change as the ratio of two components, productivity change due to output change in the numerator and productivity change due to input change in the denominator. In an Appendix the efficiency measure is extended to include any returns to scale pDDF.
C43|Econometric Perspectives on Economic Measurement|It turns out that price index functions share a basic interpretation; practically all of them measure a change in some average of quality-adjusted prices. The different options are distinguished by their choice of average, their definition of quality, and their stance on what I label 'equal interest'. This new perspective updates the so-called stochastic approach to choosing index functions. It also offers new avenues to understand and tackle measurement problems. I discuss three examples.
C43|Constructing the Asia-Pacific Regional Cooperation and Integration Index: A Panel Approach|This paper proposes a panel approach in the construction of the Asia-Pacific Regional Cooperation and Integration Index (ARCII) to strengthen the indexâ€™s ability to track the progress of economic integration in the region over time. Panel-based procedures are employed in imputing missing values, normalizing raw data, and deriving dimensional and subdimensional weights via principal components analysis. Findings suggest the pace of integration in Asia was broadly steady over the 11-year sample period (2006â€“2016). However, modest gains have been made as a majority of economies in the sample have moved up in their levels of regional integration from 2006 to 2016. Of the six dimensions featured in the ARCII, trade and investment and movement of people are the main drivers of regional integration, while the money and finance dimension was the weakest link. Based on global normalization, Asia comes second to the European Union (EU) in progress on regional integration, but in recent years a few Asian economies have broken through to the top tier dominated by the EU economies.
C43|Does Regional Integration Matter for Inclusive Growth? Evidence from the Multidimensional Regional Integration Index|This paper employs a multidimensional approach to gauge the degree of regional integration and analyze impact on growth, inequality, and poverty. It constructs a multidimensional regional integration index (MDRII) series that embodies six key facets of regional integration: (i) trade and investment, (ii) money and finance, (iii) regional value chains, (iv) infrastructure and connectivity, (v) movement of people, and (vi) institutional and social integration. The MDRII confirms that regional integration is most advanced in the European Union which scores high in all six dimensions; Asia comes second with the largest contribution from infrastructure and connectivity. Empirical analysis suggests significant and positive development impact of regional integration even when trade and financial openness is controlled. The regional value chain, movement of people, and institutional and social integration dimensions have been significant drivers of economic growth. Infrastructure and connectivity improve income distribution. Overall integration alongside the dimensions of trade and investment, money and finance, and institutional and social integration appear to significantly and robustly reduce poverty.
C43|Monetary Policy Pass-through, Excess Liquidity and Price Spillover: A Comparative Study of Conventional and Islamic Banks of Pakistan|This study investigates the comparative pass-through of policy rate to the retail prices, spillover of prices between Islamic and conventional banking systems, and the impact of excess liquidity on these pass-throughs using data from interbank market of Pakistan. The results suggest that the monetary policy shock affect retail prices of Islamic banks similar to conventional banks, confirming the findings of earlier studies. Moreover, there is a strong spillover between the prices of two systems; Islamic banks are following (leading) the conventional banks in pricing the lending (deposit) products. Islamic bank have acquired advantage in the deposit pricing by taping the religious depositors, which also has promoted financial inclusion in the economy. Our results suggest that the presence of excess liquidity have no effect on pass-through of policy rate in the Islamic system, which is contrary to the prevalent notion. However, excess liquidity significantly affects the spillovers of prices between the systems. These results support the hypothesis that the Islamic banks are investing in government securities indirectly via conventional banks.
C43|On the Information Contents of Indirect Citations|Suppose there are more researchers in the mainstream than in the fringe. If researchers have only partial appreciation of the research conducted by the other group, then a citation index that is increasing in both direct and indirect citations will bias in favor of mainstream researchers. To correct for such a bias, a citation index should be increasing in direct citations but decreasing in indirect citations. More indirect citations suggests that a researcher’s direct citations should be discounted more, because he is more likely to come from the mainstream, and many of those who cite him are also mainstream researchers with many direct citations.
C43|Productivity growth, firm turnover and new varieties|We reconcile two different strands of the literature: the literature on how new goods impact prices and the literature on productivity growth and firm turnover. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to provide a fully consistent decomposition of aggregate productivity growth that identifies the contribution from new firms producing new varieties. We extend the estimator for the demand elasticity, proposed by Feenstra (1994) and supplemented by Soderbery (2015), in two dimensions: First, we create a two-stage estimation framework that exploits the boundary cases where simultaneity is not an issue, i.e. when supply is elastic or inelastic, to obtain a more efficient estimator. Second, we make it robust towards choice of reference unit. To illustrate the decomposition and estimator, we analyse the case of firm turnover in Norway, using panel data covering the period from 1995 to 2016 for manufacturing firms. Our results indicate that net creation of new varieties from firm turnover contributes by about one half percentage point to annual aggregate productivity growth.
C43|How to Count Citations If You Must: Comment|"Perry and Reny (2016) show that the Euclidean length of a citation list satisfies five axioms including ""depth relevance"". We explore ""breadth relevance"", which favors consistent achievers over one-hit wonders. A convex combination of depth and breadth relevant citation metrics does not satisfy the independence axiom, but violations are rare. We estimate the parameters of this metric using two datasets and three rankings, controlling for cohort effects. We find that simply counting citations--neither breadth nor depth--maximizes the correlation between citation index and department rank. However, depth may explain the allocation of researchers across lower ranked departments."
C43|Substitution Bias in Multilateral Methods for CPI Construction using Scanner Data|The use of multilateral comparison methods in a time series context is increasingly becoming an accepted approach for incorporating scanner data in a Consumer Price Index. The attractiveness stems from the ability to be able to control for chain drift bias. Consensus on two key issues has yet to be achieved: (i) the best multilateral method to use, and (ii) the best way of extending the resulting series when new observations become available. This paper presents theoretical and simulation evidence on the extent of substitution biases in alternative multilateral methods. The multilateral index number formulae studied include the GEKS, CCDI, Geary-Khamis and Weighted Time Product Dummy Methods as well as some price similarity linking methods. The paper also assesses alternative methods for extending non-revisable series, with particular regard to the possibility of introducing chain drift bias. Overall, our results suggest the use of the CCDI index with a new method, the â€œmean spliceâ€ , for updating.
C43|A Revised Direct Output Gap Measure for the Turkish Economy|In the calculation of the output gap, which is an unobservable variable, filtering techniques, production function and structural models are used in general. However, the output gap estimates obtained using these methods may be subject to revisions due to the end-of-sample and model parameter revisions. To reduce the uncertainties in output gap estimates, it is important to follow indicators which are not predicted and contain information about the cyclical position of the economy. In this study we revised the direct output gap measure to cover the 2005-2017 period by including new cyclical indicators representing the different sectors of the economy. The results show that the revisions in the calculated output gap indicator are lower than the output gap series calculated by filter-based methods and that the revised output gap indicator contains more information about the phase of inflation and growth cycles than the old series. In addition, the calculated output gap indicators suggests that economic activity in Turkey was below its potential in the period 2016Q1-2017Q1 and 2009-2010.
C43|Measuring financial systemic stress for Turkey: A search for the best composite indicator|In this study, we aim to construct a single financial stress indicator (FSI) for Turkey adopting weekly data from between April 2005 and December 2016. To do so, we compose 15 different FSIs using 14 variables that will represent five different markets, i.e. the money market, the bond market, the foreign exchange market, the equity market and the banking sector. We aggregate these five different markets using a variety of techniques, including principal component analysis (PCA), basic portfolio theory, variance equal weights and the Bayesian dynamic factor model. We compare 15 different FSIs on the basis of their relation to, and the forecasting power of, different variables such as the growth rate of industrial production, the OECD business condition index and the OECD composite leading indicator for Turkey. Our results suggest that there is no simple best indicator for Turkey to measure financial systemic stress. Some indicators offer good forecasting power for economic growth while others have a stronger correlation with systemic risk. Therefore, we offer a final FSI for Turkey conducting a model averaging method via a rolling correlation based weighting scheme to benefit from the information content of all the FSIs and observe that the final FSI successfully indicates the tension periods.
C43|An Axiomatic Foundation of the Ecological Footprint|The objective of this paper is to provide an axiomatic foundation to the ecological footprint developed and refined by the authors in the Global Footprint Network, among others. For this purpose, five axioms are proposed which represent general properties any ecological footprint measure should fulfill. We show that an index exists which is unique up to a coefficient to be chosen arbitrarily. As an implication, footprints have to be measured on a ratio scale. This result supports the conventional unit of measurement (land area) which itself is represented by a ratio scale. In this respect, our index differs from the compound-based ecological footprint index in which the norm is missing and, therefore, it is implicitly set equal to one. Apart from that we find, as the most important result, that the ad-hoc design of the commonly applied ecological footprint index has been given an axiomatic foundation.
C43|On the Axiomatic Foundation of Ecological Footprint Indices|The objective of this paper is to provide an axiomatic foundation to the concept of ecological footprint indices. For this purpose, we propose five axioms representing general properties which any ecological footprint measure should fulfill. It can be shown that there exists a unique index which is characterized by the given set of axioms. Its functional form is determined and an economic interpretation is given. We find that the proposed index may resolve or confirm some important issues discussed in the literature. First, it incorporates a trade component indicating the ecological footprint of economic activities embodied in the trade pattern of a country or region. Moreover, the productivity of land use in production as a means to mitigate the pressure on the ecological system is reflected. But most importantly, from a methodological point of view, there is no longer the need for designing ecological footprint indices ad-hoc, in particular for the sake of empirical application.
C43|The Many Decompositions of Total Factor Productivity Change|Total factor productivity change, here defined as output quantity change di- vided by input quantity change, is the combined result of (technical) efficiency change, technological change, a scale effect, and input and output mix ef- fects. Sometimes allocative efficiency change is supposed to also play a role. Given a certain functional form for the productivity index, the problem is how to decompose such an index into factors corresponding to these five or six components. A basic insight offered in the present paper is that mean- ingful decompositions of productivity indices can only be obtained for indices which are transitive in the main variables. Using a unified approach, we ob- tain decompositions for Malmquist, Moorsteen-Bjurek, price-weighted, and share-weighted productivity indices. A unique feature of this paper is that all the decompositions are applied to the same dataset of a real-life panel of decision-making units so that the extent of the differences between the various decompositions can be judged.
C43|Constructing the Asia-Pacific Regional Cooperation and Integration Index: A Panel Approach|In this paper, we propose a panel approach in the construction of the Asia-Pacific Regional Cooperation and Integration Index (ARCII) to strengthen the index’s ability to track the progress of economic integration in the region over time. Panel-based procedures are employed in imputing missing values, normalizing raw data, and deriving dimensional and subdimensional weights via principal components analysis. Findings suggest the pace of integration in Asia was broadly steady over the 11-year sample period (2006–2016). However, modest gains have been made as a majority of economies in the sample have moved up in their levels of regional integration from 2006 to 2016. Of the six dimensions featured in the ARCII, trade and investment and movement of people are the main drivers of regional integration, while the money and finance dimension was the weakest link. Based on global normalization, Asia comes second to the European Union (EU) in progress on regional integration, but in recent years a few Asian economies have broken through to the top tier dominated by the EU economies.

C43|How did Regional Economic Structures in the EU Change during the Economic Crisis?|10 years on, many countries and regions in the EU still bear the scars of the 2008/2009 financial crisis. Countries and regions have recovered at different rates and undergone different structural changes. While the asymmetric impact of the crisis across regions and sectors has had a short-term impact on concentration and specialisation patterns; long-term forces, such as global economic and supply chain integration, continue to shape the economic landscape of European regions. In our empirical analysis, we describe the development of regional economic structures in terms of sectoral employment and production (gross value added) during the crisis. We focus on the location pattern of sectors (concentration), i.e. in which regions economic activities in a sector tend to be located, and the specialisation of regions, i.e. which sectors are particularly important in a region. Our analysis shows that the impact of the crisis on overall specialisation patterns appears rather limited, although some regions have been more affected than others. In addition, the general trend of sectoral location patterns in the EU becoming more similar over time has continued, albeit at a slower pace since 2009, especially in Central and East European Countries. In terms of sectors, employment and production concentration in the construction and manufacturing sectors, which displayed clustering before the crisis, have been dispersing since 2009. The data also show that regions with large employment losses during the crisis were mainly specialised in agriculture, low-tech manufacturing, construction and less-skilled services such as trade, accommodation/restaurants and transport. This suggests that local economic structures may have played a role in the economic resilience of regions during the crisis.
C43|Product Turnover and the Cost of Living Index: Quality vs. Fashion Effects|This paper evaluates the effects of product turnover on a welfare-based cost-of-living index. We first present some facts about price and quantity changes over the product cycle employing scanner data for Japan for the years 1988-2013, which cover the deflationary period that started in the mid-1990s. We then develop a new methodology to decompose price changes at the time of product turnover into those due to the quality effect and those due to the fashion effect (i.e., the higher demand for products that are new). Our main findings are as follows: (1) the price and quantity of a new product tend to be higher than those of its predecessor at its exit from the market, implying that firms use new products as an opportunity to take back the price decline that occurred during the life of its predecessor under deflation; (2) a considerable fashion effect exists for the entire sample period, while the quality effect is declining over time; and (3) the discrepancy between the cost-of-living index estimated based on our methodology and the price index constructed only from a matched sample is not large.
C43|The Optimal Monetary Instrument and the (Mis)Use of Causality Tests|This paper uses a New-Keynesian model with multiple monetary assets to show that if the choice of instrument is based solely on its propensity to predict macroeconomic targets, a central bank may choose an inferior policy instrument. We compare a standard interest rate rule to a k-percent rule for three alternative monetary aggregates determined within our model: the monetary base, the simple sum measure of money, and the Divisia measure. Welfare results are striking. While the interest rate dominates the other two monetary aggregate k-percent rules, the Divisia k-percent rule outperforms the interest rate rule. Next we study the ability of Granger Causality tests – in the context of data generated from our model – to correctly identify welfare improving instruments. All of the policy instruments considered, except for Divisia, Granger Cause both output and prices at extremely high levels of significance. Divisia fails to Granger Cause prices despite the Divisia rule stabilizing inflation better than these alternative policy instruments. The causality results are robust to using a popular version of the Sims Causality test for which we show standard asymptotics remain valid when the variables are integrated, as in our case.
C43|Superlative approximation of the Luenberger-Hicks-Moorsteen productivity indicator: Theory and application|Consisting of the difference between an output indicator and an input indicator, the Luenberger-Hicks-Moorsteen (LHM) productivity indicator allows straightforward interpretation. However, it requires estimation of distance functions that are inherently unknown. This paper shows that a simple Bennet profit indicator is a superlative approximation of the LHM indicator when one can assume profit-maximizing behavior and the input and output directional distance functions can be represented up to the second order by a quadratic functional form. We also show that the Luenberger and LHM-approximating Bennet indicators coincide for an appropriate choice of the directional vectors. Focusing on a large sample of Italian food and beverages companies for the years 1995-2007, we empirically investigate the extent to which this theoretical equivalence translates into similar estimates.
C43|Spatial Chaining in International Comparisons of Prices and Real Incomes| Multilateral international comparisons of the purchasing power of currencies and real income often use as building blocks bilateral comparisons between all possible pairs of countries. The standard approach in the literature weights all these bilaterals equally. One problem with this approach is that some bilaterals are typically of lower quality, and their inclusion therefore can undermine the integrity of the multilateral comparison. Formulating multilateral comparisons as a graph theory problem, we show how quality can be improved by replacing bilateral comparisons with their shortest path spatially chained equivalents. We consider a few variants on this approach, and illustrate these multilateral methods using data from the 2011 round of the International Comparisons Program (ICP). Using some novel bounds criteria, we demonstrate how spatial chaining improves the quality of the overall multilateral comparison.
C43|Higher Frequency Hedonic Property Price Indices: A State Space Approach| The hedonic imputation method estimates separate characteristic shadow prices for each period. These are used to construct matched samples, which are inserted into standard price index formulas. We implement two innovations to improve the method’s effectiveness on housing data at higher frequencies. First, we use a time-varying parameter model in state-space form to increase the reliability of the estimated characteristic shadow prices. Second, we significantly reduce the number of parameters by replacing postcode dummies by a geospatial spline surface. Empirically, using a novel criterion, we show that in higher frequency comparisons our hedonic method outperforms competing alternatives.
C43|A Note on α -Gini Measures|"This note provides a characterization of α-Gini inequality measures. These measures generalize the standard Gini index by including one sensitivity parameter α, which captures different value judgments. The α-Gini measures are shown to be weakly decomposable and unit-consistent. Weak decomposition provides within-group and between-group inequalities. Unit consistency keeps unchanged the ranking of two income distributions when the income units vary. It is shown that the α-Gini measures are relevant with either ""leftist"" or""rightist"" views. JEL Codes: D63, D31, C43"
C43|Is the output growth rate in NIPA a welfare measure?|National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) measure real output growth by means of a Fisher ideal chain index. Bridging modern macroeconomics and the economic theory of index numbers, this paper shows that output growth as measured by NIPA is welfare based. In a dynamic general equilibrium model with genreral recursive preferences and technology, welfare depends on present and future consumption. Indeed, the associated Bellman equation provides a representation of preferences in the domain of current consumption and current investment. Applying standard index number theory to this representation of preferences shows that the Fisher-Shell true quantity index is equal to the Divisia index, in turn well approximated by the Fisher ideal index used in NIPA.
C43|A New Indicator for Describing Bull and Bear Markets|Abstract We present new short, medium, and long-run indicators to date and characterise expansions and contractions in financial and economic time series. These Bull-Bear Indicators (BBIs) measure the risk-adjusted excess return with respect to average, to different time horizons, expressed in standard deviations. We illustrate the benefits of this measure by describing the boom-bust cycle in the UK stock market between 1922 and 2015. We compare our results with those obtained from frequently used methodologies in the literature and find that our measures contain substantially more information than the usual binary sequences that describe expansions and contractions and allow for a more granular and nuanced description of time series.
C43|House Price Markups and Mortgage Defaults|"The transaction price of identical housing units can vary widely due to heterogeneity in buyer and seller preferences, appraisers, and search costs, generating ""markups"" above or below the average market price. These markups are mean reverting upon subsequent transactions, suggesting transitory factors play a role in same-unit dynamics. We show markups are an important driver of mortgage delinquencies, defaults, prepayments, and credit losses conditional on default. In general, our findings highlight several important aspects of mortgage risk management, including underwriting, insurance, and unit-level house value dynamics."
C43|A New Home Affordability Estimate: What Share of Housing Stock Can Families Afford?|"We offer a new home affordability estimate (HAE) that focuses on the share of housing stock that is affordable to certain households in the United States. The methodology considers affordability as it relates to funds available for down payments, initial monthly housing-related payments, and future projections of household income and costs. The HAE builds upon existing industry statistics in two ways. First, existing affordability indexes make certain assumptions for one or more of those funding factors. We can observe actual investment and expense values. Second, existing industry statistics consider ""typical"" families that earn the median household income level. The HAE is sufficiently more flexible for evaluating families at different places in the income distribution. This paper discusses the assumptions and processes for creating the HAE indexes; compares the national time series for very low-, low-, and medium-income families; and then documents trends across metropolitan areas. We offer the data for public usage and leave commentary about implications to future research."
C43|Why 1990 international Geary-Khamis dollars cannot be a foundation for reliable long run comparisons of GDP|Using a large, new dataset of agricultural prices and quantities for many countries and regions, we create five new international Geary-Khamis pounds – for 1870, 1845, 1775, 1705, and a superior chained series. We show that estimated levels and changes in output per worker look very different – more extreme – using 1705 international pounds and 1990 international dollars, compared to all other series; growth rates appear substantially higher using 1990 international dollars. In short, out-of-sample baskets and/or prices create extremely unreliable output estimates. We also show that individual country price indices (rather than international indices) can generate substantially different estimated growth rates.
C43|Dynamic Industry Productivity Measures: The case of thermal electricity generation by South Korean plants 2001-2008 and in Chinese regions 2000-2004|A framework for applied production theory should focus on the crucial features of the industry to be studied. First of all, to be useful for a dynamic study, a distinction has to be made between the theoretical production possibilities before investment takes place and the actual empirical production possibilities in the short run after investment has taken place. Then there is the distinction between production possibilities at the micro level of a plant or even division within a plant, and the aggregate production possibilities for the industry as a whole. Entry and exit of plants, and embodied technological change at the micro or plant level drive the dynamics. South Korean thermal plants using bituminous coal are studied for the period 2001-2008. The requirement of plant level data has severely restricted the use of the approach. However, the paper shows that such production function concepts can be applied to coal-fired electricity generation aggregated to the Chinese province level and still get valuable structural information for policy analysis. Development in Total Variable Factor Productivity (TVFP) and bias of technical change are estimated and illuminated using figures for isoquant maps, capacity regions in input coefficient space and average- and marginal cost functions both for the plant level in South Korea and for the aggregated province level in China.
C43|Macro-economic Measures for a Globalised World: Global Growth and Inflation|In this paper we offer a framework for measuring global growth and inflation built on an index number theory and practice; standard national accounts principles; and the concepts and methods for international macroeconomic comparisons. Our approach provides a sound basis for the estimates of purchasing power parity and exchange-rate based global growth regularly published by IMF, the World Bank and the United Nations. It also rectifies deficiencies in the current procedures used in measuring global inflation. For illustrative purposes, we present our estimates of global growth and inflation using data for 141 countries for the years 2005 and 2011. Contribution of movements in exchange rates and purchasing power parities to global inflation are presented.
C43|Quantifying and Accounting for Quality Differences in Services in International Price Comparisons: A Bilateral Price Comparison between United States and Japan|Purchasing power parities (PPPs) from the International Comparison Program (ICP) are used for cross-country comparisons of price levels and real gross domestic product (GDP), household consumption and investment. PPPs from the ICP are also used in compiling internationally comparable output aggregates and making productivity comparisons in the KLEMS initiative. PPP compilation is anchored on the principle of comparing the like with like and price data are collected for goods and services with detailed specifications in the form of structural product descriptions. While this approach works well for goods, it is not effective in the case of services. If differences in service quality exist, these get reflected in the PPPs from the ICP. In this paper, we focus on the USA-Japan bilateral price comparison in the 2014 ICP in the OECD region and estimate bias induced by differences in quality of services in. Service quality is driven by various unobservable factors. In this paper we make use of data on quality differences and consumers’ willingness to pay collected through a specialised survey conducted by the Japan Productivity Center early in 2017. Data are collected from a large sample of 517 respondents from USA and 519 respondents from Japan, covering 28 service items including transport, restaurants, retail services, health and education. Estimates of consumers’ willingness to pay for quality differences in services by the US and Japanese consumers are obtained using standard econometric methodology, these are in turn used in estimating quality adjustment factors that can be applied to price data used in PPP computation. Using the Sato-Vartia index, which has useful analytical and decomposition properties, we find PPP for household consumption (including real estate services) of 113 JPY per US dollar reduces to 104 JPY per dollar after adjusting for quality differences. When real estate services are not included, PPP reduces from 95 JPY to 87 JPY after quality adjustment. The paper also presents labour productivity estimates before and after quality adjustment for a number of service sectors including transport and storage; retail trade; hotels and restaurants; and other subsectors. Our exploratory study demonstrates that adjustment for quality differences in services is feasible and such adjustments are important for making meaningful international price comparisons.

C43|Lost in Translation: What do Engel Curves Tell us about the Cost of Living?|The Hamilton method for estimating CPI bias is simple, intuitive, and has been widely adopted. We show that the method confiates CPI bias with variation in cost-of-living across income levels. Assuming a single price index across the income distribution is inconsistent with the downward sloping Engel curves that are necessary to implement the method. We develop and implement the Translated Engel curve (TEC) method that disentangles genuine CPI bias from differences caused by comparing changes in the cost of living across different income levels - non-homotheticity. The TEC method gives substantially different estimates of CPI bias prior to major reforms to the CPI in 1999 (post-Boskin), but both methods suggest very little CPI bias thereafter.
C43|Sources of Inequality in Italy|In this article, we study the link between the functional and personal distribution of income, focusing on the case of Italy between 1989 and 2016. To this end, we rely on the novel concept of income composition inequality. Income composition inequality focuses on how unequally the composition of income is distributed across the population. The higher the overall degree of income composition inequality is, the stronger the link between the functional and personal distribution of income. We show that the strength of this link decreased steadily in Italy over the period considered. This result is robust to the use of different definitions of capital and labor and different estimation techniques of the degree of income composition inequality. The implications of this result are twofold. First, fluctuations in the total factor shares of income are having an increasingly weaker impact on income inequality in Italy. Second, Italy is moving towards becoming a multiple sources of income society. Finally, we conceptualize a simple rule of thumb for policy makers seeking to reduce income inequality in the long run: This rule relates fluctuations in the total factor shares and the level of income composition inequality to the specific income source to be redistributed.
C43|Owner Occupied Housing in the CPI and Its Impact On Monetary Policy During Housing Booms and Busts| The treatment of owner-occupied housing (OOH) is probably the most important unresolved issue in infl ation measurement. The European Union has been grappling with this problem for over a decade. We argue for measuring OOH costs using a particular version of the user cost method. We then compare the impact of eight different treatments of OOH on the consumer price index (CPI), using quantile hedonic regression. The impact on the CPI is large, and the treatment of OOH emerges as an essential prerequisite to discussions over how an infl ation targeting central bank should respond to housing booms and busts.
C43|Monetary Services Aggregation under Uncertainty: A Behavioral Economics Extension Using Choquet Expectation|A central tenet of behavioral economics is that the axioms producing expected utility maximization by consumers are too strong to be descriptive of rational behavior. The existing theory of monetary services aggregation under risk assume expected utility maximization. We extend those results to uncertainty under weaker axiomatic assumptions by using Choquet expectations. Choquet integration reduces to Riemann integration as a special case under the stronger assumption of additive probability measure, not accepted in the literature on behavioral economics. Our theoretical results on monetary services aggregation are generalizations of prior results, nested as special cases of our results under stronger behavioral assumptions.
C43|Estimación del Consumo a partir de sus Componentes Principales en la Tabla Insumo-Producto|Una forma de entender el consumo privado es subdividir esta variable macroeconómica agregada en sus componentes y estudiar las partes. En este documento se estima el comportamiento de los componentes más importantes del consumo privado al cual se denomina componentes principales. Tomando como punto de inicio la información de la Tabla Insumo Producto para distintos años, se utiliza un conjunto de variables proxi para cada componente a partir de los cuales se obtiene una distribución del consumo por componente para cada año. Los componentes restantes forman parte de una serie denominada Otros, cuyo rol es de disciplinar los resultados mediante el registro de ciertas regularidades en su conducta. Esta metodología permite proyectar el consumo privado con un bajo error de proyección.
C43|Adjustment of the Regional Indicator of Income in Retail Trade|INEGI publishes, on a monthly basis, national indexes for sector, subsector and industry group of wholesale and retail trade, and state indexes for commerce sector based on information from the Monthly Survey of Commercial Establishments, EMEC. Although the sample design of this survey is representative at the national level and by industry group of economic activity of the commerce sector, the aggregation of state indexes at industry group level, necessary to construct regional indicators, requires an adjustment in the weighting of the observations. This document presents an aggregation methodology to build regional indexes based on retail trade state income data calculated from the information of EMEC databases. Moreover, a measure of the relative size of real income by region is proposed, it identifies those subsectors of retail trade with greatest contribution to the growth of regional income.
C43|The perils of approximating fixed-horizon inflation forecasts with fixed-event forecasts|"A common practice in studies using inflation forecasts is to approximate fixed-horizon forecasts with fixed-event ones. Here we show that this may be problematic. In a panel of US inflation forecast data that allows us to compare the two, the approximation results in a mean absolute approximation error of around 0.2-0.3 percentage points (around 10% of the level of inflation), and statistically significant differences in both the variances and persistence of the approximate inflation forecasts relative to the actual forecasts. To reduce these problems, we propose an adjustment to the approximation, consistent with a model where longer-horizon forecasts are more heavily ""anchored"", while shorter-horizon forecasts more closely reflect current inflation levels."
C43|Review of Methodological Specifics of Consumer Price Index Seasonal Adjustment in the Bank of Russia|Under the inflation targeting regime, the main goal of the Bank of Russia is to maintain price stability. In order to analyse the options that the central bank can use to implement its monetary policy aimed at bringing inflation down to sustainable low levels it is necessary to understand, considering the available short-term statistical data, the dynamics of consumer prices and individual components of the seasonally adjusted consumer price index. At the same time, the seasonal adjustment of the consumer price index requires solving a number of methodological problems, one part of which is common for all economic time series with a seasonal component and the other part is determined by the specific nature of the consumer price index as an aggregate indicator. The paper suggests approaches to solving conceptual problems related to the seasonal adjustment of the consumer price index. It also describes basic principles and methods for their implementation that can lead to a significant increase in the quality of identification and interpretation of short-term meaningful variations in consumer prices that the Bank of Russia takes into account when making its monetary policy decisions.
C43|Developing an underlying inflation gauge for China|The headline consumer price inflation (CPI) is often considered too noisy, narrowly defined, and/or slowly available for policymaking. On the other hand, traditional core inflation measures may reduce volatility but do not address other issues and may even exclude important information. This paper develops a new underlying inflation gauge (UIG) for China which differentiates between trend and noise, is available daily and uses a broad set of variables that potentially influence inflation. Its construction follows the works at other major central banks, adopts the methodology of a dynamic factor model that extracts the lower frequency components as developed by Forni et al. (2000) and draws on the experience of the People's Bank of China in modelling inflation. The paper is the first application of this type of dynamic factor model for inflation to any large emerging market economy. Our UIG for China is less noisy but still closely tracks the headline CPI. It does not suffer from the excess volatility reduction that plagues traditional core inflation measures and instead provides additional information. Finally, when forecasting the headline CPI, our UIG for China outperforms traditional core measures over different samples.
C43|Compilation of Experimental Price Indices Using Big Data and Machine Learning:A Comparative Analysis and Validity Verification of Quality Adjustments|This paper compiles experimental price indices for 20 home electrical appliances and digital consumer electronic products using big data obtained from Kakaku.com, the largest price comparison website in Japan, and a machine-learning algorithm which pairs legacy and successor products with high precision. In so doing, authors examine the validity of quality adjustment methods by performing comparative analyses on the difference these methods have on price indices. Findings from the analyses are as follows: Indices applied with the Webscraped Prices Comparison Method--the quality adjustment method newly developed and introduced by the Bank of Japan--are more cost-effective than those applied with the Hedonic Regression Method which is known to possess high accuracy in index creation. Indices applied with the Matched-Model Method, which is frequently applied to price indices using big data is unable to precisely reflect price increases intended to ensure the profitability often seen in home electronics at time of product turnover. This indicates the significant downward bias in price indices. These findings once again highlight the importance of selecting the appropriate quality adjustment method when compiling price indices.
C43|Lost in translation: What do Engel curves tell us about the cost of living?| The Hamilton method for estimating CPI bias is simple, intuitive, and has been widely adopted. We show that the method conflates CPI bias with variation in cost-of-living across income levels. Assuming a single price index across the income distribution is inconsistent with the downward sloping Engel curves that are necessary to implement the method. We develop and implement the Translated Engel curve (TEC) method that disentangles genuine CPI bias from differences caused by comparing changes in the cost of living across different income levels - non-homotheticity. The TEC method gives substantially different estimates of CPI bias prior to major reforms to the CPI in 1999 (post-Boskin), but both methods suggest very little CPI bias thereafter.
C43|Machine Learning Indices, Political Institutions, and Economic Development|We present a new aggregation method - called SVM algorithm - and use this technique to produce novel measures of democracy (186 countries, 1960-2014). The method takes its name from a machine learning technique for pattern recognition and has three notable features: it makes functional assumptions unnecessary, it accounts for measurement uncertainty, and it creates continuous and dichotomous indices. We use the SVM indices to investigate the effect of democratic institutions on economic development, and find that democracies grow faster than autocracies. Furthermore, we illustrate how the estimation results are affected by conceptual and methodological changes in the measure of democracy. In particular, we show that instrumental variables cannot compensate for measurement errors produced by conventional aggregation methods, and explain why this failure leads to an overestimation of regression coefficients.
C43|Testing for bubbles in cryptocurrencies with time-varying volatility|The recent evolution of cryptocurrencies has been characterized by bubble-like behavior and extreme volatility. While it is difficult to assess an intrinsic value to a specific cryptocurrency, one can employ recently proposed bubble tests that rely on recursive applications of classical unit root tests. This paper extends this approach to the case where volatility is time varying, assuming a deterministic long-run component that may take into account a decrease of unconditional volatility when the cryptocurrency matures with a higher market dissemination. Volatility also includes a stochastic short-run component to capture volatility clustering. The wild bootstrap is shown to correctly adjust the size properties of the bubble test, which retains good power properties. In an empirical application using eleven of the largest cryptocurrencies and the CRIX index, the general evidence in favor of bubbles is confirmed, but much less pronounced than under constant volatility.
C43|Monthly art market returns|We provide an innovative methodological contribution to the measurement of returns on infrequently traded assets using a novel approach to repeat-sales regression estimation. The model for price indices we propose allows for correlation with other markets, typically with higher liquidity and high frequency trading. Using the new econometric approach, we propose a monthly art market index, as well as sub-indices from Impressionist, Modern, Post-War, and Contemporary paintings based on repeated sales at a monthly frequency. The correlations enable us to update the art index via observed transactions in other markets that have a link with the art market.
C43|¿Por qué el Valle del Cauca ha crecido más que el promedio nacional? Un análisis regional de los ciclos y los choques económicos|Using a BVAR model and the data of the Monthly Economic Activity Indicator (IMAE), the effect of different monetary and external sector shocks on the cyclical growth of the department of Valle del Cauca is estimated, and compared with the effect of these same shocks on the national cycle. We found that the economy of the Valle del Cauca differs from the national average by presenting larger response to variations in the real exchange rate. This is precisely the factor that in a greater proportion -almost by 50 %- explains the higher growth of the economy of Valle del Cauca since the end of 2013. The estimates show the null effect that the changes in the price of oil have on the departmental growth andthe greater the impact on the economy of the Valley of the changes in the US GDP and the country risk. The version here presented corresponds to the updated study.
C43|Measuring Stick-Style Housing Policies: a Multi-Country Longitudinal Database of Governmental Regulations|This paper introduces a new international longitudinal database of governmental housing policies. The regulations are measured using binary variables based on a thorough analysis of the real-time country-specific legislation. Three major restrictive policies are considered: rent control, protection from restriction, and housing rationing. The database covers 47 countries and states between 1910 and 2018. This allows comparisons of regulation stringency across both time and space. The analysis reveals a surge of all restrictive policies in the first half of the 20th century. However, following World War II, the evolution of policies diverged: while rent control became more flexible or was phased out, tenure security stabilized at a high level or even increased, while housing rationing became used less frequently. An application of dynamic multivariate longitudinal clustering permits dividing the sample in two groups. One cluster comprises countries with more flexible rent control, stronger tenure security, and more housing rationing. It mostly includes European continental countries. Another cluster unifies countries with a more rigid rent control, weaker tenant protection, and rarely used housing rationing.
C43|Beyond spreads: Measuring sovereign market stress in the euro area|We develop a novel composite indicator to measure sovereign bond market stress in the euro area. The indicator integrates yield and liquidity spreads along with volatility into an overall measure of sovereign market stress. An application to the spillover literature suggests that stress mainly originates from a few countries, but that spillover patterns also vary over time.
C43|Aggregation biases in empirical Euler consumption equations: evidence from Spanish data|In this paper we investigate the implications of aggregation in empirical analyses of Euler equations for consumption. We compare the results obtained after estimating the samemodel, using total and non-durable microeconomic consumption household data, from themaximum aggregation level (National Accounts) to individual data from the SpanishExpenditure Survey (Encuesta Continua de Presupuestos Familiares). We also use thesurvey to build cohort and aggregate data to test the model using different aggregatemeasures of consumption. The results we obtain confirm the theoretical predictionssummarised in Blundell and Stoker (2005) as well as in previous empirical evidence, i.e.aggregation turns out to be crucial to study empirically Euler equations for consumption. The estimated EIS with aggregated data is biased as compared with the correspondingestimate with microeconomic data. Further, the size of the bias increased with the level ofaggregation.
C43|Scanner Data, Elementary Price Indexes and the Chain Drift Problem|Statistical agencies increasingly are able to collect detailed price and quantity information from retailers on sales of consumer products. Thus elementary price indexes (which are indexes constructed at the first stage of aggregation for closely related products) can now be constructed using this price and quantity information, whereas previously, statistical agencies had to construct elementary indexes using just retail outlet collected information on prices alone. Thus superlative indexes can now be constructed at the elementary level, which in theory, should lead to more accurate Consumer Price Indexes. However, retailers frequently sell products at heavily discounted prices, which lead to large increases in purchases of these products. This volatility in prices and quantities will generally lead to a chain drift problem; i.e., when prices return to their â€œnormalâ€ levels, quantities purchased are frequently below their â€œnormalâ€ levels and this leads to a downward drift in a superlative price index. The paper addresses this problem and looks at the likely bias in various index number formulae that are commonly used. The bias estimates are illustrated using some scanner data on the sales of frozen juice products that are available online.
C43|Alternative Methods for Interpolating PPPs|The paper draws on a previous paper by Diewert and Fox which addressed two problems: (i) how to measure aggregate real output and inflation for a group of countries and (ii) how to construct measures of real GDP for a group of countries where the country measures of real GDP are comparable across time and space. In order to address both problems, it is necessary that the group of countries construct Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs). The present paper looks at the related problem of interpolating PPPs between benchmark years when PPPs have been constructed. The paper shows that the method of interpolation that was suggested by Diewert and Fox is equivalent to a variant of the method used by the Penn World Tables to interpolate PPPs between benchmarks. The interpolation methods are compared to actual OECD PPPs for the years 2001-2017.
C43|Duality in Production|The paper reviews the application of duality theory in production theory. Duality theory turns out to be a useful tool for two reasons: (i) it leads to relatively easy characterizations of the properties of systems of producer derived demand functions for inputs and producer supply functions for outputs and (ii) it facilitates the generation of flexible functional forms for producer demand and supply functions that can be estimated using econometrics. The paper focuses on describing the properties of five functional forms that have been used in the production literature: (i) the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES), (ii) the Generalized Leontief, (iii) the translog, (iv) the Normalized Quadratic and (v) the KonÃ¼s Byushgens Fisher functional forms. The applications of GDP functions and joint cost functions to various areas of applied economics is explained.
C43|Estimating the Benefits and Costs of New and Disappearing Products|A major challenge facing statistical agencies is the problem of adjusting price and quantity indexes for changes in the availability of commodities. This problem arises in the scanner data context as products in a commodity stratum appear and disappear in retail outlets. Hicks suggested a reservation price methodology for dealing with this problem in the context of the economic approach to index number theory. Feenstra and Hausman suggested specific methods for implementing the Hicksian approach. The present paper evaluates these approaches and suggests some alternative approaches to the estimation of reservation prices. The various approaches are implemented using some scanner data on frozen juice products that are available online.
C43|Should citations be weighted to assess the influence of an academic article?|Citations are by nature heterogeneous. A citation worth may dramatically vary according to the influence of the citing article or to the journal's reputation from which it is issued. Therefore, while assessing the influence of an academic article, how should we weight citations to take into account their real influence? In order to answer this question, this article suggests various methods of weighting citations in the building of articles quality indicators. These indexes are then used to measure the influence of the articles published in the top five economic journals over the 2000-2010 period and analyses the sensibility of these indicators to the choice of the weighting schemes. Our main result is that whatever the weighting scheme, information carried by the different indicators is not significantly different. From Occam's razor principle, the number of citations provides an efficient and sufficient tool to measure research quality.
C43|Sustainable Development Goals indicators: a methodological proposal for a fuzzy Super Index in the Mediterranean area|This paper provides a methodological proposal for the construction of a multidimensional index for sustainability assessment in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In particular, the paper proposes a new methodology to properly estimate the multidimensional nature of sustainable development and the SDGs introducing an innovative fuzzy approach. Specifically, we present a multidimensional methodology to build a Super Index to measure the performance of the Mediterranean countries towards the SDGs with a focus on the agro-food sustainability in line with the Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA). For this purpose, drawing on the fuzzy approach developed by Betti et al. (2015), a step by step procedure is provided in the paper: first the underlying dimensions of a set of selected indicators for the SDGs are identified through an exploratory factor analysis and then an innovative weighting methodology is applied for the aggregation of the indicators to calculate the countries’ scores for each dimension and finally the overall index.
C43|Divisia And Frisch Are Friends|Divisia indexes and the less-well-known Frisch counterparts both involve weighted logarithmic changes of prices/quantities. This paper shows how they can be used in tandem to understand interesting aspects of consumer behaviour. The indexes can be used for measurement of quality and its price; the estimation of the income elasticity of the marginal utility of income, which is related to the overall degree of substitution among goods in the consumer’s basket; and for the analysis of the bias in the consumer price index due to the neglect of substitution effects. In this sense, Divisia and Frisch (indexes) are friends.
C43|Measuring Governance: Why do errors matter?|The World Governance Indicators (WGI) are well-known proxies for institutions and widely used in many studies across different disciplines. Each of the six WGI are constructed by aggregating several baseline indicators using the Multiple Indicators Multiple Cause (MIMC) method. This method assumes that the errors associated to the baseline indicators are independent. Here, we extend the MIMC method by allowing cluster dependence among those errors. The differences between the original and re-estimates of the WGI are statistically significant. We compare the results of three highly cited papers to illustrate that the new indices can alter their conclusions.
C43|Can Media Drive the Electorate? The Impact of Media Coverage on Party Affiliation and Voting Intentions|As the rise of populist and right-wing political movements is connected to extensive media coverage, the question arises whether media report more on political parties because of their success or if their success is caused by media reports. To tackle this question, we investigate how media coverage affects short- and long-term political preferences, namely party affiliation and voting intention. For our empirical analysis, we merge 14 years of human-coded data obtained from leading media in Germany with results of the comprehensive German Politbarometer survey from February 1998 through December 2012. To account for endogeneity, we employ instrumental variable estimations. In addition, we control for a multitude of (internal) personal characteristics, such as age, and gender, as well as for (external) macroeconomic variables, such as business climate, unemployment, and inflation. The results show that media coverage of a political party has a positive and significant effect on the short-term voting intention for this party. When media outlets cover a political party more positively, the electorate has a greater tendency to vote for it. However, for long-term party affiliation, the effect vanishes. This is consistent with the economic theory. Long-term preferences are stable and, thus, contemporary events, such as media coverage, hardly affect supposedly stable preferences. However, in the long-term, party affiliation might also be affected.
C43|IW-Studentenwohnpreisindex 2018: Mietpreisunterschiede zwischen Hochschulstandorten weiten sich|Die Zahl der Studenten ist seit 2010 um etwa 28 Prozent in Deutschland gestiegen, in manchen der betrachteten Hochschulstandorte lag der Zuwachs sogar bei 40 Prozent und mehr. Gleichzeitig hinkt die Bautätigkeit dem Einwohnerwachstum in vielen Städten hinterher, so dass der Markt für studentisches Wohnen angespannt ist. Der IW-Studentenwohnpreisindex zeigt für alle betrachteten Städten Mietpreisanstiege an. Bezogen auf 2010 haben die Mieten vor allem in München (+51 Prozent) und in Berlin (+67 Prozent) stark zugelegt. Auch im 1. Halbjahr 2018 sind die Mieten für studentisches Wohnen weiter gestiegen, besonders in Berlin mit einem Preisanstieg gegenüber dem Vorjahr um 9,8 Prozent. Doch auch in Heidelberg, Frankfurt und Bamberg sind die Mieten mit über 6 Prozent zuletzt deutlich gestiegen. Für eine Musterwohnung müssen Studenten in München am meisten zahlen, dort beträgt die Warmmiete 634 Euro in Monat. Der nächstteuerste Hochschulstandort ist Frankfurt mit 500 Euro pro Monat. Insgesamt zeigt die Analyse, dass die Streuung der Durchschnittsmieten zugenommen hat und insbesondere hochpreisige Angebote die durchschnittlichen Mieten nach oben ziehen. Allerdings gibt es auch Hochschulstandorte, die deutlich günstiger sind. In sechs der achtzehn betrachteten Hochschulstandorte liegt der Preis für eine Musterwohnung bei unter 350 Euro, im Ruhrgebiet, in Magdeburg und in Leipzig sogar unter 300 Euro. Auch die Zuwachsraten bei den Mieten liegen in diesen Hochschulstandorten deutlich unter den Werten für Berlin, München oder Köln. Mieten werden damit zunehmend wichtiger für die Hochschulwahl - und dieser Trend bietet Chancen für die regionale Entwicklung. Schließlich können starke Hochschulen abseits der Großstädte Wachstumsimpulse geben und damit gleichsam die angespannten Wohnungsmärkte der Großstädte entlasten.
C43|200 years diversifying the energy mix? Diversification paths of the energy baskets of European early comers vs. latecomers|The changes in the composition of the energy basket in the long run lead to energy transitions. Primary energy substitution models allow addressing these phenomena. However, the diversification paths of the energy mix of different countries in a long term compared perspective have not been studied yet. This paper proposes an indicator, based on the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, the Energy Mix Concentration Index (EMCI), to quantify the degree of diversification of the primary energy basket of eight European countries over the last two centuries. The results reveal that early comers, which are large energy consumers, required a huge concentration of their energy basket in the 19th century; however, the observed countries had converged to similar levels of diversification of their energy mixes from the second half of the 20th century, and more crucially after the oil crises. For some countries, today’s degree of diversification is the largest in their energy histories, but it is not the case for all of them. Our results suggest that small energy consuming countries would be able to achieve higher diversification, and therefore to do a faster transition to a low carbon economy, than large energy consumers.
C43|The Difference Approach to Productivity Measurement and Exact Indicators|There are many decompositions of productivity growth for a production unit that rely on the ratio approach to index number theory. However, the business and accounting literatures tend to favour using differences rather than ratios. In this paper, three analogous decompositions for productivity growth in a difference approach to index number theory are obtained. The first approach uses the production unitâ€™s value added function in order to obtain a suitable decomposition. It relies on various first order approximations to this function, but the decomposition can be given an axiomatic interpretation. The second approach uses the cost constrained value added function and assumes that the reference technology for the production unit can be approximated by the free disposal conical hull of past observations of inputs used and outputs produced by the unit. The final approach uses a particular flexible functional form for the producerâ€™s value added function and provides an exact decomposition of normalized value added.
C43|The Digital Economy, New Products and Consumer Welfare|Benefits of the Digital Economy are evident in everyday life, but there are significant concerns that these benefits may not be appropriately reflected in official statistics. Statistical agencies are typically unable to measure the benefits that result from introduction of such new goods and services. The measurement of the net benefits of new and disappearing products depends on what type of index the statistical agency is using to deflate final demand aggregates. We examine this measurement problem when the agency uses any standard price index formula for its deflation of the value aggregate, such as GDP. An Appendix applies the methodology to the problem of measuring the effects of product substitutions for disappearing items.
C43|Alternative Approaches for Resale Housing Price Indexes|The use of hedonic regression models on the sales of detached housing units is widespread in the real estate literature. However, these models do not address the need to decompose the sale price into structure and land components. In the international System of National Accounts, it is necessary to obtain separate estimates for the price and quantity of housing structures and the land that these structures sit on. The builderâ€™s model accomplishes this decomposition but it has only been applied to Dutch and Japanese data. The paper will apply the builderâ€™s model to data on sales of detached houses in Richmond, British Columbia to test the robustness of the model. The property price indexes generated by the builderâ€™s model are also compared to the corresponding indexes generated by a traditional time product dummy hedonic regression model. The implied structure depreciation rates generated by both models are also compared. We find that if a sufficient number of housing characteristics are included in the hedonic regressions, the two approaches generate similar overall property price indexes and similar geometric depreciation rates. However, the two approaches do not generate similar land and structure subindexes.
C43|Alternative Land Price Indexes for Commercial Properties in Tokyo|The SNA (System of National Accounts) requires separate estimates for the land and structure components of a commercial property. Using transactions data for the sales of office buildings in Tokyo, a hedonic regression model (the Builder’s Model) was estimated and this model generated an overall property price index as well as subindexes for the land and structure components of the office buildings. The Builder’s Model was also estimated using appraisal data on office building REITs for Tokyo. These hedonic regression models also generate estimates for net depreciation rates which can be compared. Finally, the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism constructs annual official land prices for commercial properties based on appraised values. The paper compares these official land prices with the land prices generated by the hedonic regression models based on transactions data and on REIT data. The results show that the Builder’s Model using transactions data can be used to estimate Tokyo office market indexes with a reasonable level of precision. The results also revealed that commercial property indexes based on appraisal and assessment prices lag behind the indexes based on transaction prices.
C43|Missing Aggregate Dynamics: On the Slow Convergence of Lumpy Adjustment Models|The dynamic response of aggregate variables to shocks is one of the central concerns of applied macroeconomics. The main measurement procedure for these dynamics consists of estimmiating an ARMA or VAR (VARs, for short). In non- or semi-structural approaches, the characterization of dynamics stops there. In other, more structural approaches, researcher try to uncover underlying adjustment cost parameters from the estimated VARs. Yet, in others, such as in RBC models, these estimates are used as the benchmark over which the success of the calibration exercise, and the need for further theorizing, is assessed. The main point of this paper is that when the microeconomic adjustment underlying the corresponding aggregates is lumpy, conventional VARs procedures are often inadequate for all of the above practices. In particular, the researcher will conclude that there is less persistence in the response of aggregate variables to aggregate shocks than there really is. Paradoxically, while idiosyncratic productivity and demand shocks smooth away microeconomic non-convexities and are often used as a justification for approximating aggregate dynamics with linear models, their presence exacerbate the bias. Since in practice idiosyncratic uncertainty is many times larger than aggregate uncertainty, we conclude that the problem of missing aggregate dynamics is prevalent in empirical and quantitative macroeconomic research.
C43|Calidad del empleo y crecimiento económico: El caso de Uruguay|This research aims to contribute to knowledge about the quality of employment in Uruguay. The multi-dimensionality of the problem is addressed by constructing a dependent employment quality index (Bad Employment Index -IME-) using the methodology of Alkire and Foster (2001). The IME summarizes information on quality in four dimensions of the problem: income, social protection, hours worked and productivity and development opportunities. The EMI value for the period 1991Q1 - 2016Q4 was calculated using data from the INE Continuous Household Survey. Its evolution in comparison with GDP shows that it is not enough to register economic growth to improve the quality of occupations. It is only since the last quarter of 2005 that there has been a clear improvement in the quality of salaried employment, coinciding with years of uninterrupted economic growth, but also with greater Government intervention in the rules of the labour market. This relationship is estimated using an ARDL modelling with the cointegration analysis proposed by Pesaran et al. (2001). Based on the results, it is concluded that the evolution of GDP is a significant variable in order to reduce bad jobs, but that the changes since the end of 2005 also had an impact on improving the quality of occupations.
C43|The robustness of mispricing results in experimental asset markets|Many experiments have been conducted on market mispricing, however there is a distinct lack of guidance over how mispricing should be measured. This raises concerns about the sensitivity of mispricing results to variations in the measurement procedure. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of previous results with respect to four variations: the choice of interval length, the use of the bid-ask spread as a price proxy, the choice of aggregation function, and controlling for observable market characteristics. While a majority of previous results are unaffected, roughly 30% do change significance.
C43|Vulnerability Of Wamz Member Countries To External Shocks And Implications On The Convergence Process|The West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) member countries are predominantly low income countries, and exhibit certain characteristics, which make them very susceptible to macroeconomic vulnerability. These characteristics include, among others, heavy dependence on imports of food and fuel products, concentration of exports on few primary commodities, heavy reliance on foreign sources of finance (foreign aid, debt and capital inflows), economic size, peripherality, political crises, corruption and incidence of natural disasters. The vulnerability of these economies to external shocks increases the risks of adverse effects on economic growth and imposes costly setbacks on the performance of other key macroeconomic indicators, invariably slowing the progress on economic convergence and integration among Member States. The economic integration process, thus, requires appropriate understanding of the degree of vulnerability of Member States to various kinds of shocks as well as identification of appropriate measures to mitigate the impact of these shocks on macroeconomic performance. Against this background, this study seeks to measure the degree of vulnerability of WAMZ member countries to external shocks by computing economic vulnerability indices for each Member State and for the zone as a whole, utilizing data spanning over the period 2004 – 2016. The paper employs the Briguglio-type economic vulnerability index (EVI) in which the EVI is composed of three components – trade openness, export concentration and dependence on strategic imports. The paper computes the indices by taking a weighted average of the three components. Three different EVI indicators were computed for each country and the WAMZ, by assigning weights to each of the components in the first two EVI indicators, and generating the component weights for the third indicator utilizing principal component analysis. The EVI3 was chosen as the preferred index in view of the usage of a statistical methodology in generating the component weights. The computed EVI values and the component indices ranged between 0 and 1, with a high score in the index corresponding to a high level of vulnerability and vice versa. Results from the empirical analysis show that the average EVI for the Zone is 0.581, implying that the Zone, as a whole, is vulnerable to external shocks. Specifically, Liberia, Ghana and Guinea were found to be most vulnerable in the Zone, while The Gambia is the least. In addition, the trade openness indicator shows that Liberia is the most open economy while Nigeria is the least. On the other hand, export concentration is highest in Nigeria and lowest in The Gambia, while dependence on strategic imports is highest in The Gambia and lowest in Ghana. Being highly vulnerable to external shocks has profound implications for the attainment of the macroeconomic convergence criteria and sustenance of regional economic integration. It triggers wider fiscal deficits in countries with no adequate fiscal frameworks to control volatility in government revenues, increases in gross public debts arising from the financing of higher budget deficits, lead to lower international reserves emanating from lower foreign exchange inflows, exchange rate instability and higher inflationary pressures. Macroeconomic vulnerability could be mitigated in the WAMZ economies by implementing a number of measures aimed at building economic resilience – enhancing countries’ ability to withstand economic vulnerability emanating from external shocks. The emphasis on resilience is important because of the huge success achieved by the South-East Asian economies in building economic resilience through appropriate economic policies to mitigate macroeconomic vulnerability and achieve high level of economic development. Ensuring macroeconomic stability with a healthy fiscal position, among others, would assist in building resilience against external shocks. In addition, member countries need to make concerted efforts aimed at diversifying their export base; promote savings and create stabilization funds both of which could come handy in periods of commodity price falls. They could also explore using market-based instruments such as forwards, futures and options to manage commodity price risks.
C43|The effect of globalisation on energy footprints: Disentangling the links of global value chains|This paper investigates the impact of global value chains on energy footprints. Energy footprints are consumption-based indicators which record the energy used to produce a country's final demand. In order to disentangle key characteristics of global value chains and their effects on the global energy footprint, we employ structural decomposition analyses (SDA). Furthermore, the analysis combines a retrospective with a prospective SDA approach. After an analysis of the global energy footprint for the period between 1995 and 2009, we discuss three scenarios of international integration and their implications for energy footprints for the period from 2009 to 2030. Our results show that the global energy footprint has increased by 29.4% from 1995 to 2009, and the scenarios indicate that it will increase by another 23.5% until 2030. Economic activity is the most important driver for the increase in energy footprints. Rising final demand alone would have increased the global energy footprint by 47.0% between 1995 and 2009. The composition of countries from where consumption and investment goods come adds another 12.6%. Sectoral energy intensity reductions are the most important decelerator of energy use (−27.8%). There is a substantial contribution of changing global value chains on the rise in the global energy footprint (7.5%): Stronger backward linkages in global value chains increased the global energy footprint by 5.5% between 1995 and 2009. Changes in the regional composition of intermediate inputs raised it by another 1.8%. The shift of the world economy towards East Asia alone would have increased the global energy footprint by 3.0%. The sectoral composition of global value chains, on the other hand, had a negligible effect on energy footprints.
C43|Embedding as a pitfall for survey‐based welfare indicators: evidence from an experiment|Welfare measurement using multiple indicators requires knowledge about how individuals weight different aspects of wellbeing. The better life index provides a way of resolving this individual level weighting issue. It invites people to weight 11 dimensions, embedding measurable indicators. Ideally, the specific embedding of the same indicators should not change their weights in a welfare function. Our experiment shows, however, that varying the embedding structure decisively affects people's weightings, i.e. we observe strong embedding effects. The better life index hence fails to measure citizens’ true preferences. Embedding thus opens a gateway to manipulating survey‐based welfare measures.
C43|Estimation of Technical Change and TFP Growth Based on Observable Technology Shifters|This paper models and estimates total factor productivity (TFP) growth parametrically. The model is a generalization of the traditional production model where technology is represented by a time trend. TFP growth is decomposed into unobservable technical change, scale economies and observable technology shifter index components. The empirical results are based on an unbalanced panel data at the global level for 190 countries observed over the period 1996-2013. A number of exogenous growth factors are used in modeling four technology shifter indices to explore development infrastructure, finances, technology and human development determinants of TFP growth. Our results show that unobservable technical changes remain the most important component of TFP growth. The observable technology indices-based component is lower than the simple unobserved time trend model based one. By comparing the performance of the time trend and technology index models in terms of TFP growth rates, we arrive at the conclusion that the technology index model predicts a more realistic picture of the TFP growth pattern as compared to the traditional time trend model. Our results also indicate that technical change and TFP growth are negative across country groups and years in the technology index model influenced by the global economic crisis.
C43|Age heaping and numeracy: Looking behind the curtain|Age heaping-based numeracy indicators have served as valuable tools to derive basic human capital estimates, especially for periods where other indicators are unavailable. However, the accuracy of individual age statements usually remains unknown, and due to the lack of precise information it can only assumed that excessive occurrence of multiples of five in age distributions reflects inferior numerical skills. We address this lacuna by identifying 162 individuals in two independent data sources, self-reported age statements and independently kept records which are based on family heritage books and church registers. This method allows us to identify individual misreporting and the degree of accuracy of each individual. We find that not everyone who reports a multiple of five reports an incorrect age, nor everyone who reports an age that is not a multiple of five reports an accurate age. In an empirical analysis we show that the commonly used binary numeracy indicator is correlated with the observed degree of accuracy in age statements, and that a more sophisticated occupational background reduces this inaccuracy. Our tentative results suggest that the commonly used binary indicator measuring age heaping is a valuable proxy of the numerical skills and occupational background in a population.
C43|The multifractal character of capacity utilization over the business cycle: An application of Hurst signature analysis|Capacity utilization rates and the index of industrial production are examined for multifractality over the 1972–2012 periods. Generally, all series behave very similarly, even though the index of industrial production is unambiguously non-stationary.
C43|Productivity growth in urban freight transport: An index number approach|Improvement of operational efficiency is a common goal of most governmental freight transport policies. Productivity and efficiency analysis consequently provides a sound knowledge base. This paper illustrates how axiomatic production theory can be applied to model road freight transport, and proposes a logistics efficiency measure as the function representation. Based thereon, a logistics productivity index that decomposes into technical, cargo mix, vehicle capacity, and efficiency changes is established to determine the rate and drivers of growth. Emphasizing urban logistics, the paper discusses the limited access to reliable data at the micro level and illustrates how local or regional freight transport can be evaluated applying pseudo panel techniques to national freight surveys. Correspondingly, the theoretical productivity index is implemented on a pseudo panel covering the 24 largest cities in Norway between 2008 and 2012, when 12 of them entered a collaboration agreement to promote efficient transport. The results indicate a modest 0.6% average productivity growth. Efficiency change is the key driver of growth, countered by technical stagnation and regress. Negative productivity growth is expected if this trend continues. Moreover, the results do not reveal productivity gains from urban agglomeration or membership of the collaboration agreement, suggesting that prevailing transport and land use policies have so far been unable to foster productivity growth in urban freight transport.
C43|The Balassa–Samuelson relationship: services, manufacturing and product quality|The Balassa-Samuelson relationship, i.e. the positive relationship between a country's per capita income and its national price level, represents an apparent violation of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and is not expected to hold for manufactures according to the explanation of this relationship proposed by Balassa and Samuelson. This paper shows that at the level of the products used in constructing national price levels, the relationship is present in both ‘services’ and ‘manufactures’ and the specification of the relationship is different for the two. It further offers a new candidate explanation for the B-S relationship in manufactures, which is based on an appeal to product quality. This explanation yields a second, distinctive, testable prediction: controlling for per capita income, a non-monotonic relationship should exist between a country's income inequality and its national price level. The second prediction is shown to be consistent with empirical evidence. The explanation also implies that mismeasured quality exaggerates the B-S relationship and hence the observed cross-country income differences are likely to be underestimated.
C43|An Evaluation of Cross-Efficiency Methods, Applied to Measuring Warehouse Performance|In this paper method and practice of cross-efficiency calculation is discussed. The main methods proposed in the literature are tested not on a set of artificial data but on a realistic sample of input-output data of European ware- houses. The empirical results show the limited role which increasing automation investment and larger warehouse size have in increasing productive performance. The reason is the existence of decreasing returns to scale in the industry, resulting in sub-optimal scales and inefficiencies, regardless of the operational performance of the facilities. From the methodological perspective, and based on a multidimensional metric which considers the capability of the various methods to rank warehouses, their ease of implementation, and their robustness to sensitivity analyses, we conclude to the superiority of the classic Sexton et al. (1986) method over recently proposed, more sophisticated methods.
C43|Do Performance Appraisals Decrease Employees’ Perception of Their Psychosocial Risks?|This paper uses cross-sectional linked employer-employee data col- lected from the French Working Conditions Survey, to assess the po- tential positive or negative effect of performance appraisal interviews administered by firms on employees’ reported levels of psychosocial risk. A subjective measure of the psychosocial risks is used and in- dicates a perceived level of risk. In order to obtain a more objective evaluation, we compare the employees’ perceived level of psychosocial risk and the level of risk reported by firms. The results show that the reported levels of psychosocial risk decrease when employees receive performance evaluation reviews on a regular basis; reviews whose ef- fects vary depending on the type of psychosocial risk.
C43|Interval Based Composite Indicators| Composite indicators are increasingly important in country comparisons and in policy making. At the same time, the robustness of the results obtained and in particular of the rankings and the conclusions obtained from the analysis it is usually accepted with doubts. In this sense our proposal is to use interval data in order to measure the uncertainty related to the different composite indicators based on the different assumptions used as input. In this sense where composite indicators can be considered as models, for this reason it could be necessary to assess the uncertainties related to the different choices in the construction. The uncertainty can be represented by the interval data. The intervals keep the information related to the initial value of the composite indicator, but at the same time give information on the range of the results.
C43|Measuring Influence in Science: Standing on the Shoulders of Which Giants?|I study the measurement of the influence of scientists based on bibliographic data. I propose a new measure that accounts for indirect influence and allows to compare scientists across different fields of science. By contrast, common measures of influence that “count citations”, such as the h-index, are unable to satisfy either of these two properties. I use the axiomatic method in two opposite ways: to highlight the two limitations of citation- counting schemes and their independence, and to carefully justify the assumptions made in the construction of the proposed measure.
C43|Property Renovations and Their Impact on House Price Index Construction|This paper provides the first wide-scale analysis of property renovation bias in repeat-sales house price indices across a multitude of U.S. geographies. Property improvements frequently lead to positive quality drift. In local markets, omitting information on property improvements can bias index estimates upwards. Bias often varies in a predictable manner and can distort valuations by as much as 15 percent in the central districts of large cities. This systematic variation in bias is partially a function of the disparate concentration of renovation activity with property improvements occurring more frequently in denser areas. The distortionary effect of not accounting for property renovations tends to decline outside of downtown areas and is generally negligible in smaller cities (populations below 500,000).
C43|Exact and superlative measurement of the Luenberger- Hicks-Moorsteen productivity indicator|This paper shows that the Bennet-Bowley proﬁt indicator is an exact and superlative approximation of the additively complete Luenberger Hicks Moorsteen productivity indicator when the input and output directional distance functions can be represented up to the second order by a quadratic functional form. It also establishes the conditions under which the exact and superlative measures of the Luenberger productivity indicator and Luenberger- Hicks-Moorsteen productivity indicator coincide.
C43|Finding the Consumer Center of St. Petersburg?|In the urban economics, the distribution of people and real estate prices depends on the location of the central business district. As distance from the city center increases, both prices and population density diminish, for travel costs increase in terms of time and money. As manufacturing gradually leaves the cities, the importance of consumer amenities as attractors of population to the urban areas increases. The role of the business center is being taken over by the consumer center. This paper identies the location of the consumer center of St. Petersburg - the second largest city in Russia and its former capital. For this purpose using data from open sources on the Internet regarding the location of dierent types of urban amenities, the indices of their spatial density are computed. Using weights based on coefficients of spatial variation and surveys, the individual indices are aggregated to two general centrality indices. Their unique maxima correspond to the city center of St. Petersburg, which is located on Nevsky prospekt, between Fontanka river and Liteinyi prospekt.
C43|Effects of the Entry and Exit of Products on Price Indexes|This study analyzes the effects of product turnover for price measurements. In addition to variety effects, we consider the effects of the price differentials between new and incumbent products. The decomposition of a unit value price index (UVPI) into price change effects, substitution effects, and turnover/new product effects reveals the magnitude and sources of differences between the UVPI and the Cost of Living Indexes with variety effects. Using a large-scale scanner data, we find that the product turnover effects that reflect the price gap between new and old goods are quantitatively important when constructing a general price level index.
C43|Alternative Land Price Indexes for Commercial Properties in Tokyo|The SNA (System of National Accounts) requires separate estimates for the land and structure components of a commercial property. Using transactions data for the sales of office buildings in Tokyo, a hedonic regression model (the Builderâ€™s Model) was estimated and this model generated an overall property price index as well as subindexes for the land and structure components of the office buildings. The Builderâ€™s Model was also estimated using appraisal data on office building REITs for Tokyo. These hedonic regression models also generated estimates for net depreciation rates which can be compared. Finally, the Japanese Government constructs annual official land prices for commercial properties based on appraised values. The paper compares these official land prices with the land prices generated by the hedonic regression models based on transactions data and on REIT data. The results revealed that commercial property indexes based on appraisal and assessment prices lag behind the indexes based on transaction prices.
C43|Can subjective data improve inequality measurement? A multidimensional index of economic inequality|This work addresses the normative and empirical problems when measuring multidimensional inequality. In contrast to previous works, individuals’ perception of inequality is used to estimate a weights for five dimensions based on German microdata. Using the estimated hedonic weights, the results show that annual multidimensional economic inequality is lower than income inequality, but significantly higher than inequality based on equal weights and increases with greater substitution elasticity.
C43|The Demand for Money for EMU: a Flexible Functional Form Approach|Abstract Monetary aggregates have a special role under the “two pillar strategy” of the ECB. Hence, a theoretically consistent measure of monetary aggregates for the European Monetary Union (EMU) is needed. This paper analyzes aggregation over monetary assets for the EMU. We aggregate over the monetary services for the eleven EMU (EMU-11) countries, which include Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Slovakia, and Slovenia. We adopt the Divisia monetary aggregation approach, which is consistent with index number theory and microeconomic aggregation theory. The result is a multilateral Divisia monetary aggregate, in accordance with Barnett (J Econ 136(2):457–482, 2007). The multilateral Divisia monetary aggregate for the EMU-11 is found to be more informative and a better signal of economic trends than the corresponding simple sum aggregate. We then analyze substitutability among monetary assets for the EMU-11 within the framework of a representative consumer’s utility function, using Barnett’s (J Bus Econ Stat 1:7–23, 1983) locally flexible functional form, the minflex Laurent indirect utility function. The analysis of elasticities with respect to the asset’s user-cost prices shows that: (i) transaction balances and deposits with agreed maturity are income elastic and (ii) the monetary assets are not good substitutes for each other within the EMU-11. Simple sum monetary aggregation assumes that component assets are perfect substitutes. Hence simple sum aggregation distorts measurement of the monetary aggregate. The ECB provides Divisia monetary aggregates to the Governing Council at its meetings, but not to the public. Our European Divisia monetary aggregates will be expanded and refined, in collaboration with Wenjuan Chen at the Humboldt University of Berlin, to a complete EMU Divisia monetary aggregates database to be supplied to the public by the Center for Financial Stability in New York City.
C43|User Cost of Credit Card Services under Risk with Intertemporal Nonseparability|This paper derives the user cost of monetary assets and credit card services with interest rate risk under the assumption of intertemporal non-separability. Barnett and Su (2016) derived theory permitting inclusion of credit card transaction services into Divisia monetary aggregates. The risk adjustment in their theory is based on CCAPM under intertemporal separability. The equity premium puzzle focusses on downward bias in the CCAPM risk adjustment to common stock returns. Despite the high risk of credit card interest rates, the risk adjustment under the CCAPM assumption of intertemporal separability might nevertheless be similarly small. While the known downward bias of CCAPM risk adjustments are of little concern with Divisia monetary aggregates containing only low risk monetary assets, that downward bias cannot be ignored, once high risk credit card services are included. We believe that extending to intertemporal non-separability could provide a non-negligible risk adjustment, as has been emphasized by Barnett and Wu (2015). In this paper, we extend the credit-card-augmented Divisia monetary quantity aggregates to the case of risk aversion and intertemporal non-separability in consumption. Our results are for the “representative consumer” aggregated over all consumers. While credit-card interest-rate risk may be low for some consumers, the volatility of credit card interest rates for the representative consumer is high, as reflected by the high volatility of the Federal Reserve’s data on credit card interest rates aggregated over consumers. One method of introducing intertemporal non-separability is to assume habit formation. We explore that possibility. To implement our theory, we introduce a pricing kernel, in accordance with the approach advocated by Barnett and Wu (2015). We assume that the pricing kernel is a linear function of the rate of return on a well-diversified wealth portfolio. We find that the risk adjustment of the credit-card-services user cost to its certainty equivalence level can be measured by its beta. That beta depends upon the covariance between the interest rates on credit card services and on the wealth portfolio of the consumer, in a manner analogous to the standard CAPM adjustment. As a result, credit card services’ risk premia depend on their market portfolio risk exposure, which is measured by the beta of the credit card interest rates. We are currently conducting research on empirical implementation of the theory proposed in this paper.
C43|Financial Firm Production Of Inside Monetary And Credit Card Services: An Aggregation Theoretic Approach1|A monetary-production model of financial firms is employed to investigate supply-side monetary aggregation, augmented to include credit card transaction services. Financial firms are conceived to produce monetary and credit card transaction services as outputs through financial intermediation. While credit cards provide transactions services, credit cards have never been included into measures of the money supply. The reason is accounting conventions, which do not permit adding liabilities to assets. However, index number theory measures service flows and is based on microeconomic aggregation theory, not accounting. Barnett, Chauvet, Leiva-Leon, and Su (2016) have derived and applied the relevant aggregation theory applicable to measuring the demand for the joint services of money and credit cards. But because of the existence of required reserves and differences in taxation on the demand and supply side, there is a regulatory wedge between the demand and supply of monetary services. We derive theory needed to measure the supply of the joint services of credit cards and money, to estimate the output supply function, and to compute value added. The resulting model can be used to investigate the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Earlier results on the monetary policy transmission mechanism based on the correlation between simple sum inside money and final targets are not likely to approximate or even be relevant to results that can be acquired by empirical implementation of this model or its extensions. Our financialfirm value-added measure and its supply function are fundamentally different from prior measures of inside money, shadow banking output, or money supply functions. The data needed for empirical implementation of our theory are available online from the Center for Financial Stability (CFS) in New York City. We show that the now discredited conventional accounting-based measures of privately produced inside money can be replaced by our measures, based on microeconomic aggregation theory, to provide the information originally contemplated in the literature on monetary theory for over a century.
C43|The MNB’s house price index methodology|This study presents the detailed method of the MNB’s house price index and the results of the new price indices. The index family is considered to be a novelty among Hungarian housing market statistics in several regards. Firstly, the national index was derived from a database starting in 1990, and thus the national index is regarded as the longest in comparison to the house price indices available so far. The long time series allows us to observe and compare the real levels of house prices across several cycles. Another important innovation of this index family is its ability to capture house price developments by region and settlement type, which sheds light on the strong regional heterogeneity underlying Hungarian housing market developments.
C43|Income-Factor Polarization: A Methodological Approach|We here propose a novel method for the analysis of the distribution of two sources of income across the population. The polarization curve for each income source is defined and compared to the Zero-polarization Curve. The latter provides a benchmark of zero inequality in income composition. We then illustrate the method via an empirical application to the case of Italy
C43|Challenges in Constructing a Survey-Based Well-Being Index|How should a survey-based measure of well-being be implemented? How could it be constructed in a systematic and politically neutral way? These questions should be approached by economists with the same level of care that has been taken in the theoretical and practical development of GDP. We focus on two essential requirements for implementation: formulating a list of different aspects of well-being that is theoretically valid and can be measured accurately via surveys, and choosing and interpreting the survey response scales. We discuss progress to date on these issues, remaining challenges, and some possible approaches to overcoming them.
C43|The Productivity of Nations|This paper scrutinizes research on the productivity of nations with a particular focus on the preceding 50 years. First, we briefly synopsize classic studies on economic growth and convergence of nations. The main criticism of these studies is that they did not account for potential inefficiency of countries. The production frontier literature attempts to deal with this issue and we give a brief introduction to it with a focus on data envelopment analysis. One central point of this review is the analysis of sources of productivity growth before and after 1990, a period of time, which appears to be a point of a structural change in growth patterns around the world. The second thread of this paper concerns the forces behind the transformation of the worldwide productivity distribution from a uni-modal to a bimodal distribution during the 1990s. Finally, we emphasize caveats and outline possible directions for future research.
C43|Repeat sales index for residential real estate in Krakow|Research background: There are several methods to construct a price index for infrequently traded real estate assets (mainly residential, but also office and land). The main concern to construct a valid and unbiased price index is to address the problem of heterogeneity of real estate, or put differently to control for both observable and unobservable quality attributes. Most frequently used is probably hedonic regression methodology (classic, but recently also spatial and quantile regression). An alternative approach to control for unobservable differences in assets’ quality is provided by repeat sales methodology, where price changes are tracked based on differences in prices of given asset sold twice (or multiple times) within the study period. The later approach is applied in famous S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller house price indices. Purpose of the article: The goal of the paper is to assess the applicability of repeat sales methodology for a major housing market in Poland. Previous studies used hedonic methodology or mix adjustment techniques and applied for major metropolitan areas. Most known example is a set of quarterly house price indices constructed by NBP – especially for primary and secondary market. The repeat sales methodology has not been adopted with significant success to date – mainly because of concern regarding relative infrequency of transactions on housing market in most metropolitan areas (thus potentially small sample of repeated sales). Methodology/methods: The study uses data on repeat sales of residential transactions in Krakow from 2003 to 2015. We apply different specifications of repeat sales index construction and compare respective values to hedonic price index for Krakow estimated by NBP. Findings: Findings suggest that repeat sales house sales indices can be used to track price dynamics for major metropolitan areas in Poland. The study suggests problems that need to be addresses in order to get unbiased results – mainly data collection mechanism and estimation procedure.
C43|Social Convergence in Nordic NUTS-3 Regions|Geographical proximity, common historical roots and collaboration within the Nordic Council make the Nordic countries, often wrongly treated as monoliths. However, in reality, Nordic regions differ in terms of broadly defined social and economic development. Issues concerning the standard of living are one of the priorities of the Helsinki Treaty signed by Nordic countries. The main goal of this paper is to analyze the existence of the social convergence in the Nordic NUTS-3 regions over the 2000-2015 period. The social convergence refers to a reduction in the dispersion of the standard of living across regions. Result of this analysis may be helpful in evaluating the efficiency of the activities under third and fourth Nordic Strategy for Sustainable Development. The spatial taxonomy measure of development proposed by Pietrzak was used as the standard of living approximation. Inclusion of spatial relationships in the construction of taxonomic measure of development is justified as regions are not isolated in space and can be affected by other units. The existence of beta-, sigma- and gamma convergence was tested for global spatial aggregate measure and as well for sub-groups of determinants forming the standard of living. The analysis showed that the regions with the highest standard of living are those situated on the west coast of Norway. Regions with the lowest standard of living were regions located in central Finland. However the most important part of this research was to investigate the existence of beta-, sigma- and gamma- social convergence. The results show that there is no convergence for global standard of living measure. However the convergence occurs in groups of determinants of education and health care.
C43|Communicating the uncertainty of synthetic indicators: a reassessment of the HDI ranking|Composite indicators convert information about different facets of a given phenomenon into a single figure. Unavoidably, the conversion processE involves a high level of arbitrariness, which, in general, makes the results not robust. The approach to composite indicators used in this paper aims at mitigating this problem and makes final users more aware of the unavoidable uncertainty of the results (e.g. rankings) based on a given composite. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Human Development Index.
C43|Netherlands beyond GDP: A Wellbeing Index|Since the modern conceptualization of GDP (Kuznets, 1934), serious concerns have been raised to point out that it cannot properly represent wellbeing of a society. Despite the recent reaffirmations of these concerns (Stiglitz et al., 2009; OECD, 2011), GDP is still the dominant indicator. While dashboard approaches have their merits, we pursue to advance a composite wellbeing index as an alternative to GDP in measuring the progress of society. This approach here is documented for the Netherlands, though it can be applied to any advanced economy. Care has been taken to address methodological problems that arise from the index compilation exercise by using appropriate international goalposts from the Netherlands’ peer countries. To avoid making subjective choices in choosing the relative weights of various indicators we utilize the weights reported by the users of the OECD’s Better Life initiative from the Netherlands. With respect to the results of the indicator, it turns out that the recent financial crisis took a couple of years more to gradually hit the Netherlands from the various wellbeing angles, compared to GDP per capita. At the same time, in terms of our wellbeing measure, the Netherlands lost over a decade, as in 2015 the wellbeing index remains lower than in 2006.
C43|A Decomposition of the Herfindahl Index of Concentration|The Herfindahl index is one of the most known indices used to measure the concentration of a variable distributed over a certain number of units, and tipically to measure the degree of concentration of business in a market. Its worth is the sensitivity both to the dimensional variability of these units and to their numerical consistency. In the this note a decomposition of the H-index into these two terms is offered.
C43|User Cost of Credit Card Services under Risk with Intertemporal Nonseparability|This paper derives the user cost of monetary assets and credit card services with interest rate risk under the assumption of intertemporal non-separability. Barnett and Su (2016) derived theory permitting inclusion of credit card transaction services into Divisia monetary aggregates. The risk adjustment in their theory is based on CCAPM1 under intertemporal separability. The equity premium puzzle focusses on downward bias in the CCAPM risk adjustment to common stock returns. Despite the high risk of credit card interest rates, the risk adjustment under the CCAPM assumption of intertemporal separability might nevertheless be similarly small. While the known downward bias of CCAPM risk adjustments are of little concern with Divisia monetary aggregates containing only low risk monetary assets, that downward bias cannot be ignored, once high risk credit card services are included. We believe that extending to intertemporal non-separability could provide a non-negligible risk adjustment, as has been emphasized by Barnett and Wu (2015)
C43|Almost equi-marginal principle based composite index of globalization: China, India and Pakistan|The present study proposes an alternative method to construct an index of globalization which is based on the principle of almost equi-marginal contributions (AEMC) or Shapley values of the constituent variables to the overall index rather than the correlation coefficients among the constituent variables and the overall index (the KOF index based on the principal component scores). This has been done by minimization of the Euclidean norm of the Shapley values of the constituent variables. As an exercise, secondary time series data (1970-2013) on the measures of globalization in three different dimensions (economic, social and political) of three economies (China, India and Pakistan) have been used. A comparison of the AEMC index with the KOF index reveals that while the former is more inclusive, the latter is more elitist in matters of inclusion of the weakly correlated constituent variables in the overall (composite) index. As a consequence, the AEMC index is more sensitive than the KOF index of globalization. Both indices capture the trends in globalization in the countries under study and are highly correlated between themselves. Thus, AEMC is an alternative or perhaps a better method to construct composite indices.
C43|Globalization under hysteresis: A study of Eastern Bloc Countries, China and India|This study is concerned with a great socio-economic experiment in history that replaced the naturally evolved market economy with the humanly designed command economy to achieve a socialist triumph over capitalism, experienced a setback and ultimately returned to the market economy for managing the material aspects of the society. Efforts to open the subject economies in the aftermath of the said experiment are on the contemporary agenda worldwide. Yet, the past pulls the present causing hysteresis that thwarts the momentum of globalization. Using KOF and AEMC indices of globalization (based on KOF data 1991-2014), the paper concludes that most of the countries to the south of Russian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan) have performed rather poorly in globalization efforts. On the other hand, the countries in the north-western side of the Russian Federation (except Moldova) have on the whole performed better. In comparison, China has performed fairly while India lags behind. In spite of all proclamations, unless the political will to globalization is there, globalization cannot progress much further. However, such a political will has not been strong in India. India has remained protectionist of vested interests of politicians, industrialists, business houses and perhaps the intelligentsia, a coalition of the dominant proprietary classes that benefit from the status quo or stagnancy of the Indian economy and society. Globalization in India is under a strong spell of hysteresis on account of the pre-1991 pseudo-socialistic nostalgia as well as age-old internal contradictions.
C43|Measuring degree of globalization of African Countries on almost equimarginal contribution principle|This paper is an exercise in construction of an alternative globalization index for 43 countries in Africa. It has used a new method for measurement of the degree of globalization (or construction of a globalization index) based on minimization of the Euclidean norm of the Shapley values, the concept borrowed from the cooperative game theory. It assigns weights to constituent variables such that their mean expected marginal contribution to the synthetic index is as equitable as possible. Since this index is based on combinatorial logic, it is also less likely to be affected by outlier data points. Globalization index for 43 African countries (for a time series of 45 years, 1970-2014) has been constructed. The new index has been compared with the KOF index of globalization for the countries under study. As its validation, it has been found that the index has stronger correlation (vis-à-vis the KOF index) with Human Development index, Corruption Perception index, Freedom index and the indicators of abject poverty in the African countries. Viewed as such the new index represents globalization closely in connection with other relevant socio-economic measures than its rival (KOF index of globalization) as well as it is based on more plausible theoretical premises based on marginal contribution rather than correlation.
C43|Trends in globalization of select Asian countries|In this study we have constructed a composite index of globalization of select Asian countries during 1970-2014 by minimizing the Euclidean norm of Shapley values of indicator variables contributing to the overall index. As a consequence, the mean expected marginal contributions of constituent variables to the overall index are approximately equal and thus, the overall composite index represents the constituent variables optimally. We call this index the Almost Equal Marginal Contribution (AEMC) index. We find that AEMC index and the KOF index of globalization are highly correlated (Pearson’s r=0.982). We find that Singapore, Cyprus, Israel, Qatar, Malaysia, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Kuwait, Bahrain and Japan have done very well and scored above 0.7. At the other end, Yemen, Tajikistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Iran, Nepal and Myanmar have scored below 0.5. Trends in globalization are increasing in general, but the rate of globalization, which accelerated after 1991, lost its momentum after 2007. Disparities in globalization, as measured by Gini coefficient over the countries under study, were more or less constant up to 1985 but after that they started declining. We have found that the index of globalization goes well with other socio-economic measures such as Economic Freedom Index, International Innovation Index, Social Progress Index, Human Development Index and Corruption Perception Index, showing high values of Kendall’s Tau and Spearman’s Rho. Its association with Democracy Index is rather weak but positive. It is almost uncorrelated with the Gender Gap Index. We observe, therefore, that globalization index is moving well with the indices of socio-economic condition in the Asian countries.
C43|Inflación Subyacente en la República Dominicana: Medición y Evaluación<BR>[Core Inflation in the Dominican Republic: Measurement and Evaluation]|In this paper we compare the official core inflation measure, which is based on the ad hoc exclusion of specific items from the total CPI, against alternatives available in the literature on measurement of trend inflation. The evaluation is done through different criteria that adequate core inflation must display; i.e.: (1) less volatility relative to total inflation, (2) absence of bias related to total inflation and (3) predictive power on medium run inflation. Our results suggest that the official indicator delivers the desired properties. Moreover, it overcomes most of the alternative measures available in the literature.
C43|An Evaluation of Effective Prosperity Measure: A Case of Wellbeing Index|Prosperity has been considered the most desirable real outcome of all human efforts however usually measured through gross domestic output of the economy that may not capable to comprehend it effectively. This paper evaluates wellbeing measured through some economic, social and institutional aspects considering the dynamic behavior of variables based on Legatum Prosperity Index (LPI), Maslow’s theory of human needs and Minsky financial instability hypothesis. Considering the data within the context of economic quality, business, education, health, financial security and environment, a comparative analysis has been made to judge the level of prosperity engrossed through LPI. Annual data related to Pakistan from 1960 to 20016 has been examined for about hundred variables after reducing them into 21 exogenous and four endogenous variables through index-transformation. Two Stage Least Squares (TSLS) regression technique to solve the simultaneous equations models prove relevant. The major findings reveal that LPI has successfully measure the wellbeing scenario in case of Pakistan, further it ascertains that social and institutional dimensions are vital complement for wellbeing in addition to economic dimension which cannot uniquely be relied upon for sustainable prosperity.
C43|Identification of Clusters - An Actor based Approach|This paper provides two things. First, it gives an overview on the existing top-down methods for the identification of clusters (Section II). Second, it presents a new method that has been recently introduced by Scholl and Brenner (2016) in a basic version. However, the existing version of this approach is limited and does not take full advantage of its potential. The approach is further developed here and its characteristics and the procedure of its use are presented and discussed in detail (Section III).
C43|The Productivity of Nations|This paper scrutinizes research on the productivity of nations with a particular focus on the preceding 50 years. First, we briefly synopsize â€˜classicâ€™ studies on economic growth and convergence of nations. The main criticism of these studies is that they did not account for potential inefficiency of countries. The production frontier literature attempts to deal with this issue and we give a brief introduction to it with a focus on data envelopment analysis. One central point of this review is the analysis of sources of productivity growth before and after 1990, a period of time, which appears to be a point of a structural change in growth patterns around the world. The second thread of this paper concerns the forces behind the transformation of the worldwide productivity distribution from a uni-modal to a bimodal distribution during the 1990s. Finally, we emphasize caveats and outline possible directions for future research.
C43|The Impacts of Financial Development, Urbanization, and Globalization on Income Inequality: A Regression-based Decomposition Approach|This paper aims to study the impacts of financial development, urbanization, and globalization on income inequality in the People’s Republic of China. It applies the regression-based inequality decomposition approach on a panel dataset, which is aggregated from a unique database of financial development so as to quantify the relative contributions of these three factors, along with other variables such as physical capital and human capital, to income inequality. The findings suggest that financial development, urbanization, and globalization exert a positive impact on income. However, the contributions of urbanization, foreign investment, physical capital, and human capital to regional inequality are positive. Moreover, it is found that financial development is crucial for promoting inclusive growth, since it can stimulate economic growth and is found to be an equalizing factor of inequality.
C43|Against All Odds: The Contribution of the Healthcare Sector to Productivity. Evidence from Italy and UK from 2004 to 2011|We assess the productivity growth of the English and Italian healthcare systems over the period from 2004 to 2011. The English (NHS) and the Italian (SSN) healthcare systems share many similar features, facilitating comparison: basic founding principles, financing, organization, management, and size. We measure productivity growth as the rate of change in outputs over the rate of change in inputs. We find that the overall NHS productivity growth index increased by 10% over the whole period, at an average of 1.39% per year, while SSN productivity increased overall by 5%, at an average of 0.73% per year. Differential growth reflects different policy objectives. In England, the NHS focused on increasing activity, reducing waiting times and improving quality. Italy focused more on cost containment and rationalized provision, in the hope that this would reduce unjustified and inappropriate provision of services.
C43|Are Perceptions of Corruption Matching Reality? Theory and Evidence from Microdata|Some criticism has been raised on the actual capability of corruption perception-based indices to gauge the essence of concepts they aim to measure. One can argue that perceptions about corruption are not matching reality and could be the re?ection of distorted truth. Based on this evidence we provide a theoretical ground for the corruption decision-making process (objective corruption) and the corruption perception-making process (subjective corruption) which accounts for the role of media attention. From the theoretical model we are able to derive testable implications for the empirical analysis, i.e. whether socio and cultural norms can explain the gap between the two measures of corruption across Europe. We employ a generalised setting of the structural equation models to build latent indices of objective and subjective corruption from our microdata exploiting the information on various economic, geographic and socio-demographic factors that can a¤ect the perception and the experience of corruption practices. The resulting indices allow us to define country rankings for both types of corruption and draw a geopolitical picture of the phenomenon across Europe. We also show that countries where the quality of media is higher are associated with lower di¤erences between perceived and real corruption.
C43|The Inclusion Of Natural Resource Wealth In The Index Of Economic Well-Being: Results For OECD Countries, 1980-2013|This report presents augmented estimates of the Index of Economic Well-being (IEWB) for 14 OECD countries for the 1980-2013 period
C43|The import price index with trade barriers: theory and evidence|Abstract The standard economic import price index hinges on an assumption of free trade. Applying the index to situations with barriers to trade yields biased results compared to a true import price index. To circumvent this problem, it is common to use average prices, such as unit values, as an aggregator function. However, the use of average prices is not rooted in economic theory. In this paper, I generalise the economic import price index to allow for barriers to trade in the form of quantity constraints. To illustrate the theoretical framework, I use the case of imports of textiles to Norway from 1988 to 1997. I find that a standard economic import price index, such as the Laspeyres index, grossly overstates import costs and that this bias is significantly reduced by using unit values.
C43|A generalization to QUAIDS|Abstract Previous research shows that consumers’ response to price and income changes is heterogeneous. In addition, evidence from national data often does not support the classical assumption of one commodity-one price. This paper introduces a data coherent generalization to the quadratic form of the almost ideal demand system (g-QUAIDS) that incorporates the sources of heterogeneity in the demand function and allows for regional price variation. Aggregation over consumers imposes a linearization to the g-QUAIDS that requires a new set of price indices. The results from an empirical study by using microdata from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey of Iran highlight the impact of aggregation bias in relation to the level of aggregation. An investigation of the predictive power of linear versus nonlinear g-QUAIDS in different aggregation levels provides practical recommendations for consumer demand analysis.
C43|Measuring Multidimensional Inequality in the OECD Member Countries with a Distribution-Sensitive Better Life Index|Abstract The Better Life Index was introduced by the OECD as a tool to chart the multidimensional well-being of its member countries. However, the Better Life Index relies only on aggregate country-level indicators, and hence is insensitive to how multidimensional well-being is distributed within countries. This paper discusses how a distribution-sensitive Better Life Index could be designed. A broad family of distribution-sensitive Better Life Indices is discussed and decomposed in interpretable building blocks. While a rich and comprehensive micro-level data set is necessary to implement the distribution-sensitive Better Life Index, no such data set is currently available for all OECD member countries. The paper constructs therefore a ‘synthetic’ data set that relies on information about macro-level indicators and micro-level data from the Gallup World Poll. The implementation of the distribution-sensitive Better Life Index is illustrated with this synthetic data set. The illustration indicates that, when taking the distribution of well-being into account, Nordic countries are top-ranked whereas Greece, the Russian Federation and Turkey occupy the bottom positions. The results indicate considerable losses due to multidimensional inequality for OECD member countries. In addition, sizeable differences are found in the level and composition of multidimensional inequality.
C43|Exact and inexact decompositions of international price indices|Decompositions of international price indices are usually inexact in the sense that the underlying aggregator formula is not exactly reproduced. In this paper, we compare analytically the exact and inexact decompositions of international price indices, paying particular attention to the bias in aggregate inflation occurring from using the first order Taylor series approximation and not the quadratic approximation lemma to a geometric average of price levels. Our calculations, using the Norwegian clothing industry as an illustration, reveal that the bias in aggregate inflation over the sample period of 1997−2016 is quite substantial and as high as 0.5 percentage points in some years. We therefore conclude that the quadratic approximation lemma should be used in practise to exactly reproduce the underlying aggregator formula.
C43|Decomposing Value Added Growth into Explanatory Factors|A method for decomposing nominal value added growth is presented, which identifies the contributions from efficiency change, growth of primary inputs, changes in output and input prices, technical progress and returns to scale. In order to implement the decomposition, an estimate of the relevant cost constrained value added function for the two periods under consideration is required. This is taken to be the free disposal hull of past observations. Aggregation over sectors is also considered. The methodology is illustrated using U.S. data for two sectors over the years 1960-2014.
C43|Alternative User Costs, Productivity and Inequality in US Business Sectors|Using the new Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts as well as other BEA data, we construct productivity accounts for two key sectors of the US economy: the Corporate Nonfinancial Sector (Sector 1) and the Noncorporate Nonfinancial Sector (Sector 2). Calculating user costs of capital based on, alternatively, ex post and predicted asset price inflation rates, we provide alternative estimates for capital services and Total Factor Productivity growth for the two sectors. Rates of return on assets employed are also reported for both sectors. In addition, we compare rates of return on assets employed and TFP growth rates when the land and inventory components are withdrawn from the asset base. Finally, implications for labour and capital shares from using alternative income concepts are explored.
C43|No Price Like Home: Global House Prices, 1870-2012|How have house prices evolved over the long run? This paper presents annual house prices for 14 advanced economies since 1870. We show that real house prices stayed constant from the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, but rose strongly and with substantial cross-country variation in the second half of the twentieth century. Land prices, not replacement costs, are the key to understanding the trajectory of house prices. Rising land prices explain about 80 percent of the global house price boom that has taken place since World War II. Our findings have implications for the evolution of wealth-to-income ratios, the growth effects of agglomeration, and the price elasticity of housing supply.
C43|Interval Based Composite Indicators|Composite indicators are increasingly important in country comparisons and in policy making. At the same time, the robustness of the results obtained and in particular of the rankings and the conclusions obtained from the analysis it is usually accepted with doubts. In this sense our proposal is to use interval data in order to measure the uncertainty related to the different composite indicators based on the different assumptions used as input. In this sense where composite indicators can be considered as models, for this reason it could be necessary to assess the uncertainties related to the different choices in the construction. The uncertainty can be represented by the interval data. The intervals keep the information related to the initial value of the composite indicator, but at the same time give information on the range of the results.
C43|Measuring Influence in Science: Standing on the Shoulders of Which Giants?|"I study the measurement of the influence of scientists based on bibliographic data. I propose a new measure that accounts for indirect influence and allows to compare scientists across different fields of science. By contrast, common measures of influence that ""count citations"", such as the h-index, are unable to satisfy either of these two properties. I use the axiomatic method in two opposite ways: to highlight the two limitations of citation- counting schemes and their independence, and to carefully justify the assumptions made in the construction of the proposed measure."

C43|DiGiX: The Digitization Index|The Digitization Index (DiGiX) assesses the factors, agentsâ€™ behavior and institutions that enable a country to fully leverage Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for increased competitiveness and well-being. It is a composite index that summarizes relevant indicators on 100 countriesâ€™ digital performance.
C43|A Financial Conditions Index for the CEE economies|Financial Conditions Indexes (FCIs) are analytical tools devised to synthesize the information contained in a set of financial variables in order to identify how financial conditions affect economic activity. In this paper, for each of the three main Central and Eastern EU member states outside the euro area (Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic) an FCI is constructed as an unobserved factor estimated using the EM algorithm. After having assessed their performance in providing information about future economic activity (both in-sample and out-of-sample), these FCIs are used to describe the evolution of financial conditions in the three economies between 2001 and 2016. The overall findings of this study support a narrative whereby all three economies, after their integration into the EU, enjoyed very accommodative financial conditions until 2008; the Czech Republic and Hungary subsequently turned out to have been more exposed than Poland to the spillover effects from both the global financial crisis and euro sovereign debt crisis.
C43|Détecter autrement les tensions sur le marché immobilier résidentiel|Les indicateurs habituellement utilisés pour mesurer l’évolution des prix immobiliers ont pu amener à la conclusion erronée d’une surévaluation persistante des prix. De nouveaux indicateurs, intégrant les changements de l’environnement financier, montrent que les tensions sur les prix immobiliers étaient en réalité largement résorbées en 2016.
C43|Construyendo un índice sintético de inclusión financiera|Este trabajo propone la construcción de un índice sintético de inclusión financiera. La normativa de inclusión financiera introducida en 2014 determinó, entre otras cosas, la obligatoriedad del pago de salarios y pasividades a través de instituciones bancarias o emisores de dinero electrónico. Asimismo, surgieron nuevos prestadores de servicios bancarios a través de la creación de la figura de corresponsalía financiera, lo cual se tradujo en una expansión de la red física a lo largo de todo el país. Con el fin de medir el impacto de estas medidas, se construye un índice sintético de inclusión financiera, utilizando el método de componentes principales para definir los pesos de los indicadores incluidos en el mismo. Para ello, se utilizan datos de la red física y de los usuarios del sistema financiero a nivel nacional y departamental. Contar con un índice de inclusión financiera es relevante no sólo para la comparación de nuestro país con el resto del mundo y para el análisis de la evolución del mismo en el tiempo, sino también para la comparación a nivel departamental.
C43|The Demand for Divisia Money: Theory and Evidence|A money-in-the-utility function model is extended to capture the distinct roles of noninterest-earning currency and interest-earning deposits in providing liquidity services to households. It implies the existence of a stable money demand relationship that links a Divisia monetary aggregate to spending or income as a scale variable and the associated Divisia user-cost dual as an opportunity cost measure. Cointegrating money demand equations of this form appear in quarterly United States data spanning the period from 1967:1 through 2017:2, especially for the Divisia M2 aggregate. The identification of a stable money demand function over a period that includes the financial innovations of the 1980s and continues through the recent financial crisis and Great Recession suggests that a properly measured aggregate quantity of money can play a role in the conduct of monetary policy. That role can be of greater prominence when traditional interest rate policies are constrained by the zero lower bound.
C43|The CBR-LRI Dataset: Methods, Properties & Potential of Leximetric Coding of Labour Laws|Leximetric data coding techniques aim to measure cross-national and inter-temporal variations in the content of legal rules, thereby facilitating statistical analysis of legal systems and their social and economic impacts. In this paper we explain how leximetric methods were used to create the CBR Labour Index (CBR-LRI), an index and related dataset of labour laws from around the world spanning the period from 1970 to 2013. Datasets of this kind must, we suggest, observe certain conventions of transparency and validity if they are to be usable in statistical analysis. The theoretical framework informing the construction of the dataset and the types of questions which it is are designed to answer should be made explicit. Then the choices involved in the selection of indicators, the definition of coding algorithms, and the aggregation and weighting of data to create composite measures, must be spelled out. In addition, primary legal sources should be referenced, and it should be clear how they were used to generate reported values. With these points in mind we provide an overview of the CBR-LRI dataset's main features and structure, discuss issues of weighting, and present some initial findings on what it reveals of global trends in labour regulation.
